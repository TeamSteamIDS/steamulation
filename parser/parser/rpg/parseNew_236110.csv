Early Access Review
								So this is the squeal to the Dungeon Defenders series. let's start with pros and cons and give it an equal side.Pros+ LOOT, this is the life force of the game, there is SO much awesome loot.+ Fun game-play with multiple classes you can build or jump on you hero and smack things with a sword, or other weapons.+ Players can be creative with the classes and builds, so you can play your way.+ Large multi player base, Lot's of people playing and it's easy finding a group of people to play with for anything.+ Don't like Multi Player? With one of the recent patches/changes the game has been re-balanced for single players so you're not punished for wanted to play alone!+ A daily quest system that can hold 3 quests! This mean each day a quest will be given, the game will hold 3 for you so you don't have to play every day.+ Don't like a daily quest because it doesn't fit your play style? Or maybe you just don't wanna do it? Then you can re-roll!+ The monthly quest system introduces major rewards making them feel they are really worth doing.+ With how the new item system works alot of gear now introduces abilities and effects to your towers will gives way for more interesting play, frost towers being able to buff the damage of other towers, or having your harpoons explode on each and every target as they pierce the horde of monsters.+ Many maps and modes to play on, you can hit the hard maps for the godly gear or play the normal maps to relax and just bank up your coins and pets.+ Did I mention pets?!! You can find eggs during matches and then take them back to the tavern to be hatched! Pets can do multiple things for you from giving you a boost in stats, damaging the monsters you fight to having a an ability that assists you or damages enemies and there are lots of abilities.+ NO PAY TO WIN  at all Trendy has made it their goal to do this, all micro-transactions are skins for pets,heros and (planned) Tower skins! So towers will look different and have different animations, oh and bags let's talk about bags.+ Trendy has recently introduced a system where you can now Auto gather to specific bags and auto sort with them to keep your cache of loot neat and tidy! You can also customize your bags icons/names to what you want making organization a breeze.+ It may not seem like it, but the developers read every scrap of feed back people offer for the game, the forums are incredibly active and the developers do listen and will partake in the forums and chats, sometimes you may even run in to a white named person in a game and play with em!+ Every week they have a Developer cast on twitch to show case some of the new features, talk to the players, get feed back and improve the game, they will also answer various questions from chat and forums. The developers are really active in the community. + Vibrant art style full of colors and awesome effects.Cons every game has em.- The loved lobby system is no longer, we can no longer scroll through a list and see a list of players playing what maps and what levels they may be or modes they may be running, you just kinda go in to a tavern and go to the war map and join a game based on map and mode, and if there are others playing it will put you with them, if there isent any then it will create a new game for you.- No offline single player, this will effect some more then others.- The RNG in this game is heavy, some times you just want that one item with those beastly tower stats and all that drops is hero skill gear.-The game is currently in alpha, so bugs and other issues are to be expected as well as changes, this may include wipes or changes to the core of the game, so once you get a feel for the game you can lose everything you thought you knew due to the changes,-The pet skins the only negative thing about this is the fact you have to buy and apply a skin before knowing what rarity the pet will be so its a gamble and not a very good one.-There are some Anti Troll mechanics put in to place for the actual game, but while in the tavern they have almost free reign(can always make a private tavern to bypass this though)-4 classes at this time there are only 4 classes in the game so options can feel limited, however trendy has said they will release more heros(free)- NPC shop keepers kinda have nothing useful for sale, all the good stuff is out there in the monsters gullets! So get out there and get chopping--Pet hatching time is a bit long, as of now it's 8 hours for a single pet to hatch, that's real time, there is talk from the devs that the time may change soon.- Unlike DD1 the mana is sparse so you have to play more carefully so no more maxing out all dem towers and seeing all the pretty stars.- The current lack of content you can play on multiple maps on multiple modes which is really fun, but I just wish there was more raw content, I know they are working on it though.Over All I would recommend this game, please remember this game is in alpha, so if that bothers you then you may wanna wait or go watch some game play on twitch or youtube before you decide, if you're like myself and don't mind a few bumps here and there and get to watch the game grow then jump on it.

Early Access Review
								17.10.15 - I'm recommending it now and will replace the review below once it gets out of early access.--I loved Dungeon Defenders 1, I even loved the nightmare-gear gap that a lot of people struggled with. This is my opinion about DD2 on Day1/2.DD2, out of the box and eventhough it still is in early access, is a heavily gated experience. It forces you through an abyssmal grind while isolating you from the rest of the player base the higher you go. Personal skill isn't rewarded, but how many times you attempted a mission. You can win a campaign map but it doesn't unlock the next one - something I have never seen before - it's behind a ridiculous mechanic where you have to grind previous maps over and over for XP until the next one unlocks even if you wouldn't have any problems winning the next ones. You can't even attempt harder maps or harder difficulties. I know a fair deal of grinding, but I don't understand why a game won't let you progress even if you conquered all the maps you've previously played. The whole war table thing doesn't make any sense and should be abolished because a system where players are put into tiers is dumb.A lot of my fun in DD1 was figuring out placements, but it seems it has been completely thrown out of the window here.If you're too strong, the game just downscales all of your stats/towers and always attempts to put you on the verge of barely winning. It's good if you want that sort of challenge, but the game also forces you through this item progression grind. In DD1 you could perfectly well do maps below Nightmare if you knew how to play. You would also believe that finishing on normal would unlock harder difficulties for the map - it doesn't, you have to accumulate a ton of XP until the game decides you're up for 'hard' mode on specific maps. It doesn't make any sense, considering that the game limits your access of maps depending on your level. Most of the times you will not be able to even replay levels in the next tier. So the progression system actually regresses the options you should have available. WHY?I think this is all an effort to stop people from twinking and powerleveling, because otherwise selling gold or other services isn't going to be profitable in the future if it wasn't obstructed. Which is probably going to be a big deal because even upgrading your gear requires a lot of gold to a point where you waste more gold on a level 1 upgrade than you possibly get from finishing a map. That's completely bonkers. Though there are a few silver linings.The PC version is well done, as opposed to DD1 which struggled with a lot of port problems. Eventhough there are a lot of interface options, it's still lacking a way to disable ally health and enable that tower health is always being shown or at least if it's on low health. I like the concept of the chests at the end and that you don't have to complete all waves to still get a reward. Actually between finishing or failing a map there is very little incentive, aside from the possible higher rarity loot at the end and slightly more xp depending on the wave you were. All that matters in the end is that you've attempted it and you get your fair share of a reward. It turns everyone into a winner, behind a heavily grind/gated based mechanic. I can't recommend this to anyone who loved DD1, as it is right now. Wait for it to come out in 1-2 years and hope that they didn't turn this into a game on-par with a mindless cow clicker and with more substance instead. Also be aware that this game can only be played if you are online, it's basically a mmo.			"

Early Access Review
 Here, I am going to explain the Dungeon Defenders PC lineup to you in TL;DR fashion: DD1 (Dungeon Defenders - that's the first one) Base game is best value for money, boasts great replayability and lots of tower defence & hack 'n slashing fun and great to get your feet wet. DLC rather steep: £5 will get you a single map and a challenge, slightly less may get you a single character, less than that may get you a costume.  DLC price total is triple that of the original game. DLC controversy due to not only being overpriced but creating a divide in playerbase (People with DLC's couldn't play those without DLC's) and a heavy power creep in new gear making the late game shamefully easy for veterans and causing many newer players to hit a wall they could not surpass (say goodbye to winning any online PvP challenges!). Hacking became an issue - as of current has mostly died off though abuse of Steam Workshop has created massive Mana (Money) / EXP / Hacked Gear generation maps, as tempting as it is, don't do it. You'll ruin the game for yourself.Advise people interested in the series to start here - buy full package (That means game + DLC) on Steam Sale, Indie Bundle or otherwise where cheapest. DDE (Dungeon Defenders Eternity - the worst one) A rereleased version of DD1 - purported as the 'definitive' version, which is basically a glorified DD2 beta - testing out features of the new engine for the recent DD2 release, I'm not even going to list the features here - they are so insubstantial to what was lost and you just shouldn't bother even considering buying this one. No Local Multiplayer.  No Steam Workshop. Always (forcibly) online, with god awful connection - just trust me on this one. Ingame store with microtransactions despite already having paid for the bloody thing. This is the MOBILE PHONE version of the game ported to PC.Would not recommend to my worst enemy. DD2 (Dungeon Defenders 2 - What you're actually here for) I was incredibly wary of DD2 upon hearing of its release - having read other reviews I made the decision to take the plunge into buying Early Access, here's what I think, take it as you will: ~ Larger emphasis on combat, for better or worse depending on your own personal tastes: each class has had their number of unique skills increased from DD1 from 2 -> 3, however the total types of towers each has fell from 5 -> 4. + Combat, thankfully, feels better for the most part. + Animations are more lively than the previous game. + Skill spheres are a pretty cool concept. + Microtransactions ingame grant no play bonuses to those that pay for them (ergo: no pay-to-win), and Trendy have made the promise to keep to this. - ...But damn, ingame purchases are expensive: for a single Monk Ninja costume it will cost you 1200 gems - the equivalent of $12. - Characters are normalized across the board: no colour customization at the time of writing and the game has lost the RPG character development in favour of gear being the sole provider of stat boosts, along with Skill Spheres, which, depending on the size can increase stats by variable amounts or completely change the way a facet of your character works (such as a tower's mode of fire) though there aren't many of these at the time of writing either. - Characters feel somewhat imbalanced - Monk and Huntress have great synergy together (for those who have/n't played: Geyser Traps and Electric Aura can stun & damage for days) which writes off the viability of the Squire (my class) and the Apprentice - which is a shame because while tower synergy is really cool, the current designs indicate little synergy outside of the Monk-Huntress combo I mentioned - making them more popular for people who know of it. - Maps can feel claustrophobic compared to the previous game (we're only counting DD1 as a comparative: screw DDE). - It's always online - you can host a Private Game and play by yourself, but good luck: this game was NOT meant for soloing, and is significantly harder to do so alone, considering prior shady practices of Trendy in and outside of DD (look them up, and need I mention DDE again), it's worrying that once this game - as an MMO - gets out of Early Access, they may simply drop it if the money isn't good enough anymore, meaning people who have invested into the game will flat out no longer be able to play it (which is my biggest overall apprehension - but it can't really be avoided). Final Thoughts As surprising as it was, despite my skepticism I still really enjoyed (and am currently enjoying) my time playing DD2, and was impressed for what it offered, being pre-alpha.Do buy if you: Are crazy for another blast of Dungeon Defending goodness. Have tried it elsewhere and like it and can see yourself playing it in future (It's good value for money!). Or alternatively you're one of many Steam-goers who just likes wasting money on games they'll never likely play.Don't buy if you: Have never played DD1: try that first and THEN consider this game. Didn't like DD1 - at the time of writing it still currently stands as the best of the  three  two Dungeon Defenders games. Felt that stat allocation and creation of character builds was vital to your enjoyment of DD1 - as an MMO this game currently just doesn't boast the allowance for such individuality and feels homogenized as a result. Are on the fence on the matter - you can always wait rather than waste your student loan on an eventual F2P MMO. Don't have enough money in your Bank Account/Steam Wallet/Steam Point Card because Steam will refuse to let you purchase a game you can't afford and you'll just look like an idiot.All in all, I actually really enjoyed myself, and got the Collector's Edition on top of that to show my support: don't let me down Trendy.Edit: Steam completely destroyed my formatting for some reason.Most recent Edit: ♥♥♥♥ dis grame "

Early Access Review
								EDIT: Made my points clearer, and fixed some of my horrendous grammar.EDIT 2:I've added some more points.DISCLAIMER:I have some 200~ hours as of the time of writing because I've been mindlessly farming stuff I hope to trade some day, not because there's actually this much content.Please read this, Trendy, for the sake of your game. Trendy saw, read and responded. I'm impressed. I just hope you'll take some of this to heart.They didn't.TL;DR at the bottom.It is a good game, right now a downgrade from DD1 sure, but a good game still.  I'd like nothing more than to change my review to a positive one, but It has some concerning flaws that makes me want to discourage the purchase of any dlc/gems until they are fixed though, especially since Trendy seems more intent on making more skins rather than adding content or fixing bugs. The game is still in alpha with alpha amounts of content, and its making me kinda nervous when Trendy is saying they're planning on releasing the game this year.They are as follows:Loot and loot customization/upgrading is completely shallow compared to DD1. Items have class specific traits though that make 99% of the loot you find without said stats useless, making it harder (read: not in a good way) to progress. In dd1 you could just grab near any piece of decent loot and upgrade the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of it. All gear say for some legendaries are now trash. There's no real achievement to getting legendary pets either, considering a single onslaught run up to 15 gets me on average at least one. Getting good loot used to be such a rush...Upgrading your loot nets you about one items worth of the single stat you want, whereas in DD1, depending on how much mana you had and the upgrade levels, the benefits could be massive. This makes upgrading to get a grand total of 300 tower health split across all your items such a letdown.The game has general lag and disconnecting issues for many players, even while playing singleplayer(!). The game runs over 60 fps, mostly, but never 144 fps, even on my gtx 970 and i7-4770k... And suffers frequent fps drops in certain areas, like the tavern. .  It runs better now. Still suffers a lot in the multiplayer hub area, but its much better.There are few maps, most of which not really that interesting, and no fun challenges like in the previous game (incursion is just more mobs and minibosses, onslaught is near pointless to do for anything other than golden egg farming). This, combined with the loot problems doesn't exactly encourage the progression into the higher nightmares.No trading (yet?) and no playershops. This was a really big part of the previous game for me and many of my friends who enjoyed DD1. Customizing your very own tavern with your items and having your achievements on display was a really neat feature.They keep using the words ""Play [the hero] your way"" in the devstreams, but in reality, there's only the four builds (dps, towerdps, waller and hybrid), and mostly just the same way of beating levels with the same ways of placing turrets.Trendy is adding more heroes as their first priority (according to what I hear on the devstream) and I think it is the wrong way around, they need to add more stuff to do with those heroes rather than the heroes themselves. Otherwise it just feels like doing the same over and over only barely different.The reason I list this bunch of cons and not recommending the game is because I have a blind hope that trendy can fix their game and make it live up to its grand potential. I'll thumb this review up in an instant if Trendy ever decides to fix some of these issues.TL;DR This game is good, it is a dungeon defenders game, but everything it has from DD1, it has less of.

								So the core DD experience is here. If that's all your looking for, than your good. However as someone who paid for the game before it went free to play and ended up buying a bit of the ""premium currency"". I didn't think that much into it because the currency was almost entirely for cosmetic stuff. Fast forward to today. I picked it up again after a lengthy break (almost a year). First thing I noticed was: Damn this game is STILL in early access?!. The second thing was the new characters locked behind a paywall requiring you to invest tens of hours into it just to unlock ONE, or fork over cash for them. I regret every penny I put down on this game. After investing all the money I did and hundreds of hours of play time I still have characters locked behind a paywall. That is unacceptable.			"

								This review is mostly addressed to the players of Dungeon Defenders 1 that have not probably experienced DD2 yet. I will try to save you some frustrationg, disappointment and money in the process. This is a copy/paste from my post at the official forums here: https://dungeondefenders.com/2/topic/131203/ with a few edits so that it makes more sense as a review. Hope it does not get deleted from the forums so you can always refer to it.Note that this is not a negative review because of bugs or early access status etc. This is due to design choices and the direction the game is taking.Dungeon Defenders II or ""Farming players for cash."" or ""How you go from a great game, to a mediocre one in order to increase revenue"". Take your pick.Everything that is wrong with this game is everything that differentiates it from Dungeon Defenders 1.Meaning:a)The Hero Deck. It is awful, restricting, makes it impossible to solo high difficulty if you need to do so, makes you go in and out on multiplayer as people join up who have what you need but..not in their deck. Hey we all left our purge monks out of the deck. The moment you decide to bring your monk, no one has whatever else is missing...b) The match creation/joining system. Old DD1 was just great. The current one is a mess.c) No bank, selling inventory space and generating content that clutters inventory space. Consumables are now in the game, yeah!! NOT.d) Loot went from huge amounts or interesting loot, item sets, etc (DD1) to loot that only allow cookie cutter builds (forget hybrids folks).e) Tedious monthlies. Seriously 50 pet affection levels? 600 waves? Leveling pets you don't need on maps that generate loot that you don't need. Yeah!! You're a casual gamer? Have a job? Family? Tough luck buddy.f) Timers on eggs. What for? Inventory clutter. Buy bags, buy gems.g) Did I mention separate pet inventory? Buy more bags and gems.e) Overpriced skins/models, yeah! 4800 gems to show your support and buy a new character model. Wait, I already showed my support with the collector's edition and the awakened pack. You obviously need even more support. Yet because I missed the ""promotion"" (which also required buying!) I can't be recognized as a DD1 veteran. Shows how much you support me, the player that's been loyal to you and already supported you with lots of money although they smelled the direction this was going for. I didn't want the gems that came with the promotion, I only wanted the title. It's the first game ever that I see requiring a payment for giving you a title recognizing you as a veteran from the previous game (and I collect games for over 25 years--1035 games 872 DLCs owned currently on Steam alone). Every game out there that offers such title, all they require is you owning the previous title (which of course I own, with all available DLCs). And I own 2 of copies with all the DLCs, not one. Because I played it with my other half.f) Overpriced skins for pets that you gamble your money on. Yes, I can't even buy the skin I like and apply it to the pet I farmed for. I have to buy/spend gems to transform eggs to get random quality that may or may not have the elemental damage I want. Ad infinitum.g) Here comes the carnival event. Offering a wheel that drops up to 700ipwr legendaries (at least not like the useless shops that cap at 550) with bad combinations of stats and..inventory clutter. Masks(see head skins) that you don't even get to keep, they're consumable and serve as inventory clutter. Either you use them up immediately/sell them or if you want to save them, buy even more gems/bags. While the good part of the event requires..gems again!h) We now know there will be many more heroes coming up! Heroes that you have to buy space for. And skins for. With.. gems! The perpetual carrot. You wanted a MOBA element to this game exactly for this reason, the community of old DD1 players said no and you backed off, yet you kept the MOBA carrot in the game, new heros every other week, new skins for the new heroes, new things to buy gems for. Ad infinitum. Yet, the existing heroes have useless towers, bad combinations and there are only cookie-cutter builds viable. But sure, lets get more heroes because strategy and tower defense is not the point. The point is having new heroes and new skins every month so we have something to spend gems on.I could go on. And I'm sorry for the sarcastic tone in my post but I feel that this way it gets the message across much better. We played DD1 because it was a fun game of tower defense with FPS elements that required strategy as well. This game is turning into the mindless perpetual money making machine that defines games like League of Legends etc. I have already deeply regretted that I supported this title but obviously the romantic in me, smothered the cynical critic and hoped that it would not go this way after all.I have already paid a lot for DD2, but from now on I will not spend another cent on it UNLESS it changes business model, or at least adds a SINGULAR pay-once-for-everything option and addresses the real issues with the game instead of creating perpetual carrots. Fix all existing heroes so that they all have viable tools with synergies with each other and provide content updates in terms of new maps etc that require strategy instead of things that constantly require gems or indirectly just cause an influx of revenue. EVERYTHING that was fun in DD1 is missing from DD2 or has turned into something that generates revenue.This report/review will go up on steam as well as my negative review, addressed to the players of DD1 that may have not yet experienced this, in order to perhaps save them from the frustration and disappointment that I personally experienced.

Early Access Review
								As of early access. I have to give this one a thumbsdown and here's why.First of all the positive:Graphics - Game looks a lot better than the previous in my opinion. It  doesn't look blocky, It looks smooth. Lighting's quite impressive and it is also colourful which is what I like about the game. Not to mention they actually manage to put a little bit of realness(if that's a word) to it by making trees sway, leaves on trees move and grass and other plantation have animation as well.Items - The item actually looks better in terms of quality. Like my squire for example I have a common, epic and mythical sword. By looking at the three the higher the quality the better than look of the weapon, I mean I played DD1 and a lot of the time, I prefer the looks of my supreme quality items than my ultimate quality ones which doesn't make sense since you want to make the better quality to look more epic, right?Character specs- Ok I like this on my squire since It got specwhere it would make my barricade have a chance to stun enemies after hitting and knocking them back which is good for a defensive structure.Now heres the bad part:Character specs- Even though I said good things about character specs, The fact of the matter is that, there's not many of them and some of them are just outright useless like the ""powerful spears"" on my squire. 18 im at lvl 13 with 18 spec points and If i use it on ""shiny spikes"" which makes my barricades stun, It gets a 47.62% chance to stun while If I use 18 specs points on powerful spears, I would give me 3% chance for my ballistas to do penetration do full dmg which is sooo low considering there's no stats to add when you level up to get more defense speed, these are all items based now. Im guessing to prevent people from using cheat engine like DD1 but that is just bad.Structure's Stats - Ok There's no way to increase your structure's range other than upgrade....Yep..you heard it right. Ok how does this affect the game you might ask? Considering that there's barely any green crystals(currency to build turrets and stuff) you are pretty much stuck with at most time tier 1 or tier 2 upgrade and not to mention that YOU HAVE TO PROTECT them for a round because 100% of time at my level, it gets destroyed because at the first round you get 230 crystals so for example i put in a ballista which cost 50crystals and upgrade it to tier 1 for another 50 crystal and tier 2 to make it decent cost 100 crystals and the best at my level is tier 3 which is 150 crystals. Now as you can see, at 1st round you can only go up to tier 2 and that is only ONE structure while the maps have several of these paths where enemies will spawn! so you are forced to almost not upgrade any of your structures at 1st round because you will NEED barricades to at least slow enemies down and 60% of the time, they get destroyed because of the fact that theres about 4 enemies on my level that would far outrange all my structures including the ballista which makes structures almost useless at my level. Firebomb chucking enemies, Dragon that fire fireballs from its mouth, spear throwers and flying dragons all outrange any structures from any classes that is IF you do not upgrade which is more likely what you are going to do because green crystals are soo limited. What the hell?Sort Button - No sort button considering you can easily get full inventory quite quickly unless of course you got the gold to buy more inventory spaces.Item/Stat Downscale - You get downgraded when you try and do low level maps which is just bad because grinding is much more tedious now considering the game is based on grinding for items and most of the time you get sweet (F word) all. I just don't like the way DD have changed from its previous predecessor. It feels more forced into you like you are forced to grind for level to unlock the next skill or map. The range enemies need nerfing and what the hell is up with the ogre? It can one hit kill my barricades with 8k hp (either this is a bug or intended I do not know). There is not much variety in terms of classes. You still have your base classes with almost the same structures as in DD1. The only good thing is your character's skills, it's more useful now and is actually needed in order to win the game such as the earthquake attk that stuns AoE for squire. However,  I really think they need to improve on this, I know it's only early access but I cannot recommend it at the moment in its current state. Wait for it till it goes free to play.Edit: Edited Structure Stats			"

								Even in pre-alpha, DD2 expands on what made the original Dungeon Defenders great. A better loot system, more customization, and an overall more rewarding feeling that the original, and well beyond what most games offer. If you were a fan of the original DD, this is a must-have.			"

Early Access Review
								tl dr: Not a tower defense game anymore. With the addition of a new enemy Siege Roller that can only be damaged by heroes, not towers and him being present everywhere the only way to win a map is to get 4 dps hero players, while towers are left with a little support role as any hero can hold off lanes on his own. Yes the new enemy is no problem for hero dps, but thats about the problem! this renders defenses pointles thus this game became an ARPG instead of a Tower Defense game.Oh and solo play? forget it, this enemy can come 2-3 lanes at same time, and you alone can only do one. Thus this new addition killed solo play.Oh and in a tower defense game it should matter ur wisdom of how to place towers right? well NO, only matters how much time you spend to farm equip to get the right rolls, oh and there are alot of rolls and RNG on top of RNG on top of RNG. First RNG is how much ipwr this item has, then what stats it has, then the stats range and then the passives and then the passives range! thats 5x chained RNG! This game is not about tower defense, its about farming gear and throwing out 10000 items till you find that one that fits your build. Oh and then next month comes with an update and trashs your build and tells you: farm again for new flavor of the month!There is no real space to place towers any way different then designed. The distance between enemy spawn and cores is the firing distance of towers. You have only this one option to build and no other tactical options. Only thing that matters are stats on items to make your towers stronger.This game has tower defense tag on steam. This is simply wrong, its an action RPG with small tower defense elements.And even as action RPG it fails, all heroes have 4 action skills and 4 towers, while gunwitch has 8 action skills and is supossed to be pure dmg hero. Well what does our lovely rollie do? yeah he simply is immune to all skills! The only way to kill him is hold leftclick down oh what a joy! autoattack! Gunwitch spells that perfectly fine work on all other bosses dont work on this one. And ofc to have the dps of leftclick you need items, see above lol. Example on huntress that has oilflusk and phoenix to set the oil ablaze(basically napalm), a nice combination of 2 skills right? well rollie ignores that completely. Leftclick for the grind!!!			"

								Edited, yet again.I'm not sure where to begin at the moment. Part of me loves this game and wants it to succeed so very much, and part of me is very bitter at the moment.I'll try my best to explain why, and you can make the call based on that, whether or not it's worth your time.Leveling, and getting to max level is not bad at all and in fact if that's all you intend to do, I say play it, you have nothing to lose really and things are quite fun especially if you have multiple friends to play with. The art is well done, the gameplay is quite smooth and it's a fun casual relaxed experience which I think anyone can enjoy really. Here's where it starts to get gritty, and you'll either hate it or love it for the most part. Once you're maxed level, and you want to start to improve your gear, there's really not much left to be desired. You'll play the same maps you were playing, only with higher HP monsters and higher damage. And you'll not see any variation from that at all. Allow me to reiterate:Onslaught, previously Survival in Dungeon Defenders, is ♥♥♥♥. Literally. I'm not going to sugar coat it, it's a big steaming pile of ♥♥♥♥. Literally the only reason people run it, is on a super low difficulty, so they can farm gold. Rewards suck. The time it takes to do sucks. Nothing special about it at all. Don't even waste your time, IMO. Incursion, a slightly different variation from maps, but really nothing different other than throwing mass quantities of mobs at you in each lane. Yeah I guess it's harder but it really doesn't bring anything new to the table. Nothing new, just more mobs, more HP and more damage. Sounds so fun right?Nightmare 1-4 is my gripe with the game, I suppose. In DD1, we had one nightmare mode and that was it. This game tried to change that and it's pretty much fell flat on its face. There is no difference between Nightmare 1-4 outside of damage numbers. So much engaging gameplay. So you farm the same enemies while you're leveling, to continue farming the same enemies through nightmare 1-4 only scaled higher. Absolutely nothing different, you'll run the same maps until your eyes bleed, and then more.Pets are bland. Seriously if you played DD1, you're going to be very disappointed here. Liked that mega chicken and it's badass DPS from DD1? Well sorry to say you're going to laugh when you see the pets here. Overall, this game lacks the fun that Dungeon Defenders 1 had in all aspects. No goofy weapons, no goofy pets, nothing fun at all. Defense speed and range are not a thing here, and I hope you like watching a tower fire slow as hell. Gear is boring in every since of the word, and you'll see what I mean if you play this in comparison to DD1. The same stats, and you'll be looking for 1% upgrades which is laughable to me. Don't even get me started on the ♥♥♥♥ they've pulled with the latest update they had in which they threw a carnival at us when the game has been needing core changes for months, and what do we get along with it? A 40$ costume that's a reskin. Yes, you read that right. A frickin costume that's 40 bucks. I believe in supporting a game if you enjoy it, but they seriously overstepped their bounds on this. Every patch seems to roll out costume after costume and core gameplay changes that need to be made, have yet to make it into the game.Take a look at steamcharts and you can see what I mean. TL;DR: If you enjoy casual relaxed play and just shooting the ♥♥♥♥ with friends and trying out a tower defense game to level to max level and not expect much more than that, check it out. If you want fun, laughs, and was hoping to see a sequal to the dungeon defenders name, and are expecting a hell of a fun time, avoid it. My two cents, take it or leave it. Obviously I can't cover every major gripe/perk of the game, and if you want a good view on what players think, check the forums out for yourself and you'll get an idea for how negative they are, especially after last patch.Obviously I want better changes to come, and I hope they do, I'd really like to recommend this game, but sadly in its current state, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

								I fell in love with the dungeon defenders franchise with the first game.. It was a wonderful mix of genres and I just loved it. Then in came Eternity, which had some improvements, but also made the game a bit less fun, due to the lack of local co-op (don't know if that was changed at a later date, but when I played, there was none).Then in came Dungeon Defenders II, and I was excited.. Bought it as soon as I had the money for it and I liked it.. I liked it a lot.. Just like many other reviews have mentioned before, you got some premium money (gems) when you bought the game when it first came to early access, and back then there was no talks about any other uses for gems aside from costumes & more inventory space. So I spent my gems and kept playing.. Then there wasn't enough new content to keep me interested, felt like updates came far too seldom.. Then I heard that there'd be a new character coming, the abyss lord.. and I got all excited about the game again.. Started my game up & tried making a new character aaaand then I noticed that the character costs gems.. or ""hero medals"".. That just broke my heart. The game series that I had loved and spent hundreds upon hundreds of hours playing, was just turning in to an early access f2p moneygrabber.. If you liked the original dungeon defenders, go play that instead. Or if you want to try this one, don't waste your money on it. I'm out 20€, and what I got to show for that, is a couple of outfits for my characters.. or I could've gotten a character unlocked, if I'd saved my gems for a year and a half. It's unfortunate, but this game series got ruined with the switch to a free to play model.. sure.. It's free to play, unless you want to get a new character & not have to grind for day after day to get your hero medals to unlock said characters with.			"

								A few months ago I would have recommended this.But then since their new Trials & Chaos update, it's been very downhill.It's essentially still the same game, but instead of tower defense with hero assist, it's the other way around with hero base defense with tower support.Every time the community comes up with an easy way to do something or a powerful item combination, the devs decide to patch it and nerf it until it is virtually useless.There is a lot of unexplained things related to progression that you have to check or ask on forums.  Most of the progression is gated by daily medals now because the gold you get from doing maps is so little, and you are required to spend these medals/gold to find upgrades.Microtransactions are mostly cosmetic, the exception being buying an alternative hero instead of spending a month saving up medals, and bagslots because boy do you need a lot of bagslots.  The new shards system uses up a lot of bagspace, duplicates do not stack, and some of them you may need a lot of.What with shards, there is a lot of grinding, so much so that even if you can complete Chaos4 or Chaos5 difficulties, you'll still be spending most of your time in Chaos1 for very rare & essential shards.  The higher difficulties also do not give proportional rewards, so it is still best to grind Chaos1 for exp, gold, and medals.In it's current state it is worse than it used to be and not even worth trying.  (I don't know how bad it might be to level from 1-50 right now, but I've heard transitioning from 50 to chaos1 is much harder than it should be)			"

								Dungeon Defenders wasn't great, but it had a lot of potential. Unfortunately Trendy seems to have gone backwards rather then forwards... Overpowered heroes sold at ridiculous prices, costumes with less variety at a high price and, in my opinion, poor enemy design that punishes players for not playing a certain way. Hopefully they can turn this around, since it's in ""Alpha"" but I wouldn't hold my breath.			"

								Defense Council Member, meaning I've played the game since like 2012 or 2013 when it was in pre-pre-pre Alpha as a Child's Play perk with no sound or anything, and I believe the first few days all you could just walk around in the tavern. I've played a lot, you can see the hours on record, and that's not counting any of the time before it even hit Steam. Played through every iteration, ""wipe-a-geddon"" last summer and beyond.The game is just not nearly as fun as the first and it is ******* prohibitively expensive. It's kind of hilarious that in DD1 people would complain that a new hero would come out and it was five bucks or a new map and it was two bucks and you could usually get them on sale for half off. Here, get ready to shell out a whopping $15 for a character, which is beyond insane. Look at the value in that vs something like Smite, where $20 or $30 (depending on the sale) would get  you every character and all future characters which is up to somewhere around 80 characters right now. Are you kidding me? And don't say they are optional, the Abyss Lord on his own is better than all 4 starter heroes combined and it's not even close. Everything in this game needs to realistically cost half of what it currently costs. But pricing structure aside, I have no idea why they got rid of the action wheel HUD for trap placement for controllers like the first game. It was basically perfect and now they have some weird layout that has taken almost 4 years to implement. Also, every time there is an update or a patch, the game will wipe out all your custom controls and you have to redo them every time. Neat feature. And finally, the only gear you equip that changes your appearance is your weapon. So if you find some sweet looking armor or helm, nah... it's not going to show on your character. That's kind of unforgivable in 2016. I used to really pull for this game but now I simply just don't care. I'd rather go back to the first one which is something I never, ever thought I'd say.			"

								If you played DD1, you will quickly see that this game is completely gutted. From the leveling to the gear to the social interaction. Leveling:-In DD1, leveling always was fun, at any time, you could pick which map you felt you were strong enough for, and you     were rewarded for completing more challenging maps. -In DD2, it doesn't matter which map you choose, it is much faster to just play the quickest (hard difficulty) map possible, and keep repeating the process. The difficulty is trivial at best, and it just feels like a chore.Loot:-In DD1, loot is very diverse when it comes to the stats on the items that are dropped. There is a continuous search on any map for those rare pieces of gear with the perfect stats for your character. Many times, there are pieces with negative stats, because other stats on the gear are over leveled, and it is up the player to decide if the loss in some stats, is worth the gain in others. This makes you want to see how far you can push yourself in each wave to find the most overleveled piece of gear possible, even if it means sacrificing all of your character health and damage, for a full tower stat item.-In DD2, all loot feels linear. You progress through the maps which have an indicator of what item level of loot will drop. You run the map and get gear that is slightly better than the previous map. You repeat the process, slowly getting better, but never standing out for pushing yourself. You never feel the need to push yourself.Social Interaction/trading:-In DD1, you get your own tavern, where you can place items on the floor of your shop, or in your personal shop. In your personal shop, you set prices on any items you wish to sell for mana(currency). Players tend to place the best items on the floor, in an attempt to barter with players that join their shop. It really makes you feel like you are selling something that has meaning, because items can have very unique stats. This makes the player WANT to go do more tougher and tougher maps to improve their shop. Having a personal tavern is one of the best aspects of the whole game, you can spend hours just setting your shop up the way you want it, and chat with customers who enter.-In DD2, trading is non-existent. You get a personal tavern, but can't sell or trade.Please Trendy, randomize stats on loot based on map difficulty instead of just increasing the gear by a percentage. Give us taverns that we can sell our items that we work for, and let us level up the way we want to, with more experience based on how tough the map and difficulty is.			"

								I bought into this game way back when it was a wee baby DD2. I loved so many aspects about it, and I was hooked on the progression. But this recent trials patch took everything I loved about the game (the progression, the loot drop rate, the ability to specialize in DPS or Tower, laid back and stress free tower defence if you wanted) and crushed it into everything I hate about these kinds of games (super slow progression, scary low drop rates, No ability to specialize in tower or DPS, No more time to relax).As a game design student, I would love to get my hands on a project like this at an internship level! Wish you guys had summer internships. xDTrendy, If you are looking over your reviews and community discussions, please take a good look at what your community has to say, and consider a re-design or a rewind. After reading some recent reviews, it does not seem that I am alone on this one.I will consider rewriting this review upon a redesign or rewind on the design of this game.			"

								I tried. I really, really tried.Ever since I bought this game in 2014, I continued to throw my time and genuine effort at it, hoping to get at the very least a decent sequel to DD1. I even ignored the very clear warning sign that was the release of DD Eternity  (DD1 was abandoned to hackers, then repacked and...sold again under a new name, wham, bam, profit). Today, with the game about ready to leave yet another developement stage, instead of having hope and tons of fun playing the game, I am disgusted and bitterly dissapointed.Let's put the issues I have with DD2 in a neat list, so that I can check myself for bad language after each point I make. Yeah I'm bitter, can you tell? :/ DD2 used to reward maps played with full 4 people team with better loot. Nowadays, it heavily punishes co-op with difficulty spike added with each player (why on earth would devs do that?!), often alienating players not willing to farm for days for equipment for a full set of builders and creating issues amongst people trying to play together yet failing. Oh and public games for higher difficulties? Pretty much dead, thanks to exactly that. Every update leads to massive issues, game-breaking bugs, giant lag spikes and results in the need to implement at least 1 (often more) makeshift patch. Updates are usually 1,7gb, patches are often just as big. While I enjoy a fiber connection, there are still people who sometimes need to wait 2-3 hours to play this game after every mess the devs try to fix. Out of all the games I have, DD2 has the worst update management I have ever seen. Yeah...part of the issue with updates? No real testing. Yep, that's right - DD2 utilises a remote testing group, with disastrous results. Rtg mostly consists of players waaay too devoted to the game to be objective (been there, done that, never again), hence their feedback doesn't represent the majority of playerbase. Has that ever worked well? No. Stupid overlooked things, like boots with a certain passive on a boost aura (that was actually years ago and it didn't teach devs anything), towers doing crazy damage or being suddenly broken, etc., that's the stuff those ""testers"" never find.  FUBAR hitboxes - from never updated tower hitboxes (remember when towers were smaller? no? no worries, their hitboxes remember! /sarcasm), to absurdly big hitboxes of environment (why are some leaves and twigs not simply textures, ffs?), oh and let's not forget the glorious moments where you see mobs pushing themselves over your barricades, where you can literally see how the outlines of crazy hitboxes push against other mobs. Such a fun away to lose a map. And why the hell am I constantly stuck on stuff I can't even bloody see?! Bugs take forever to fix. And by forever I mean years in some cases. YEARS. One of the bugs I reported in 2015 I think? is still there. I ended up thinking of it as my own pet bug and I named it Clarence. Our requests, even the most reasonable ones, also take forever to be even considered. With the light beams from loot littering maps, we whined and begged and asked for help with that for months. Rewards for early stage supporters? Still bugged. Guess we weren't all that ""valued"" after all. Bye bye, Grumpy. All the passives and most special weapons, that had their own history and were tied to the game's storyline and certain maps, were recently nuked and turned to shards. Yeah, makes sense - spend months developing special items and passives, get people to enjoy them and farm them enthusiastically, then...go to nuke city. Perfect logic. Response to tickets? Lol what? If your pet is suddenly gone, forget it. You can fill countless tickers, nobody is getting back to you - unless you're a streamer of a member of the forum suck...err, I mean, forum enthusiasts. If you're a streamer, you will get 2 dracoliches in mail without even asking (yes, that happened). No, I'm not bitter, I wanted to get rid of that perfect, expensive, fully evolved lil Betsy anyway /sarcasm. DD2 is NOT eye friendly. God forbid if you have epilepsy or headaches induced by flashes, because DD2 is a hot mess of special effects that no longer make any ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sense and serve only to make things harder and more tiresome. If you ever have any doubts about the level of professional training and education Trendy has, just turn all the video options in DD2 to default. Enjoy the crazy excess of bloom and your complimentary seizure. DD2 performs really bad in terms of fps, fluidity of gameplay etc. I can easily run much bigger games and never notice any kind of issues, but DD2 tends to get choppy and laggy for no reason. Co-op sucks as well - in other games I can join servers on other continents and barely notice any lag, but with DD2 it's sometimes impossible to play with someone 2 towns away. For years now, we are being forced into a closed loop cycle of new content, patched mistakes, change of direction, new content. You either join the train and win new content with exploits and bugged towers/abilities, or enjoy being left behind (did I mention Trendy is NOT building a healthy and happy playerbase?) Let's leave this list at that, I'm just not sure I can write down the rest without resorting to really foul language and obvious jabs at the devs. I am thoroughly dissapointed with the state this game is in. And it's not just a current thing - it feels like for years with every tiny step forward, we took 2 steps back and were hit in the face, our daughter ran off with the gardener and someone kicked our puppy. Repeatedly.  TL;DR  version: it's terrible. I waited, I helped, and it still didn't matter...DD2 took every good thing from DD1 and....threw it out the window. It also flipped it a bird and went to drink toxic moonshine with terrible devs and fanboys.			"

								Yes yes yes.  The game is great.  Fans of the first game which is also good should enjoy this, and newcomers should as well.  Fans of Dungeon Defenders Eternity, well...we don't talk about that one, but you should enjoy this too.Currently there are 4 characters.  The monk, the squire, the apprentice, and my personal favorite, the huntress.  Each one has 3 different abilities (with the 4th always being a heal) and 4 different kinds of towers/defenses.  Use these to fend off waves of monsters and bosses who follow paths to try and destroy whatever it is you're defending.  As you play, you will get all kinds of loot drops.  Armor pieces, weapons, and eggs which can be hatched into a bunch of different kinds of pets.  There are quite a few maps, as well as higher difficulties and some different modes to play.  As you level up, you can also unlock special slots that you can place various passive buffs in.You can play solo, with 3 randoms, or a private lobby with friends.  You'll all be gathered into a cool little player HUB area before you start, where there are all kinds of things you can do.  I do believe however that you need an internet connection to play, so keep that in mind.  If that bothers you, stick with the first game or wait until this one is released and goes F2P.  Lots of fun, definitely worth checking out.			"

It has some features I like a lot that are not in the previous game, and while it is not as good as DD1 at this current time it is still in early access, and can be very much improved. I follow the game and look forward to when it is complete. Still a ways to go but I have enjoyed my experience so far, however there are some things I do miss that were in DD1, that being said the new things in DD2 are a welcomed changed.Note: I don't play anymore for now at least, so I won't be updating the review.

								First of all:Don't listen to those people who keeps saying: ""This is the worst game ever! It doesn't even look like DD1.""This is Dungeon Defenders. If you want  to play a sequel of games that are all the same, buy Call of Duty. They are right about one thing though, this isn't like DD1 but this is a good thing! This is only and pre-alpha and the work they did with it is just amazing. The graphics are amazing: just look at all the colour in the artstyle. Got to admit, not like the first Dungeon Defender which was, in my opinion, a bit low on graphic quality.Look at all the content!! So much new stuff in there! The new pet system, the costume system and much more. In only one patch, they doubled the fun I had the first time I played Dungeon Defenders 2. After 2 hours of playtime, I already bought the collector's upgrade because Trendy needs support for this amazing game.To those who keeps whining about the bugs and the crashes, etc. Don't cry in the comment section, send a ticket to Trendy! Plus, this is only Pre-Alpha, so there are still a lot of issues to be fixed. You need to remember one thing though. Don't buy this game expecting a fully developped game, it is a work in progress (which progresses like crazy!). I played over 500+ hours of Dungeon Defenders 1 on console and I am really satisfied with the sequel. I digged the first one and liked even more the second one. This is the kind of game that you can't get enough of.The only thing that scares me is the idea to go free to play. What will happen to the community? Will it get ruined? Will it be even better? I don't know.But the thing that I know is that I recomend that game to anybody who digged the first one and is looking for a Dungeon Defenders 2, not a Dungeon Defenders 1 HD.			"

								Pre-Alpha[08.12.2014][26 hours]I played the game for 26 hours now and I can safely say that this game is going in the right direction. It just needs content, changes and some fixes here and there. It runs surprisingly well for a game that’s in pre-alpha. I did glitch through the map once, but I have yet to find another bug.At the moment it has only 10 maps that all feel unique and rich in detail, and difficulty selection is just like it was in the original. Monster variety is given but there are some monsters that have a higher range than your towers, and since you cant increase your tower range with stats anymore its pretty difficult to counter them. Also there are new monsters immune to physical damange, so squires are not OP anymore, as they were in the original. There are only 4 classes at the moment, with 4 towers and 4 spells each, and the max level cap at 25. Sadly, the game is quite difficult if you play it solo and it even gives you a disadvantage in the rarity of dropped loot. If you play with a group it’s much easier overall, and you get better loot for every additional group member (up to 4), so it seems to be clearly intended for co-op play.New:- Combining different elements to get bonus exp/gold is a nice addition to Dungeon Defenders, as it lets you experiment with the different tower elements (water + lightning, knockup + ice, etc).- There are sub-cores that can now be destroyed without ending the entire round. However, if you let them get destroyed, new enemy paths will open up and you’ll have to build additonal defenses.- The cores are now unique level based objects that fit nicely with the surrounding map (doors, portals, generators).- New manually activated traps which do damage in an area, and can only be used again after a cooldown (Gas, Fire, Water).- Upgrading towers now shows visual changes, which is awesome.- There are now 2 kinds of mana, which I think is a good thing. (blue for spells and green for towers).- Items can gain levels by fusing other items into them, which will also reward you with skill points that you can spend on the tower/hero stats on those items.The graphics seem very minimalistic at first look, but upon closer inspection they are quite detailed close up, a clear and improvement over Dungeon Defenders 1. I personally enjoy the changes, but other fans might be put off. The new tavern looks fantastic and I can't wait to find out what they’ll add in later, as the game is currently in early access.All in all it’s a solid tower defense game as it is right now and you can have some fun with your friends for sure, but keep in mind that it will be Free to Play on release,  so you might want to wait untill then.The devs have claimed that the microtransactions will be purely cosmetic (costumes, tower skins, and tavern decorations ), but we’ll see if they can keep that promise. It’s sounds promising but other devs have changed their minds down the road. (Loadout, for example)There you have it, my first impressions. I will update this review if I encounter anything notable and as I play newer Early Access builds.Thanks for reading :)			"

								Ever since the item nerf last year I've had difficulty getting back into this game. I've tried time and time again with friends but I find the experience has become extremely tedious since, once you've capped your level, it's all about grinding for gear and the gear half the time didn't actually do the things it claimed it did, ie. Certain special effects were either bugged, non existent or simply worded incorrectly. Sometimes games have to rework their dynamic to achieve a longer lifespan at the risk of alienating those players who were already acclimitized. That may be me. I can only hope that the changes have in fact led to a more lasting and enjoyable experience for newer players. I find the hunt for better gear to be a flatout excruciating and nauseating experience since it typically involved high risk/difficulty and little or no reward should you fail to reach or beat the final round. If you challenge difficulties that meet your current item level you typically find nothing worth the hour of scrutiny it will take just to examine the whole lot just for a few measly points of extra damage, or crit or whatever. Tedious and distasteful.			"

								New update ruined the game for me. Some might like it, but i just don't like the new system. Range stat was removed (Only found in rare shards and as skill gambles) so aura and trap defenses are weak and useless. the Shard and medalion system means that a couple of stats will always be left out ( for example you can have def pwr, speed, and crit but no def health so your defense might do alot of dmg but gets hit a few times and gets destroyed as if you were a lvl 1 noob (and they will get hit because range isn't a factor you can control anymore). Ascension isn't even an ascension system, it's a grind more because the max hero lvl won't do you any justice. Gold consumption has been increased drastically which is good, but the items and upgrades you spend it on just suck. Defense speed stat seems to just be there to look pretty. Even if they were to fix all that i Just said the game would still suck because the whole rework of the game is just boring. Update: Player choice has been decreased even further by removing the ability of the player choosing which chaos map they could play in. But hey, tower skins that you can purchase are a nice addition though.			"

								I'll keep my review as a no, or a negative review until the problems I have with the game as of the recent patch are dealt with, or fixed in some way.Anywho, I haven't put as much hours as some people, I do admit but that won't really stop me from knowing enough for a decent review. I think well over 100 hours is perfectly fine for a game such as this one. Overall, I'd say my past 2 days roughly have not been very enjoyed. Honestly, this is a loot based game, and all loot based games generally boil down to the same point. Gear. This games content can run you about 200hrs for the highest difficulty. I had no friends to really play with, and I spent quite a bit of time dicking around. I got there about 125-150hrs if that, the other 50ish was spent again. Messing around, or playing with randoms.People can tell you that you have to play 1000hrs for a game such as this one, and its clearly not the case. I've played other games, that are more complex and they do not even take that long to understand, or even get to the highest difficulty. That being said, it takes about 100hrs, if you're actually 100% focused on getting to the highest difficulty, and maybe 10-25 depending on your luck to get the gear you need. This includes leveling every character. It just doesn't take that long as people seem to think it does.This is a pretty sweet game, ESPECIALLY for an ALPHA.. Man, it blew my mind on terms of how well optimized this game is, honestly I think games released sometimes are thrown out in alpha states.. Anyways. on with the Pros.PROS- Decent combat - Lots of variety in ways to play, and extremely customizable builds.- Well balanced between the characters, none of them really feel Overpowered (trust me, thats a +)- Nice pet system (actually pretty customizable too)- A tack to add on to variety in ways to play, You could honestly play strategy or go play it without any strategy in mind.- Music, its actually really nice. (Although, I think the most recent patch got me looking for positives to this game, and I can't believe I didn't notice how amazing the music was at times)- The few cutscenes in games were pretty nice, and slightly entertaining- Developers seem to listen, and quite fast. They seem to take action on it too. - Visually, this game looks pretty nice. I know some people will beg to differ on that, but I think this game has a nice     style, it doesn't look bad at all. I think it fits the game perfectly.- Harbinger boss fight is actually quite good, and not as stale as the other one they released. Giant thumbs up for that one.CONS- Gear/loot system is terrible now for certain builds, that are unattainable and didn't deserve to get nerfed. Everyone is about average like said in the pros.- Builds are tedious, and take more ""perfection"" (enter bad cell quote here) ""This isn't even my perfect form"" Although, this isn't really a con since more gear is ""perfect"".- Although not a bad for some people. This game is definitely a time soak. (Although still a time soak after recent patches, its a lot better than it was, guessing time frame would be 100 hours to get to final NM4 content if you're not as lucky as me)- Does have minor bugs (they get ironed out pretty quickly generally. Its an alpha lol)- Overall currency gaining in game, is horrible right now due to lack of drops, and drops being your money maker, even the trashy drops had use.- Definitely a game to play with friends, its a nice game but like most. It is definitely a lot better with friends.- Feels like uber spheres are generally useless, or not really any better than the original skill/tower if not weaker. Some Ubers are useful, just some are down right awful, and even questionable how it got through, and still hasn't been messed with.Its a good game, I just cannot recommend it at the moment. I honestly love this game, and I enjoyed it 170 hours. The farming isn't that bad anymore, still a bit of a time soak really not that much compared to other mmo-like games. Much better with friends and casual play in my opinion. Sorry for the long review. The game has been getting updates to fix the problems I had, but I feel as the damage is done, hopefully others can enjoy it. Its not a bad game, but I'm not going to reccommend it.			"

								Currently the priority of the developers and a lot of players no longer match.  The developers want to keep your engagement in the game by making it very slow and difficult to progress.  This has been done by:-Gear only starts to regularly drop on the third of five waves of enemies on a map. (Can still drop off Special mobs on the 2nd wave).-Shards needed to aquire power are given only for winning the map (1-3).-The only way to earn rarer shards is to do 1 of 4/5 random maps per Chaos Difficutly.-Each Chaos Difficulty seems to add shards to the possibility pool that you can earn, which mean as you go up in the difficulty the chances of getting rarer shards is more and more unlikely because the pool has increased.-Shards that you earn are completely random meaning you can get shards for characters you don't have/don't use.-Every piece of Gear has a random amount of available upgrades which means that higher quality gear can be worse than lower quality gear.-Gear is upgraded one of two currencies, one you can earn in limited quantities per day/week/maps (Medals) or a currency you earn constantly at a tiny amount that is less cost effective to upgrade with (Gold).-If your Gear stats are not high enough / you haven't leveled enough in the endgame you will not get gear appropriate to the difficulty level you are facing. (Essentialy you have to be so tall to ride but no way to know if your actually tall enough).Developers have stated on stream that they wish the final difficulty (Chaos 5) to be near impossible to beat at the moment... so their priority is to ensure that the majority of players can not reach that difficulty tier in the forseeable future... which leads them to prioritize increasing difficulty further and lowering passive damage sources like towers so that in this 'Tower Defense' game your towers can't effectively contribute to your damage... or they require so many specific pieces of gear/shards that it is unlikely you will have those combinations for months.Tl;DR : Find something more fun to play... there are thousands of other ways to spend your time that will feel less punishing and more fair.

Early Access Review
								Let me preface my review by expressing that even though my review is negative, I  do NOT  think DD2 is explicitly a ""bad"" game, but I  DO  think the game is built on flawed game mechanics (that I will get to later...), that haven't necessarily been touched on by the Developers yet, and that I can only see compounding and negatively affecting the end result of the game in the future. But before stating why I think that is so, I'll try to draft a quick list of  Pros and Cons :Pros:Appearence: I find the game's artstyle and animations very pleasing aesthetically-speaking. The cartoony feel of the land of Etheria and the heroes themselves works very well to convey a story-book type atmosphere. There isn't a lot of compelling storywork behind the heroes or campaign, but it's meant to be a Tower-Defense title with minor RPG-elements, and so I don't necessarily see that as a conPerformance: Optimizing game performance via the in-game preference menu works well. There aren't a ton of options available, but my 5yo, overheating-prone, piece-of-crap laptop can still manage 30+ FrPS with the settings turned down. The game itself isn't graphically-intensive, so this makes sense, but being one of the few games my laptop can still run, I figured I'd list that as a Pro for other players with less-powerful machinesPersonal Loot: Learning from their experiences with DD1, Trendy implemented a ""Personal Loot"" system for DD2, where you are free to pick up whatever items you see on your own screen, so that Players don't have to fight over dropped lootF2P; NOT P2W: Contrary to some of the less-informed reviews for DD2, the game is indeed ""Free-to-Play"" (F2P), but far from being ""Pay-to-Win"" (P2W). Everything except for cosmetics and bags can be bought with DD2's in-game currency (known as ""Defender Medals""). Unlocking new heroes is somewhat expensive at 10K medals, but Daily Quests award anywhere between 250-450 medals, while Weekly Quests award around 600 medals, so it's a fairly reasonable pricing system (unlocking a new hero comes with an extra character slot as well). An additional character slot is 2K medals, which I consider another reasonably priced item (and you'll only really need to buy a lot of extra slots if you want to create multiple builds of the same hero)Cons:Lag: The game does currently seem to suffer from a lot of stutter and general laggy-ness, which seems to be amplified when in a Public group. This can cause the dreaded ""character-teleport"" effect, where your active hero will sometimes pause for a moment, before teleporting many meters ahead -- often launching your hero off of the edge of a map. There has been discussion on the forums regarding this problem, that suggests the issue might be related to having multiple builders on the same map, in group play, whose visible defense ranges overlap (i.e. the large, blue, conical regions displaying the areas that your defenses can reach that appear when you mouse-over a defense). And there are also specific hero abilities whose animations are known to slow the game down (I've heard the ""Gunwitch"" hero referred to as the ""Lagwitch"" in the forums, to give you an idea...)""The Inventory Problem"": While the game is far from being a P2W title, there is currently no way to unlock additional bag storage space without spending ""Gems"" (which are only purchaseable with real money). The game is  technically  playable with the default bags, but unlike in DD1, dropped items aren't automatically sold at the end of a wave, so the current solution is to set certain bags to ""auto-loot"", but you still have to go through and manually sell the items that you don't want later, which wastes a significant amount of time. The only option to prevent clutter is to choose NOT to auto-loot items of quality below a specified rarity-tier, but then you miss out on the gold you'd otherwise receive from selling such items (Note: ""gold"" is hardly used, which is fortunate in this context, but unfortunate overall IMO). With only DD2's default bags, more time needs to be dedicated to manually selling items, as you'll fill up your inventory faster -- to the point where I personally considered the game unplayable until I spent some money on a few extrasInventory Management: Trendy has introduced some pretty basic criteria that you can set for each bag regarding what kinds of items they will ""auto-loot"" from the ground, and also how a bag's stocked items are sorted, but these features could still use some improvements. One of the major downsides is that you can only choose 1 of these criteria at a time.  ""Want to set one of your bags to auto-loot ALL item qualities less than Mythic?""  (Mythic being the 2nd-highest rarity, where anything lower than that is fairly worthless atm...). Well you can't. In order to accomplish that feat, you'd need 4 separate, dedicated bags, set to auto-loot the ""Worn-"", ""Sturdy-"", ""Powerful-"", and ""Epic-"" quality items, individually. Another problem is that you can't use the Sort feature across multiple bags. If it were possible, it would be easy to simply auto-loot everything, and then sort ALL of your bags (top-to-bottom) by ""Item Rarity"" with one button, so that it would be easier to sell off the lower-quality items. Instead, it seems the quickest way to sell items is to sort EACH bag by Item Rarity, manually drag the ""Mythic"" and ""Legendary"" items to an empty bag dedicated to NOT auto-loot (so that you can search through them for potential upgrades later), and then finally, you can hit the ""Sell-All-Items-In-Bag"" button on the low-quality leftover items that you know aren't upgrades. The quickest way to sell trash items is still far from being quickGear Stat System: In DD1, items would drop with the potential to include +/- stat contributions in ALL possible fields: the 4 Hero Stats (Damage, Health, Speed, Cast Rate), the 2 Hero abilities (Ab1 & Ab2), the 4 Defense Stats (Damage, Health, Speed, Range), the 4 resistance types (for armor), and various weapon stats (for weapons) (link to a DD1 item example) [images.akamai.steamusercontent.com]. Conversely, DD2's items have 2 stats that directly affect heroes  (""yes you heard me correctly... a whopping 2 stats!! And 1 of the 2 is always Hero Damage on weapons..."") , while the remaining are item-specific (like weapon speed / firing pattern)  (link to a DD2 item example) [wiki.dungeondefenders2.com]. This means that it is not possible to stack more than two primary stats on any given Hero.  ""Want to spec a Builder hero around defense damage, crit damage, and health?"" You can't. You'll have to forego one. In short, item stats are infinitely less important than item passivesAlas, I have reached the character limit =(Other cons worth mentioning:Mechanic-changing item passives lock character builds behind farmed items rather than Player customization. Rather than simply changing how a defense is used situationally, most passives are just better versions of the original defense. They also complicate hero balanceGear rolls for one specific class making sharing gear impossibleHero balance - some heroes are vastly more useful than othersNo real end-game progression systemOnly maps with guaranteed legendary passives are farmed on end-game. Once you get the guaranteed item with a good passive roll, there is hardly any replay value for that mapNot enough item qualities / raritiesYour character absolutely HAS TO BE lvl 50 in order to contribute anything on end-game. This both rushes the leveling process and makes it less fun. Starting a new character is painfulPets = non-usefulEndless Onslaught is boring "

								I started playing this game roughly 6 to 7 months ago. I have 5 lvl 50 heroes and have played every bit of content their is including the new carnival.I spend more time aggravated at the game than enjoying it. The game is filled with bugs that the devs don't seem to care about fixing. I'm probably alone in this seeing as most people who play games like this love to grind but I don't enjoy playing for 6+ hours and not get a single peice of gear worth a damn.To me, it seems the devs are trying to mask the problems with their game by producing these shiny new peices of content like the carnival in the hopes that you'll forget about them and buy more gems.In the end, it's just another broken early access game that cares more about milking your wallet than producing an enjoyable experience.

								i enjoy playing the game with other people, but there are issues with progression that have left the game difficult for me to play. when you get to endgame its fun but everyone joins random games to get carried through, so everyone is playing the toughest difficulty (NM4) but if you dont have gear for NM4 you are left to either 1) play solo... not at all why i downloaded this game2) scrub some carries off random people i have been stuck on NM3 soloing which is difficult for me because i get bored playing a co op game by myself. and if you bring someone along with you to NM3 after completing a weekly challenge together they will sabatoge your run because its not NM4 or just leave. it takes on average 2 hours to find one person willing to play NM3 in town. posting on forums is not any faster either. some posts looking for players just go unanswered, or have people saying they will carry me (to which i will always refuse). i can not recommend this game until the grind is better. no online co-op game should force you to request a carry or solo past 1/2 of endgame content. i have no problem grinding for the items other people buy with IRL money, but doing it by myself is just not fun.a suggestion i think would make this a lot better is if everyones itempower syncs down to the lowest item powered hero card in any of the 4 heros decks. so if i bring my level 1 apprentice card with no gear to NM4 then everyone in the party will have stats equivalent to their gear if it was level 0 but with the same type of rolls. or if i join a nightmare 4 game with my fresh level 50 to scrub some drops off people not paying attention they will get warned that their item power is about to drop down to 100 (which means they will wipe) if they dont boot me. that would force people to actually progress through the gear grind instead of jumping into NM4 as a fresh 50. the game has literally no middle class the way it is now. but meh il check back in a couple months to see if people are doing NM3			"

								farming shards in the new update is the worst. they take up space in the inverntory, they don't stack, they are hard to organize and there are way too much. it takes forever to get the few usefull ones, so you end up afk-ing chaos 1 which isn't fun at allsince the line about the bugs caused some disagreement from a certain personthe game has a lot of bugs (https://bugs.dungeondefenders2.com/) and it feels like every new patch fixes a few and adds twice the amount of new ones. some bugs like the stuttering hero movement have been there for years and can cause a lose if you fall off the map instead of running to a wall to fix it.the patches got bigger and bigger. they used to be a couple 100mb and now the are 1-2gbthe towers aren't balanced. you either use the few op ones to progress or just outcale the content with lots of stats. some towers like ballista or cannon ball aren't used at all exept from the campaign because they are too bad or just broken. ballist projectiles did okay damage but the tiniest amount of terrain is enought to stop the arrows, so they do 0 damage (like a little twig)towers are bugged. sometimes towers just stop doing damage or they don't do the intended effect like slowing mobs or the damage is just wrong. stuff like that happend all the timeskills and towers aren't explained in sth like a ingame-wiki (at least i didn't see one). you have to figure out what towers do or how they work by yourselfovercomplicated stats compared to dd1 (let's face it most players played dd1 before and they liked it) dd1 had 4 stats for towers and it worked finewipes all the time. adding shards to the game is the latest wipe. they said a couple time no more wipes but removing abilities from the weapons and raising the ipwr is an effective wipe. you can keep your items because of the models but they are pretty much useless right nowa huge amount of useless maps. last time i played, there were a few maps on every chaos-tier (4-5) and every other maps wasn't worth playing. they added incursions and boss maps in the past, but there was no reason to play them anymore (gray loot... yay)and last but not least. why is this game still early-access after 2+ years of development? they've got time to add sh*t like skins and towerskins and make you pay for it but the game isn't even done yet? i also bought some garbage from them to ""support the development of the game"" but when i look at it right now, it was just a huge waste of moneyi'll revisit the game from time to time but right now i can't recommend it to anyone. don't waste your time on dd2			"

								For starters let me say, that i played DD2 a little when the game became avaliable first and i did not like it at all.A lot of time has passed and DD2 is still in developement, but this long process has brought alot of the stuff i love to remember about DD1 back. Like a decently functional upgrading system for your items. A pet system. Alot more synergy between classes and the ability to have 4 heroes in your deck and alot more out of your deck.There's still alot of things wrong with the game.One frustrating bug i encountered was said to have been around for over a year with nothing done to adress it. But these are bugs and even if Trendy works slowly, they will be resolved and i am ALOT more confident in saying today, that i am happy with what Trendy has done with DD2 over the last year. Alot of strong updates to the game and i'm looking forward to seeing the full package.Not recommending because its still in alpha/beta (whatever its called these day) and bugs are a frequent thing. If you love the game you should wait untill its full release, when bugs wont frustrate you into abandoning the game.________________________________________________________________________________OLD REVIEW - OLD REVIEW - OLD REVIEW - OLD REVIEW - OLD REVIEW - OLD REVIEW________________________________________________________________________________Oh how i loved DD1..For me the only similarities, between this game and the original one are the graphical themes, the characters and enemies. The rest was apparently destroyed by Trendy and the Defense Council. Max 3 classes in a 4 class game? No thanks.Leveling down heroes? No thanks. Classes having synergy with only 1 other class, forces players to sit endlessly searching for multiplayer games, with a correct setup, though a system that tries to find sessions for you, but does utterly nothing to look for class balance at all.So try try again, and hope it finds a good session... No thanks Trendy. The lack of choices in this game makes me flee, but above all else, the utterly stupidly abysmal item upgrade system, realy just... No. I'm gonna go cry that this game turned out to be only a but a shadow of its predecessor.			"

								This is another of those times that I'm having so much fun with a game, that I feel the need to sit down and share why it is that I feel this way. I first tested DD2 very, very early on, before it was redone to be much closer to its predecessors, Dungeon Defenders, and Dungeon Defenders Eternity. Team Trendy was still deciding on the direction they wanted to go with the project. At the time it was PvP, and I for one am extremely happy that they went back to the tried and true formula that makes the series great. After trying the game again, post-redesign, I bought into the Defense Council, and it's not often that I feel thrilled to have paid $70 for a game. Here are the things this game does SO right: Dungeon Defenders at its finest:DD2, even still in alpha, trumps the first 2 games already. The tavern is bigger, better, and packed with things to unlock and discover as you play. The game features quests, NPC's, mad amounts of loot and items, a solid campaign, and once beyond that, multiple new game modes to dive into. For an Early Access title, there is a tremendous amount of content here already, with more updates pouring in every 6 weeks or so. I do look forward to plenty more maps coming in in the future, those are pretty limited currently, but not so much so that you get bored. Trendy!Trendy Entertainment, once again, shines in their interactions with the community, in addressing bugs and issues, and in building a great experience. These guys GET IT. I mean REALLY get it, when it comes to how to treat the community, and even in alpha they're right on top of things. You'll see them reply to nearly every thread, and for a game with around 14,000 concurrent users at the time of writing this, that's impressive to say the least. They've gone above and beyond the call, even compensating the community when issues arise which reset quests or cause the players to lose progress. This is an alpha, we will ALL lose progress at times, but these guys still know how frustrating that can be! ImmersionOne of the big surprises for me in DD2 was getting into the campaign and seeing more than just the same crystals to defend. There are interactive traps on the map, and other things to defend besides just the main crystal. In one case, there were even NPC's on the map, cowering up near the throne while you defended them and kept them alive. Tel ya what, having actual characters there made it feel so much more worthwhile! Who wants to defend an empty throne? I love the added depth they've brought to DD2, it brings so much life to the game! F2P done RIGHT!Trendy has done a perfect job with the cash shop. There is absolutely nothing pay to win in DD2, and never will be. It's a promise they made, and have stuck to like glue. You can buy costumes, bags, things like that, but never boosts, or anything that changes the way the game is played. You can't go to the cash shop and make your game any easier, or make it impact the experience. You can sure look great though! The costumes for each character are quite cool, and worth a spend for people looking to support the development of the game. Additionally, even with an already bustling community, I LOVE the option for private taverns/friends only gameplay. Let's face it, most people don't want to play with ""that guy"", who presses ready before the towers are even placed, or who afk's mid battle. There are plenty of players around, and getting into a public tavern/game is definitely easy to do, but if you want to chill alone or with the best friend, being able to do that is a huge plus for me. The game has taken the best of what makes a free to play game fun, and added in the way to play the way you want to play. To sum up: Pro's: -The game is already head and shoulders above previous games in the series-The development team is ROCKING this! -The game has depth, immersion, and a ton of fun, even for an alpha release-It's Free to play done beautifully rightCons:-It is an alpha, so you are going to find the hiccups and bugs that come along with an Early Access game -Maps are still limited this early on, but there are enough to keep you going for hours even now			"

								I do indeed reccomend this game, especially if you were a fan of DD1. The devs did a good job making this game similar enough to the first one, but added enough originality to call it a brand new game. This is NOT just a retexture of the first one, but so much more, there are now sub cores that if destroyed open a new spawn point for enemies, ability spheres, several levels, and much more. Also, unlike most other early-access games the devs are CONSTANTLY updating, the more you sign in and play the game, the more points you earn to vote on what they add into the game. These people truly care for their players.Pro's:- Better looking (Graphics, animations, enemys, tavern)- Tons more levels, items, and pets.- New types of equiptable items including vanity items.- New enemies and boss fights.- Item leveling requires other items to be enchanted into it, instead of just paying with gems.- Seperate tower gems and ability gems- I could freakin' go on forever hahaCon's:- ONLINE ONLY; This is one thing I don't really like, since a lot of times my internet is down or just bugging out, but there is a private lobby mode, and as long as you have a feint connection to the internet, you should be good.- The menu is somwhat complicated and progression is unclear, it's hard to tell what missions you have done on what difficulty, and which one you are supposed to do next.I was a huge fan of DD1 and I am really really exited for the release of DD2 when everything is finished up.

Endgame content is incredibly hard and takes a lot of thought and skill-Mostly friendly community looking to play together, not very toxic-Developers are constantly updating the game and communicting to player to fix issues-NOT AT ALL PAY 2 WIN. e̶v̶e̶r̶y̶t̶h̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶y̶o̶u̶ ̶c̶a̶n̶ ̶b̶u̶y̶ ̶i̶s̶ ̶p̶u̶r̶e̶l̶y̶ ̶c̶o̶s̶m̶e̶t̶i̶c̶. With the release of the Coming all heros update you can also purchase the new class, but earning it ingame doesnt take very long.Cons:-Grindy (just the nature of this game)-Matchmaking issues, sometimes takes a while to join a game-Little depth. You can theory craft in this game and many maps are very difficult but until more heros are released, you're limited on optionsDungeon Defenders II has gotten a huge ammount on unfair, negative reviews that complain about the lack of endgame and content updates. The Developers at DD2 are focusing heavily on gettting the foundations of the game just right so it can support future content, for instance:loot changes, the way gear stats work and difficulty. Thats the reason this game is still in alpha, early access. So people can test the core of DD2 and developers fix any problems to create a refined game. Luckily, big content updates are being released giving DD2 more end game something to work towards.			"

								Before the ""Trials"" update it was a fun Tower Defense and Loot game.After the ""Trials"" update - Nope. This was basically a reset on all your gear and game mechanics.What once was up and down, black and white is now a mish-mash of I don't know what the hell I'm doing anymore.This game maybe fun for players starting out with a keen interest in micro-managing all gear aspects there are.It's just not DD2 i started playing with.I just can't finde myself motivated to start all over again. Maybe after a long break.			"

								Really liking the game so far.Got roughly 100 hours in this game of which most was in the first two weeks.That kinda goes to show that even though the game is a lot of fun in it's current state it is also still lacking. upsides : - the game feels super smooth, other than two crashes I had on day 1 I've had no bad experiences at all concerning the smoothness.- nice map variation, sure there are not an insane amount of maps yet but the ones we have are pretty diverse.- Abilities of classes are a lot more fun to use compared to DunDef1, squire for example has a taunt and an AoE stun that are just a total joy to use.- friend system works nicely and due to the way downscaling works you can always play with your friends even if they are low level. ( though obviously a full geared level 25 that is downscaled will still be a bit stronger than a normal level 1 ).Downsides:- Only 4 classes, this is mainly due to the game being in early access so I will remove this one eventually but for now it feels lacking even though they are working hard on it.- Some towers are completely useless while others are a must.  This is also a temporary thing with balance patches coming in the future but I had to throw it down since at the current state some towers are just vastly superior to others.There might have been some things that I missed out on but all in all I greatly enjoyed playing the game and will check back with every big patch , on that note a big patch is coming again soon so those kinda waiting with buying it should totally get it when the patch comes out.edit:  removed the lack of endless survival mode from downsides since it was recently added.This game is being updated a lot and I still have high hopes for the future.

Early Access Review
								LOVE THIS GAME!!!EDIT: They have now made the game free to play which is insane because this game is worth buy to play without even thinking about it.(I never played Dungeon Defenders 1 before anyone asks)So I got this game today and I played it for 8hours straight and literally could not stop playing it.  As I write this review, it is 2AM in the morning for me because I am so addicted to the game!I enjoy this game so much I sent my wife a key and she is also now addicted to the game, we cannot stop playing it.So let's get into the game itself!Graphics: So the graphics are basically a cartoon easy free mesh style with nothing amazing or special to look at, but it does offer some nice aspect to play with a cartoon/ anime feel which draws you into the game with the cool design, meaning the game feels different and runs smooth because of the unique design! Overal decent to look at for once, very colourful!Audio: The audio is actually suprisingly good, cute cat meows, funny slashing with monsters growing, cool weapon swooshing and bangs with some really really relaxing old style music that draws you in!Gameplay: The gameplay is pretty simple! Seriosuly the character controls and the way you move is so smooth and easy, you master the game in seconds and cannot complain! It is basically a tower defense with a mixed in RPG (XP, stats, money, armour etc) so you earn coins and ranks, with armour offering certain things to make you better, you get pets which are awesome from eggs to hatch into some more support... It feels like Fable meets Diablo too me which is pretty decent to me (Even though I do not like Diablo) but this game really you work at it, play with friends, form defences and fight to survive against monsters.  It also feels a lot like ""Orcs Must Die"" which is another amazing game but this game feels more refined and balanced correctly!Too date I am playing at early access alpha, so I am unsure if there will be any character wipes! Too which I hope there best not because I am spending over 8hours waiting for an egg to hatch for a pet to hopefully gain a legendary or mystic!!!You can also have multiple characters to create the perfect setup on maps, example I have one character which is soul Hero DPS which I use to kill the bots, I swap to my tower dps to build which is tower power so it holds my damage, once built I swap again to another character to buff my towers health and DPS and finally I swap again to another just to deal damage before hitting my turrets... Once the build is setup I change back to my main hero damage, press ready and fight. The hand has a very in depth tactical edge which you can dive into and tank the game alone. This I prefer to play on all fields to hold the best edge at all times. (You cannot swap while a combat phase, only during build phases)The armour you obtain is important to what build you would like to have for that character so it's best to pay attention to what you are doing when trying for the right strategy. A draw back I do not like is the game uses matchmaking, no party create in main menu, you have to physically press play or private and then invite a friend into the game, but even when you select private and have 1 friend, you press play and that session is no longer private! Only the lobby is because you can and most likely will join a random person (happens every time with my wife and I)There are a decent supply of maps but my wife and I went through every one in campaign in 8hours (again to date of this review I am writing) we are. Ow playing free mode which is the same maps.... There are other modes but they are... The same maps! Which believe it or not is getting tiring already even though we cannot stop playing the game! Is it pay to win? Not that I can see! I bought the digital deluxe because I enjoyed the alpha code I was given so much, I was given the special blue coin things and found the only thing I could buy with them WAS access the the vault boxes which gave me clothing items (They do nothing, they are only cosmetic) and clothing store clothing (Which again is cosmetic)I could not find ANYTHING that makes them useless, you cannot speed upgrade or use them (Too date of writing this review) that would make them worth the money or beneficial to me or the game or like any cash cow, because it is not.Would I recommend this game?Yes, in a heart beat.  I love some tower defence games and now this is a game that is XP/ Stats/ Gold/ Ranking/ Community and much more on the side to enjoy!			"

Early Access Review
								Dungeon Defenders IIIts still pre-alpha, but second version.I play this game now about 200 hours and i still like it very much. Guess the reason is that the developers always work on this game to improve it. Dungeon Defenders was released in the year 2011. The second part can not be compared to DD. Duneon Defenders II with new 3D animations is the next step with lot`s of improvements. This game belong to the tower defense game genre. The second pre-alpha update include some new game types ( campaign, free play ) like incursion, onslaught, end game, end game incursion and end game onslought. The difficult level has added ( easy, normal, hard ) four new nightmare levels. The match type Quick match is for multiplayer co-op and Private for invited friends only. New pets are available now in epic, mystic and legendary. For all of us who expect more, we can power up and increase our pet`s affection level in order to evolve. It`s necessary to use Shellium shards for evolve. To receive shellium shard let the founded eggs in your inventory about 48 hours. The first pre-alpha offered medium challenge, now with the second alpha it`s more challenge. From easy to hard difficult it`s possible to play single too, but on nightmare it`s obligated to play in a team. The currency in this game are crystals and wyfern tokens. The crystals are included in pre-alpha and the wyfern tokens can be earned in daily and monthly missions. With the crystals for example we can buy more inventory bags, new character slots or discover accessories. For all Uber Speres and lockbox master key it`s possible to pay with wyfern tokens. The balance of this game is good. From the  fondly social and private tavern we can choose challenge on the war table. Bug report is possible too at the tavern keeper. There are some different Shops in this game. The Gran`Masta ( Skill Sphere ) support improvements for hero skills and defense improvements. The Alchemist can improve your items ( clothes, relics and weapons ), simply put all stuff you don`t need inside around your good item and improve your `better choosen item`. The Hatchery for pets can be found at stable boy. For feed your pets go to the Keeper. The Seamstress offers assessories and on the Relic Hunter shop we can buy relics. All special uber skills can be bought on the adventurer token collection shop. The game has reached alpha version and is free to play until beta.short review: ( positive criterion ( + ) maximum 5 ) - single multiplayer and co-opmusic: +++++ (4/5)graphic: (5/5)gameplay: +++++ (5/5)tutorial: ++++ (3/5)			"

Dungeon Defenders 2 ReviewTL;DR -  Video Review	 The kids have grown up!  In Dungeon Defenders 2 you continue the story as the apprentice, the squire, the huntress, or the monk.  The kids are now what appear to be teenagers with slick overhauled graphics.  And, More characters are coming.  The game is now in early access on Steam and I thought I would provide my initial impressions on this unique game.Just like the original dungeon defenders game, this is also a hybrid tower defense and Action RPG.  You still get all the same fun loot collecting, leveling, and skill points, along with a slightly tweaked gear upgrade system.Before I get too far down the rabbit hole, I was an original Dungeon Defenders 2 Defense Council Member.  This meant I have seen every build prior to the Steam Early Access public release.  This game has progressed immensely from the days of its infancy and with much excitement I am glad to say this is one of the best feeling ""Early Access"" games I have experienced in a long time.  They did right by the community and didn't release a buggy product.  I have yet to see a crash.  The only issues I have noticed are a few camera clipping issues.From the first few moments in the game you can tell this is a smooth product.  If you were a player of the original this will feel liquid, with a slightly faster pacing.  When the game was initially announced it was going to be a MOBA styled tower defense game that was free to play.  A lot of the original fans were obviously upset that it wasn’t a true continuation of the original game; I was not one of them.  I thought the MOBA style might provide something unique to this game but those ideas were tabled, but will it probably make an appearance in the future in some form.The game did keep the Free to Play ideology though and that will likely propel this game to new heights on the PC.  However to actually in the ""Early Access"" you do have to purchase a copy for $25, or catch it on sale.  This does come with perks such as premium currency, a unique title, and some exclusive skins.  This is the standard fare when a game comes to early access.  However, unlike other free to play titles all items sold for cash currency will, I quote ""Never grant gameplay advantage. Ever.""Being part of Early Access does have a unique perk. Influence.  Influence points are earned every day you login which can be spent to vote on what various features or implementations of features in coming builds.Back to the game, each playable class has 4 spells and 4 unique ""towers"".  The game builds upon its original format with each spell and tower unlocking through level progression, along with ability to upgrade the existing towers.  Another area where this game excels over its predecessor is the new Wave Director which will slightly randomize enemy waves.  This could mean different enemy types, where they come from, or various stat buffs.  They are also looking to get in the occasionally, ""caught you with your pants down"" events.This game is currently planning on remaining in Early Access for at least a year.  Hopefully the Trendy can keep up the momentum and keep new exciting features releasing until the game’s final release.It currently doesn't have any form of cash shop available, or pets.  The biggest downfall to the game currently is the tedious matchmaking process, which can have you struggling to get in and out games fast.  Layers and layers of menus slow the process even though finding players to play with is the fastest part.Knowing this game is going free to play but still costs money to play before launch can dissuade a lot of players, but if you enjoyed the first game, tower defense, or casual ARPG games you will easily get your monies worth in entertainment.  This game sets a good example for what Early Access games should be in their launch status.			"

								I was waiting over a month to give developers a chance to somehow fix what they broke, but after last update i have to write this out of extreme frustration. Trials update was impressive, many great ideas, but it was badly executed. As a (solo) player with very limited game time it took me almost a month to get to the point where i was.... well, i haven't reached the point where i was before trials, everything is extremally hard.And after last update (19.5) my defenses were a little stronger, but my heroes got nerfed, and enemies got buffed, i couldn't complete maps on difficulty where i was farming earlier. Bosses are unbeatable, i can bearly finish difficulty i was somehow farmin before 19.5 patchNow i have 3 options: 1) uninstall the game2) find some1 to carry me3) farm for gear that won't be any better than what i have and try higher difficulty and fail, after that, pull the rest of my hairI'm sorry this went in such direction, and by that i mean dd2 became very unfriendly for players like me, with limited game time, who simply want to have some fun solo.After over a month since Trials update launched, i have maybe 5-10% better gear compared to what i had before update, while maxed out gear is 100% better. I'm writing this after 6 hours of failing in difficulty (chaos 4) where i COULD find some upgrades. I'm still hoping developers will realize not only hardcore farmers are playing this game and i can edit this review, but it appears they are happy with how it turned out, plus already maxed players are liking new changes, because with the gear they have, little enemies buff isn't a big deal compared to buff defenses recieved (and it's noticable on high end gear).

								I have 116 hours on this game on another  account Do you like towers? Do you like upgrading your towers into epic epicness?Well, i'm sorry to say but you came to the wrong game. Dungeon Defenders II focus more on the different characters different building types and each has very few upgrades for each of their 4 towers/defenses. Do you like strategically organize the best route in order to get the best gear or the item you really want?Well, i'm sorry to say but you came to the wrong game.Dungeon Defenders II makes you grind and only grind and when your not grinding you're trying your luck in crafting items and when you are not crafting you're trying your luck in different maps trying to get that one item piece that you are missing unsure if it even drops in said map or not.Do you like to get to see all the stuff in more than 100 hours?Well, i'm sorry to say but you came to the wrong game.As I mention earlier the only reason I played it more was because of my friends needed to grind after they got some of the better items ( they are properly around 70 hours ) they quit. Honestly for the last few hours all, they were talking about getting some good gear before quitting which they did.Do you like to have progressive gameplay?Well, i'm sorry to say but you came to the wrong game.As in many other tower defense games, the only real change is the monsters, heroes and towers. In Dungeon Defenders II, however, you have seen all the content of 1 character after 2 matches in about an Lvl 20 map and the monsters get reskinned and recoloured but all in all no bigger change. You get a few starting heroes and can buy all heroes for in-game currency however some of them are again very grinding Want to upgrade your towers and your hero outside of your items to improving your personal playstyle on a hero?Well I'm sorry to say but you came to the wrong game. When leveling up you gain points these points can be spend on improving your hero's personal traits however it's basically rather or not you want to be hero focus or tower focused and once you pick one of them the other is going to be somewhat just a side role dealing damage and sustaining the damage but it will fall of later into the game. Do you like fanservice?Well, i'm sorry to say but you came to the wrong game.This game have none of that			"

This game used to be fun and enjoyable and doable solo, which wasrequired since the community for the seconde one is one of the least helpful of the series. After the Trials update the game is broken for those who put the timeto grind to get viable heroes. Every last apsect of this has been nerfed except the enemies. all the time and hard work put into it was thrown out the door andthe company demands that you start the grind all over again to rebuild. Used to be bleto solo up to nm2, now, lucky to beat a map.			"

Early Access Review
								In short, not yet, maybe never.It's still early access, but after playing about 35 hours, I'm probably not coming back.  They tried to stagger your abilities, you get something new practically every round, but it's still about playing the same maps over and over.  I was level 30+, but I couldn't even play the events.  Pretty lame.I don't even know why they have the tavern.  It's just a glorified menu.  There's no interaction with anyone in there, and when you're in a shared tavern you are likely to get sucked into a game on accident.  That will drop you out of whatever thing you were doing.Balance is a big issue.  Having a ranged weapon that fires two projectiles is dumb, because neither of them go straight.  They also do 1/2 damage each, so you might as well just get a 1 projectile weapon and hit things.  Attack speed is the same, you do the same DPS whether you're firing 1 or 4 projectiles per second.  There are a few interesting weapons, but they become obsolete very quickly.  Higher tier items have a formula.  You get more effects, but the stats are the same.  The effects are totally unbalanced.  Some of them are super powerful while others don't even make sense.  Eventually I just sold all weapons if they didn't drain HP or if they fired multiple projectiles.For a game that is all about items, item management is stupid.  You can get hundreds of drops per round, but there's no way to just sell all the low quality ones or anything.  No favorites.  No filtering.  Just a pain.  I was spending more time selling items than I was playing the game, what with all the waiting for rounds to start and an item overflow that times out too quickly.			"

Early Access Review
								I lost interest with this game after being a beta-tester for the Abyss Lord.I had broken legendary gear, able to solo nightmare 5 as huntress.But, what's fun about solo'ing stuff when there's no real challenge or sense of accomplishment?At times playing with other players actually feels like a crutch, you have to spend time arguing ""Who's the builder, check my stats, I have more damage. But I have more speed, blah, blah.""You also have to share the gems with those that argue, when their towers are just insufficient to do the task needed.At at times there's no need to even attack, just spam abilities now and then.And I get that can be 'fun' for some people, but it got boring for me over time.And I know Trendy has been trying to make Hero combat fun and needed, but it feels very forced. And the fun factor still isn't there.I've kept an eye on the updates ever since stopping to play after Abyss Lord's release, but nothing screamed at me to return to the game. The loot didn't interest me, the costumes didn't interest me, the pets didn't interest me, the new enemies didn't interest me, the events didn't interest me and the new heroes didn't interest me.To be honest the only thing that made me say ""Oh, cool"" was the current Terraria + DD2 collab, but that's not enough for me to want to reinstall the game.I don't regret buying the game when it was P2P and buying some of the skins in the past to support Trendy, they're an amazing company with insane talent.But this has no replay value, unless you like more OP loot to replay the same levels again and again and again...It's like some bad bragfest of who can solo what with the shiniest most expensive costumes.

								Like others who had originally paid for this game, I feel a little slighted by the shift to the Microtransaction model. Being ""rewarded"" with a single title and a small amount on abstracted in-game currency feels like a bit of a betrayal. I realise I backed a game that was not released and that was my fault entirely. Just had slightly higher hopes from TrendyEnt than what was received.PROS:-Its basically just updated Dungeon Defenders-Controls are responsive, if a slight departure from the original game. Vetrans to DD may find it awkward that all towers must be walked to and pointed at to be intereacted with, as opposed to just going into an aerial m view and selecting everything, Placing towers also feels wonky without this.-All the characters from the original have made a return (or are in the works) with more to come. That said, they're a grind to unlock regularly, or you can opt to pay a microtransaction.There suppose to (maybe) still be a PvP MOBA-style game mode with a large selection of classes to chose from. This might be worth checking out eventually.CONS:-I feel the new tarvern is too large, anjd awkwardly spaced. This is entirely personal.-The community seems to be kinda eh. I can remember jumping into the old one with a bunch of randos and co-ordinating builders and repairment and whatnot, all without a hitch. This time around everyone seems to do their own thing-The mana handed out at the begining of a way is untrue to the previous game. Now each player can open exactly one chest. Mana can still be given to other players, but this makes having one builder difficult, especially given the tone of the community.-The inventory and hero deck function essentially makes the Defender's Forge obsolete, yet it still remains, I'm assuming only because a team member spent time modlling, rigging, and animating it.-The bag system is abysmal - if I have 10 bags, why do they all have to be in the same window? Why not allow players to have multiple bag windows so as to not force you to constanly open and close them and drag and drop and scroll etc. -Early Access and still microtransactions. This is another personal point, but I feel that Steam should disallow any game that is tagged as ""Early Access"" from having a microtransaction store.-To me, maps feel awkward and sprawling, even if they do have a good flow, especially the early levels when compared to those of the first game. Perhaps sightlines could be improved-Its hard to convince friends to play this F2P game. This could just be my personal circle of friends, but most are more willing to play DD1 and start everything fresh there than they are to do anything here. -Personally, I prefer the old art direction largly over the one this game presentsOverall, the game isn't terrible, but it has shifted its direction and that's kinda left a bad taste in my mouth. I wouldn't say to strictly avoid this game, but would agree that this is a game you can skip and not have missed anything.			"

								I personally enjoy this game, but I don't recommend it. I place out cons of this game first.1) Bugs, many bugs and developer ignore it / take a long time to fix itSo there's a recent meta (defense combo), but we found out the defense is buggy, which makes it overpowered. I've started this game about 3 months ago, yet to be fixed by now (21 - dec - 2016)2) 1 hit on the core and lostThis won't happen on easy difficulties (Normal, hard, nightmare 1). This often happens on Nightmare 4 games, those monsters deal extremely high damage and your core just have about 2k health. They deal up to 20k damage, even able to kill you in 1 hit.3) Grinding system, sucks.You may ask ""what do you mean by it sucks?"", well, we grind our weapon from different maps that offers us the same weapon (legendary) with different stats, yes, thats it, different stats. But for example I just want (Hero dmg) and (Elemental dmg), sometimes you might replay the game up to 10 times, even up to 30 just for the stats. 4) Unfair leveling (IPWR level)For those who yet to play the game, IPWR means Item power. So when you just started, your average IPWR is around 30 - 150. But you can instantly jump into any public no IPWR requirements, grind loot from there and instantly jump from 200 - 600. This is a huge disavantage for those who started the game a long time ago and grind slowly from Nightmare 1 to Nightmare 4 difficulty.5) Spheres are in a complete messOnce again for those who yet to play the game, spheres is a token (or whatever you call them) that gives you a stats, for example +40 hero damage, +10% experience loot, etc. There's some of them which cost a lot (Indeed alot, because you need to spent 2 weeks or even 1 month to get it), and they're useless, pretty much. Because if the current meta defense doesn't require it, you won't find any help with the sphere if you are not someone that like to research.I've spent around nearly 200 hours, and i've gotten bored and lost interest to the game, this game is base on the angle you play it, if you don't like it, just deal with it, because no one is going to change the meta UNLESS the developer does.

								Waited some time for a few patches before I decided to review.  Has it been 2 years already? Well like most I was highly anticipating this game and was expecting that original DD feeling.  Did I get that?  ...Not exactly, but that is ok given games have to evolve in some way, even though it's not always based on our personal wants & needs.  At first I was excited and then somewhat disappointed and then hardly play anymore, but I come back time to time and it seems DDII can't grab me and keep me prisoner like the original still can.  I still recommend this because it has some changes coming, but replay-wise for now, not so much.  I still love the DD universe and appreciate all its parts, so hoping that flare to keep playing returns.NOTE:  Some of the below are based on friends of friends opinions, but seem to be matching equally to random people I asked the same question.PROS:1. Familiar Music themes2. Familiar map areas revamped3. A little more hero customizations4. Knight actually welds a shield without being an accessory5. Graphics are well done frame to frame animations6. Still maintains that unique hero feeling7. Abilities are a bit different, but still enjoyable8. Handling pets has changed9. New Quest system is realistic & fun10. Month-to-month quests for pets & other rewards is a nice addition11. Still has that Boss Fight fun factor12. Customizing inventory = Names, auto-loot categories, by class, etc and etc13. Easy levelingCONS: 1. Limited inventory compared to the original2. You have to purchase inventory slots (Bags)3. Towers to damage to creature formulas have changed4. Huge limitations on gear upgrades compared to original DD5. Handling pets has changed (placed as PRO and CON because it’s a huge argument to most in my circles and circles of circles)6. Open tavern creates some negative feedback on the community as a whole and reporting system might as well not exist (can be avoided with solo tavern play or private + inviting friends); which leads to a very immature atmosphere7.  Normal Mode difficulty does not feel like Normal mode, so difficulty to difficulty is not a realistic transition from one to the other.Most arguable PROS & CONS:Handling petsGraphicsAbilitiesOpen Tavern with no control or monitoringDifficultyEasy leveling (easy to vets but to new players? ...compared to the original)All-in-all I love that the DD community is still going in some way, but... (PERSONAL OPINIONS SECTION)1. Did it grab me and dedicate me like the original?       No2. Do I feel Trendy was able to make a worthy sequel?    Yes, but wanted that old rewarding feeling3. Am I already finding myself anticipating the next Dungeon Defenders?    Yes4. Will I still play DDII?    Yes, but not daily = a couple times a month5. Am I not playing due to the unregulated chat?    No, but I see how the racist names and 24/7 bashing among people in the community can alienate many new players and some vets alike.6. Will I stream DDII?    No, and it's not because the community is very small, it's just that I only stream/record games I play daily to almost daily = no streaming or YouTubeSo basically I like this game and can recommend it, because I do play it, but for me it lacks that replay value like the original granted.Sirspoony rating:    7.5/10			"

								The packs are riddiculously priced...I loved the original DD and played a ton of it, i love the genre its fun to play. But for the paid content, thats a joke. 27.99 for inventory space ? really ? 32.99 for costumes? Better games have been made for less.Cut the greed and maybe focus on providing a great game. Larian Studios is doing it right, they made a revamped version of their game and offered it for free to the fans that had purchased the original. No micro transactions, no packs that cost as much as a game would.Maybe gamers need to realize this and stop supporting companies like yourself. It's Because of this type of stuff i don't play EA titles and by the looks of things i will not be a supporter of any future content from your developments. 152.70$ in DLC lol you guys are a joke.

								I love this game! I put hundreds of hours into DD1 and while this game isn't quite there yet I'm excited to see where it's going. It has familiar qualities from the original game and there are plenty of hooks for new content. The Dev team has a decent pulse and are fairly involved with the community.If you don't like being a part of games still in development then WAIT!If you are like me and don't mind alphas then jump right in you'll enjoy the ride.

								This is a game with a bit of graphics and well.. did i mention it have stuff that moves on your computer screen?The rest is a bit lacking...Not that fun not that rewarding, It's like that friend you have that always promises that he will change but still makes the same stupid mistakes over and over. He tells you that he values your input and listens to what you say. But then ignores you and runs away yelling lololololol while wearing a crazy cap (CC for short).All you can do is stare at the thing that moves, like your hypnotized by the movement and the stupity. You know you could do something better with your time. Do it, run away from the guy with the CC. It's not worth it, he will never change. It's all empty promises.There comes a point in every gamers life, when you must realize what's in front of you and let go... Just let it go.. Or don't go there in the first place. It's a wery bad and dark place filled of regrets, and restless nights waking up screaming in the middle of the night... Remeber It's all a fantasy, like the fantasy you have about this game ever being any good. It's time to face reality.And if you who tried DD1, DD2 is not the new DD, it's something else but with the same name. The game is just not that interesting or fun. It's like a dull idle game / hold down the button action rpg hybrid. I have som great memories from DD1, played it around 300 hours. Lots of maps that was fun to explore, just running the map and failing a lot of time just to understand the mob movement, was part of the fun. Finding unique loot on the maps, and big maps that you could get lost running around. There was always a sense of progress. A lot of...  let's try that map again and see if i can go one wave furter, maybe if i tweak a little here and a little there. There was a lot more strategy involved in DD1.DD2 is like a no brainer action-rpg with towers. You get a clear line that shows where the mobs will be, and chokepoints pointed out where you should build your defences. A lot more focus around finding the right loot, not upgrading loot as in DD1. Now you can spend days just farming for the perfect loot so you can take on the same map as you where farming the loot on. Even the skins in DD1 was a lot more rewarding since you hade to accomplish something to get the skins, now you just hand over your money and get your skin.Most of the time you fail a map while in a group is because someone from your team fell asleep and forgot to repair the wall. Or was watching youtube on his/her laptop while holding down the fire butting pointing the bow down a lane not caring what happens in the game at all.This game is so bad i regret playing it, I could have done so mutch more with my time like staring at paint while it's drying or contemplating my navel.

								DD2 is a very polished game with some very flawed fundamentals.  It's not really a tower defense game.  More of a baracade game, with shooting.  But not really fun shooting.  Most levels boil down to standing in the same spot the entire level and with four huntresses hosing down their lanes. I want to like this game so bad.  But honestly, it's just boring.  DD1 was much more fun.         Allowing players to hot swap heroes seemed like a good idea.  It's not.  The dps heroes are too powerful.  Here is a short breakdown of what you will experience:Start a level and use your builder to place initial baracades and towers.  This part is fun.  Probably the only fun part.After spending all your money, switch to the huntress and position yourself where you can see the most lanes.Level begins - Hold down the left mouse button.Level ends - Make a sweep of the level, heal some towers, lay some more towers, upgrade others.  (again, somewhat fun)Level begins - hold down the left mouse button.After you've beaten the level, the game has automatically picked up the prodigious amount of loot that dropped.  Now its time to sort through all that crap like its a sale at the thrift store and you're hoping to find at least one thing of value.  Chances are, you wont.  But that wont save you from having to sort through it all for every character you own.  Its as bad as doing your taxes, I kid you not.  I cannot express just how much crap gear you need to sort through.  It's awful.TLDR:  Instead of this, play Orcs must die 2, or even OMD unchained.  Also, Kingdom Rush does TD way better than this.  This game wants you to grind your life away.  Don't do it.			"

								This is a decent game. I've put a lot of hours into this game, meeting people, making friends, and simply socializing as I work my way up to find better equipment. I play this game to simply try out the new classes and try the variety of weapons this game has. I have never spent money on here to get where I am now and I don't find it much of a hassel to grind for what people would normally pay for with real money because you can still get things free. Paying for bag expansions are the only thing you really need to worry about. It's not a requirement, but your items do become full quickly. I was able to obtain 450 free gems in the past due to selling the collectable cards the game provided so I could get another bag expansion but let me tell you where I'm growing extremely frustrated over...The game's bugs/glitches. I cannot tell you how many times I've played this game and found myself randomly crashing or logging me out in the middle of active gameplay. There are bugs in this game that has been around since game release and no one has considered fixing them at all. Examples: Random log out of session, entire lobby randomly gets kicked out, a weird crash that causes you to log out and end up under the map in the lobby, falling into an endless void and everyone is glitched as 999 iPWR (You cannot simply log out to fix this glitch, you have to X out the entire game and reload it for it to fix), inaccurate defense stats when someone else looks at your defenses (Sometimes they even glitch so bad that they show only 1-4 as dmg), match making error, and much more.I've tried everything to reduce the chances of crashing, even lowering my specs to the lowest possible in the options only to still see myself freeze up and crash without warning and I have an actual gaming computer that can handle heavy graphics so I don't see why a game as simple as this would cause me to crash to much. It's extremely frustrating. I would love to recommend this game to people but due to the bugs that have been in this game for so long, have been mentioned to the staff on several occasions and still hasn't been fixed, I cannot recommend this game.I might consider changing my recommendation once these common bugs are fixed.

								(This is my opinion today - The game changes often, and in a month it might be a better game.)I can't help comparing with the original DD and DD eternity, and when doing that DD2 falls very short in almost all aspects (for now). There are some specific improvements to certain mechanics that were annoying in DD, while some of the great stuff from both DD and DD eternity has been lost. Also I am pretty dissapointed in the state of the game, by which I mean that they havent gotten further than this in such a long development period.. was it almost a year since I watched the first alpha gameplay on youtube?.I am not going to write a long list of thumbs up and thumbs down. All I can say is I am BORED.. in all my 800 hours DD and 100+ in DD eternity I was never bored - DD2 just lacks that thing that makes me want to reach for that next level of gear, or farm for better pets or better gear, tweak my stats, explore new builds, try new ways.But lets see how it looks in half a year from now.

								You know those absolutely gargantuan overhauls that completely flip any strategies you had previously, leaving you aleinated in the game you love and enjoy? Like what happened at Robocrap? Yeah, this game had one of those at the time of me writing this.I've been left stunned by all the major changes to medallions/totems, meaning you have to grind even more to get something that's merely a shadow of what you used to have, one of the pains being you need to get totems for individual towers now. Also, some of the tower changes are abysmal, like how the flame burst is now a putridly short-ranged flamethrower that now has goblin bombers laughing hysterically at how useless the tower now is without that small portion of needed range. A lot of my towers even seem to fail at acquiring air targets aswell.Can't even take on lowly hard mobs in most paces, my towers are that inert now.			"

								I put in a little over 200 hours in DD1. Its mind-boggling the scope of how you took a fun game and what should've been an easy sequel, and managed to make something awful. All in the goal of chasing after a market you will never get.  Seriously, it's never going to happen.Sure the graphics are much nicer. Kudos for great artwork trapped in a horrible frame. The gameplay is now awkward. The forced social stuff is exactly that, forced and impersonal; in ways you simply can't seem to understand because there is no point to ""team building"" in DD2. This isn't an MMO, and it's also not LoL, and it never will be. Worse, the myriad of wonky systems feel poorly glued together, yet collectively don't have the depth of the simplier systems of the last game.			"

								So i thought after all this time i should step up and bring you guys my review:Early Access review: As an early access game you can only notice 2 things:- Small balance issues (which are being worked on daily)- Content (specially end game and higher difficulty) These are not game breaking of any kind, it's the less buggish early access i've played (Did i mention that it's still only pre alpha? Man the game totally feels way better).So should you get this game? Well that depends, the game will be F2p, if you have your doubts and only want to test you might wanna wait, now the game is early access, so that means there might be wipes and lack of appropriate content for the time you want to spend in the game, but you can always entertain yourself in many other ways and help the game develop. If you're okay with purchasing a game that's not released yet don't doubt it. If you want to help the game get better, go ahead and don't think twice.FAQ:-Do Developers even care about the feedback? Definitely they do! Many changes have been made for community request, and many were added. There's even an influence system that you can vote with points you gain by being active!-Dev Interaction? Yes there are streams every thursday and friday ; Forum activity by the Devs ; A devlog coming out weekly about what the devs are working on! -Better than DD1? Dungeon Defenders 1 is a full complete game, i believe DD2 has potential to be way way better than DD1, but it's still Pre-Alpha, so it's normal you might not find as interesting.-F2P? Won't that be P2W? Nope the game will have no such a thing as sold advantage, it will depend on costumes and all type of cosmetics and whatelse they can come up with but no sold advantage of any sort =).There's a lot of info i want to give you about the game to help you judge it, but go ahead and watch the streams/videos and decide for yourself, i found myself getting the game a while ago, and i simply love it, love the game love the dev interaction, totally worth it, this game is going to rock for me. There are some changes that must be made but i believe all that will come in time!			"

								The game is very similar to the first one in some points, even the graphics that everyone likes, even if I like the first one better, a matter of personal taste, I recognize the improvements.On the similar aspects, I give a thumbs up. As the first one the gameplay is very cool and the maps are wonderful. The characters and towers are very much alike too.The bad parts are the one that differs from the original DD. As you level up you are given a very limited and poor choices of specs for your skills and, as I have seen, most of the choices are pretty useless. That messes up a bit with your character customization, since you are forec to buff up a single tower with your specs, and once you get 10+ points on that skill its upgrading becomes pretty useless, since you wil get a 0.45% boost on that skill or less.The other aspect is that you can't level up the things you want to play with. You can't level up tower damage, health, hero speed, attack speed etc. You depend on item drop to do that, and you depend A LOT on item drop (and I say A LOT). You can go almost 30 hero levels without ever finding a gear that fits your hero, so you won't play it the way you want for a very long time. That is a terrible decision by the game designers and, for me, what ruined the game, because what makes a good RPG is character creation and the fact that you can costumize you hero to play the way you want to play it. DD2 won't let you.Personaly I like to play builder. That is not an option either in DD2, since you get enough ""build mana"" to build one or maybe two towers in a map. And, if you don't go aura, there is  good chance you will waste your mana by having your tower destroyed in the first waves.The other thing is that you cannot kick a player from the map or even vote kick him. So if someone decides to troll the party on the last wave, he will do it, and will remai unpunished. But I believe that there will be something regarding that for after the pre-alpha.If the game was just a few dolars expensive or maybe free to play, I would give it 5 stars, but, when I pay almost $20 for it, I feel a lot of regret.

								Hello there! :)I'm a completely new DD2 player, but I've already played for quite some time. Lovin' it!I don't understand all the negative reviews. No game can stay alive forever; everything gets boring in time, but why not enjoy it while it lasts? All games are played for the entertainment value; if you think the game is fun and fits your personal preference it's a great game.All the reviews in here comment on the game being F2P and that it should've just stayed as a P2P; well, the game is completely free of charge. 4 completely free heroes (you have to complete the first quest in the game to obtain two of the ""free heroes,"" but that's easiely done); you can play through the entire game without ever buying anything.The only things you buy are either cosmetic or inventory space; what's your problem? You earn Defender Medals over time and can buy any of the heroes, again, completely free of charge.The only thing that really forces you to pay money are the actual skins. Are skins really that important to people? Does it really ruin the game for you? Well, that's sad for you, but I'm enjoying the game a lot. Just started playing and I'm already 45+ hours in. Great game! :)Score: ""9.5/10""			"

								I don't know what they did to the networking, but everytime I try to play with a friend, we lose 5 to 10 minutes trying to get into a game. Going to a private tavern is a hassle. Everytime we manage to finish a map (near impossible with the latest update, even with fully upgraded old NM4 gear with fully upgraded shards), another 5 to 10 minutes are lost because one of the players in the party has to restart the game (you can't join the other person's game from a private tavern, from the city and from the main screen the restart is required). Constant request timeouts when you finish a map and has to pick where do you want to go.			"

Perfect game in the hands of the wrong developersDungeon Degender 1 was one of those amazing games that everyone knew and lot of peoples liked it, so it comes with no suprise that Dungeon Defender 2 was made, but it just doesent live up to the expectations.After around 10+ hours it quickly comes out obvious that the game just doesent have enough content... Maps,characters,gamemodes... there just isint enough variety. The game comes out so short that it only takes few hours to reach the max level of 50 and from onwards youll be forced to grind your way trough those exact same maps that arent interesting really at all. Numerous Bugs and Graphical issues also kill the experience a lotGood: Cartoonish graphics are nice Lot of items to collect 4 Player CoOpBad: Lack Of Maps No Customization (Other than paid outfiths) Same enemy types (Gets kind of repeative) Bugs (Antialising from ingame doesent work, Constant Crashing, Memory Leak, Connection issues, odd error messages)DD2 deserves to be made into a big name game with a strong playerbase but with all the issues and lack of content it just falls short too fast. Giving the game a steam workshop so users could craft theyre own maps would make the game 10x better or even the devs coming up with a 10-30+ map pack with new games modes and/or bigger character roster would definetly make the game much more worth the time.As of now its fun with friends but other than its just mediocre tower defence game.

								Game is free, and is actually ok, but not even close to the original DD (which is not free). Being a huge fan of DD I cannot recomend part 2 to anyone who already has part 1. But if you dont have part 1, check part 2 and if you like it then just go and buy the original DD.Maybe on some point devs will be able to turn it not a good game but now it is just grind and boring ... that is the price of a free game i guess.UPDATE1: I have played a bit more and even bought a DLC (one sale now). Was very interesting moment when i reached lvl 50 and somehow was able to join N4 game (even though i was pretty much usless there) and in a few minutes my iPWR have jumped from 170 to 695. Then i have started my own game on N4 and some other low iPWR level guys joined and did exactly the same (some may say it was my fault, did not set a limit) But i was not able to kick anyone because other guys were either AFK or did not know how to vote ... will keep this review negative,			"

								Game is far too different from the first one so far, in a bad way.- Each hero now only has 4 towers (used to be 5)- Unique towers have been removed (electric tower, ensnare aura, bouncer blockade, etc)- Monk has lost all but one of his auras- Many of these new gear passives enforce 'meta' builds- Melee combat is uncomfortable with the new 'lunge forward with every attack' thing- Resistances have been condensed into two categories (DD1 had 4)- Enemies are less interesting- Imo, the graphics feel unfinished, worse than DD1 evenThere have been improvements, but for them to come at the cost some of the core features many of us loved about the first game isn't worth it. The game is just too different. Had Trendy not changed all of these things so drastically and seemingly without good reason, and just improved the stuff that needed it, this game could have been a smash. As it stands, I'm not a fan of this game and wouldn't recommend it.			"

								I really wish I could give this a thumbs up, but I can't.  I'm more neutral it than anything.The biggest issue is there really isn't a sense of progression like Dungeon Defenders 1 had.  I understand that there were balancing issues, but half the fun was dumping all your stats in range or attack speed and watching your towers perform ridiculously.  Dungeon Defenders 2 has more unique towers, but you can't really ""play around"" with them as everything is tied to equipment.  Specs are an interesting concept to replace tower/hero stats, but they're either broken, uninteresting, useless, or some combination of the three.Hopefully it'll turn around by release and impress me, but right now it just doesn't feel like Dungeon Defenders.

								one of the recent patchs was a huge nerf to everything, after struggling to survive and manage in the now messed up ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game, they just again today ( 3/8/17 ) nerfed the last bit of anything useful, destroying dryad as a defense means and making this game simply impossible to play, they will never get another micro transaction from me ever again, ill probably simply uninstall tonight and see if dungeon defenders 1 still has a server or not.

								Rewriting my review so its more up to date with the gameFirst up my playtime is divided with alot more hours put on the ps4 version of this game.Also on the ps4 version i have soon three level 50 characters with one of them being around 400 item power.Towers and spheresWith the updates rolling in fixing balancing and fixing stuff it gets a little bit more funwith setting the towers up and what towers to use. Like before i only needed a barrage of cannon towers and maybe one or two ballistas sitting close together. Now with the spacing you cant have as many cannon towers to make the range work all the time which then require the heavy cannonball sphere so you can set out some long range cannonball towers. The heavy cannonball tower isnt as great as the standard one in damage but the range makes it more effective in some lane defences.That being said it gets kinda weird to go to your character changing station on the map just to change the sphere so you can set out the heavy cannonball tower then go back and change back to whatever sphere you are using on the ultra sphere slot.++ a bigger combination of towers on the map then just three (two good offensive and the wall tower)- - weird way to make it happensuggestionThe heavy cannonball sphere should either have more effects or make the sphere into something else you maybe unlock upon reaching level 50 and not something you have to equip. More like just a alternative version of the cannonball tower that you can EASY change to when in the building stage.This also applies to the other tower changing spheres the other characters have. Its a great idea so i say: more alternative tower version = more gameplay (yeah i know, it requires a lot more work and balancing also).LootI love how they changed up the hero weapons to have more variety in weapon speed and attack pattern. There is also the special weapons (betsy weapons and spooky weapons and more) and thats real good. ""more variety"" = ""more gameplay"" to a certain degree.StoryBecause i have played from the start of this game when it was more difficult to see any story then the Dark souls games, i dont have any say in this, i think i have to play from the beginning with a new character to experience it.

								To Echo the other reviews: New update basically ruined the game. They stripped out all the old endgame content and replaced it with the same maps but instead of mechanics it has randomized buffs on monsters a la The Underdome from borderlands. They also made gearing arduous and frustrating, and based on a hidden value that your existing pieces have. Give it a pass until they do some kind of fix.EDIT: Another couple dozen hours of play in, def give this a pass. We got all our gearing woes sorted out and managed to slowly crawl up to the top tier content where one is treated to the worst designed enemy in any game I've played in this decade. This is an enemy with about a third of the HP of a wave boss, that spawns in groups, can teleport around the map, and glue themselves to you one at at time doing massive damage to you and defense near you. They mechanically get knocked off when taking damage but don't worry, the other ones that spawned in other lanes at the same time will happily take their place. Also you're constantly silenced as long as they're on you and they seem to leave you permanently silenced when they're done. Which has been a 'bug' for the month since this launched. Is it doable? Sure. Is it fun? Absolutely not. Total trash game design and a poorly designed frustrating difficulty spike.			"

								This game seems to have done to RPG games what Team Fortress 2 did for online army/war games. Made the genre nice and fun. A great, fun game to grind away with your mates in teams of 4 or by your lonesome. Bright and cartoony graphics make it easy on the eye, yet not cheesy in any way. It runs like a charm, smooth play and I have yet to experience any bad lag issues, just a couple of spikes here and there. The Devs are doing their job with consitant updates, changes and improvements. Looking forward to seeing where the game is headed. My only gripe is that you can't gift items to friends in game, or even drop them on the floor for some to pick up, OH, and it would be nice to see some way of upgrading your armour and weapons. That's about the only negative things I could say about the game really. Great fun and addictive.			"

								- I rate this game Positive with Mixed Feelings-Heres why:I am a big DD1 and DD2 fan, I generally enjoy tower defense games, and this game is no diffrent. Since the game is now free, I can easily have friends download it, and hang out for a day just leveling new characters, or trying difficultys that are too hard for us just too try and win, what you want out of a tower defense game in the first place.-Why is the game getting so trashed?Recently there was an update, a lot of players myself included that had spend hundreads of hours basically got knocked down to a casual level, our gears stats were randomized and most our effort was destroyed. That said, its for a better tomorrow. The game gets updates that changes it to its fundemental core for endgame, when this happens you always role the dice on if you're going to be setback, don't look at it as your time wasted, but as the game improving to a final state. Its obviouse the developers want there to be a semi-hard core scene for DD2, and its all in prep to see who has the best stratagy to down harder content, and get better gear.-What do I dislike?As if stolen from Diablo 3, they added paragon points after hitting max level. (I say D3 because the only game I currently play that has them. :) )) These add more grinding to help improve your character overtime, but personally I'm not a big fan of them, the game seems to be designed around these paragon points for character progresion, so thats also part of the reason old and new players were on a more even playing field, the more you grind the more it'll help you climb the ranks.-What would I like to see in the game?I would like to see some sort of ipwr, armor restriction, or something along those lines to joining harder difficultys. I want there to be a clear progression path for all players old and new that can't be skipped because you have someone like me with enough gear to afk through harder content, friends love me but they don't understand how quickly they burn them-selfs out just letting someone carry them while they afk, thats not where the true heart of the game lies.-Final ThoughtsI'll continue to play this game on and off for years to come, i'll continue to support the design team by buying their skins and other DLC, for a day I can clearly say ""This is better than DD1, hands down."" till then, keep on grinding, unlock those characters, and make use of the weekend events ect.

Early Access Review
								It's a great shame that Dungeon Defenders II is as dissapointing as it is. I loved the first one and played it loads in splitscreen with my partner. While I bought a few DLC packs (that I understand were fairly controversal) the base game felt like a complete experience with plenty of levels and characters and tons of replay value.I actually bought Dungeon Defenders II before it became free to play for around £18, due to my love of the first game. My initial reaction, particularly of the artsyle, was of how much it resembled those crappy mobile games like Clash of Clans. Dungeon Defenders 1 was of course very cartoony but had a level of charm that elevated it above the generic cartoon style of F2P cash-cow mobile trash. Dugeon defenders II on the other had looks very tacky.  The problems don't end at the artstyle though; by going F2P the game now feels like a rubbish F2P MMO. When launching you are greeted by messages asking to buy things and enter a lobby with loads of other players milling about and spamming the chat with nonsense. As a result I overall did not enjoy my experience with the game so far. My reward for both buying in to the game early and spending £18 was very little, maybe 1 skin as far as I can remember. Performance isn't great although the game is in early access so this may change. Overall I feel the move to F2P was a huge mistake. While the tower defense genre is hardly an easy genre to compete in what with many other games existing in this genre I feel Dungeon Defenders 1's blend of tower defense with Diablo-style classes and loot was unique and interesting to stand apart from the competition. On top of that brilliant levels, music, art design, and charm meant the first Dungeon Defenders was well worth the up-front investment. I feel the developers almost didn't have faith in their own product with Dungeon Defenders II in their decision to go F2P, feeling they needed to rely on the game being free to attract an audience and that an up-front cost would turn away buyers. As a result the game has taken a huge hit to it's value; feeling tacky, grindy, and just generally unappealing. There is still hope I suppose, the game is still in Early Access and there is time for the devs to reverse the decision of going F2P or at least improve the game signifiicantly that it becomes worthy of a try. By the time the title releases (and exits early access) I will give it another shot and see if it is any better, I hope so because I want to enjoy this game as much as the first but so far I've not been impressed.

								I rreally enjoyed DD1 and had a good time with it.   The biggest stumbling block of most F2p/P2W games is they put most of their endgame content behind either a huge timewall or a paywall.DD2 seems to have gone with the timewall.   The game is fun at first.   Once you unlock your abilitites it quickly becomes stale and boring.   Little new information or items are thrown at you and skills have little to no depth or subtlety in their execution.TLDR: Just play DD1.   You wont have to re-lvl or farm all your stuff.   Its basically the same with some new wrapping.PSA:   Trendy studio is also a POS who is suing another company (coincidentally) right as their game started to tank.   Desperate grasp for cash maybe?  This is also a major driving factor in me dropping the game and abandoning all trendy products.			"

								Early access games often have some sort of in game purchases to help fund the game's development. This is a practice that is as widely accepted as it is criticized. Usually the purchases are for cosmetic items to customize your character in some way. Dungeon Defenders has that.Another thing dungeon defenders has is...$24.99 DLC that increases your inventory space and gives you a title.You know a developer doesn't give the slightest semblance of a crap for you when they sell you inventory space for real cash.This game deserves to be on an iPad, not on Steam.

								I got this early before it was free to play.  I loved the first DD and I like this one.  I have some resurvations about some of the mechanics but in general I like the way the company is approaching it.  It's fun and it's not Pay to Win.  It's Pay to customise (mainly your look)  there are a few convinances that cost also (like extra bag space) but in general you don't pay for better weapons, upgrades, faster leveling, or anything else required to win.  I think DD1 had some aspects I liked a little more but DD2 is still great and it's not done yet.  The company listens to the players, lets you vote on upcoming choices and has great live streams where they actually address and answer YOUR questions.  If you like the First Person Tower Defense games (Sanctum, DD1) I recomend it.  And I'm still looking forward to seeing what else they do to make it even better before it stops being Early Access.Update:  Game is still fun though content is still a bit light.  I wonder if the game operated on DLC terms, where I could buy more content, if the updates would be more dense.  As it is I tend to wait a month or two for content updates then jump on and have a few days of fun before waiting for the next few content updates.  If you are planning on trying this out for the first time it's worth it, Free for a lot of fun.  If you like it I recomend buying bags to support the company as they make the game a bit nicer.  If you don't then it didn't cost you anything.   However if you run out of things to do or are waiting for some of the changes or new content to come aobut, know that it's a slow process.  Trendy seems to still be delivering, and listenning to the people who play, but it does seem painfully slow.			"

								This game used to be so good, probably one of my favorite games for a while. Then it became a ""free to play"" game, aka ""pay to win"". All the new content that used to be free to you now has to be payed for with irl money. This game sued to be super fun, but now with 4 new characters that i will never be able to play, and special events that I will have limited to no involvement in; it is just sad. This game used to be a solid 5/5...No it struggles to even get past a 1.5/5 for me. Sure the base game will always be the same, but half the fun of playing this game was waiting for the new content that the Devs released every so often. It re sparked the games fun for me, and now that is gone. The game becomes repetitive and dull when you don't have new content. As much as I would want to recommend this game, I can't. Making it pay to win and pay to have fun is just sad. (Keep in mind I do have this opinion because I have had the game since almost initial release | But if you don not like in game purchase games, don't waste your time)			"

								DD1 was amazingBought this before Steam early access and was VERY disapointed.The original pitch for DD2 is that it was going to be a MOBA game and I had ZERO interest in buying it, Then they announced they had scrapped that idea went back to the drawing board and were going to stay more true to the original - They did not.The tower defence aspects in DD2 are vastly inferior to DD1 (which for me was the best part of DD1)  No longer can you place your towers as your main defence and fight as filler during the combat phase.  You must now place your (weak) towers and fight for your life during the combat phase or you will NOT win.If you prefer the combat side to the tower defence side then this game may be for you,  If you prefer the tower defence side to the combat side (as I do) I just cannot recommend this game, Which is unfortunate as DD1 was such a masterpiece.

And not a cheap free to play... They constantly updade the game with new heros, new maps and no need to pay. If you actively play, you can get all this for free. Now some people will whine that it's P2W because they have to work to unlock some stuff. Guess what? People are making games for a living. Someone need to pay them. So it's fair that they sell packs to unlock few heroes more quickly and that they sell skins. The only things you cannot get without paying are all and only cosmetic stuff. It's not P2W... Just play the game and you'll notice that you can earn the medals needed to unlock new heroes pretty quickly.Honestly, it's one of the best F2P I ever seen and one of the most fair if we consider players that pay VS players that dont pay. This game deserve a way higher rating than it currently is.			"

In their most recent hotfix patch they have made the dryad completely unplayable in an effort to increase the difficulty, this patch coming after a large amount of players bought the character with real money in order to progress. Super disapointing and regretting spending any money on this game!Careful spending any money on any feature of this game as devs do not care about player investment at all.			"

								Dungeon Defenders 2 should've been a very, very good game like the first one, but since its early access release, there have been so many tiny little things done wrong that were never corrected. All of these cascaded into the poor time of today; and no one is better for it.Bugs that have existed since the dawn of the game are still in, I'm not talking about small minor ones. No, I'm talking about pretty major ones such as matchmaking issues, enemy/map glitching and player's towers being broken. On top of that, the game is repetitive. Once you've played the campaign once, you've seen practically the entire game. You're never forced to adopt and refine your strategies or are given new interesting challenges to play through. The ""incursions"" the game offers, maps that have a special objective of some sort, are a far cry from DD1's challenges due to the fact that the player is given very little option to play around the special objectives. Simple invincibility fields or having the player run around to catch collectibles do not provide interesting challenges to the player, because there's no smart way to play it. You either play ""Simon-says"" with the map, or do the same thing you've been doing except without personally attacking with your hero. The player is not given a choice, and without a choice to make there is no obstacle to overcome.I believe this comes from a fundamental design flaw within the development team. They seem to be prioritizing making new content and incentive systems instead of making a game that is worth playing. If the game itself is not a sound concept, it does not matter how much content or grind mills you put into the game. Nobody wants to play your revival maps, and they most certainly don't want to run through your grind mills. This is why it's very important for early access games to focus on the game itself, not the content it has.If you're just a person looking for a game to mess around with friends though, there's a few hours of enjoyment for you here, as long as you can look past all the bugs. Otherwise, I would highly recommend simply purchasing DD1 instead of hoping this game works. If you really want to look for this game in the future, try to look at what the development team is doing and try to figure out their focus. Once you notice a large shift in their thinking, that will probably be the time this game comes back to light.			"

								What happened to Dungeon Defenders 2?In short: I no longer like the look and feel the game has. I just don’t enjoy playing these “walking stick” characters. I feel that all the small things, that made me enjoy DD1, are no longer part of DD2.For me personally, it’s a huge step back from DD1. The first thing I noticed when I played is, that nothing is familiar. Everything is completely different and not in a good way. All the menus such as character, level and inventory menus are very confusing. The enjoyment of upgrading your character and spending time on searching through good items, is no longer there for me. I find find it rather annoying and confusing to go through all the menus.In DD1, the mana crystals which are needed to build towers, were so much fun to collect. In DD2, I don’t even see them properly. What happened? Why are they so tiny?Same for all monsters and player characters along with the weapons. They’re all so small and look like walking sticks. Sometimes the monsters blend into the environment and you can’t even make them out. I don’t like the art design of the 3D models that they went with. I prefer the more “bubbly” look from DD1.Towers? I loved playing a mage in DD1, the art design was great, but in DD2 all the mage towers look cheap, as if they were rushed.And no, don’t say “Oh but early access, they might change these things”. No they don’t. The development of the game is now focusing on optimizing the game and bug fixes, they are not making any major changes anymore.			"

								I will try to explain some points:1) The game itself:   -The game is not bad at all: looks beautiful and Trendy seems to spend a lot of money on it, even nowadays. I would say it has a very different game concept if we compare it to DD1. I personally prefer DD1 style.   -It is a little boring. This is not the same DD1 we used play and which we spent hours creating a good tower defense scheme..   -Trendy deliver new contents often. This is a very good point.   -Most of other reviews are legit; the good ones and the bad ones.2) The project management:   -I agree that developing games requires a lot of resources (money, time, patience, life, etc) and there are great risks. But that's not excuse to such bad administration. I bought the game on alpha because I believed that It would help them to finish the game I loved to play. But years later it is still on alpha.. and for free! >:(   -Playing alpha for such long time is waste of time.   -Now the game is free you can play it and check it by yourself. ;)			"

								Dungeon Defender 2 is not good.The Biggest issue to me is the Lags. You can choose to play on any of their 3 servers (EU, AU, US) oftenly experience the horrible rubberband and teleport all over the place. I don't know what cause these lags. be it Net code or server issue or whatever. It's really really bad.Next problem is the Junkyard management simulator problem. There are a few Good equipment stats which are randomly generated for the loot drops. To get them you just need to farm over and over until you randomly get the one you want for your build. while selling other  10,000 junks you don't need. There doesn't seems to be any kind of reroll for equipments.The inventory system is a mess. It would take me like 30 minutes to sort the items i picked up from one mission. to see which has good stats/passives then discard(sell) the rest. I have been using all the sorting option they provide with the bags-autoloot system. but it still took me that long because i expand my inventory (by purchase more inventory bags) and have the autoloot on some of them.Also, there's no trading between players. the few of interactions between players are Chatting and Co-operative play.So i would not recommend this game for anyone. it's bad and sad.

								I'm writing this review on the 8th of December - 14. A Very familiar feel to the first game, definetely needs some polishing, in terms of level design and combat in general. Servers also need an upgrade, as jerking and teleporting, as well as delayed attacks and spells are quite definite. The way the game is right now, is unplayable, unless you are comftorable grinding endless hours. Also, Singleplayer and Co-op is unplayable, as combat is not fixed for either one. I would like to see much more customization and more RPG'esk mechanics introduced. I know this game probably has a while until it will feel polished and fun to play, but at the moment I do not recommend it.			"

								I am having trouble enjoying this game anymore, even though I want to. Pros:You can get fun outfits without having to pay real money for them.You can get some of the highest lvl pets without having to pay real money for them.There is no pay to win aspect in this game.With those pros you would think that this game would be a great mmo tower defense, but the cons make you loath the process you have to undergo in order to even attempt the nightmare difficulty playthroughs. DD2 stops being a game of strategy long before you reach even the hard or insane difficulty levels preceding the nightmare ones. Cons:Grind, Grind, Grind goes the player. Item drops are arbitrary. What I mean by this is that the high lvl gear that drops as you solo a difficult map, will hardly ever be gear you actually want for ANY of your characters. What adds insult to injury is the carnival ticket mechanic. During every map playthrough, carnival ticket's drop, and for every 10 tickets that drop, you can spin the carnival wheel for the chance of getting Legendary gear of your current avg item lvl. This is the only way to dependably get good gear, because Legendary gear is the best in the game. So, even if it is not perfect for your build you may still be able to use it. To use the wheel in this way requires that you equip terrible tier gear that have high item lvls. This way you increase your avg item level before you spin the wheel. If you do not have tickets, you can use 2500 in game currency to spin the wheel. So, you end up farming maps for gold, then spinning the wheel until you get better gear, finally playing the same old maps at a higher difficulty setting, and then restarting the process all over again to advance to the next difficulty setting.Therefore, this game is more than just a grind fest, but also a redundant waste of time with no true reward for effort expended.

								Charming. Technically tower defense but not really. Hack-n-slash and pew pew game that takes almost no skill at all. Farm endlessly for no reason because there's literally nothing else to do.No real strategy. Basically block off every path and prevent the mobs from getting through. Have good gear = win. Not having good gear actually makes it fun and challenging but the fun doesn't last all that long.There's essentially one only one way to play each of the 4 characters. There is no depth to this game at all.High level play, like level 30+, devolves to players swapping their high level characters in to place OP towers and afk every round. Bugged flying mobs are the only thing keeping people active because it slows down the farmfest. Beyond level 40 the game begins to feel nearly dead. Probably because people with half a brain don't keep playing hoping it gets more interesting like I did. There are barely any players to play with aside from the farmers. Once you find a farmer, you can afk and go do something better with your time. Literally anything.You constantly replace gear because this game is all about ascending and descending in power. Take a few zeros off the numbers and check it out! It's as if you're still level 10! The difference is maybe your weapon looks cooler and your gear icons glow and have colorful borders.The gear you are constantly replacing isn't shown on your character. Instead, the devs have opted for costumes that you can buy with real money so your character actually changes appearance aside from weapons. Some of the costumes are cool but that's not going to excuse how silly the Squire runs and pretty much just makes it look even more ridiculous. It's like the devs looked at the melee character and said, ""Make this one pretty much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥."" However, the attack animations are pretty damned good. The character goes from derp to Spartan warrior at the click of a button.It's charming and could be cool but deep down, just like The Mighty Quest for Epic Loot, it's garbage and will be until time erases it.

Early Access Review
 Decent game, did not live up to DD1	Admittedly, this game is fun. The item progression and character progression make you feel more powerful as you play. The art style is unique and fun. Having it free to play is a bold move, but having paid for access earlier, I do not feel rewarded.However, this is a shell of what it could have been. Dungeon Defenders 1 had more classes, a better item system, a higher level cap and even more enemies (feels better killing 1000 enemies rather than 100). Rather than refining on a tried and true model, they created a different game, taking multiple steps backwards. Character leveling takes far too long, enemies do not spawn properly, waves take ages...After the trainwreck of Dungeon Defenders Eternity and this game falling flat, I cannot recommend this game, or even Trendy. While they produce many podcasts, they seem to have almost no involvement with the community (or at least the vast majority). The games have tons of bugs, many of which should have been easy fixes. It's laughable, really.			"

								The moment the Devs added in the Siege roller the game took a significant step backwards in terms of fun and overall playability. I'll freely admit that the current meta of Poison Dart Tower/Serenity Aura made most levels a joke but making an enemy that is virtually invincible to towers and forcing you to switch to a DPS hero puts a spotlight on how poorly thought out it was; not to mention the fact that despite heavy complaints from players virtually nothing has been done to rectify the situation making some levels almost impossible to pass unless you have 4 players geared to the hilt.In its current state I personally wouldn't recommend it but that is obviously subject to change depending on how the game progresses.

								NOTE: Keep in mind, the game must be paid for in order to play at the moment, as it is in Early Access. It will become Free To Play at around the end of the year. Also, a lot of the negative reviews on the front page are complaining about issues that have been fixed or changed or complaining about features that are not in the game YET.In my opinion, This game has a lot of potential. Even though it is currently in early access, it feels like it has enough replayibility to keep me going for hundreds of hours with the latest update. Now, here are some of the pros and cons for the game in its current state.Some Pros: + Pretty art design, the way it is done gives the game a more 'Toon' feel to it. + Alot more enemy diversity compared to DD1.  + The Game is regularly updated, with the latest patch adding loads of content in to the game. + The people who work on the game interact with the community and hold Developer streams on Twitch every friday. + According to the developers, There won't be DLC Map packs, so the community won't be split. + The music in the game is good. + The towers have more 'Personality' as i would call it... + Once it goes F2P, It won't be P2W. + Betsy and cute Propellor Cats + If you do buy Early Access, you get $30 worth of ingame currency to buy costumes with.A few Cons: - It's in early access, so you have to pay to be able to play it. - Tavern is laggy and the game feels slightly unoptimized. - Uber Skill Spheres cost waaaaaaay too many Wyvern Tokens.. (i call the tokens 'Betsy Bucks') - Level cap that does not take long to reach. (Level Cap will be increased later on) - Earlier maps become meaningless to play once you hit level 25. (They are adding Incursions soon for them to make them playable in late game again) - Bug paradise - No controller support yet.Note: Most of the problems i have with the game a due to the game still being in development and a lot of the features are not in it yet.Final Verdict: While the game is unfinished and has it's fair share of problems, it's fun, which is what people really look for in games. 8/10 (in it's current state)			"

								Firstly, the game is good but a few things have just irked me from the get go. The fact that when you level you cant put any upgrade points into tower stats is a massive fail, it is necessary to reinstate this to be able to even have the smallest chance on higher difficulties. The fact is to improve your towers you are completelly reliant on equpment drops (which are rare as ♥♥♥♥)  The lack of controller support is annoying for now but i understand that this will be added later so isnt that important of a point to make now.The graphics are a nice improvement and i like the art style in general. Trash equpment that nobody wishes to pick up now no longer vanishes and gets banked at the end of each wave it stays until the end of the map making everything look cluttered by the end and instead of auto selling everything and splitting the cash it splits it into each persons inventory which you then have to manually sell or wait a few days for the auto sell.the preorder stated $30 of in game cash but my account has 0, not sure if thats a UK thing but i havent got a dime.The map order is strange and have yet had a chance to work out what sort of order I should be doing them in with no solid structure like numbering added to the map names it is slightly confusing. The lobbies need an option to kick or to votekick idle players as they come in the game and build a few towers the reap the benefits of xp with no action able to be taken against them and it gets worse when the random lobby host is rolled onto them on endgame and everyone has to find a new lobby.The building mana needs to have a higher drop rate as I have gone through games only being able to build a handful of towers that are then just destroyed as I dont have enough mana to upgrade or repair them.To sum up, levelling feels pointless apart from being able to equip slightly better armour now and then when the lynchpin of all rpg style games is character progression and on dd2 it feels completely dead and worthless. Many more issues such as droprates need to be looked at and until this is updated i will probably stay away from this game for now. I will change my reccomendation upon further updates if improvements are made. "

								Ver. - AlphaHello, At the beginning I would like to say that the game itself isn't bad, but there's no ""Neutral"" button to press and my personal game preference pointer is slightly towards ""Wouldn't recommend"", that's why my review is negative.The game itself isn't that bad, just so you know.As a new player to the ""Action-Tower Defense"" games you'll probably like it. The opposite goes for players that spend XXX hours playing the first Dungeon Defenders.Anyway let's write about few things that I would like you guys to know...1. This time they've made a game as F2P(free to play) with cosmetic microtransactions(mostly) as Cash Shop. Don't be fooled by this. Character slots are limited to 4 - you need to pay to get more slots. And you will need more, when new characters will be introduced to the game. The second problem is you Inventory, starting bags are limited, they fill with items really quick - more bags of course are available with cash. It wouldn't really be that big problem if the items like chests or pet stuff would stack, but sadly it doesn't...2. Unlike DD1 you characters here have more skills to use, which is kinda nice - 3 skills + heal, but you have less towers to build, only 4.3. Game looks a bit better than DD1, a bit more cartoony I would say.4. If the game host got crappy connection or his internet will start doing some nasty stuff(high ping, dropping packets, etc) you and other players will be laggy as hell, be ready for that.5. Pet hatching time, 48h to hatch an egg - hatching can fail(no pet, sorry)6. Number of trash items dropped isn't bad, like it was in DD1, it was earlier in alpha but they've reduced trash drops.7. No character customization - just outfits unlocked via chests.I think that would be all I can think about at the moment.To sum it up, DD1 sucked me in for many, many hours of fun, and I really enjoyed it and love the game, while DD2 just doesn't feel this way, it lacks something that keeps you interested in the game.In a bit funny way I will type this:You sit at the table and you see two things on this table - 1. Sandwitch with cheese(represents DD2) and 2. Pizza(represents DD1). Which one would you pick? - This is how I see this two games. DD1 - 9/10 (-1 for the number of trash drops)DD2 - 4.5/10			"

Bugs and broken gameplay elements remain unfixed and unchanged for months. The core game is a broken and unbalanced grindfest that's not worth your time, money, or patience. It's been years since release and if feels just as unfinished on the gameplay side as it did on day one. This game looked to be good one and I've rooted for it from the beginning, but it's in the hands of inept developers who have squandered away it's amazing potential. TLDR; Save your time and money, this game sucked then, sucks now, and will still suck in the future.			"

								Ive tried to like this game but just cant. It just feels like a generic knockoff of Dungeon Defenders 1. The levels feel really claustrophobic, the lanes are so tight that when your towers are firing down a lane it looks like the finale to a 4th of july fireworks show, obscuring all sight of what is actually coming down the lane. The movement just doesnt feel intuitive and many objects on the levels seem to have almost the same height as your jumps apex making navigation through the tight levels a pain. The only thing i do like is the new action skills but other then that the game is a huge letdown and id recommend just playing DD1 over this mess.**Update: The game has improved alot. theyve fixed some of the movement issues. collisions could use some work because atm u get stuck on many invisible objects and cant walk over any little bump so u have to jump alot to get onto things that you would think u could just walk right up onto. its easier to see the mobs coming over the graphical effects from your towers, although it can still get a little crazy at times and could be toned down abit or use more transparent effects. atm they seem to use alot of opaque 2d sprites for effects that obscure everything behind them. net code could use work when your in the tavern but seems to be pretty good in co-op matches. figuring what stats have what on an item has been greatly simplified and is much more intuitive now. im still not a fan of the small inventory. u can buy larger bags with earned gold though so thats a plus and alleviates quite abit of that headache but it still feels lacking when u start to play multiple char's. overall though they have improved the game greatly and is worth trying if u were a big DD1 fan. keep an eye on it atleast.

								I've been waiting a long time for this to come out, and yet here it is December 2014 and this is still only ""pre-alpha""??? As other have said, no controller support yet, and no split-screen local multiplayer either!! So those 2 things right there limit my enjoyability for this game since my brother and I have been playing the original DD together for a few years.Also, I'm not a fan of the forced online ""instances"", a la MMORPGs. I hate those kind of games. I generally play games alone or locally with a friend, or very rarely with a friend online. I seriously do not have any interest in playing with random people online. I did not know this was the case before I bought it.And, did something change, because I distinctly remember the Dungeon Defenders website saying that DD2 would be a free-to-play game, with in-game purchase of items, levels, etc. Yet they're asking $24.99 (20% off until 12/12) for this unfinished game! I went ahead and bought it yesterday anyway, though, since I loved DD1, but the current state of the game leaves a lot to ask for.Yes, I get that they're calling this ""pre-alpha"" and ""early access"". But since this game has been in development for a long time now, I would have imagined they be further along, and at least have the same features as the first game (controller support, splitscreen multiplayer, pop up menus for your powers/summons, ability to upgrade your items in your inventory with mana, etc.)The good: The game looks great; the graphics and animations are well polished. Some neat new game play aspects. Simplified mechanics, each hero now only gets 4 types of powers and 4 kinds of summonable defenses.The bad: Core features are missing! HELLO? What happened to controller support and split screen multiplayer??? Also, the music gets repetitive very fast. Some of the new aspects and mechanics are confusingly presented. For instance, you can't get your inventory or character stats without visiting the defenders forge. Level ups seem to be automatic, except for points you can distribute, but you must go to the forge.As others have said, you don't get as much green mana for summoning as DD1. Basically there's now blue mana for powers and green mana for summons. In my 2 hours of play so far, the levels end up littered with blue mana crystals that I can't pick up because I'm already full, yet my green mana is either empty or nearly half full. I guess this is a balance problem, hopefully they'll address it.RECOMMENDATION: Not worth even the sale price of $19.99. They need to bring back the core features I loved about DD1. Maybe once they've released a few more patches it'll be up to my expectations.			"

								29.99 for early access, you know, to help the game and the devs out early on... heres the kicker, i had maxed heros, and baddest gear the game made... only to have it all stripped from me in an update, and given nothing back in return... seems fair, whatever, i shrugged it off... heres the kicker, now if i want to ""upgrade"" and get full features the game offers, i have to pay another 49.99........................ sooooooooo in total, i HELPED this game in early development, and for this, they want me to pay 80 dollars to play it in its entirety. i hope that you read this review before considering this game, trust me, there are MANY more games in this genre that are MUCH better and not a complete cash grab.. you get yellow coins that are absolutely worthless, and the gems that are required to buy everything require micro-transactions of actual cash to buy.... this game will cost you 100s of dollars for basic enjoyable gameplay... pass on it, trust me. TRY SANCTUM 2, MUCH MUCH BETTER AND MORE AFFORDABLE, AND THEY DONT SPAM FOR YOUR CASH! "

								If this is the endgame they have ruined it for players that have been there since the beginning. I didn't pay for extra inventory space. I paid for extra inventory BAGS. But somehow you saw fit to remove them and make a big jumbled mess of the inventory compared to what it once was like. And in the end this game is just a terrible follow up to DD1. Shards are not equipping into items i had previously. All my heroes items only accept blue shards but no wait they don't take those either for some reason. There is no reason to punish myself to earn ""Ascension"" just to earn skills when I already had to farm the gold to get those skills to begin with. Again terrible follow up to DD1. Could not be more disappointed.			"

								So I bought this game a couple of months ago, and I enjoyed playing it initially. It does get quite old after a while. I think they need far more items and item models to make it interesting. That's not my biggest problem with this game though. I happened to be browsing on steam today and one of my suggested items is a DLC pack for this game... why is an unfinished game launching paid DLC packs? This company is clearly just trying to grab all the money they can, steer clear.			"

								The game isn't bad, but it's not amazing right now either. Compared to the first DD nothing really wow's me or makes me say ""Wow that was an obvious and needed upgrade!"". What I see are a bunch of little changes that I found unnecessary, the little things so to speak. For example...-Mana crystalsIn the first DD it was fun just running around watching the mana crystals float around and gobbling them up. Killing an ogre and watching it explode into huge mana crystals was oddly satisfying. And seeing the ground littered with mana crystals after destroying wave after wave of minions was awesome. Now there are just little uninspiring little diamonds, just makes it feel more grindy. -TowersThe towers feel kind of meh. I mainly played as a squire, the cannon balls towers in the first game which albeit not the best towers were hilarious to set up and watch all the balls just go bouncing around. They are replaced by generic projecticle explody turrets. The ballista towers which were so fun to just watch go pew pew pew and tens of ballista projectiles go all around the map is so boring now. They just fire every 5 seconds or whatever and the range sucks. Additionally my friend plays a monk and I don't like how the auras from the monks are just so small and are basically circles on the ground instead of huge epic semi spheres. All these little changes that just make the game less epic compared to the first DD. -MapsThe maps are alright. Nothing amazing, nothing outright bad. All of them boil down to find chokepoints, build towers at chokepoints, kill big health mini boss at end of round. Gets kinda repetitive after a while. But its the beginner maps so thats to be expected. -ArmorI was highly disappointed that armor doesn't show up on your character still. Felt like that would've been an obvious added feature upgrade from the first DD. Anyway, I know I've only played ~8 hours on this game so far, but I compare this with my experience with DD I. When I first got DD I i was skeptical of the game, I got it for like 5 bucks and thought it was going to be one of those play for 5 hours and forget it indie games. But then I logged over 400 hours officially but probably alot more (steam account got reset), got to end game farming perfect 600/600/600/600 kobolds and selling for cubes, getting the super legendary skins etc, I played that game to the fullest. Compared with this game I went in with so much enthusiasm and after 7 hours or so I just feel meh. Overall, I know alot of these criticisms seem kind of small but for me they all add up to a product that in its current state just doesn't have the 'magic' of DD I.			"

								How did this game manage to go down hill like that? I left the game since there wasn't all that much to do at the moment I picked it up, I capped lvl on my squire and monk got good enough gear and was pretty much able to solo most challenges and group up to do anything I couldn't on my own so I felt like there wasn't much more to the game for me and I waited for some new patches to add new stuff to the game to make it more engaging and interesting.But hoo boy did they make the game suck as much as they could in the meanwhile. Well that is not completely fair it seems like they tried some things but they ended up making the game unfriendly from what I've seen all the playable builds have been destroyed (I guess they just ABSOLUTELY HAVE to sell the new heroes somehow so tearing down the old ones will do the trick) but again that might be my idea I did see a lot of monks so they gotta have something useful to contribute, but from all that I've seen the new heroes own the battlefield where as the old ones maybe contribute a tower or two on the map, sometimes?I know maybe I should have put more time in the game to be able to make a better review, but the fact alone that the game alienated me so much from the very beginning is a marvel on it self quest that don't explain anything, you have to know what to do from before. But did they tell you before what you needed to do? OF COURSE NOT, who needs tutorials anyway, so off you go to the forums to find out, and you do people are nice enough to explain thing the DEVELOPERS SHOULD.But appart from all that the worst thing is that the game had real potential, and I guess it still has. But I wouldn't hold my breath. If it happens though this game will be amazing if they actually manage to fix all this mess they created. But to me it seems they are more concerned with selling costumes and heroes rather than making the game player friendly and not feel like a grind fest. And that is the last thing I have a problem with, the grind, from what I've been told (since there is no chance I'd stick around for that farce as well) is disgusting, grinding months for medals to get bag slots to fill up with multiple same shards which don't stack (because of course they don't we gotta sell more bag slots) and you might need a bunch of them (again take care this is what people have told me in game and what I've seen in forums but also the fact that my bags got half full with 1 hour of gameplay. I've read of more problems but since I didn't encounter at all I wont put here but I can't say I don't believe exist. Over all I wish this game gets a lot better than it currently is because for as long as I went on with it it was really fun and also a really good game to play with friends and have a laugh sometimes with the maps and the enemies but as it stands I'd say keep an eye on it for the chance of getting better, but as I said, I wouldn't hold my breath if I where you.

								Faster paced than the original, and much less focused on strategic defense than it is on ""KIL AL THUH THINGZ"".If people like fast paced games, that's fine and their preference, but as I prefer to rely more on thought than snap reactions, and have adrenaline problems, this game is Not Playable for me.The focus more on thick-action combat than strategic tower placement turns this into more of a hack-fest. Again, fine if you are looking for a combat-oriented game, but if you want something that rewards planning and a long term strategy, this is not it.I loved the original, but this? I'm not happy that the devs have leaned more toward this fastactiongogogokablamyeahgogogo direction, but that's me. Someone who likes fast games might well love it......but purely from my perspective and preference for games that don't punish taking time to think, I can not recommend this.			"

								Long time DD1 player. Easily clocked over 1.5k Hours. Even had a Carry shop. Now that was a stratigic tower defense game.Now DD2 not so much. The game is F2P now and it shows. A once fun and enjoyable series is now very blandtastic, bug support is non exsistent especially for in game mico transactions. Everytime they patch the game they seem to break more things than they fix. If this game was suppose to be the new upgraded shiny version of DD1 they failed and failed horriably. This is a soft shell of what it could and should have been. The gameplay is stale and very limited in terms of what and how you can use. The meta is overly boring and require no skill at all to get to the the ""hardest"" difficulty of NM4. Which if you played DD1 is the equivilent to insane+ even if that.So much wrong with this ""sequel"" thats its not even a sequel... I wish they would have just went with their even worse first idea and made this game a moba so that I didnt even waste my time waiting for them to come around.			"

Early Access Review
								Well, where should I begin?Dungeon defenders 2 is the sequel to what's probably one of my favourite games, to be honest, it's quite disappointing but I can't hold too much against it as it is only in alpha at the moment, if I haven't updated this and it's in like beta when you're reading this then you should probably just ignore it. This is what I will say for now, however:The game is rather similar to the original DD but to me it just feels straight up bad in comparison. Let's talk about the main two components of both games, combat and strategy:The combat of this game is quite different to the original, in the original you will be greeted by hordes of weak enemies who surround you and make combat a challenge as you smoothly slice or gun them down dodging lots of orcs (basically like big tank enemies who slowly swing big axes) and projectiles along the way, it sounds easy but as there are so many of them, it makes it an awesome but still balanced challenge. However, in this second installment, it's changed for the worse, there are around 15 enemies on each part who all just feel a chore to kill, they have a lot more health but as it's not a proper fun horde, they are all easy to dodge and kill, it just takes AGES, it takes around 5 hits just to kill a goblin (a small enemy which is extremely weak, obviously there are a lot more in DD1). Did I mention melee? Using a melee weapon is just annoying as anything, every attack lunges you forward in the most awkward and uncontrollable way with a melee weapon. I've fell off cliffs trying to fight as a squire (the knight class in the game), so melee weapons and melee combat has just turned to total crap. Ranged weapons aren't any better though, really, all you do with one is move backward and shoot, which is no fun, I'd probably rather be a messed up knight, jerking uncontrollably. Basically, all the combat really is, is hitting and using your abilites when you can (just extra powerful attacks in this game really, and self healing). Squires can block but in this game it's useless as anything, I don't even see any difference in the damage they do me.The strategy in this is probably even worse than the combat, let's start with DD1, all the maps could be built up in lots of different ways, some ways a lot better than others, all of the good looking builds worth trying, if you're smart (or you just have ridiculously high stats for the level) you can just build up and sit back to watch it perfectly working, or just grab a cup of tea. Now let's look at DD2, there are two obvious builds for every map, put turrets on the walls of the map and walls to block them off as they die, or just put turrets and walls on the obvious bits of the path. Both aren't really that different at all and no matter whether you chose the best out of the two possible decent builds or not, all the towers need constant supervision, repairing, fighting and all that. There are also environmental traps (such as valves you turn to release smoke and damage the enemies) which you NEED to use, forcing a lot of players in one game, it's hard to play with just one friend, you end up on a public game packed with 7 year old idiots. All the towers also have huge like spaceboxes so you can't place a tower within a meter's range of another, making placing them properly difficult, in DD1 they just couldn't overlap, unless they were monk or hunter traps. In short, there's no real strategy, you just need to run around like a headless chicken attending to your towers and activating environmental traps.Let's move on to looting, this isn't that main a thing in both but it gets a verrrrrrrrrrrry annoying in DD2, you get a new, better weapon almost every wave and upgrading them does barely anything to the stats, all considered (In DD1 you need to upgrade your weapon to do good damage, which in my opinion is good). There is an option to automatically collect loot but it fills up the few bag spaces you have in DD2 very fast and you find yourself sorting good from rubbish after every level. There aren't many different models the items can spawn with either, so you will probably find someone with the same weapon as you in a public tavern. There's also only like 20 different pets in DD2 but tonnes in DD1 and in DD1 EVERYTHING spawns in different sizes and colours, nothing does in 2. This makes looting very bland. The items do spawn with different weights but this is broken so that heavier weapons do more damage per second, even with the same damage stats.Now on to DLC, there's a lot of better, more optional and reasonably priced DLC in the first game, such as different characters with unique abilities but in DD2 it's inventory space for £20, More items and IN GAME FREAKING CURRENCY(!!!!!!!!!!!!??????????) for £30, how reasonably priced, fun and worth it this is (sarcasm BTW), oh and if anyone wants it's £17 for a costume pack on special offer!Summary:DD2= rubbishDD1= awesomeIf you like the look of this then just play DD1, you'll have a much better time.

								Bought this game and now it's free.I don't care if I received in-game currency for my purchase, that was supposed to be a bonus with the purchase, not a hidden purchase as it now seems it was.As far as gameplay goes, I loved this game for a while, but it becomes a gear grind if you want to play into the really high tier nightmare modes. Then finding a game with anyone else is impossible so you have to grind every class to be able to solo, or just play Squire because they're the only class that really needs no other class's help to solo.  Every other class can not solo end game well enough without the best of the best gear, and even then, it's probably impossible.So, broken classes (Squire is better than everything by far) + a broken business model (charging people for the game for over a year and then suddenly making it free to play, prioritizing skins and selling in-game currency over actually progressing the game to a conclusion and taking it out of Early Access) + broken servers (lagging in my private tavern, connecting to the public tavern happens once in a while) = not recommended.

								*GASP*! A new hero! Stuck behind a grindy pay-wall.......... I supported this game forever ago with a lot of cash and I have to grind or pay $10 USD for the new content. I love DLC in early access games <3. Before you charge me for new content, polish your netcode and engine.I still stand behind the idea that you'll get your time's worth of entertainment here. That being said, after leveling one or two characters, there isn't any reason to return to the game. It's not the lack of content, but the lack of well-polished content. Loot is confusing and clunkier than it was before, and there quickly becomes no incentive to play early-encountered maps. You'll still enjoy your time here, even if that time is less than 20 hours.--- ORIGINAL REVIEW ---TLDR: Great MMO-Tower Defense-RPG romp with enough content on offer to justify the purchase as-is. An incredible experience. Well worth the fee to enter the Alpha. I'd be freaking enraged if the developers did not make true on their word and finish the game with the features they had discussed. But, I wouldn't feel like I was out any money if they didn't. I've had so much fun with the content on offer, and there is a ton of it. About 10 hours to beat the campaign with each character (for a total of 40), and you will not be max level by then.After that, there are still about 4 more gameplay modes that your characters can enjoy that help level them to the cap! In addition, the Free-To-Play model being implemented here is solely for skin customizations and inventory space. (Spend your gems on the inventory space) Skins can be unlocked through random crate drops a la Counter-Strike, but those can be opened with tokens earned in-game. These Wyvern Tokens aren't too grindy to earn. All-in-all I've had a ton of fun with it! I'm working on a playthrough right now. Give it a watch if you want to see what it's all about! -

Early Access Review
								So after 38 hours of gametime and three lv.25 characters i think it's finally time for a review to give you my opinions about the game in it's pre-alpha stage.So to begin with i'm gonna say that i really loved DD1 but it feels like i won't give DD2 a chance if i would compare the two to eachother, especially when DD2 is just in it's alpha stage. So i just left DD1 behind and seeked out all the great potential from DD2 (Comparing DD1 to DD2 will be more fair when DD2 gets an actual release)-So the game can be played both solo and with other players, i've been playing solo more or less all the way and i haven't encountered any problems that way (My experience when playing with others was just frustrating, lack of communication and semi-afk people)But i would say that the game feels very smooth with it's wonderful design, a very toony feel which i absolutely love within games. It sorta feels like it's a key enhancer for this game.I've encountered some small freeze lags here and there (especially when i upgrade items), but it's really no big of a deal. I wouldn't expect anything else from a pre-alpha game.The way you choose maps in the game so far so is to me a big mystery.. I don't think anyone would say it's a very appealing to replay old levels at a little harder difficulty.. It becomes boringThrow some ideas at trendy how to make ^above^ better.But let's just cut to the end,Do i recommend this game?: Of course i do! It's a fun addictive game that you can enjoy for many hours to come. And i have a big trust in Trendy :)I wanna throw in some words from another review i read before: If Trendy follows their heart it's bound to become good, Very much true!			"

								At the moment and possibly in the future I can't recomend this game.It's never good to load into a sequel and the first thought to have is ""Man I really wanna play the first one again..."". Don't get me wrong this isn't a bad game or anything it's just not as fun as the first one and a lot of that has to do with the littering of real money pay options and the inclusion of a live tavern. I can't tell you how hard it is to get into this game when you're surrounded by people who are already way into the game, it feels like I'm a scrub and there's no point in continuing the journey.In fact of the three times I've launched and attempted to play two of the times I just logged out because I was surrounded by players speaking an entirely different game language than I was used to and felt just overwhelmed by the amount of new. Not just players, or a new game, but even exploring a cluttered hub with large notifications yelling at me that 'this part is unlocked after XXXXX is beat!' was all just way overwhelming coupled with a new UI that feels like a mix between a moba style skill layout and a diablo II ability clone I was just constantly overwhelmed.The third time I played I made it two minutes before I ended up loading DD1 and playing on a much more comfortable and smaller scale. I may return since it is so early but it's just so different from the game I fell in love with and I know the only way I can solidly play this is if a friend drags me along.			"

								For an early access game, it's largely in great shape compared to other games that are either completely unfufilled games or broken.  The fact that it's F2P is even more amazing.  Absolutely nothing about the game is P2W.  Almost everything purchased with cash is cosmetic.  Lots of potential for people who came from DD1, and with continued support from Trendy will be a huge success.  The game isn't without it's issues or quirks.  Thankfully the support staff either here, the discussion boards or the official forums are all quick to help. A lot of the issues I've seen or have known others to encounter are largely quality of life issues and don't cause the game to be completely unplayable.  Considering the cost to buy the game, there isn't much of a reason why anyone shouldn't download it and give it a try.			"

								Tsk Tsk Tsk, Before You Make any Assumption As to why Im writing this review after only playing for half an hour, Just know That I have played Dungeon Defenders 1 Across Many Platforms for many hours.I gave Dungeon Defenders II a Thumbs down  for the time being Because as of right now Trendy..Your going a little try-hard.I believe they should have stuck closer to their roots, Dungeon Defenders was and awesome game for what it was. They Kinda Moved away from that to make more money it seems adding this coin system to upgrade weapons and buy weapons alike like we saw with their Dungeon Defenders Eternity. Also, The unlocking of maps is awful. It's really aggrivating.  They way the enemies work along with how you level up and your starting strength alone is too OP. Why AM I Hitting 100's as a lvl 1. This Gives the Leveling up a slower pace and not much of an increase. You rely too much on your armor in this one as well with the added Relic's to be the most effiecient way of boosting tower health and strength.This game needs a lot of tweaking and i would even say a complete make-over. At least when it comes to Game play.The game looks good, The game itself is bad however.			"

								After seeing all the recent negative reviews, I think a positive one is in order.  I've had this game since the pre-alpha days and it for the most part, has been a joy to play.  I'm sure that some have had issues with the gameplay, however, I haven't seen a game developer like Trendy, take the opinions and suggestions of the community, and put them into practice.  To those who question why the game is still in alpha, it will soon come out for full release.  Would you rather receive an inferior product that only took months to create, or get a quality one that may have taken years to create.  Be patient, it's coming.  Great job Trendy, and I'm looking forward to the HUGE update coming soon.			"

								Unlike it's predecessor, Dungeon Defenders 2 features a bunch of new qualities -- such as separate mana for abilities and towers, and a huger tavern.Now, the graphics may be more attractive than the first game, but this DD2 quickly gets downgraded with it's slowly slithering 'pay to play' standards. Costumes in the previous one were able to be achieved through quests and fun game types, whereas in DD2 you must pay. Also, to open chests which include 'oh-so-rare' loot, you must buy keys. It's a good tower defense game, but definitely something that gets old faster than Dungeon Defenders 1 -- you'll get bored from the inability of accessing cooler items in the game.			"

								All these negative reviews as of the trials update, i can guarentee that every single one of those people were reliant on pure PDT and afk = win.Sure as of now the game is quite a bit harder even on chaos 1 as the towers are garbage without a medallion or totem in the defence slot, so the game has basically gone back to the good old pre-PDT days where you NEED to do something otherwise it's a loss, laziness doesn't get rewarded with this update, once you get some points into the ascension tree it all starts to become rather easy.

In DD1 I had a buddy that would spam ever mage tower and monk aura, while he stood there. DD2 makes you actually participate in fighting. Currently you get 4 towers and 3 skills (Not counting heal skill). I'm not sure about the level curve since I am only level 15 but I can say I am enjoying this game more then DD1.			"

								It seems to me like Trendy has no respect for peoples time, and this update proves it . The game now feels like an insurmountable grind compared to what it used to be. You spent how many months doing how many runs for that perfect relics with the right passives at a high enough power level? Well congratulations, now your time has been completely thrown out of the window and we hope you enjoy your arthritis. Has the trial update brought some pros? Of course it has, but with it, it has brought just as many, if not more cons. If I wanted to mindlessly grind gear and work on paragon levels I would just go play Diablo 3.Early access or not, it seems to be a trend in the development cycle of the game where they just throw♥♥♥♥♥♥at the wall and see what sticks and that to me seems like a very poor development process. With their blatant disregard for peoples time and effort in previous game builds, I cannot recommend this game. Stick with the first dungeon defenders if you want a unique and actual fun game like this.			"

								The gameplay is really fun, and the whole thing would be enjoyable. However, if you try to play with friends, it's a complete nightmare. Starting or ending a mission, you have to wait about five minutes for the game to find a session. It's just nightmarishly long, and the missions aren't long enough to make that amount of wait time seem inconsequential. Additionally, when inviting friends to play over steam, often time they would be unable to join and we'd have to retry constantly. And a couple times, we'd all be in game and suddenly I'd be shifted into a solo private game for no discernable reason. It was just awful. If they can ever fix those weird issues, I'll change my recommendation status. But until then, this is basically unplayable.			"

								Dungeon Defenders use to be a simple, rpg-ish, tower defense game that you can play with a group of friends on a couch or online. Now, it is online only. In DD1, with a push a button, you can see your tower set. Push another button, you can repair or heal yourself/towers. Now, you have to push a few more buttons to repair or heal. I like the look of the game and the fact you can build towers without needing to be there anymore but the tower placing, equipment, and attacking are completely different. Control tutorials dont change when a controller is connected. So good luck finding out how to ready up or build towers with a controller when they say hit G. I don't recommend this yet but have high hopes they don't require us to buy gems to progress like most F2P games.			"

								TLDR: Its not pay to win, its just pay to be able to have anything worthwhile.  Can it be played without paying? sure, but I remember the days when this stuff we pay for now was referred to as unlockable content already in the game. YOU PLAYED TO UNLOCK STUFF BECAUSE THAT WAS HALF THE FUN.  Game is bleh, I dont recommend. You will have more fun playing the first one even though its loot system is broke.Between Xbox 360 and the pc version I played the original dungeon defenders well over 1000 hours combined, it was a game I absolutely loved.  Then the announcement came for dungeon defenders 2 and I was all giddy and super excited for its release.  Then I read that it would be free to play, and my excitement turned to ""meh"".  Because we all know what free to play really means. But i remained optimistic, so I bought the game a couple months ago.  I must say I am incredibly disapointed.  Every time I turn around I am bombarded with treyarchs ""give us money"" free to play philosophy and im tired of it.  Wanted an extra bag? gotta pay for it, want another hero slot? gotta pay for it. want some costumes? gotta pay for it.  Most recently however is, want to get super rewards? give us money for a chance at a loot wheel.  As for the game itself, meh, levels are not very fun, balance between champions and towers are just bad.  The progression system could have been awesome, but it turned out to be ""meh"" as well.  Playing with friends is boring, one person sets everything up, everyone else just pulls out their dps champions while the tower person just sits in a corner watching every one else mindlessly shoot enemies in their lane, and this is nightmare 4 im talking about, the current hardest difficulty.This game is nothing like the first one, its been in development for some 50 freaking years and they've got very little content to show for it. I cant recommend this game. Maybe the developers will pull magic out of their♥♥♥♥♥and actually put out a decent game but at the moment its a money sink and nothing more.			"

								Here I'll give you my opinion on the game.I never played DD1, and I got this game 7 months ago. I did help Trendy beta test a game they were working on (Monster Madness Online) internally, so I did learn a lot about how they work, and manage things, ect.First things first, you can expect constant updates and changes if they don't like how something is working, this company works very hard on their games, and they aren't here to just sell the game in early access and then throw up their hands and stop working on it. This is one game you can buy and know for sure that things will always be getting added/changed, ect.So what can you expect yourself to be doing in this game? Well at the beginning you will be doing the Campaign, it's basically a long tutorial with a bit of a story to it, unless you/your group fails the zone, you won't be replaying the same area more than once during this Campaign, you will amass a ton of loot and after each zone, I like to replace/sell whatever items I've gotten. Once you've finished the campaign you will be doing ""higher difficulty"" zones, this is the worst part of the game according to most people I've spoken with, because it's literally just grinding for gear and replaying the same zones, so that can be a negative depending on the person.What customization do you have in the game? Right now there are 4 classes, you can build each class in two ways, you can focus your stats & spheres (explained later) on your hero doing the bulk of your damage, or you can focus your stats on your Towers doing the bulk of your damage. What are spheres? These are kind of like ""talents"" from other games, where once you reach a certain level you unlock a new sphere slot, this can buff your skills, your mana regeneration, and a bunch of other things. There's also a new feature recently added into the game, it's kind of like ""transmogrification"" from WoW, this allows you to change what clothing your character is visibly wearing, without losing stats of your actual items.Extra bits I forgot to mention: You can not change your skills, whatever class you choose has 4 ""hero"" skills (like maybe an AoE spell, or a bomb that slows enemies down, ect. Each class also has 4 ""building/tower"" skills, so you may have a Fireball turret, an Ice Beam Turret, mines, ect. Again, you don't have an option to change any of these 8 skills, but each class has different skills. Building requires green mana, which you get from killing monsters and running over the green crystals they drop, and at the end of each round you open a chest that gives you a lot of green mana to help upgrade/make/repair towers. There is a limit on how many towers your group can place in a map, however it's a fairly reasonable amount. And then there's blue mana which is for your hero's skills, these drop much more frequently than green mana, and you will use whatever amount a skill requires if you cast it.So that's about it, I hope this helped somebody make their decision on buying the game, I purposely skipped some mechanics in the game because it would take too long to explain. Overall I'd recommend picking up the game, it's pretty cheap and you can always be expecting updates and changes, and Trendy is a company that does listen to player feedback quite regularly.			"

								Worse than Dungeon Defenders I.The new loot system sucks and UI is terrible.Difficulty system sucks as well. You are stuck with ""easy"" and ""normal"" till you are high level - which means, every game is too easy to even care. Why would you play a game which you can beat with like... closed eyes? That's funny.I liked DD1 that there you had access to difficulties and maps you shouldnt be able to beat - but you could try! And if you managed you could get nice items - high risk, high reward - thats what was good about DD1 is no longer a part of DD2.For me - everything that made DD1 fun is gone in DD2.Instead of polishing everything in DD1 and adding new content(skills/towers/characters) they just re-designed the game to something unplayable.

								Dungeon Defenders 2 is in pretty playable condition for having the tag 'pre-alpha', and it is filled with a decent amount of content to keep coming back to. The Devs are constantly listening to what users what and are responding in a positive fashion. This game has to live up to the high standards of that Dungeon Defenders One, but i feel the game is on the right path. The loot system is much better than the 1st game series and the towers have a refreshing appeal, especially since you can now combine elements to increase damage or efficiency. It is a great game to play with friends, and hopefully the game will live up to the standards of Dungeon Defenders One.			"

								At first I'm talking about other people's responses to DD 2 and how DD 1 is with grinding compared to DD 2, so skip to paragraph 3 for the review.First of all, everyone seems to hate this leveling system. They say it's all grinding, and its stupid, and that DD 2 should be just like DD 1. Now heres the truth, these people just dont remember the beggining of DD 1. Sure you could beat the set of levels to proceed to the next 3, but guess what? Usally those levels were IMPOSSIBLE for your level! Sure Sure, you could say that you just needed skill in tower defense to win, but remember how you unlocked toweres? By grinding! Not just a little grinding, ALOT of ginding. For me atleast I thought it was alot of grinding. So then I play through the story, replaying the same levels over, and over again until I win. Then guess what? I was level 30, so all the challenges were♥♥♥♥♥♥♥IMPOSSIBLE! I had to gind to 50 to have a chanse at those. I went hell no, and downloaded the DLC. I invited my buddy over to play and guess what? It was impossible for a level 30. So you know what I did? I grinded my♥♥♥♥♥of. So please dont tell me DD 2 is a grind fest, because DD 1 beats it sooooo far out of the ballpark, it's in a whole new planet. All these people remember is the end game, but there was a incredibly long grind to victory.Now lets talk more about DD 2 way of handling levels. You start in the 1-3 level select. With my three characters it takes one game to unlock more levels, therefore in the 3-5 group. I play another game and I'm not there so I play an online match to get levels faster and boom I unlock another (this time set) of levels. See the way this works? The game is just helping you through the grind with you having to sometimes replay levels to level up, instead of giving you a level your 10 levels off beating, then you keep getting to the last wave and crying when you wasted 30 minutes of your life. Then I have to grind previous levels, then every level replay it until I'm stroung enough. This is more of a way to let you know if your stroung enough. Could it not force you to not play those levels... well yes but you'll die anyways so I dont really care.Now on to the review side of these DD 2 has some proublems. First I wish there was a story, but oh well it's only pre-alpha and it will be added later. (plus, who play DD 1 for the story any way?.) Next is the glitches. Theres a wierd teleporing all over the map/tavern glitch that keeps happening, but again it's in pre-alpha so what did you expect? Third point is that while weapons and shields change with loot, the armour never changes and I REALLY what this to change because I'm disencoureged to find armour when that new sword will be flaming, or that new staff have a crystal with mist around it. Kind of a knit pick but, it does effect how I play so I put it here. (plus this game is so good I don't have many knit picks, and im the biggest knit picker I know.) Lastly is a good and bad thing that won't apply to everyone. You have a character deck for who you can switch out in between waves like in DD 1, only the limit is 3. So if your like me and levels all 4 characters, say good bye to one or later when theres DLC but 2 other characters and cobine them with your left out choice. This may not affect most people because they have only one character, but I had to say good-bye to my monk... for now.Now the good things, aww yeah. Lets start with the obvious, the GRAPHICS ARE SO GOOD. I mean like INCREDIBLY good levels of good. Set this game to high and you won't be sorry. Also EVERYTHING look 10 times beter from background, to envirment, to the glourious loot, to my favorites the characters and enemys. My good good there so detailed, the goblins which are the weakest trash enemys of the game are so detailed, clearly someone spent countly mounths perfecting each design to make it just perfect. AND THIS IS IN PRE-ALPHA! Not even the full game yet!Next good thing is the level design. DD 1 was good, even amazing, but this is borderline pefection. I mean it there was some clearly good designers here. You all deserve a cookie, wait no a pie. Infact I'm coming to Trendy with pies for everybdy, unless there to busy prefecting more enemy's and loot. Next is the new lines that show the path of all the enemys. Thats right, theres no more comlaing that you lost because you didnt know a enemy ogre could go there, or a pack of colbots went another direction you didnt expect. (I HATE COLBOLTS! I take it back, goblins arn't all trash I take it all back.) The next thing amazing about this game is what was in my opinion, not that solid in DD 1, the combat. In DD 1 the combat was simple, press button alot in a swarm of enemy's and when you lose to much health (which im garunteeing you will in survival mode on mave 15) go and heal. The best thing about combat was the  ogers, but they were so slow you just have to back off while they attack and go in for the kill after the attack. Simple, and with a friend you could trick the AI shooting at him from both sides, and therefor confusing him making him turn around alot. Then the ninjas were stupid, would lose me all the time, and shouldnt be in DD 1 in the first place. In DD 2 It's much better. First off all death has a big consenquense. when you die your dead for a LONG while instead of 10 seconds, so dont ever die. Next healing costs alot of blue gems and takes a long time. So don't get hurt, because theres a consequense unlike the DD 1 where you wait 2 seconds to heal. The combat its self is more balenced so squire wont steal all the kills like in DD 1, and most importantly the enemy AI is good in combat. They are worthy opponets and running in with a sword to a giant lizard (forgive me I forgot there name.) Will hurt alot or kill you unles you sheild ALOT or back away at the right time, and shooting the lizards is just as hard because you'll have a arrow (or mana) vs acid the giant lizard is spitting. And thats just one enemy. Trust me, the AI is better.Next is the class balencing issues with DD 1, Squire is way to Over Powered, Wizard is Over Powered and has mana bomb, Monk is balenced with nothing good or bad about him, and huntess us Under Powered with long reloades. On the other hand DD 2 made everyone good in there own way, and the huntress is even one of the three people in my main deck.Next is the defenses themselves for each character are more balenced but if your solo, you need the wizards or squires blockades. The best thing about the new defenses this time is there alot more fun, like the guyser the sendes enyemes flying in the air for you to shoot. There really cool, and the huntress traps have way more ammo.I'm going to stop here because this review would go on forever but i'll start the conclusion. If you love DD 1 you'll love this game but remember, there is a little grinding that you may of forgot from all that time in the end game. If your new I would wait until this becomes free to play, with DLC on the way. I say this because there is no tutorial for newbies, however if your new and your friend is begging for  you to play now I HIGHLY recommend this. Play with ypur friend a little while and you'll soon get the game inside and out. I want to cut this short so message me if you have any questions about thing like level count, loot, ect. Hope this helped :) Thanks for reading!			"

Early Access Review
								Although I guess I can understand some of these reviews I still really have to disagree with the negativity out there.When I got DD2, I actually bought it when it was still $50. I did buy it on sale but then I found out that it went to free-to-play and I was a little upset. Except that they gave me one of the DLC worth the $50 price tag and then I was not upset as I had been properly compensated. The game is awesome and a lot of fun and I guess some people still don't understand Early Access. This game is still in Early Access as of writing this post. It's so much fun to play and I have gotten a couple of my friends to download it and not pay a dime and we have had a lot of fun. And none of them have griped about any of the paid-for content as free-to-play is awesome all on its ownSo what did I get with my $50 edition? well it's the Defender's Pack or something like that so it's not incredible. But it was enough for me to buy myself two extra inventory bags. Which are great. And I could buy a new character if I wanted to as well but i'm happy enough that the original 4 characters are FREE TO PLAY and you can make all 4 at once and they level all at the same time... and yes it does take a LONG time to build up enough Hero Coins to unlock more characters + slots which I do admit kind of sucks but honestly I love this approach.Yes there are some things that make the game very different if you pay for it. But that's actually something they did right. This game is FREE TO PLAY right now and I know i keep bringing it up but peopel seem to be overlooking that and having expectations for a SEQUEL which is FREE. If you like it enough you will pay for the DLC which means you get a full size demo in the hopes that you will just give them extra money to access content faster. Or, you could just keep playing FOR FREE and unlock everything that way. Maybe not costumes but who gives a♥♥♥♥♥♥ I haven't even bothered to check that.This game is great. There are NEW CHARACTERS (in the last game there were a lot of 'characters' but every single one was a clone of the original 4 except with SOME different abilities. Which really blew chunks in the last game). It's free and VERY accessible even to free-to-play players. And it's so much fun especially with friends and guess what they all have it in their library too because it is free to play.			"

								Just remember this is an Early Access Review and does not refer to the game in it's completed state.Dungeon Defenders, the game before the sequel, in it's entirety was completely awesome and great.When the game started, there wasn't a whole lot of DLC and stuff added to it just yet. The difficulty of the game for starters was not easy and it took time to learn how to play.The same can be said about Dungeon Defenders II currently. It's difficult, it isn't easy to learn, and there isn't ANY DLC just yet. However, this is currently an Early Access Game and it isn't the end of it's expansion. Currently I would recommend this game to be played with friends and you will have a fun time exploring the new maps, learning the new mechanisms, and enjoying the overall gameplay with friends.This game singleplayer is not recommended at all because it requires alot of strategy and time to understand the complexity of the new set of towers and defenses, finding out what works for you. You only get 3 heroes overall per map (unless there is more in later levels or something) and you can only do certain maps and difficulties in a particular level range so power-leveling your characters is not really that much of an option.Having more people on your team also gives you a better chance at an item bonus so working with 3 other people aside from yourself is the most ideal way to make it through every map and level range. This game is a great multiplayer game and is far superior to Dungeon Defenders when it first started out. It is more balanced and fair and it makes the game a little more challenging and competitive.Anyone who does not like this game only doesn't like it for the fact that the game isn't done.This is an Early Access Game and it isn't completely finished. They haven't even brought out the PvP just yet and they are already complaining about the Co-Op. All the heroes have not been released yet and it certainly makes for an interesting game to watch come into development.Highly recommended.			"

They freaking nerf towers again... Well it doesnt feel like a tower defense game and this is what i was hoping from this game.Also the loot system is so messy in this one ugh.But wait there is one cool thing in the game: They have a broken new Inventory (colors off items in the bag doesnt match the items) and they worked so long on this new cool inventory !!! wiiii now we can all be so happy...so i will Uninstall this ugly game that you deliverd to us.Thank you for listening so good to your community !! keep it up soon you have the servers for yourself.

Chaos 2 is freaking hard except if you follow the 1 meta and it still give you lvl 46 items wich are totally useless!!! it make just no sense at all... last time they released a community vote for the next content was literraly months ago, patch are slow as hell and just break the game more.before the patch i could solo NM4... now i cant even do Chaos 2 and it only drop lvl 46 items...

								Was really excited for the new update to come out until I tried it out on my characters. All of my characters are level 50 but now they all feel like level 5 with how bad the reset hit them. My once fearsome attack character that could dish out a crap load of shots per second is now reduced to roughly three shots per second. They ""reinbursed"" us for all the upgrades and such we spent our in game money on with the new shards however when I revealed all of my shards, they were all garbage stat upgrades like ""2% chance to douse your target"" I got roughly five of those in the small batch they gave me. The new update ruined my builders, attackers, and experience for the game. If someone new is coming in then I could see the appeal with being able to work with the new system but for a long time Dungeon Defenders player, this unfortunately has made me turn away from the game. Possibly for good.			"

								This game is in a bad state right now, I recommend you not waste your time.I really liked the first Dungeon Defenders, and I wanted to like this but despite my best efforts trying, I couldn't find any part of this game that I liked.This is a hero defence through-and-through, a slightly modified third person shooter. Every tower has been nerfed to uselessness. As an TPS it's pretty bland and boring.Progression is broken. Especially with the most recent update. Shards (upgrades) that you need to progress drop from the hardest difficulties, and even then they're locked behind RNG walls, requiring you to grind endlessly for little to no progress. Gear usually drops one difficulty level below you, meaning more mindless grinding for little gain.If you want a tower defence, play anything other than this.If you want an TPS, play anything other than this.I hate to say it but this game is bad, and from the direction Trendy has been going it's unlikely to improve, move on and don't bother looking back.

								This is coming from a DD1 fan who played it for a few years non stop.Yes it's not exactly like the original, but thats the good thing about it, who would want an exact clone of DD1 after all this time? Now I am not saying that DD1 is bad, It's brilliant, but personally I think DD2 shines where DD1 failed to do so.Yes it is a bit cheesy that they are selling the same charachters again for dlc, but remember, it IS free to play.If you have played this game when it was pay to play, let me reasure you that it is almost a different game, everything is alot smoother and flows better.One of the only things I am dissapointed in is the lack of upgrading items and pets at low level, which in my opinion let players get used to it before choosing a pet was the most important thing in the game.Another is the lack of harder difficulties on low level players, I love a challenge and was dissapointed to see that the hardest difficulty for my noob mage was Normal. What happened to trying to beat The Deeper Well on Insane level 1 char only?This game is definantly worth getting since it is an amazing game, if i were to put a price on it, I would say around $15-$20 AUD. but since its free there is no reason not to give this a spin.

Early Access Review
 Dungeon Defenders II  review:Dungeon Defenders II. The sequel to Dungeon Defenders I. Last game, the focus was a Tower Defence with First-Person Combat on the side. This game, it's the opposite. It's a mix of Sanctum 2, and a bland MMORPG game. Not necessarily a bad combination, at least in my opinion. You can either go in, collecting and equipping items only for boosting your damage, instead of focusing on the other aspect of the game, Tower Defence. Towers, they do not do as much as would seem viable for a game which has them as one of the two subjects. Only barricades are actually needed. You can go into a match and be able to just place a few walls here and there, on chokepoints or in corridoors, then take out the whole enemy squadron using nothing but your 'Wizardly Stick of Purple Flames and♥♥♥♥♥♥. Or, well, that's my experience. You can have geat on yourself to only help make your Towers and Defences more powerful. Health. Damage. Range. Speed. Those sorts of upgrades. Minor numbers, however, you will not be seeing a Catapult dealing 203 Octillion damage within 2.7 seconds (approx). You will mainly be using your weapons instead of your skills, too, I actually have forgotten that they even exist in my few latest missions. Unless, well, you are too weak. Then, they will become useful. Otherwise, the damage does not scale too well, my weapons are truly able to take care of all problems. Weapons aside, other parts of the game include:+ Skill Trees.+ Private and Public HUBs.+ Matchmaking system (not the best at all).+ Daily Missions.+ ""First Win"" modifiers.+ NPC merchants.+ A bunch of maps and difficulties.+A Terraria crossover.- Not much endgame content.- A really bad UI in the Inventory menu, especially trying to sell all your loot.- Inventory being spammed by items which were useless, even 5 levels below.The RPG element, it's... Satisfactory. Put the bar, well, not too high though. It's not yet finished and the minor flaws, are a lot in number. The gameplay, though repetitive, it is alright enough for me to carry on a little longer. I recommend playing with a friend, however, as the matchmaking system is, well, about as basic as a stick and stone. Sure, you can say how strong players must be in order to be able to join the lobby, but there's not much else to it. But, the levelling and progression aren't that great or a real ""wow cool"" moment. They're more of an ""ok..."" moment. You can't care less. Especially while you're in a mission, and reach a certain level when you unlock something new, then there's this huge black box which takes up a lot of the screen. Disturbing. Unneeded. The weapons, I have mixed feelings about. There should be a way to filter things when in your inventory, from best to worst. Or, only let us have collected some real goodies instead of the same trashy ring from level 2 or so we still get on one of these endgame missions, for whatever reason. Just, let us have the useful gear when we need it. Not some OP gear before we reach that level. Not some weapon which deals feathercuts in terms of damage. Endgame. Endgame. What do you mean, endgame? There is not much endgame. There is repeating missions, however. But no real endgame. There's harder difficulties. Those are fine. But something which is just unfairly difficult but actually accomplishable, is not. I want to feel I have done enough Radiation damage to take out a good 20x15x30xkm blast in the planet, while I am trying to survive with all of my thoughts and mind on the task. Something which is a real kicker. You either are dying all the time, or only die because you fell off the map because of the very slippery movement. Not much inbetween. Either Zeus or a peasent. The closest experience to such a thing in Dungeon Defenders II is going to be a Nightmare mode mission, or the gear, or the pets. This brings me onto my next point: pets. It's an RPG. There will be pets. You can either buy pet eggs using paid currency, or find them from some more difficult and later missions in the game, then hatch those eggs. There's different eggs, each bringing a different theme of creature. From dragons to cats. All pets have their own powers, damage types, rarities, really what you could expect. They're not too great when  you first get them. Their at their hatchling/junior stage, and have not been evolved or powered up in any way. This costs time, and money. The latter is not a problem at all, as you can easily grind a ton of gold within 2 hours. I have actually not needed to grind for gold at any stage in the game so far, actually. In order to evolve your pet, you must first fill up its 'Affection' bar, which is how often or how much you've been using that pet in missions. After the evolution, your pet will grow up a bit, changing the looks and stats. It's a simple system but I don't mind it at all in the game, just seems a bit bland what you could do with a pet, as they do not deal that much damage, though, they are not meant to, they are meant to act as a support for your character.Characters. There's classes: Squire, Monk, Huntress, Apprentice (The main ones), with some others which are more difficult to unlock. Some are more poweful in certain situations than others. The Apprentice has stronger towers than the Squire, however, the trade of lower base HP for them, is the price. The Monk has some powerful towers, such as ones which automatically damage enemies unlucky enough to walk into them. And do they damage. They damage a ton. He also can play a Supportive class as he has a healing tower to help back up your noob teammates if they die too quickly or too often. The Squire is a tank and can deal damage relatively nicely. Just what you could expect. Not much more to talk about. The Huntress is a ranged bow-user. A Ranger or Archer. Good damage. Good range. Overall, the characters are all used for different situations, and they deal with them in different ways.That's all I have for now. Potential. Not yet met.~Wilkowaty			"

Early Access Review
 DUNGEON DEFENDERS 2 I personally CANNOT STOP PLAYING THIS GAME. To be honest, I was extremely skepticle on whether or not it would be worth my $14.99 for, and it's not (Maybe), but I got it off another site Steam keeps blocking with a Four-Pack for $2.49, completely worth it. I did however buy the Collectors Edition to show my support for this beautiful game. But enough bantering, here's the Game in a Nutshell. MECHANICS Dungeon Defenders 2 plays like a Tower Defense with a complete twist of Four characters you play in 3rd person, all with their own Abilities and Towers, Strengths and Weaknesses. Your 4 Heroes are The Apprentice (WHY NOT CALL IT THE MAGE?), Squire (AGAIN, WHY NOT CALL IT A KNIGHT?), Huntress, and Monk. All have their own good Synergies with the other Heroes.The Apprentice is a good Form of DPS, Squire is a Tank, Huntress makes Traps that Synergize well with all other Heroes, and the Monk uses Buffs and Debuffs for your Team. ENDGAME This game probably has a lot of Life ahead of it, despite being in Alpha for a year, the Devs listen to their Community, and have made the Game extremely long for anyone looking to do a Completionist run on it. OVERALL REVIEW This game is Beautifully made, but make sure you have a good enough computer for it, sometimes the particles can make your game lose framerate. All in all, buy the game, either on Steam to support them or get the Value price of 2.49 on a site steam keeps blocking, which I recommend. 11/10 would buy four pack again on a site that Steam keeps blocking because the site sells games for very low prices and is trusted... (See my Profile page for the Site name, because Steam blocks the name.)			"

YouTube™ Video: Dungeon Defenders 2 falling through ""tavern"" without models or textures 

			Views: 83		

			This is by far the first time and I have to restart the game every second time or so that I get into the start area because this happens time and time again.		

 That aside the gameplay so far to me has been fun and I like that you can just swap heroes and have a deck. I wish the deck of heroes had more importance though. For a free game it's a solid tower defence but it feels unfinished even without the bugs. When the game has been improved and/or the game is finished I'll update my review.			"

								So very minimal gameplay at time of writing this. Only played the first few maps. There is a fair few bugs, which unless you can identify them, it will stop your progress (enemies glitched inside of walls in small corners, death seems to disable the 'ready up' button, etc)I also noticed the price of DLC, and holy crap! There should be a way to earn them in-game or something, not flog out up to $50USD just for some skins and a title...Other than that, gameplay is basically left MB = attack (can be held for infinite attacks), right MB (hold down) = bigger attack.Easy difficulty is super easy and Normal is basically an instant match loss (from the times I tried it). Seems a tad unbalanced.As current, I can not recommend this game, due to repetitive and far too simple gameplay and super expensive DLC.----------------------------------------------------------------------------I must say though, I LOVE the weapon designs!

								First I must say the gameplay is very fun and I love the graphics. However, the lobby system, logging on, just connection to the game in general is the worst I have encountered in gaming. I will click on a map to go to and it will tell me it is searching, then as if I never selected anything at all I am apparently not in a que/loading up any map and I have to reselect one. After that, it will tell me that too many multiplayer requests have been made and I must wait before trying to do anything again. I CANNOT DO ANYTHING IN THIS GAME. I have played this game for 4 hours and less than one of them was actally gameplay.			"

								I was an avid Dungeon Defenders 1 player and loved so many things about that game.  Dungeon Defenders 2 is a far cry from a sequel to do it justice.  While 2 does have its few improvements, most of what they have tried to do and the changes they have made just fall well short of 1.I do have to say that I PAID for early access and now this game has become Free To Play which I think is not at all a good thing.  Cheated with no reward.Comparisons of 1 and 2:-The size, scale, and scope of the levels are very dissapointing compared to 1.  The maps are small wiith no real options for strategy, just put down big towers and hit the mobs as soon as they exit the doors or just barricading the crystal.  Towers seem too big and bulky on most maps.-Character depth and selection is so much less than 1.  Why do so many changes and break a great stat and equipment system?  Less skills, less stats, less customization, less options, big part of what made 1 great which is gone in 2.-Sloppy developement in a lot of ways.  Parts of the game, which were disabled from early beta, have just been abandoned in place, or left not working and broken.  Glaring glitches, major errors, updates that break the game, cumbersome control and gameplay (ex. can't use controller due to faulty button mappping on programmer side), major lag and sluggishness on normal game operations and loading which suggests a bare minimum approach to developement.  I would say that they have a long way to go before this early access build is anything like Dungeon Defenders 1.  I don't feel the experience is anywhere near as good.  While I would love to help develope this game towards that direction, I don't think Trendy's direction is a good one at the moment. "

								I loved Dungeon Defenders 1. It was fun, funny and very easy to handle everything.In DD2... well I was utterly dissapointed. I only played 15 minutes and I know that if you read this you will think to yourself... ""You didn't try the game at all! Your review sucks"" I could care less to be honest. The only reason I only played 15 minutes is because it was all I wanted to give the game. In DD1, movement and everything else was so smooth. Sure this is still Early Access but still this was not fun for me to see that the game I utterly loved got turned into this. I feel like interface, options and simply everything is lacking in some aspect.I will probably try some other day but right now, this is not the game I expected. I hope this can be made into a better game even if you have to buy it. Put DD1 and just add better maps, mobs and items, thats all this game needs.			"

								Fantastic game i waited so long for it to come out! when i first saw it go up on there site i had to buy it. The games scaling does get a little weird first two maps you are doing pretty well against the waves then all of a sudden you get to your 3 map and BAM it hits you. The learning curve is kinda weird for this game but once you have it down it the game curve seems to smooth out a lot. The new sphere system is really cool and i REALLY hope they expand more on it than it is right now because it is extremely small and the uber spheres seem to be a little lengthy in obtaining. Long story short the game is fun, game curve is a little weird, talent system is pretty decent, item upgrade system which i didnt mention sucks due to the amount of gold and gear you need to sink into it, another thing i didnt mention is how cool the combos are but sometimes in higher level stuff they feel really needed and you cant do high level content without them. All and all great game i have high hopes for this "

Early Access Review
								Dec-12-2014Time Played: 26-HoursPre-Alpha Review (Patch 1.1)From the view of an Aprentice main with mid-lvl huntress/monk----TL;DR at the bottom----*There are plenty of reviews giving a Pro/con list for this game in comparison to DD1, so this is my take on DD2 as is, and where it seems to be going.Initial Thoughts - This is not DD1. Hands down, the hardest part of this game is other people. You can't throw down your towers without reason, you have to communicate(esp. for Hard-mode), and plan out a ""strategy"" which at the moment is basically Lightning aura/Gyser/Ice Tower and a Boost aura(there are other combos that work of course). Sure you can add on some towers that synergise with those as well, but that is the core layout that many people are running. (Squire - cannon/Apprentice- earth are the best additions)  ---Edit: They fixed a bug with lightning aura, so it's not as op now. However, the gyser/lightning is still a strong combo. Furthermore,  I'm glad they're willing to make changes, I wouldn't want just a reskinned DD1. Because lets face it, if you want DD1, play DD1. Any re-skin they do will always pale in comparison to nostalgia. As for me, I'm loving where they seem to be going, and hope they implement new ideas that make DD2 look like, what DD1 wanted to be.----------------------------------------------------------------------------Towers/Classes - With all the negative things being said, I still think having synergy between towers is a plus. Yes, it does somewhat limit gameplay at the moment, but, it creates some purpose to playing with other classes/using various towers together. it just needs some tweeks in the way it's implemented atm. Remember, Pre-alpha. Currently, I can think of 1-2 optimal builds for a map/character(excluding legendaries that buff certain towers and may make them very valuable). that's extreemly boring in the long run, and limits the replayablility of the game. *More towers, combos, and specable talents would open this up some, because currently the Meta for a good team-based build seems to be - Apprentice? Max the ice towers chance to freeze, place ice towers Monk? Max lightning aura dmg, place lightning aura's and boost aura'sHuntress? Max the dmg the next atk does to a doused target. Or, If you want to go single target dmg, Dmg+ for target dist./ AA Full charge chance. Either way, place gysers.Squire? (haven't played squire, so no idea) Cannons are rediculous, as are balistas. ----So, why do I reccomend the game?----It has potential, a lot of potential. Remember, this is Pre-Alpha. They're still working out the kinks, and adding in a ton more content, this game, as is, is the foundation with a skeletal structure for what's to come, and it's shaping up very nicely. At the moment, it's meh. Not amazing, but not worth a thumbs down. IMO the game looks a lot more promissing than DD1, it both looks better, and has a more intuitive UI in place. I'm loving it so far. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------Suggestions for the game - . More than 4 towers per character. But you can only chose 4 to bring into a map. . Improve lvl'ing experience. The game really starts 15+ when you have all your towers, but takes a while to get to depending on solo/group play. . Lower chances for green chests. . . 1 non-green chest in ~70-80 runs is rediculous, and it was a blue. . Item Drop chance not dependent on # of players in the map, but on difficulty of the map. . . . Stat re-roll option for items. (i.e. Changing M.Def -> def). More Weapon options. . Clan option in-game . Improved UI/Overlay. Improved Matchmaking. lvl25+/++ and all challenge modes should only be able to be played by 1 of your characters, no Hero Deck option, unless in private play. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------TL;DR - This is not DD1. If you're dissapointed it's not just like DD1, play DD1. . . but you'll be missing out.TL;DR V.(Patch 1.1 Pre-Alpha)  -Thumbs neutral, at the moment it's ok, but has a lot more potential than DD1 IMO. Hardest part of the game is learning to communicate, and strategize. They made multiplayer mean something, so don't be a 1-man army in a group of 4. ----Currently 7/10, could easily be 9/10 - 10/10 with some minor tweaks by Launch. If you're on the fence, waitlist it, hopefully the upcoming improvements will push you over the edge =PIf not, it'll be Free-To-Play upon full release. . . whenever that is.			"

								They took everything that made the first one interesting or good and threw it out the window so they could create a F2P game. They stripped the depth from each of the character classes so that they could flood the game with more character classes, or maybe it was because they could not balance more than 4 towers per class.I am disgusted by the game. I thought the flood of DLC heroes was annoying in the first one, but that game was at least fun and at $14.99 for the first go around a few DLC heroes were worth it.This game is less about the strategy and more about the bang things with your hero.

Early Access Review
								It's not a great game and honestly it's a step back from the original. However, DunDefToo does grow on you a bit. Finding rare loot and pets feels nice... but loot is so overabundant that you stop caring about anything that isn't mythic/legendary. The game has an auto-collection feature but it doesn't let you choose what is collected/left behind. This means you gotta sift through the garbage to make sure you didn't miss a pet or pet food (they don't have an indicator on the screen/map to make them easy to track).The maps are all super boring, small, and mostly tight spaces. This is problematic because players and towers have collisions on them. So, the game gets crowded very quickly.Players get their own mana (currency for making/repairing/upgrading defenses) each round and it scales based on the player count. This is pretty nice and you can hand it off to the other players. Sadly, the game is totally anti-social. A single player can (like the first game) change their character to place additional defenses. The players also have a shared point limit for placing defenses. So, most of the time you either put up with bad placements or a single player doing everything. Basically, the game stops being tower defense and more about doing nothing or going combat focused (killing things yourself). This was a problem in the first game as well, but those maps were usually laid out in a way that a combat player still retained value.The pet system is god awful. You need special materials to ""evolve"" your pets... this sounds cool, but you need a resource called ""shellium"" which is obtained by letting pet eggs expire. This means you have to give up the chance at an interesting pet for some resources... and it takes 48 hours of sitting in your inventory to expire. Pets occupy their own special bag space, but eggs take up normal bag slots. Leveling up pets requires food... food does not stack with itself and therefore takes up extra bag space. The eggs can be hatched instantly between matches (in the tavern after you reach a certain level), but the timers could change. The timers used to be 8 hours and you can only hatch one at a time.So, your inventory will consist of the following:* Garbage items for upgrades/selling* Eggs* Cosmetic item boxes (requires premium or daily quests to open)... you'll get a lot of these.* Quality items (so you can use a different build.* Pet Food* Pet Food* Pet FoodIf you want to get materials to upgrade pets then you'll spend even more space on eggs.What the game sells for a premium:* Character slots (5$) - you get enough for each class at leas* Bags - 2-5$ depending on the size of the bag* Pet Bags - 2-3.5$ depending on the extra space you want* Costumes - 10$ or more for costumes* Pet Skins - 2$ or more depending on the costumeAt first glance the game seemed pretty fair (monetization-wise)... but with the inventory problems and sheer cost of space it began to feel greedy. Like they sacrificed usability to sell more things.Physics/Networking:So, the game is prolly hosted on a server rather than on the leader's system. This wouldn't be so bad, but the game's server is authoritative and the client has to obey. This means rubberbanding, or worse, the server sends you flying forward because it didn't notice that you had stopped. This means that input lag exists... and it's pretty awful. It's like they built the game on an old-school architecture without realizing that there are superior options.The game has large, blocky, collisions for everything. The characters slide (prolly input lag) around and so it's not uncommon to throw yourself off of a cliff. When your character attacks they move a little bit and the animation can't be canceled. This again, leads to the feeling of input lag (this is animation related rather than server related though). Basically, ranged attacks function better than melee attacks.Bottom line:It's a skinner box disguised as a game... a game with poor physics and networking. While it's free-to-play it has a lot of greedy elements hidden in there.			"

								I am a former player of DD1 for Xbox 360 I played it for about 2 or 3 months then I quit because of hackers that hacked for their own good not modding. This caused me to quit playing it. Then about a year later I overheard one of my friends talking about a second dungeon defenders coming out, I was esctatic <-(I think thats how its spelled who cares) suddenly the memories of all the fun I had in DD1 on Xbox came back, then i heard it was gonna be f2p that was the icing on the cake. So when it came out I looked it up on my steam acct and saw $20, because of the christmas sale, and I have to admit I was disheartened but I bought it anyways because of how much I loved the first one. Got on it and I just got warmth in my heart for how good of a PRE-ALPHA game it is. I have yet to find a bug and I even found some cool places in the tavern like walkway above the weapon shop. I was so shocked even to see an enemy get stuck behind the purple defense wall, first thing i thought was guess theres no such thing as a flawless game then next thing i know he just dies. i dont know if they integrated suicide for them like they did for players but something they did even stopped the enemies from getting stuck. so for all you haters if you dont like the game then dont buy it tell you i certainly dont like playing with people who just constantly dis a game for no reason.Thank you to the developers of this exceptional game i just hope it doesnt succumb to the same demise of the first			"

Early Access Review
								After about 65 hours into Dungeon Defenders II I am happy to report that they have been enjoyable. While the overall feel of DDII remains similar to that of its predecessor, there are some things that are notably different. To start with, if you want to use each of the heroes you will have to grind them up to the higest level (currently 25 although this is bound to increase as new content becomes available) individually as the maps are now broken up into level restrictive increments such as 1-3, 3-5, 5-10 etc. You are however able to use your higher level characters in lower level maps although they will be scaled down accordingly to the highest level for the current map. This can be time consuming but presumably it is to discourage solo play and encourage teamwork and synergy between community members. The maps feel a bit busier graphically and it was harder for me to wrap my head around tower placement than it was for the first game. In DD1, you were often able to place towers in such a way that you could guard multiple lanes with clever and well thought out placement. With DD2 placement feels more dictated and formulaic which takes a bit of fun away from the planning process.Currently at the time of this review (Dec. 2013) only one ""Stage"" is available. There is not yet a ""boss"" fight which was disappointing but the game is still in a pre-alpha state. There are synergies now between damage types and trap combinations which are interesting and give the players something to strive for in terms of teamwork.Item progression seems well planned, however the items have very little variation. There are generally two stats associated to one item, the first is determined by the item name (i.e.: ""Rapid Fire Gloves"" are guaranteed to have Defense Speed on them) and the second appears to be random. As a result of only 2 stats for each item, you are almost forced into choosing a specialization of 2 to be effective and are only looking for items with those 2 stats on them for the majority of the game.  This often leads to finishing a map, browsing through items very quickly, keeping the ones that match your criteria and selling the rest. While this seems like a good formula, I found myself quickly bored as there are only a couple combinations of items that are worthwhile at the moment (Defense Power/Defense Speed for builders, and Hero Damage/Ability Power for DPS). This meant that 90% of the items I found I sold and 10% I kept. With 20-30 items per map it felt like a lot of time selling useless items.The inventory system is currently somewhat challenging to navigate. Dragging items onto other bags works infrequently and forces you to manually open bags and move items between open slots. It was difficult to organize them and I wanted a more user friendly experience. It would also be lovely to be able to check your inventory with 'i' like in the first game instead of being forced to visit a defender's forge.Working with other people was sometimes more challenging than it should have been. I think this game could benefit from a built in chat system to make the process easier.I'm looking forward to the costumes to become available in game via micro transactions so that I can lend some uniqueness to my character as currently, when there are four monks running around in game it feels very much like a clone of the person next to me which takes away from the immersion considerably.Overall, the game was really fun up to the maximum level but there is little reason to stay and grind at the moment. I look forward to exploring additional content as it becomes available. I would reccommend purchasing the game in it's current stage to anyone who is willing to be patient as content becomes available since as of right now it is somewhat limited in scope.  "

								First impression:Only level 3 so far but at face value,it seems like the DD1 of old.You build towers,some towers are k,CC towers are better and you smack stuff with your hero.We don't do skillpoints but gain stats as we level? Seems nice.I always found switching my spec/making a whole new character for a specific spec to be too cumbersome.I only hope the loot is better this time around.There's an item level system from the looks of it.Hope that doesn't screw me over when I get to endgame.Also,when this game eventually dies down,I hope I can solo most of these dungeons.The later DLC for DD1 made the challanges pretty awful once the population thinned.

								Great game and concept that is unfortunately ruined by TrendyEnt's terrible ""balacing"" (aka nerfing everything into uselessness).  Towers feel incredibly weak and gearing up does not feel satisfying at all anymore, with most of the unique stats either removed or locked into the 'Shard' system (which is gated by awful RNG).  Maybe this game will be worth coming back to months from now, but currently I cannot recommend it.			"

								I liked this game before the update.  Trendy said they ""balanced"" the classes.  BS.  Most of the towers are useless now.  And if you want to use a tower, you have to make a character and put your ascension points into that tower.  Now you see people with 3 and 4 of the same class just so they can put their ascension points into one tower on each character.  You may say ""why dont you spread your ascension points around?""  I supposed some would, but that just makes your towers weaker.  And there is no cap on ascension, with most of the stats you can put it into capping out at 999.  And this isnt a tower defense game anymore.  Its a hero defense with added korean mmorpg grind.  They removed the range on towers, nerfed the gear and relics, added shards you have to put in gear with needed buffs forcing you to play the same maps over and over hoping you get the one you need.  No longer my cup of tea.			"

								Yes, still Alpha. Yes only 4 hours played at this point. But I know what I want from a Game.*Let's be realistic, with the recommended specs, It's 2016 Tomorrow. And it's not like Trendy Failed with Dungeon DefendersGraphics 4/10 *Sound 5/10 *Storyline 0/10 - ""Copy Paste""Game Play 3/10 *Networking 0/10 * Additionally I'm lagging out in my 'private' tavern.Yet another example of not getting the Minimal Viable Product down before Proceeding with development. If you paste a bunch a roses on a turd, it may look more appealing, but I Can guarantee you that it is still a turd.Pros:1 - Dungeon Defenders 2.2 - Free to Play.2.1 - Not pay to win.Cons:3 - Towers and Skill Changes.4 - Profanity Filter does not work.5 - Forced online Play. {I don't know about you, but I want to play single player/LAN offline}6 - Development Direction.7 - Community.8 - Chat.I will come back to this after a couple months, maybe. But until then I highly recommend that you either stay away until full release, which will probably never happen if they keep this up, or risk Beta {If that will ever Happen}.Closing Thoughts:A whole year in Open Alpha? Is no one Playing this game or are the developers relying completely on the more than 'juvenile' community to finish the game for them?			"

								This game, made by...some of the same people as our beloved classic is more than disapointing.But, because im not a prick ill start with the positives1.Lots of content2. Better graphics, performance...and thats it, the only things that are better than the original are the technological things.Here come the bad things1. You remember that unique system where the money you use to buy stuff is the same as  the money you build towers with? sure noone used it but it was UNIQUE.2. Its a free to play game, expect them to cut content off if you dont want to grind endlessly or pay money which is exactly what they want.Id have prefered to play 50 dollars for an Actual game which doesnt limit the ammount of content i get. 3.Hero abilities suck. Especially the beloved manabomb.Also, they no longer use the building mana which also differenciated it from your run of the mill tower defense game.4.Grinding.Even.More.Than.The.Last.Game.5.Everything feels...empty. It just feels like a big studio bought the name and made a completely diffrent game.I loved the original to bits, but this is just sad. I know theyre trying yet...i dont think my issues are resolveable.It doesnt feel like a sequel, it feels more like a ""Startrek Online""-ish Adaption of a series using the name to get easy money. Im just dissapointed in trendy.			"

								Was a fun time killer before, it wasn't perfect but they were doing a good job by adding new hero's and updating the gameplay.  Now for whatever reason they have completely changed almost every aspect of the game to where it's not really interesting. Gear is basically not important at all unless you want to go DPS. They removed all options to really costomize your style of gameplay with the hero's you like. Ascension is basically a sloww grind process to try and be able to be able to do any higher lvls of maps. Drops are horrible now and it's just a pure grindfest that has removed all the fun from it.It really seems like the developers have lost touch with it's game community and what people really wanted out of the game. If you enjoy griding your♥♥♥♥♥off forever then this is the game for you, if not I wouldn't bother anymore.			"

								It's like they are trying to make this game more of a hack n slash than a tower defense game. The range of towers has been nerfed to the point of being useless. Gone are the days of monk towers being able to cover a location and even if you upgrade the tower, it's range does not change. I cannot recommend this game in it's current state. Devs, if you read this, please look at the things that made DD1 so successful. The direction you are going right now is going to kill this game.			"

Alpha & Beyond: It's looking great. It runs rather well, I have expirienced very few to no bugs at all and the Devs are quick to fixing any that happen to pop up. The classes are all fairly balanced in their own ways and they're all able to be built about 2-3 different ways, which adds some more diversity to the game itself.That being said, it is till only in Alpha stage so there is a rather large limit to most of the game's features at the moment. After completing the Campagin mode you're left with Free mode and a newer insane mode, which both become repetitive and annoying at times, especially with having only so many maps to play.Good news is that the community is alot kinder than most and if you don't mind replaying maps here and there it can become addicting, and one hell of a lootfest. With the many ways of playing classes and spending 8 hours a day waiting for the damn eggs to hatch just one legendary pet to admire; you'll get alot of time into it. It's also possible to play singleplayer, if you're the anti-social type or just don't have any friends.All in all, it's a fairly good game for being in Early access, and there's clearly alot more coming to the game. So if you don't mind the repetitive gameplay and watching the game grow, then this is for you. If you'd rather get the full expirience then go ahead and wait, either way this certainly is, and most likely will be a wonderful game upon full release.			"

								Loved DD1 but as this one even fails to start for me i can give this game nothing but 0/10. I have been trying to start the game for almost a month now but still only get black/white screen and i am far from the only one. Still no response on the issue from the devs. Second issue.This game has not even been released and the total cost for for all the DLC is over 130€ at the moment. WTF, just seriously WTF! Just NO! You want people to pre-order and support then give that option, nothing wrong with that, but NOT stuff AT A TOTAL OF 130 EUROS that is mostly useless! That pricing is insane. All i can say is that the devs seem to have sold out completely and i seriously have doubts that this game will ever be anything close to what DD1 was. Sad but true. So far my recommendation is, if you can start it then fine, go ahead and try it as it's ""free"" but DO NOT BUY ANYTHING. Stinks like a cash grab from miles away.			"

Notice the huge difference?Going F2P was a huge mistake. Dungeon Defenders had a special place in my heart from its very detailed and unique mobile gaming experience. I was ecstatic to see a DD2 being developed years ago. Having popped in and out of the early access tid bit of DD2 I am nothing but disappointed.Once again, going F2P was a huge mistake. It feels like a 3D clash of clans with horrible graphics and so much damn clutter on the screen. Seriously, everywhere you look is another attempt to get you to spend more money to get a better chance at RNG loot. Besides that the GUI is a mess and the game almost feels like it makes an effort to make it difficult to simply manage your insane amount of useless loot.They took what DD1 did and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ized it.

								Albeit I have only played for a short while, I have gotten a clear picture how this game works, and even though it is very similar to the first game, this one takes the simple idea and then tosses it in a river.The RPG, loot collecting, and tower defense, is fun as ever. However, when you first start off playing the game, you are met with utter confusion. The first maps start off as hard as most maps were half way through the game in the first game. By the way I reached the third or fourth map; It had four places where monsters kept pouring out, and the items I were to defend were placed in a haphazard manner. The maps are in general just poorly designed in comparison to the first game.So, right from the start; This game is impossible to play alone to get a hang of it. So you are forced to play with people online, which I figured is the way it's supposed to be played, of course. Well, it would have made a bit more sense to let a person who is new to the game actually start off in a brand new game, and not throw the poor player into a group that is already half-way through the map, leaving you unable to build any towers. So you stand alone in the onslaught, doing no damage, simply waiting to get your free loot.Also, throwing all the leveling info, stats, customization, and everything of the sort ALL AT THE SAME TIME, is extremely daunting and off-putting. Slowly introducing mechanics to new players would be extremely helpful, since most info you get is either too detailed or not detailed at all.It's not a terrible game by all means. But it would at most get 4 out of 10, where the original DD would easily get 8 out of 10. If it was as simple to learn as its predecessor, the game would have been better in general. But the useless stats thrown around, no proper info or pointers given, poor optimization, and the maps being completely rubbish in comparison to the first game, does make it feel extremely lackluster.

								Just finished a 14+ hour marathon of this unfinished masterpiece. The top review for this game is a serious overreaction. If you played dd1 a lot and had all the dlc, then you'll like this one even more. The gameplay is super refined over the first (buggy but only like 1 game breaker that i know of), the matchmaking is excellent most of the time, and the grind has plenty of incintives if you're the type to min-max your gear to become a godly monster slaying badass. I haven't even reached the endgame yet and i can see myself sinking hundreds of hours into this game over the next few years. It's hard to believe that this is only an alpha and it's already better than the first game!As for the paid currency transactions: HOLD OFF UNTIL YOU KNOW YOU LOVE THE GAME. Don't get greedy and burn your money just because something looks good. If you truly like this game (or even the first game) you'll glady drop the money with no regrets because the premium content is really satisfying if you're a big fan.If you were the type of person to repetedly run challanges on nightmare difficulty in the orignial game, you'll find this game to be an amazing breath of fresh air. If you're new, skip the first game and play this one... NOW!!tl;dr: I HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Amazing RPG/Survival/Tower Defense Hybrid gameonly in alpha; still beats the first,Don't waste money unless you absolutely love itJUST PLAY IT NOW			"

								Having played the this game's predecessor: Dungeon Defenders 1 it's great to see Trendy is trying to fix some of the issues that plagued the previous title, while staying true to the great foundations of the Defenders series. Combat is easy to get into and unlike the previous title the hero abilities feel like they make a difference in combat, not only does this make battles more exciting it also gives you a compelling reason to invest in ability specs instead of heading straight for hero damage and health like in the previous game.Tower placing has improved vastly since the previous game, and feels more balanced in terms of green mana being available - in the previous title towers were able to reach their maximum upgrade level fairly quickly, however in DD2 mana is more scarce so upgrades need to be more tactical and always repairs are essential at all times. Some towers in the game have combinations but the squire class seems to have been left out of this equation - something I hope the developers are planning on addressing.Loot is more fair in this title, in the previous game loot was dropped and visible to all players, this would lead to a mad scramble as everyone abandoned their posts to try and snatch the loot before someone else. In Dungeon Defenders 2, loot is instanced (players can only see their own loot) and means that people focus more on the battle than watching for a nice drop. Nice drops are also alerted to so people don't have to stare at the map all the time.However a lot of the game is still missing, I'd like to see:* More bosses* Improved pet system* Higher level cap (as content comes)* More game modes* Balanced uber spec spheres* A way of selling unused spec spheres* More adventure maps "

								""We Never Sell Any Gameplay AdvantageWe mean it! You will never be able to gain gameplay advantage by spending real money in Dungeon Defenders II.""  /\   |This is quote from gamedev (read the description)- Initiallly the game is really entertaining, but as soon as you reach the level cap (which takes a couple of nights), it kicks you in guts! Here is the list of♥♥♥♥♥♥1. If you played most of the so called ""free-to-play"" mobile games you know the drill - it lets go easy peasy on first 10 to 15 levels, and after that the further you get the more tempting it gets to buy stuff. Here you will get the same story. The game is now solely based on microtransations.2. It has been waaaaaaaaaayyyyy too long in pre-alpha (not even a pre-beta John!). And what did the game get in such a long time ? Well :1) More pets! Yay! ( 9 out of 10 for real money only ^_^ )2) New costumes! Weepee! ( 9 out of 10 for real money only ^_^ )3) New levels! Free*! OMG! ( but with your lvl you still need to either spend over 40 hours to get something decent or *JUST BUY STUFF )4) Poor otimization :( BUT WAIT! The devs promise to fix it someday ! They still haven't done so since the release in Dec 2014, but please believe in them.To devs: Of course you have to earn money from this - DLC was a good idea, paid access to early access was good idea, but you ♥♥♥♥ed it both up. DLC matters nothing now - it is all about microtransations; paid access to alpha for 1,5 years ?! SERIOUSLY ?			"

								I really like this game. Even though it's in early access I can tell there are a lot of different routes you can take with your character and I love games where the end game is infinite and you can always be upgrading and changing specs.I have a first look I did before this most recent patch if anyone is interested in seeing what it's like to be a newbie in the game.

								I used to love this game but when it came to I realised the grind was too real. It was so real because of the fact that you need over like 10k Medals to get a new hero and when it comes down to it grinding the game is boring as heck. I can't even play the game anymore because before the round is over I have to go study or do homework. The rounds are very long and the grind for loot is terrible. It would be better if you could access all heroes no matter what because the heroes are what I play this game for. I have been grinding and grinding for Ev Mk2 but when it comes to the matter it would take over a week of hardcore grinding to get ev 2k and on the road there all the gear i've gotten is terrible and farming Harbringer is plain boring.

								i played the campaign through once and it got very repetitive and boring shortly after. Also ever since the carnival/gunwitch update i can only play 2 maps in a row before i get hit with 'request timed out' and thrown into the hub which wouldn't be a major issue if the hub were actually there, instead i'm put into an infinite fall since the world didn't even spawn.Edit: i forgot to mention that i ran it on a computer that exceeds recommended specs and since the terraria update i can safely play the games for hours without the aforementioned bugs.Actually being able to play it now, the game is still repetitive and the heroes (aside from the base 4) require either a premium currency gained through daily and monthly challenges or with a premium currency bought with real money. all cosmetic outfits require the currency bought with real money.

								Well I have enough of a reason to change my mind now. DDII is shaping up to be more than what I expected to be, and if you enjoyed the first game, chances are you'll enjoy this one. It feels like a refined update of DD1, but with more emphasis on thought rather than mindless slaughter. It is, however, still a tad too grindy for my taste, but i'm hoping that will change.			"

Early Access Review
								To be quite honest, I DO RECOMMEND THIS GAME FOR THOSE WHO HAVE PLAYED DD1 AND LOVED IT. It's great, but there are multiple problems that you would commenly expect when getting a pre-alpha game. Ignoring the fact that I have down voted this game, there are multiple aspects of this game that include DD1 gameplay style and newly intergrated styles in this new game.Now for the main reasons I have (not) recommended this game.- A lot of the features of DD1 have been removed/rehased/recycled. This means that some of the things have been kept, while some of these things have been reworked, while most of the other stuff has been reused.-Style of the game is great, it is visualy appealing and very well textured/graphics are amazingly good for a pre-alpha.- A lot of the classes have been reworked and nerfed heavily. Huntress's mines/traps and bombs area of effect has been greatly nerfed had has no were near the the effect they did in DD1. Squire's defences are while the same, have been heavily nerfed, and dont hold a candle to DD1's squire's defences. Monk and Apprentice are in the same boat, thus making the game a lot more difficult and challenging when progressing onwards in leveling. Defences are also quite weak, and you're forced to rely on your hero to do most of the cleaning of waves.-Mana: Mana has been drastically altered and is no longer the main currency of the game. While you still use mana to build towers and use abilities, the new incorperation of a coin/gold system is now the new money of the game. Speaking of mana, there are two different types of mana. Ability mana (Blue) and Tower mana (Green) both drop off enemies, but in very LOW quantites.-Online system: They have a very strange working of the Online/Server set up which at first greatly confused me. However it took a while to get use to. You are thrown into a recruitment tavern where you talk to a recruiter. This brings up a menu allowing you to pick from multiple different level groups. E.g. 1-5. 5-10. 10-15. This also stops boosting somewhat as if you were a higher level, (E.g. 15) and joined a lower level bracket, (E.g. 5-10), you would be brought down to level 10 for the remainer of your time in that bracket, once you leave, you are returned to your normal level. This also kicks lower level characters from trying to join higher level brackets.Overall, the game is very different from DD1. I was expecting it to be a lot better than the first one, and wasn't expecting much of the workings of the characters to change that much considering they were perfect in the first game. However this is my opinion and that doesn't mean much on the internet.The main reason I am not recommending this game is becuase it's purely a pre-alpha and the the fact that its $24, (from New Zealand), is not really ideal. However, in another case, if you loved DD1 and want to give it a try, by all means, i would recommend it to you just becuase its a great start to a game that has LOADS of potential. However, definately needs work, and lots of changes.~~TLDR~~ If you liked DD1, get it and see for yourself. If you haven't played DD1 or didn't like DD1, don't get it, becuase it's simply not worth $24 or whatever its going for in your country. Especially when rumour has it that on offical release its going to go Free 2 Play.			"

Early Access Review
								tl;dr - This game has a decent campaign but that's literally it.The problem with this game is first of all: it's much more of a hero game than it is a turret game, the game requires way too much work to even unlock additional heroes, I've put in nearly 30 hours and beaten the campaign and still am not even close to having enough medals to unlock a hero. The campaign of this game is where you can enjoy the fun parts of it, the whole TWO bosses they have lmao. After campaign I'd just reccomend you live with what ya got because it's nothing but ugly after that, either pay your way out or farm for hours on end hoping for a decent drop. the recent updates have skewed the loot drops, so don't play this game expecting that buzz when you get a nice item, it happens rarely. It's extremely clear that most people hate this trials patch and devs don't comment on this nor do they try to adjust things, instead they just nerf everything (not even kidding check recent patches). It's clear that this game had it's prime and now it's in the dirt. I think based on recent patches the devs know that too, which is a shame.			"

								Unfortunately full of anti-fun mechanics including making certain characters and their defences useless (enemies will ignore or be immune to them) which forces you to adopt one of only a few valid strategies until that too is nerfed into oblivion.Developers need to watch Sid Meier's The Psychology of Game Design (Everything You Know Is Wrong).

I love the mechanics the game works on, remember its still an Alpha soo a lot of people are not as excited as I am. Maybe they are complaining about poor skill development system that is not over the top but I like it! Yea sure you cannot use the skill points like In DD1 but its still a hell off a lot fun to play! I hope that we get to see more characters, More Advanced Weapon development system and more but for now, I Love this game! Certainly worth my money. This Review is published by my secondary account, if you noticed any mistakes feel free to ignore them and I will try my best in the next reviews. RedyD			"

								If you want a super repetitive, unsatisfying, grindfest then you'll love this game. After you play the first map, you've experienced all the game has to offer. You max out your character, just to be able to play the same boring maps. You repeat this cycle until the day you die. Terraria crossover? You mean more sifting through the same boring map set ups with the same exact enemy types. After years in development, you'd think there would be more to this game then over priced microtransactions and boring missions.Edit*If you are a braindead mindless retard that likes doing the same menial tasks over and over, until you have the coolest looking things to be able to the same missions that you already completed, then you will ♥♥♥♥ing love this game. As for me, this game is probably going to destroy most of my friendships.			"

								FIRST OF ALL NOTE THAT THIS GAME IS ON EARLY ACCESS (PRE-ALPHA), MEANING ITS NOT A FULLY DEVELOPED GAME WITH NO BUGS AND ALL CONTENT AVAILABLE.I played the original dundef and i liked dd2 just as much.Keeping true to the original game, still blending the fun of tower-defense game with action rpg games, this sequel is just as fun, if not MORE fun than the original dundef. (And it's only on early access! Imagine when it's fully released!)~PROS~-Better Graphics (LMFAO wHo cAREAS Xd seriously.)-Characters are more customizable with the new accessory patch!-The new sphere skill tree is better than dd1's skill point system imo. + UBER SPEC !!! (game-changing spec for each classes towers.)-4 HERO ABILITIES COMPARED TO DD1'S 2 HERO ABILITY.-The world is more interactive (Pre-Set Traps!)-Class COMBOES! water + electric = electrocute? oil + fire = ignite? yes please!~CONS~-The towers are BOOORING. I miss the bowling ball turret from DD1 T_T-BUGS GLITCH BUGS GLITCH (But it's okay, since its only Pre-Alpha.-NEED MORE HEROES!-Some Spec is just utter 5H!T AND USELESS. MORE CHARACTER SPEC PLZ!!!-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI GETS STUCK AND IT PISSES ME OFF! (Could be exploited too, but what fun would that be?)Overall, the game's progess is looking REAAAAL good. I was skeptical about buying it first, but then Trendy really showed me their hard work on making this game, even convincing me to buy the collector's edition (DAMMIT TRENDY!)9/10. HIGHLY RECOMMEND PLAYING THIS WITH YOUR FRIENDS! Soloing is possible, but it gets BOOORING REAL FAST, but if you play this game with your friends (4 stack if possible) it is just simply AMAZING.<3 u Trendy, keep up the good work!-Popon			"

								If you want a super repetitive, unsatisfying, grindfest then you'll love this game. After you play the first map, you've experienced all the game has to offer. You max out your character, just to be able to play the same boring maps. You repeat this cycle until the day you die. Terraria crossover? You mean more sifting through the same boring map set ups with the same exact enemy types. After years in development, you'd think there would be more to this game then over priced microtransactions and boring missions.Edit*If you are a braindead mindless retard that likes doing the same menial tasks over and over, until you have the coolest looking things to be able to the same missions that you already completed, then you will ♥♥♥♥ing love this game. As for me, this game is probably going to destroy most of my friendships.			"

								'Aw yeah, Dungeon Defenders II is in Alpha, we've been waiting for this for years' - me and my friend on original release of DD2 on steam.Played it. Was pretty broken but eh, was an Alpha. I enjoyed the game play, they made it different to the first one, which was good, but it still stuck to its roots of a magical RTS with some 3rd Person fighting involved.Enter TrialsGame I spent £15 or so on is now free. I get some ingame pay-to-win currency for what is now basically an FPS with a slight hint of tower defence in that you can kiiiiiinda slow them down. If you are new to DD as a franchise get DD1. If you like DD1 play DD1.Get Gid Trendy			"

								I really wanted this game to do well. I have to just stop playing this game. Every time I come back to it every mechanic changes and progression is flipped around and left incoherent. The developers seem to not know what they want to do and I just cant support this any more.  As of right now. The game does have entertaining aspects to it. Classes feel fun, buildings are entertaining and flashy. But the bad things like certain monster forcing play styles is just jarring and not needed. Goblin tank forces you into tanking because it just plows through any tower without stopping and requires massive amounts of dps to kill it. They added the annoying talent system from Diablo 3. Want to find tune some thing? Too bad you have to gain 4 levels to add one point to the thing you want.  I suggest Coop if you are interested in the game. After hitting about level 45-50 it gives you an enormous gear check and soloing comes to a grind.Best of luck Trendy. I loved Dungeon Defenders 1. I dont know what went wrong in house, but this doesnt feel like a sequel. Feels like some thing EA would do to an IP they want to get rid of. Ill check in again once you guys officially release this game.			"

If the game wasn't updated then yes i would. All of the fun and enjoyment has been taken away.			"

								Very fun, I hope it will come as great as DD1. It is still beta and it is coming out quite well. Of course, we are still waiting for the first-person mode as well as re-implementation of all dd1 maps.Sometimes it can feel a bit grindy, one option to fix this would be to add the possibility to release multiple waves at once, for an income bonus (just as in any td game)Plenty costumes as DLC, all classses are accesible with DLC but also with in-gmae currency, earned daily, nothing to complain here.A lot of maps, waiting for more, also workshop content would be nice.

								I'd be able to recommend this game easily before this recent update. This update not only made most farming before it worthless, but it made the game bland and linear. The new ascension system is sad and uninspired and the new inventory system is terrible. The UI got much worse (though it wasn't anything great before it's worse now) and they replaced spheres with terribly implemented ""shards"" with WoW like inspiration. In that they're much less worth investing time in, much like the rest of the game now. It's become just as unfun and unrewarding as other tower defense games, if it isn't worse than them.

								I've logged into this game every so often since they very first released it as a paid beta. Coincidentally, each time I see what they've done in the latest update, the pulsating cancer in my♥♥♥♥♥grows slighly larger. Somehow the devs have managed to make an even bigger and more unethical cash grab than the first game, which was produced under Chinese sweatshop conditions. But at least that one was fun.Originally, a lot less emphasis was placed on the microtransactions, but now the game is essentially another ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Korean MMO grindfest with state of the art psychological exploitation. Every nasty business model around has been distilled and injected into this game which plays you much more than you play it. There is very little strategy in the shockingly limited towers and abilities you possess, and every inch of the game has recieved the 'competitive' sterilization that never fails to suck all the fun out of multiplayer titles. You can also find more impactful character customization in a Kim Kardashian dress up game. No matter how much I try to push a single stat, my max level character feels like it plays exactly the same as it did at level 1. Also, you're forced by both level design and game mechanics to use both towers and abilities, because Trendy sees their players as vegetables who shouldn't be deciding anything for themselves. I would have quit this much, much earlier if I didn't like DD1 so much, but I guess it's what I get for hoping a F2P game will be good. Loot is boring, pets are boring, the game is boring, the art is pretty nice, the cancer hurts, and I regret spending $30 and however much time on this game. I could see myself recommending this game to devoted fans of cookie clicker and/or lobotomy patients.			"

Theres also a lot of rpg elements like skill spheres, your stats level, your equipment. Lot of space for different builds but also a bit of spreadsheet madness.

								I loved and supported this game from the beginning, but Trendy ruined it for me.Sadly they seem to have no idea how to balance the game, implement end game features or fix game-breaking bugs, some of which are part of the game for a very long time now.The game itself and progression in general are frustrating and do not feel balanced at all - especially when playing solo.Trendy, you had a great game idea and lost it on the way.This game might be playable or even good one day, but I won't be around to see it.UPDATE:Had to see it with my own eyes, but you did improve the game at least a little bit with the latest updates. And you made it P2W by adding Shard-Bundles to the store. I remember a time when you promised to never do that, but I guess you are desperate. Hate to see a great game concept go down like this ...

								this game is.... uhhhhh the WORST tower defence game EVER I never died unless I fell in a pit and apperantly goblins are babies!? also am I the only onewho thinks this looks like clash of clans and should be on ipad? DD1 had the coolest graphics for a 2011 game but now in 2015-2016 we have clash of clans. the inventory space is terrible in DD1 it was ok.... but in DD2 it has no inventory space after 3 levels and I know this is turning into a rant and getting annoyed by (some) bad english but just bare with me. speaking of levels there are about 15 that are not fun to play again and onslaught mode is really hard for a huntress who has a great bow and great stats. now the difficulty is is very not hard at all like oh no ranged enemies? where are the dark elf archers? and wyverns at the final boss wait I meant Only boss. ogres are gone now so we now get powered up normal enemy thats super duper easy wow so cool........ this rant is overalso dont judge me by my profile pic I cant change it for ssome reason and bye!!!!!!!!!!!

								If you loved DD1 you will love DD2.  I liked all the different heros you could build with in DD1.  I enjoy the hero/tower and tower/tower combos that DD2 has.  Hours of tower defense play while leveling up heros, finding gear/loot and hatching pets:)			"

								-This review may get some future edits-Apparently there is few bad reviews for this game, and I notice the reason for that probably is because they don't find the game similar to first DD1 and to have different aspects. As far as I can see those folks didn't even play the game enough to make such harsh reviews of the game, they simply give up after having to do some grind, which is sad cuz the game is very promising and fun.To begin with I must say that I never did any review about an early-access or beta/alpha games, but well ... like they say : there is always a first time.So here we go. The first Dungeon Defenders games come out a couple of years ago, and I never had a chance or time to try them out on that time. Just this year I had a chance to play it and without any surprises I immediately loved it. After getting all the collection I decided to also buy the upcoming Dungeon Defenders II, which is currently on alpha (I probably will update this review later), but for now the game is running really GOOD, So good that doesn't even feel like an early-access, As you can notice I got tons of hours already, that's all because the game hook you in, lots of fun playing solo or online, and will be even better when this goes F2P, cuz all your friends will be able to play it without spend a cent. Though I really reccomend this game as it is right now because it worth every penny.			"

								So I have played this game for a significant amount of time and I have finally come to the conclusion that I cannot recommend this game right now.Pros:So this game is kinda like a visual upgrade for dd1 which I played a lot on the 360 at the time and I enjoyed that game. The maps can have a pretty good learning curve and they can be kinda fun to play on. The gear can be pretty nice to get but later on in the game you will come to find the gear to just be frustrating in terms of the shear amount of rng on the rolls for different stats and so called ""passives"" which are suppose to give you buffs to certain builds. Then there is the characters. The characters are pretty simple. There are builds for each type of these heros that can make them fun and pretty viable late game(I say this now but Trendy are doing a lot of nerf passes as of late which is kinda why I am kinda done with this game for the time being but more on that later). Cons:There are a lot of problems for this game and I feel like the game devs can't use the whole ""It's in beta or alpha"" argument after the game being out for about 2 going on 3 years now. It is extremly buggy and each update seems to be adding more problems. Then there is the new heroes they have released. You can grind these heroes for this type of currency called ""Defender Medals"" which can be somewhat easy to grind for if you have a lot of time through the means of daily missions which reset at a wierd time for some in different time zones. There are also weeklys and monthlies but they haven't done a monthly in a good couple of months. Some say it is ""pay to win"" I like to call it ""pay to skip"" which is not that bad if you think about it. The gear at later levels can get really frustrating if you don't get the correct rolls. The devs keep just doing the nerf hammer on a lot of heroes and builds people run and barley buffing anything to a viable use. There are massive server issues and bugs that can make the game unplayable for some people for some length of time. TL:DR This game was a really cool concept and I liked playing it for the time being but it seems the way the devs are doing things at this point in time compared to the time was a payed to get access alpha the devs seemed to have lost sight of what this game was suppose to be. Until the devs either fix the the problems in the game or stop the nerf hammer on a lot of things and buff stuff to be more viable in endgame then I will still not recommend this game.			"

								Just as I started playing I could notice the differences between the first game and this one some are bad and some are goodBad-The game mechanics are kinda strange-Sometimes I fell like I am playing a free-to-play game (due to in-game currency and other things)-You can't ''build'' your character in stats anymore since all the changes(in stats) are made by Items so far in the game(I may be wrong)-Mana chests are kinda confusingGood-Graphics really had an ''upgrade''-Easier to find lobbys-The tavern is now different introduncing more merchants and other serviceSo that's my review some thing can be wrong since I only played so far in the game, and It can change since the game is on Early Acess.You can ignore the in-game currency(gems) since it is used to help the developers from the game(I think)			"

								This is a pretty good game, and heres why. - Fun to play characters.- Plays at 50 fps on my crappy computer on medium in some pretty intense moments. - Doesn't look like crap on medium or low- You can earn basically everything- People who pay get very trivial bonuses- Some sort of story that revolves around the four main playable characters- A decently done two-way crossover- Multiple challenges after the story is done- Diablo-esq loot system that doesn't seem heavily rigged in favor of pay to play players.Heres some cons. - Very short six act story, with 2-6 missions on average per act. - Challenges recommended directly after final boss seem infinitely harder than the final bosses stage. - Can't unlock any of the cool heroes even if you beat the full story, still gotta do those challenges for them. - Paying does give some convienient short-cuts, nothing bad though. - Story lacks general depth, but its alright for a game of this length.

								Dungeon Defender II is a very fun game.  They have done an incredible job on the graphics too.. such detail its amazing.  You will love the game.  Quite addicting and everything can be bought with medals you win so you dont have to put money into it to get the paid for items.  Now...the costumes on the other hand are ridiculously over priced... not to sure what to say about that one except laugh.  I would love to see a finished product in the near future though but there is no talk of such yet.  If you are going to play this game during this stage then be prepared for your characters to be constantly changed, your items to be nerfed and inventory to be wiped.  I have been doing this for few years now and at this point I am hoping they come to some end and decide to release a full game so we dont have to go through this anymore.			"

I stoped playing for a year cos of personal reason. And i was back last month.After trying for about 10 maps. WTF am i playing!????its not a defence game anymore, the core value of DD is totally damaged. SIGH!Its now just a cartoon style fps game with some construction of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ buildings. A cartoon style FPS game, why dont we go and play over watch!Fold up and stop this development. Back and see why was dd1 so sucessful. Rework the whole game! We dont want to see a FPS game of just numbers and levels.			"

								There are six reasons you buy and play a DD game. You love TD, RPG, loot farming, burning your life away, forgetting what the outside world looks like, doing the same thing over and over again, and have a tendency towards masochism. Every actual DD fan cannot deny the prior statement is true of themselves, and they know it. Moving on.What is actually wrong here:Content; believe it or not after 2+ years in ""alpha"" dev, the amount of content is sorely lacking. Namely endgame.Microtransactions; exclusively costumes are pay only, while new heroes/heroines are either 20$ish or replaying the same maps hundreds of times.Community; there are generally two types of players, those that have no clue what's going on, and those that are farmed and know what's going on. The two don't interact much and if they do the results are often less than fun.It's not a new story for the series but it's reached thinly vieled to in your face bad, at least for me. I can't expect Trendy to make any different decisions at this point and I can no longer support their business model.So, if you either have a deep pocket, or lots of time on your hands, I recomend you skip this one.

								7 Feb 2015 - Edit: They have changed how things work and implemented the old system where you can just beat a level and be on your way. They are listening to the community feedback and changing the game and how everything works according to that. If you like developers who work hand in hand with their community, then you will like these guys.I can now recommend this game if you liked the old Dungeon Defenders and have friends to play this with and if you don't have any friends who will play this game, it's still a solid game to play co-op with strangers or just solo.Keep in mind that the game will be free to play once it is released and the price you currently paid will be converted to in game currency, which will only be used for cosmetic items according to the developers.

								I have been following dungeon defenders II just for the love I had for the previous game. I was hyped at first few months of the game. but the developers are taking very odd decisions about this game. There is no real challenge in this game. You simply do the same content in different difficulties and skyrocket yourself to the highest difficulty which is NM4 atm. Then the game is simply over. You can get the best gear, still improve very slightly but the content does not change. There is no end-game challenge that keeps your mind working. This was supposed to be a strategy tower defense game with attacking hero mechanics but all I experienced so far is constant map zerg. They are releasing very cool new character every once in a while but that is it sadly. Some metas change in the way characters are built but the result never changes. I never have to think of a strategy. I can just put towers whereever I like and the map slowly melts before my eyes while I sit and browse the web. This is not the game I hoped this game would become.			"

								If you like orcs must die then you will like this game. So what you do is build traps and barricades to defend the target, the only thing I find annoying with this game is the chests (not the ones at the end of the level that spawn) require keys or gems to open. This game is $15.00, you have to buy the gems to open the chests and the cheapes is $5.00 fo 500 gems. If I have to buy a game then there should not be any in app purchase/micro transaction. But other than that the game is pretty fun.			"

								I am really enjoying Dungeon Defenders 2, I am a fan of Dungeon Defenders and have had the second game on my wishlist for a while now.  Overall I feel like the game has improved, it lacking a lot of things the first game had at the moment but it is still in alpha. I am jsut glad i dont have to deal with all those crazy hacks and mods i feel like were rampant on the first game.  For those not familiar with Dungeon Defenders, you chose your hero and battle waves of enemy's in tower defense gameplay with up to four friends. Dungeon Defenders has a good deal of classes to chose, but so far in Dungeon Defenders 2 we only have the 4 original to chose from, those being the Huntress, squire, monk, and apprentice. Really I am hoping that Dungeon Defenders 2 ends up better than the first game. Its supposed to be going free to play after launch so I am really hoping it  gets popular. its a fun tower defense game, especially if you play with friends.   "

Early Access Review
								This game is fun, especially if you have friends to play it with. However, the developers misled a lot of people early with making us buy the game, then turning it to free to play. We still have to pay more to get all of the new stuff that they're still devolping.In short, try this game. It's worth it. Just don't pay a dime until you know for sure they're done adding things. No point sinking money in thinking you'll get it all, and then getting less than half of the released content.			"

Early Access Review
								A sequel to the wildly popular and unique Dungeon Defenders game that takes a different direction from its predecessor.(Note, I originally did not recomment this game, but after hours of playing, I have decided to recommend it.  I'll explain why below.)Pros- Personal loot drops make for a more relaxed game where you don't have to constantly keep your eyes out for drops you need (There's no more race to grab the good loot before other players and that is a great design call)- The classes have some really cool attacks and abilities making each feel unique- Changes to mana and loot selling have made things much easier, both for sorting through loot and for upgrading it- Seperation of mana for building and for personal powers was a great call- Easy group finding system gets you right into the action- Reputation system makes random players more inclined to be polite- Synergy system means you can make powerful tower combinations if you have a cooperative team of players.Cons- Can't play offline- Long lags between games.  Due to the fact that a game has no clear leader, everyone has to ready up for the game to progress between levels and after the games.  This doesn't sound too bad, but when people go afk or someone new isn't paying attention, it can end up being 2+ minutes to continue on- Solo, each classes tower set is lacking (I'll explain more about this below)- A lack of mana will prevent you from doing much during a combat round (at least at low level)- The win points and fun-factor strategies to this game aren't as obvious as they were in the original- Builder specs feel very nerfed thanks to the lack of mana (EDIT: Again, this is only when you don't try to work with the other player's towers)- Maps are a bit bland, there aren't as many strategic points where you can put towers to have them cover multiple lanes- Tower synergies are esential to effective play- Certain specs are almost completely useless right now- Gating low-level players means that you can't power level your buddies.  It also means that, if your buddies get too far ahead, you can't play with them unless you make a new character.- Certain monsters outrange your towers.  I'm not sure if this changes at high level, but at low level it's extremely frustrating.  It means that you'll be babysitting your towers instead of being able to place them in different spots and trust them to do their job.- Due to the fact that you have to babysit your tower clumps, you cannot solo most of the levels (At least as an apprentice)So I went back and started playing as the monk with a friend who was playing the huntress, and I quickly figured out a pretty devistating combo that made the game much more playable.  I also figured out that one of my mages towers, while not super impressive when combined with his original towers, was extremely effective when combined with one of the monk's auras.So it seems the devs are really pushing for cooperative gameplay in this one, the game almost feels more like WoW than it does Dungeon Defenders.  To be successful, each player must assume a certain role in their tower construction.  A group of apprentice towers isn't very effective, however an ice tower combined with an electric aura (monk) combined with a water geyser (hunter) is devastating.  The concept is fun when it works out, the big problem is that new players or stubborn players will often build whatever they want, effectively lowering your chances of success.  I feel like this sort of design choice needs to be combined with a matchmaking system that tries to put one of each class in a game together.  (Maybe this is already the design, I don't know, but I was often in games with several members of my own class.)The good news is, I did start having a lot of fun once I figured out how the devs expected me to play.  However, I had to do a lot of digging to find that answer.  The game needs to guide its new players better so they know what's needed for victory and don't just build whatever, therebye frustrating the other people who are trying to work as a team.Also, the game needs more towers and more tower synergies.  As of this review, there is one devastating tower/aura/trap combination and everything else is very meh.  Certain towers are very meh and pretty much un-needed.  This needs to be changed so that there are multiple metas (tower building combinations) showing up in the games instead of just 1 or 2.In closing, the game is fun but very different from the first Dungeon Defenders.  You'll have the most fun when playing with friends, and you may want to watch some videos on how to effectively use your towers depending on your class.* UpdateSo the game changes quite a bit at high level.  Once you get your gear established and start the process of farming, you pretty much only need one skilled builder (generally an apprentice or squire) to do the tower setup for the level.  To be honest, it is kind of grindy and not always fun.  And while finding new items to improve your stats can be fun, the actual gameplay isn't.  This may change once more maps are available and harder difficulties are provided.  I'm going to keep my recommendation for now as the game isn't bad and still has potential, but I'm really looking for some new kinds of juicy cooperative gameplay.			"

								As with any Early Access game, make sure it is a game you are okay with it being changed as development goes on. As it stands, the game plays very similar to the first, with some minor changes. So far it seems to be living up to the greatness that was Dungeon Defenders 1.Understand that because it is early access, I know a lot of my concerns with the game will be fixed, and I will update my review when that happens.Pros/Cons:+ The AI seems to be smarter, and more dificult than those in the first game.+ The ability to move your hero while in place/repair/upgrade defense mode is amazing.+ The Dual Mana system is also an awesome addition. You now have mana for abilities, and a separate mana for towers.+ The new defenses each hero has are either upgrades from the first game, or new all together, which is good.+ The ability to vote for the next addition into the game is an awesome early access feature, and should be done more often by developers.- The gear upgrade system is lacking, and confusing at first. - There has yet to be added a proper tutorial system for new features.- The small amount of maps gets old quite fast, and the game tends to get boring after a bit.- Costumes and pets are nowhere to be found, and is one of the things that made the first game a favorite.- The gear shops are barely useful, as the only reason I use them is to get junk gear to upgrade my current stuff.All in all, the game is damn good, and can only get better from here.

Early Access Review
								I've played the first one, it was great fun. This second one does a fantastic job building on what was great. Keeping what made it successful, yet deepening the gameplay, and setting itself up to become a very successful and long lasting experience.I've played the Pre-alpha so far, these days with so many Early Access floating around on steam, very few are actually entertaining for long periods of time and don't portray a very good picture of what the end product will be like.After purchasing it (based on the gameplay I've seen, and my experience of the first game) I read up on some of the difficulties the Studio faced, and as a member of a fellow game studio, I can understand their struggles, but I also commend them for making the right decisions to make the game they want to make for their fans.What I didn't know was that DD2 is intended to become a Free-to-play game. Even though I bought into it (with a 4 pack) which I think will work really well if done correctly, and it sounds like they got their heads on straight.I fully intend to cover this game in my future video guides, as I feel there may be enough depth to the game to make regular videos for fans.But one tip I can share right off the bat: PLAY WITH FRIENDS. It is infinitely more enjoyable, especially if you're around the same level. The matchmaking system is probably still in the works, so do yourself the favour, and don't expose yourself to potential malicious players who could ruin your experience. You payed good money, a good experience will allow you to justify it's current Early Access cost.Keep it up Trendy, you all deserve it!			"

Early Access Review
								The original Dungeon Defenders was likely one of the best executions of an integration between FPS and Tower Defense that the marketplace has seen.  I managed to clock a substantial quantity of hours into the original game, and it was an absolute blast to play.And then they started monetizing the game.  DLC became incredibly commonplace for addons.  New Heroes, new levels, new cosmetics, new character skins, anything they could think of.  They never directly monetized 'power', however, with the introduction of new levels with a higher level cap, it was an indirect way of power-capping new players.The other concern out of the implementation on the original Dungeon Defenders is that as new content got released, there was a substantial amount of Gear Inflation.  +500 to a given stat, which was godly at release, was trivial a few months later.  It had a much more MMO-esque grind to the game that drove their monetization strategy.Then we come to Dungeon Defenders 2.  When I look at this game, I realize that there were a lot of underlying engine upgrades, tons of texture updates, and they completely revamped multiple parts of the game... However, it's different enough from the original.  A lot of rehashed abilities, the same/familiar characters, etc.  The strength behind Dungeon Defenders 2 is that they have a better grasp of their monetization model going into it, and it's built that way from the ground up.  The reason Dungeon Defenders 2 is so popular right now is because it's still at it's infancy.  But even incredibly early on in the process, it really appears to be taking the same path at the original game, but by 'resetting' everything, they're opening the door for more monetization opportunies.  In my opinion, there hasn't been substantial innovation into this game to necessitate the high price tag, or recommend this game to anyone that has already enjoyed the original Dungeon Defenders.  It satisfies the same basic FPS-Tower Defense itch that can be scratched by cheaper alternatives in a more complete state.  This is much less a Dungeon Defenders 2, so much as it's a substantial overhaul of the original Dungeon Defenders.			"

Early Access Review
								Updated review (as of 01/28/17)Let me start by stating that I have never played the original Dungeon Defenders game.  So for me, Dungeon Defenders II (DDII for short) was my first experience with this franchise.  I have no knowledge of how DDI played and I will not be comparing DDI with DDII in this review.For me, DDII did something other Tower Defense games have never done.  They combined awesome tower builds with the ability to have a 3D environment that you (the character) can also run around and interact with.  This means that, in DDII, if you are not optimizing your towers as well as your hero damage and contributing both equally, you are not really playing the game the way it was meant to be played.The game also has its fair share of issues, like any other game, and it’s also worth mentioning that it is still in early access so anything I mention is subject to change.  When I started playing this game in mid-November of 2016, quite a bit had already been changed in DDII from the inception (or initial launch of the title).  For example, the campaign got a huge revamp right before I started and now it is designed to take you from lv1 to lv50 and get you started in Nightmare I difficulty out of the gate.  This was not the case originally.  The reason I mention this is, there is a massive update coming which will change and address quite a few issues most players have with the game, how you gear, progression within the difficulty tiers, inventory management, game balance and so much more.  It’s important to understand, in my opinion, that the game is still early access and will continue to get better over time.All that said, I have really enjoyed my time with this game thus far and it is free to download so you can try it risk free.  I am so excited for the new changes coming in February 2017 (or later depending on TrendyENT) and I can highly recommend this game to anyone that likes the idea of a tower defense game that is much more action oriented.  Since I haven’t really mentioned it, your character gears and levels up and it is very similar to diablo style games, loot based systems, where you are going to be grinding for better gear/drops so you can not only enhance your towers' defense power but also your hero power.

								Still early days as I write this, but this game is shaping up to be a winner.It is a great family co-op game.  It appeals to both men and women (at least in my family). All four of us play: father, mother, sister, brother.It is cartoony, in a colorful fantasy setting.  Everyone has a character and is always active, yet we're in it together, planning  a joint strategy to  prevent the monsters from destroying our crystal.DD2 is nice step up from the original DD.  The visuals are fantastic.  The interface seems more intuitive.Please game developers, let's have more family friendly co-op games such as this one.			"

								This is a load of crap. You want to try and tell me that this game costs $25, slap on an early access or pre-alpha tag and think you can get away with a fully functioning micro-transaction system? $50 micro transactions?! THATS NOT MICRO! YOUR FULL GAME DOES NOT COST THAT MUCH. Almost $10 for a single costume, and then more on top of that to unlock the alternate accessories? How about you guys actually focus on making and FINISHING the game instead of some cash shop items. Hell the $50 extra for the collectors edition upgrade is even more crap. 4 character skins, 4 tower skins (which aren't in the game yet) 10,000 in-game cash shop currency, and a title. You could spend that $50 and get DD1 with all of the DLC, or a 4 pack of DD1 and have even more fun with your friends.And for those of you saying ""Well this is just there way of gaining support to make the game better."" No, it's not. The collector's edition, maybe. Not this BS micro transaction crap. I already know where this is heading, there going to make the level cap high, and slow the leveling process to a halt halfway through. Then they start selling speed-ups, EXP, money, item droprate boosters. At the prices I'm already seeing I imangine they'll be $5 each, or a bundle pack for $10. Other games and other companies have pulled this same crap, and a lot of those were crucified by gamers. Just because they made a decent game once doesn't mean they should be immune to this. What happened to my character customization? Why can't I change my characters colors, put skill points into the towers and skills that I like the most? Because they monitized how your charcter looks and streamlined all forms of character building. Now you pick a character, name it, and that's all you get to do. Oh, but you get skill spheres. That's scool right? You get a total of 7 skill spheres: 3 small (stat boosters) 2 medium (tower/skill boosters), 1 large (tower/skill modifier), and 1 uber (huge boost to tower ability I guess). And that's it. That's all you get to do. There is no other form of customization, you don't get to level up skills or towers, you don't get to modify any of that crap. This is basic stuff that was in the first game. Why whould you take it away? Yeah, I get it, the game is pre-alpha (which is a BS excuse to ignore any problems people like me have considering how this game looks and plays) and a part of me really wants to like and enjoy it for what it is, but these terrible business practices will need to either change. I will not play this game ever again, and I will go back to playing DD1 as it is a more fun, enjoyable, and fulfilling experience, with or without friends. Do yourself a favor and go buy that. If you'll excuse I'm going to go put in for a refund now.			"

								6/10  For those who have invested many many many hours into the first Dungeon Defenders, heed my warning. This game is very much worse than the first Dungeon Defenders. It just does not offer much in comparison but since it is free (open alpha), feel free to try it out yourself.  I personally enjoyed this game a fair bit.This game was also very fun playing with friends and theory crafting strategies for beating maps we were having trouble on. Figuring out the most effective/efficient tower placements made it quite fun the first time around.After the initial 50 hours I started to grow quite boring and tedious to do anything and everything.The journey of getting your first max level character (level 50 at this point in time) is probably the most fun I've had in this game. Getting to max level and grinding out for the best gear you can and then replacing it instantly after climbing to the next Nightmare difficulty becomes less and less rewarding and feels like more of a chore.With everything I've said, this game is fairly fun for the first 30-50 hours. In that time you can: -Learn about the classes-You can reach max level on a character or two (or 3 if you're really diligent)-Learn about every map F I N A L   V E R D I C T All the maps are given to you and you can play them all before you ever reach max level.There is no real reward to reaching max level besides being able to start the Nightmare difficulties which are just a pain the butt and offer nothing new besides identitcal weapons with better overall stats.You get the feeling of ""Oh great now I get to grind the same maps but its even harder...woop dee friggin' doo"" I give it a rating of 6/10 and I'm listing it as a positive review because I did indeed have a lot of fun. It just gets boring with the lack of variety in ""End Game""			"

Early Access Review
 This is my third review of this game because I can not even PHATHOM why this newest update exists. With this newest endgame update, it sure did end the game for me. I don't even know where to start with this, so I'll go ahead and start with what I think the worst part of the update is about.  THE REMOVAL OF NIGHTMARE, THE ADDITION OF CHAOS So chaos goes up to chaos 5. Each chaos tier adds a brand new enemy type, ups their health and possibly even the wave sizes. Chaos 1 is extremely doable and is fair. Theeeen we get to every other chaos tier. This is where the game really goes belly up. My build is predominantly traps and auras at the moment. The reason? Almost every other projectile tower has turned into hot garbage after the update, either because they don't have enough crowd clear, attack too damn slow, or have pathetic damage. Auras and towers that are considered traps are where the real meat is, doing a decent amount of damage at a fast rate to a large group of enemies. Why did I just explain this to you? Just so you get an idea on what sort of hell you are facing on chaos 2 and above. Starting as early as chaos 2, they introduce EMP orcs. These ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s can just spawn in a lane, do a quick windup where they slam their hammer into the ground, and suddenly every aura and trap within a 5 mile radius is stunned for 7 years (give or take). See the problem here? Unless you have a 5 man team of coordinated players who manage to insta kill the EMP orcs before they have a chance to EMP your towers, you're screwed kiddo. These guys render EVE2, monk, and huntress almost entirely unusable because most if not all of their towers are some kind of trap/aura. Did I mention they spawn in more than 1 lane? If you're someone like me that only plays with 1 other player, good luck dealing with these insects before they screw up an entire lane for you. So by that point, you are almost required to use a projectile tower or at least a dryad trap with good range. Oh but wait, whats this? Chaos 3 introduces a new annoying enemy type that completely blocks all projectiles? They spawn in every lane too?! AND have 1 million health?? Looks like that plan didn't last long. Again, this might be alot easier on a 4 man team, but this is an extremely cruel punishment for solo players. Oh, and they block projectiles from some heroes too, so I hope you brought a melee hero that needs to do a large amount of damage quickly to kill it as well as have enough health to not get blended by the enemies inside of it. Chaos 4 and 5 just add more annoying crap enemies to the mix that I won't even bother going over. Chaos 5 is basically impossible while 4 is an even bigger pain in the♥♥♥♥♥than 3. But thats not all, folks! WHAT HAPPENED TO INCURSIONS AND PASSIVES Disregarding the fact that they removed entirely different balanced 4 difficulty levels, lets move onto incursions. Originally, incursions used to be unique forms of missions that had you do a specific task or kill a special type of boss. They were brutal but possible, and rewarded excellent types of unique loot. This was because they could be done on nightmare difficulties. Now, this mode is locked to hard, meaning you get abysmal tier loot that will NOT help you in chaos. If that wasn't bad enough, the passives of alot of these weapons simply do not work anymore. The MAIN POINT of these weapons were their unique passives. The midas bow's gold drench passive is entirely gone, and its fully charged m2 flamethrower attack does NO damage. The monk's staff that gave him a cloud to fly on is entirely broken and only allows you to fly for 1 second. These issues and many others have not been fixed at all 8 days after the release of the update. Which ties into my last complaint: THE 1GB UPDATE THAT CAME OUT JUST TODAY Seeing as how there was a very large update today, I thought good things were coming, hopefully some nerfs to chaos and buffs to towers.  No.The update nerfed towers. It nerfed towers. Let that sink in. Broken passives weren't fixed and the acension bug that actually REMOVES slowing percentages were not fixed. At this point the game might as well be called ""Barricades, Rams, and Flamethrowers oh my!"" because these are the only towers viable anymore. Oh wait, you don't own abyss lord because the grind for medals is an incredible slog that takes weeks before you can afford a single character? Guess you'll be playing ""Barricades and Flamethrowers"" then. The game is like a burning building right now, and they are pouring gasoline onto it before grabbing some water to snuff it out. Even after these supposed 'big changes' (http://imgur.com/rNumAbr) go live, I doubt the game will be as good as it was before the update. I want nightmare back, I want nightmare incursions back, I want passives back, I want the old game back!			"

Early Access Review
								Yet another good game doomed to fail because of a developer team that can't listen to even the most simple of feedback.Dungeon Defenders 2 was fantastic before the release of the Trials update, then everything seemed to begin snowballing downward. Not only was the initial jump from campaign mode to the new Chaos difficulty nearly impossible, but the people who managed to do not only that were punished instead of being congratulated. I'm sorry, but you don't reward players for getting to certain difficulties by randomly nerfing all the heroes and raising green mana costs on things that were just fine on their own. You do not make your new difficulty more difficult by making players weaker and making some heroes completely unviable.Another thing that the Trials update has done to doom this game is player scaling. In what screwed up universe is it a good idea to make your players feel like a burden just by playing with other people? The more people that join, the harder the Old One's Army gets. And it's not even to a challenging difficulty, a Chaos 1 or 2 map with four players is nearly impossible to beat, and it's gotten to the point where most people swear by the playstyle of ""solo or nothing"" because of how much of a burden playing with other people is. You've really messed up when people don't want to play with their friends by no fault of said friends. Trendy tried to fix this by lowering the scaling, but they refused to listen when their playerbase said ""We want it GONE"". That description I used for player scaling? It was referring to after the nerf. So even after they believed they had done good and entirely ignored their fans cries, their multiplayer-centric game still entirely discourages multiplayer.The loot scaling system is a damned mess to the point where most players in the chaos difficulty are just waiting around for the blacksmith or relic hunter to stock something that's even some semblance of an upgrade. Because apparently the very simple idea of ""Stronger enemies and higher difficulty = better loot"" is too bland and stupid for Trendy Entertainment. There are far too many stories about how players are confronted with the choice to either sacrifice all their shards because a piece of equipment is far better than what they have but has no shard slots, so they opt to just sit around and wait for the blacksmith or relic hunter to have something better. Waiting around for an upgrade despite having clearly earned it is not okay.Trendy doesn’t seem to care about proper game care, either. Reports abound of gamebreaking bugs that have been occuring for months up to a year, and what has Trendy done? Absolutely nothing. They seem to have a complete and utter disregard for things that make an online multiplayer tower defense game what it is. I wanted to like this game. But I can't care about a game if the devs can't either.			"

								It's still in early development but already quite playable. For the players familiar with DD1 it's a feast of recognition and for those new into the world of ""hybrid FPS combined with tower defenses"" there's a tutorial and campaign easing you into the game.At the moment of this writing there's only 4 characters available, the same foursome from the original. But in true spirit the characters have aged a bit and no longer look like grade-school Southpark aged characters but more like teenagers. Quite a nice detail giving you the feeling of story progression.The game is still defend a crystal (see it as a homebase) from getting damaged by angry enemies. You can do this actively by killing them with your hero (the FPS element) or using your heroes defenses, arrow shooting towers, explosive traps auras and walls/barriers.Not all is quite finished yet. The way xp evolves at the moment is still a bit unbalanced the same if you compare the ratio of hero damage versus the damage traps/towers do. At the moment there's lots of ways to share your feedback via the forum and the developers seems to take the feedback into account.It's not a finished gem yet, but from what I can tell it plays a lot better than plenty of other ""beta games"" available on steam now.So if you can live with a few issues and enjoy playing either solo (doable) or with friends (co-op) then this can be a fun game			"

								If you like tower defence gameplay and playing with your friends - this is the game for you!The game offers multiple beautiful maps in their cartoonish style and drown you with loot that you have to decide whether to keep or not. The campaign, 2 heroes (another 2 can easily be unlocked) and 3 gamemodes are completely free. My friends and I encountered few to no bugs and could always easily connect to eachother. The replay value is also good, as you keep challenging yourself and your team.			"

								Having tried DD1 for only a few hours, I felt like it was missing some things to catch my interest. DD2 has all those things.It seems like a lot of negative reviews fail to realise this is a Early-Access PRE-ALPHA release, not Alpha, not Beta, Pre-Alpha. Things are happening constantly and as of the latest update the game just doubled if not tripled in content. Helpful support, great devs who provide loads of insight into development and a mostly awesome community with great humour. Fully recommend giving it the support it deserves.			"

I'm guessing the old generation plays these kinds of games, I rarely meet any kids.Everything runs extremely smoothly with graphics and whatnot, I would however wish they made it harder to level in the future, and do the drops for rare loot even more rare, it's easy to get good gear atm, or at least that's how I feel.Easily worth the price, even with the low game-time I have.

								I've had early access for a while and other than the occasional ""I can't find my friend- how do we party?"" glitch I honestly wouldn't know it's early access. If you want a casual and fun game to play with your friends pick this up. My only critique at this moment in time is:-Trading items is not implemented in the game- YET. It will be, and honestly it's only been an issue one time out of my 7+ hours playing with friends but it has been missed.-Your armor will not change. They have icons for different slots (helm, gloves, chest, shoulder etc), but only your weapon will change appearance. I guess this is to sell skins but it makes the whole point of the game less exciting.^ they may be working on this, but I'm not sure.Other than that it's really FUN.			"

								I have changed my review from a meh yes to a no due to lack of faith in the products future.Trendy, hot tip. Fix the core game before you make more content. It only gets harder and harder to go back and make the core good the more you stack a bunch of stuff on top of it. I keep returning to find more and more stuff, but it keeps feeling of lesser and lesser quality.This means tuning controls, menus, hub worlds, visual design choices...This means returning to DD1 and finding what was so fun about that game and infusing DD2 with it.This means adding controller support and splitscreen.And this means doing this BEFORE adding a bunch of levels and characters. Go back, look at the core. Fix it, then return to adding new stuff with the lessons learned from fixing the stuff you started with.I have returned to try out this game on MULTIPLE occasions hoping it had found its stride. I have been disappointed every time. I want this game to be good, it can be good. Everything is there to make it good, but its not good. Still no Controller support, the menu's look worse than they did before. The town is still huge for no reason. I don't want to buy anything because I don't have faith in the product. Give me the faith back, dig deep and find what made DD1 great and contrast it with what made Eterny-whatever suck. Pull it out, get it together, and then kill it. I want you to succeed. I want to play that game. I will come back and look at it and hopefully change my review to a resounding thumbs up. I have been waiting to throw a bunch of money at this game since it was announced.			"

								so i have a huge issue here.  when you come in to games late you end up with no ability to upgrade or place defences. where some might be okay with this when 3/4ths of the game play is that, when you come in late or to a big group you end up swinging your wepon 2 or 3 times and nobody letting to get any kills. they will follow you from place to place defending their experience rate or some♥♥♥♥♥♥ part of my issue with that even clicking play privatly sends you to multi player where you can be joined or just flat out joining a big group. i have played solo 3 times in 23 hours of game play.  and every single time i have had to leave and try getting that solo experience again with another match because people join and it does not let me have the fun part. that being said they did well making setting up your towers fun.  if i could get a solo experience at will i would change the negative score.

								Very GoodThis is a very fun and a well-made game, the mechanics work well and it is just fun to play. Lets talk about the micro transactions shall we? Personally i think they are not that bad, you get the first for heroes for free (essentailly) then the other heroes you will hace to unlock later on. The only thing that requires you to pay are for costumes, these cost gems (or whatever they are called) and as far as i know there are no ways to get these other than spending real money.Pros+Very Fun+Variety in the different characters+lots of different maps+there are lots of people playing so its not too hard to find a matchCons-Sometimes the micro transactions feel a bit scummy8.5/10			"

								This was a great game. I bought the game when it was on alpha and it was awesome. recently started playing it again, what happened? the Golden chests you get from completing a level on hard or watever now give you SUPER AWESOME WEAPONS. Thats good right? NO. GESS WHAT, ITS FOR DLC HEROES. the game was perfect. now that its free they have to make money somehow, so how do they do it? give them super legendaries to make them buy the heroes we want. not worth the money i payed for it, but its free now. this sucks. just buy the original Dungeon defenders. its WAY BETTER than this money-making crap. at least the loot is RANDOM. here? its the same loot over and over again (im talking about the chests that offer the best loot. but the loot is for DLC heroes.

								Ok this review might be a lil shallow since i've just started today but heck who cares. Sooooooooo without further ado,Pros: Simple & Easy to learn game mechanics.Cool graphics and audio soundtracks.Challenging and requires the use of your brain to succeed. (well for solo players anyway).Awesome friendly community. (High lvlers aren't snobs).Cons:OMG the costumes are sooooooo expensive.The other class jobs are also soooooooo expensive to unlock. There are some trolls that ruin your game just to leech for free xps. (luckily u can vote to kick).The session timeout forced logout is annoying.Edit:ok after 59 hours of gameplay, finshing campaign and reaching iPWR of 700, I literally have nothing left to do in this game except playing nightmare maps. All I can say is, to all my fellow new players, finish campaign as fast as u can. Coz nightmare level is where all the fun is. I can guarantee you'll have a freaking wonderful time surviving the endless lvl500+ mobs (well not endless)			"

								Gameplay is alright, just very very repetitive, so you have to really like this kinda thing. If you want a different character you're going to have to grind for weeks or spend $15ish to buy them. The game is pretty broken, at the end of every single match the game will error me out and not send me back to town, forcing me to restart the game. But don't worry there are plenty of crappy microtransactions to make up for all the unfixed bugs.			"

								After quite a lot of time with DD2, the most important item of conversation I think should surround every review of this game is simple: Developers that listen to their players and act on it.I've been playing DD2 since closed beta early access, on and off. I'll go a few weekends playing almost non-stop, come back a 3 months later and the game is the same but different. It's always better. Little things here and there, big changes every once in a while, but always getting more polish, always getting better.That's what matters to me. They know exactly what kind of game they wanted to make and they made it, but they're open to player opinions and requests. Obviously they won't change everything based on what one person says, but if enough people share an opinion they make the change. That's really cool and is what keeps me coming back.			"

								Dungeon Defenders 2 is a fun little game to pick up and play for short bursts of entertainment. Unfortunately that's all it is in its current state. With not much depth or difficulty, the fun can quickly turn into a boring grind for gear/currency/unlockables, all of which do not make much of a difference in gameplay.Every map has been mind numbingly easy, even on the ""hardest"" difficulty, and most of them can be cleared with a single Hero's defense towers. This can make for a very boring and lackluster session. It is a shame because the Heros do have some fun and interesting choices for defense, but they're just not needed in most cases.In my opinion, with the main flaw being lack of difficulty aside, DD2 still is a great game to own and play, especially if you have some friends to co-op with. Just don't burn yourself out by mindlessly grinding and instead focus on playing for fun-like using towers you don't need just for dramatic effect!			"

								Was good when my friends and I first played it but after coming back to later they have nerfed every good weapon in the game, removed skill spheres, made inventories a hassel to deal with, reset and redone leveling, made towers useless, and added a bunch of useless♥♥♥♥♥♥that nobody wanted or needed. Dungeon Defenders is supposed to be a laid back casual game where you set up a good defense and only help towers on especially hard levels. Now with 4 lvl. 50 characters previously able to solo The Buried Bastille without broken dlc characters *cough* Abyss Lord *cough* I can now barely make it through the first couple of levels on normal difficulty without having to babysit my defenses.Also unless I have overlooked something, they have completely removed fireball towers from the game and made them all ♥♥♥♥♥♥ flamethrower towers that nobody ever liked or wanted to use.

								Ever wonders what a game is like when the focus on getting cool items in order to survive only to spin it around to where items are only 10% of your character within 6 months of gameplay? Look no further for now you can play a game where all your hours are wasted and the core concepts are rotated on a 6 month basis.  Now for the second part to hopefully captivate you, creatures that are immune to attacks from the front specifically lead the charge while a conga line stream of enemies file in close behind to make a difficult concept even worse (the new update added the shield goblins).  So please enjoy collecting medals and grinding maps to get expierince instead of items which will only be completely changed waisting the majority of the time that you invest in the game and remember Alpha is the new Beta.Spoiler- If you were to take a roleplaying game and make it where every level required 1000 exp points to earn and each MAP earned you 1 exp point this would be what you would get, it's basically a 2 tier leveling system, in the beginning they treat levels like normal games then after 50 you now have ""infinite"" growth IE complete a hard map to get enough exp for 1 ""ascension"" level and the focus is on grinding your character and not on items.

								this game is awesome just like the first game, the only issue i have with it is that internet is required to play it solo, which means youll be fighting a boss, get it to 1000 hp (about 2 hits) and the game boots you loosing you loot, exp and any patiance you have with this game. if you have internet that isnt bad i highly reccomended. if, like me, you have rubbish internet then dont bother. get the first game instead, its awesome and you can play OFFLINE! to the game developers PLEASE make an offline mode! games that can be played one player but still needs online is silly and looses some fanbase who cant play due to rubbish internet. i love this game and have hundreds of hours in the first game, so far i got to level 4 on this during which time i was kicked about 10 times in 3 hours before loosing my patiance. i will play this again one day hopfully the game devs will make it offline, at which point i will more than happily change my review and let it consume my life like the first one did.

								This game is a perfect example of what happens when a dev team makes a really good game and then decides to get greedy and make a freemium sequel. In order to get any characters except for the first 4, you have to log in a solid 20+ hours across several days to get the currency you need for them from daily missions, or simply do what they want and buy premium currency. Along with that, the daily missions suck♥♥♥♥♥ You'd expect things like ""deal x amount of damage within 10 seconds in a match"" or ""kill x enemies with y character"" but nope, the only daily missions are ""beat x maps of this theme"" It's utterly stupid. On top of that, in the first dungeon defenders game, it actually mattered that you leveled each character up, got good equipment, and played your towers correctly. Now none of that really matters. All of your characters level up together now, which makes leveling up completely pointless at all. And then to actually do anything you have to ""level up further"" through ascension which is actually completely stupid. On top of that, the level cap for you and items is 50  (although I've never seen an item above lvl 46), and in order for any equipment to do jack♥♥♥♥♥♥it needs to be upgraded, and all new equipment starts from 0. This game is an absolutely♥♥♥♥♥♥poor sequel to the first game, which was actually really good. Now, it's just a greedy company trying to get money.Oh, and one last note: the devs don't know how to balance for♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the game is absolutely FILLED with bugs and optimized horribly. I shouldn't be teleporting across my PRIVATE TAVERN when I'm BY MYSELF. Having lag when playing alone is horrendous. Oh, and the dev teams attitude towards patches sucks too. They literally will say ""we know x bug exists, but we'll address that in the next patch."" That's a♥♥♥♥♥♥poor attitude towards the literal stability of the game.Last thing I want to mention: the campaign is really ♥♥♥♥ing easy and doesn't require all the extra ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t I mentioned earlier. The campaign doesn't need you to upgrade your equipment 30+ levels to do anything, and it's easy enough to where the ""balance"" the devs try to make doesn't hurt you. The campaign itself is fun. Really fun. And it's worth going through some lag to play. I'd give the campaign experience an 8/10. The problem is that the campaign is like 15% of the game itself, where the rest of it is post game ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that requires ungodly ammounts of grinding. If you're interested in this game at all, then I definitely recommend trying it and playing the campaign, because it's worth it. After that though, just stop and play something else, because there's nothing after the campaign worth trying to do.			"

								Pro's: -If you have a group of friends, its a very fun well crafted tower defense game.Con's: -To unlock the rest of the characters available in the game you either farm for an estimate 3~5 months, get lucky and gain some gems from their on stream giveways and maybe get enough gems to buy a character, OR buy gems in a total value of 95€'s just to unlock the rest of the 6 character's. -Even if you do spend the ridiculous amount of money on it or grind out the 3~5 months just to unlock the other character's, you might get one of their famous Lost Connection type of bugs, that will plague you until you have a mental breakdown and either delete the game or re-instal it in hopes that it will fix the issue, which it may, or may not, depends on how Trendy Entertainment feels like that day.

								I'll go straight ahead:Pros:-Graphics are alright;-Runs as smooth as butter in a less than average PC.Cons:-Bugs are taking forever to be fixed;-Good weapons and combinations are always nerfed;-The devs seem to be really interested in making us players farm for the rest of our lives for crappy gear;-This game has no progression at all;-Bought this game on early access while it was not f2p and received enough crystals to buy just two characters;-Microtransactions are painfully expensive;-The UI was changed three times already and it's still really confusing and misleading on matters like levelling up characters, pets and gear;Conclusion:Devs, you should listen to your community.It would've been better if you were to follow DD1's footsteps and it's approach on DLC. Although it was nearly impossible to play the first game without DLC characters, they were cheap and everyone used to buy them. Maps were far more memorable and new content was always highly anticipated.As a matter of fact, I've enjoyed playing DD2 on it's first year, but things have come to a point that this game is nearly unplayable and you are losing more players each day.

								My boyfriend and I both downloaded the game after playing the 1st one on the 360. For him the game won't even open. hes redownloaded it and the game just never opens. For me I can get into the game but once I click one of the options on the main screen they never load no matter how long I let it sit. All in all I'm very disappointed. Hopefully this is just a glitch that will be fixed soon.			"

								Loved Dungeon Defenders 1. bought this game when it wasnt even FTP yet. started playing it now and my god what a rip offCore characters are the same but worse. the new characters are hugely dissappointing and too expensive-HUGELY! Pay To Win-Debuffed traps and other defences-Such a grind, for everything, linked to this, too big of a power gap between levels, cant even play the game on normal in one go to get the story.			"

								I would have recommended this game before the Trails Update ruined the game. It alienated the people who invested time to grind out armor in the original game by giving♥♥♥♥♥♥gems wilth little variety. There is A lot less individuality.Before:-You could have two of the same charaters with different builds, encouraging you to try different play styles for the same Character.-The Armor you received scaled the towers and charater to different builds. Allowing you to look for the gear that suits that individual charaters build (Tank, DPS, Wall, Tower DMG, Slow Tower, Debuff Tower, Anti Air) allowing for alot more grinding.-the game allowed for coordination with indiviual tower specing.Now:-You only need one Character (per Class) Because each tower is buffed by its own Talisman/Relic and your armor and weapon scale your health and damage. (Eliminating the Mulit character grinding and individual Tower Specing)-If Everyone is DPS, and Every Tower Speced where is the Individuality?-No one Needs to coordinate because everyone is speced to cover entire Lanes without help.Current Complaints:-The Mini Sheilds are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t (They Block the Phonix from the archer completely Ruining her Wave clear. The Seige Rollers dont do that)-The Gems NEED to Stack if they are the same ♥♥♥♥ing GEM.- Past Players are going to need more incentive to restart the entire game then the♥♥♥♥♥♥tier gems provided for Max level Gear. At Item Level 750 I could not play against Chaos 2 Because of the garbage gear I received. Other Comments:-I was a Fan of the Idea of Gems (Another thing to grind great!)-All of the new enemies I was happy with, besides the shield minions, If the sheild had health and could break awesome and instead of stopping any projectile that hits it.Misc:When is this game getting out of Alpha it came out in 2014?

								The game was amazing and fun to play, untill the ruined it. The last big updates changed the game for the worst. All that i've farmed all that i acomplished is worthless now. And what do i get? A bunch of useless shards. Is that what i desurve? Is that what we desurve? For what we've done for this game till now? I don't know if i'll ever go back to this game again. Couse i don't like my work to be underpriced like this. For the question why do i even bother writing this is just for that little hope that maybe, the game will go back to normal, when it was fun to play, when you spend hours with random people and just have fun. But now it's gone and i don't know if it will ever come back. For those who are thinking should you play this game i'm not gonna tell you no, but remember that who knows what will happen in the futcher. Play at your own risk. That's all im going to say, have fun if you can.			"

								Dungeon Defenders II is the sequel to the popular tower-defense role-playing game, Dungeon Defenders. Like it's predecessor it has the elements of what makes a good tower-defense game.However, Dungeon Defenders II features a all new competitive mode which I've yet to tried out. (to be updated)Overall, I'd say its feels just like Dungeon Defenders,  the environment is much more beautiful to look at and the community is more lively which is a plus.It's a great game that I would recommend to veterans / new players to the tower-defense genre.

								I loved playing this game when it was first released for early access as I was a huge fan of the original. All that was lacking was content and replayability.I came back to the game recently and it's a mess now. Although there are more missions and content to play the community is extremely small so it's hard to find groups, and even less item drops. Too much for purchase DLC for a game that is still marked as early access.			"

								TL;DR It's not too bad to play if you can look past the p2w, just don't spend money on it. Not worth it.I've played for a long time, just not always on this steam account specifically. It's a geniunely good game, great concepts and all that. But it is leaning to that p2w side of things with microtransactions and overpriced heros and kits. It's great as a free game, but seriously, don't waste your money on it. They improved from the first dungeon defenders, but they're not quite there yet. The pay to win is ruining the teamwork and skill elements because if you have enough case, you don't need to work with people or have any skill.Plus it's been early access for at least a year by now? Probably longer. It wasn't even always Free to play either, it cost $50 at one point. But seeing as now it's free, it's not too much of a waste of time,  there still room to enjoy the game to a degree. But I have a lack of free time, so I play it maybe once or twice a week? Maybe if you play it every day, you'll get sick of it sooner.			"

								damnit dd2 why.so when this first came out i really liked it i even bought the pack to get into early access but now jesus where do i start.cons.ridiculous amount of farming for a new character also the currency used to buy the character itself is also used to buy the characters ability orbs. im fine with f2p farming but this is a bit much.enemies are currently weak ... if you use the unlock characters, they are going to buff both the base 4 characters and monsters but that seems a bit away at this point.locked playstyles so anyone remember the bonus you got in dd1 for letting defenses do everything? ya even if that were in game it would be impossible... without abyss lord because he has the range to counter an enemy whos entire point is to be dealt with by playerspets are now ... meh at best RIP kobold on treadmill we knew thee well.so heres the good stuff.DEMOCRACY REIGNS, basically just by opening dd2 you get a point that you can use to vote on what thing you want next it could be a map new characters or it could be various other things i like this system a lot it does have some wierd things in how it works. (though i dont want barbarian i do feel sorry for those who do want him)actually starting to shape into something nice at this point its going away from the ""you must have all heroes on your team even solo to be able to win later on"" and going back to very powerfull heroes that can work together which i like.secondary part to the above new heroes look to be doing some pretty interesting things all around i can only hope the base 4 get to be just as cool when they get buffedfarming up levels on new characters is really easy now so you can powerlevel to your hearts contentoverall right now the game is a♥♥♥♥♥♥show with several things transitioning i really want it to be good but right now it just isnt sadly			"

								So coming from someone that played the first Dungeon Defenders way back when it came out I`m actualy glad to see a sequel that was done with such great care and polish. Great optimization, as always a nice design and detailed animations and excellent modeling. The soundtrack still keeps you in that state of living fairy tale. The dungeons are quite challenging later on and the skills still have a nice impact. You can feel your character growing in power with each upgrade. Also let`s not forget the loot: shiny, strong and eye catchy; the basis of any RPG.			"

								This is DD one with better graphics and different levels it's an enjoyable game however it should be a Pay 2 Play instead of F2P with in game transactions... I'd rather be to unlock costumes and outfits and whatnot instead of buying them. So honestly if you want a new DD experience check it out, if you want a full game with a new story and purpose this isn't for you. If the microtransactions go away and they make it Pay 2 Play I'll change my review...https://www.youtube.com/c/vezatir "

								I had such high hopes for this game. I've been playing since the paid beta and the devs have just given us broken promises one after the other. The game isn't balanced what with required meta-gaming to push into nightmare 4 (highest game difficulty) followed by being able to steam roll through the endgame whilst using that meta, unkillable or unecessarily difficult bosses in recent updates. Also, for how long this game has been in development, and how active the community is at providing bug reports, why is it that with a strong computer system and internet connection my heroes are jumping all over the map? I cannot recommend this game until basic gameplay elements that should have been fixed many patches and months ago are revised.			"

								Decent sequel to the original, which I absolutely loved, but everything is behind an endless grind wall designed to get you to spend money. This game would be much better off without the FTP model, as it really ruins a lot of the enjoyment. The two additional heroes are priced at $100, which is absolutely ridiculous. While the original had a lot of DLC, it wasn't so insanely expensive, and the base game wasn't designed to bore you into spending more money. In my opinion, this game suffers quite a lot by the switch to free-to-play, and I would not recommend it.			"

								TL;DR It's not too bad to play if you can look past the p2w, just don't spend money on it. Not worth it.I've played for a long time, just not always on this steam account specifically. It's a geniunely good game, great concepts and all that. But it is leaning to that p2w side of things with microtransactions and overpriced heros and kits. It's great as a free game, but seriously, don't waste your money on it. They improved from the first dungeon defenders, but they're not quite there yet. The pay to win is ruining the teamwork and skill elements because if you have enough case, you don't need to work with people or have any skill.Plus it's been early access for at least a year by now? Probably longer. It wasn't even always Free to play either, it cost $50 at one point. But seeing as now it's free, it's not too much of a waste of time,  there still room to enjoy the game to a degree. But I have a lack of free time, so I play it maybe once or twice a week? Maybe if you play it every day, you'll get sick of it sooner.			"

								I loved playing this game when it was first released for early access as I was a huge fan of the original. All that was lacking was content and replayability.I came back to the game recently and it's a mess now. Although there are more missions and content to play the community is extremely small so it's hard to find groups, and even less item drops. Too much for purchase DLC for a game that is still marked as early access.			"

								this is a tower defense game that you can control a hero and each hero have different towers you can construct to defend the thing you need to gaurd. your heroes have 4 set abilities that they use to kill enemies and 4 different types of towers. the towers requires green gems to build that you can get when enemies dies and in gem chests at the beginning of each wave. you can change heroes anytime you want. If you are playing solo you can organize the defense to anything you want, which towers you want and where they go. in coop mode you get paired up with 3 other people and the green gems get divided up among you all.

								As of right now, it is lag nation... And since there is no single player option, even when playing solo you still LAG, its quite ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ indeed. Its an awesome game other then the lag though, so I will still recomend this beauty, just FIX THE LAG! Please :) Some of the pros: Loot, lots and lots and lots of loots, and its not like you get amazing op gear fast, so its more like you have to work to get decent gear, which I personally enjoy. Visually, this game is a real beauty in comparison to its predecessor. Four diverse classes to choose from, and the ability to choose how you wish to play. You can focus your skill points into your character, or your characters defences (towers) or even go for a balanced build.Cons: Already toxic community, but thats every f2p game right? Lag, but again, thats expected from an initial alpha launch of a f2p game. Lack of offline single player same with the lack of LAN play, this is a HUGE con for me as this is how I play 90% of the games I play, with my wife on LAN. "

								Played the first Dungeon Defenders game and this one it just a dissapointment compared to the first one. The gameplay feels clunky and gets boring fast, everything is in your face and just doesn't feel right once you've played the previous one. Playing with another friend this game got boring after finishing 2 maps so just shows how dull they've made this game. Not only that, they add ridiculous amount of DLC, and the price of each DLC is stupid, I don't think people are wanting to pay another £20-30 per DLC, people would much rather buy the game and then that is it and not pay anymore.

								Fun with a group of friends, but not that great for soloing unless you are willing to create multiple characters. Much like Dungeon Defenders 1, interactions between towers and the involvement of the player brings a new variable to what would otherwise be a traditional tower defense game. Average run length for each map is much shorter compared to DD1 (about 20-30min vs 1hour+) and the game overall is quite short, though there is decent replay value. Visuals and gameplay mechanis are much improved but the high degree of customizability that I loved from DD1 is reduced. Relatively a worthwhile purchase.			"

								Despite its fault, I have a soft spot for the first Dungeon Defenders.I hoped the sequel would be an improvement.It is not.I had only one request : to make the combat more satisfying.I did not get it.Instead,The game is unstable, it is ""free to play"" (meaning you'll pay a lot more than you should) and you always have to connect to some social ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that nobody ever asked for...Don't fall into this trap.

								Dungeon Defenders 2 is a fun free to play game, with the option to ""pay to get ahead"". While at first glance when in game it may seem like new characters are inaccessible, that's a short term examination of the game. If every game only took two or three days, even a week to get everything in the game, you would stop playing. To start with everyone gets 4 character slots (assuming the player wants one of each class). Each character levels up when in your deck (4 hero slots, oh look less grind work) meaning when you start off and create one of each character (or whatever config you like) your first 4 heroes will reach maximum level at the same time. Simple beginnings no? After this comes getting good gear by playing endgame maps (working your way up the nightmare ladder). While you play however, you are also completing dailies, weeklies (monthlies will probably come back in a bit) and gaining defender medals. These medals can be used to unlock new characters (12000 the first two weeks for new heroes, 10000 afterwards, may eventually change) purchase special boosters (like pet love), keys (for the non paid costume and seasonal costume chests), powerful skill spheres, character slots (2000 each) or eggs (not quite yet, they are working on it). While characters might sound pricy, if you like the game you will easily play long enough to quickly obtain them and then be left wondering ""what do i spend it on next?"" The estimated time to obtain a new character at present is 3-4 weeks if your a brand new player that hasn't done any dailies. However they intend to boost the daily reward for a time from 150-250 per quest to 225 - 450 meaning that 3-4 weeks could be much shorter depending how often you play and events you participate in, giving any newbies a chance to jump headfirst in and get to the heroes they want. Overall, yes it's in Alpha, it's not the most polished or perfect game, but its damn good fun and they are working hard to make it not a product or service, but an experience that will entertain and spread enjoyment. They are aiming for 120 heroes, 6 down and 5 in the works, avg release time is one month inbetween characters. Every other week seems to be a release or event of some sort, not including special medal boosting weekends. This is my overview and recommendation of the game, hope it helps sway you in favour.			"

I've come back after every major update but I keep getting dissapointed. They've changed loot and progression a few times, but it's arguably at its worst now.There are even more problems Bad netcode, always online, servers keep timing out, confusing item and character progression, annoying controls, boring characters and more.Wait until its finished, and don't buy early access games.

I am willing, nay eager, to pay $30-40 for a sequel - but I refuse to pay for gems, points, or widgets to make a lackluster base engine shine enough to make this work. From my play experience, I swear, it's like they farmed out design and even sensibility to a foreign country for cutthroat rates.

								Great Tower Defense with a lot of freedom. Played it with some friends, had some fun.Heroes can be played various ways, tower defense, dps, one of my friends went tanky knight. I especially like the freedom of tower placement. You can place towers almost anywhere in the most bonkers placers. MIght not be efficient, but fun. In contrast to let's say Orcs Must Die where trap placement is restricted to certain places more or less (though a good game on it's own). Difficulty was alright. The beginning was really easy. Depending on the amount of people you play with it gets harder as you progress (we were not powergamers who let themselves get carried, so if you do that you might skip difficulties entirely). Overall a great game. The only thing it is lacking are maps. There are some server issues but apart from long loading times there wasn't anything serious. D3 had more performance problems than this game.There is some criticism that I think is unfair and I want to adress it from my point of view.Some say overpowered characters are locked behind a paywall. In my opinion this is simply not true. Apart from a business perspective (it's free to play afterall) we found the gathering of ingame currency quite easy. There are daily quests and can stock up 3 of them + weekly quests. The lowest amount of currency for a quest is 275 (you can reroll a quest). You need 10000 to unlock a new character. So in 30 days logging in 10 times you should have a new character.So in my humble opinion anyone who thinks this is a paywall or considers this grinding has never played a game with actual paywalls In fact while I write this review I doing my daily quests on a low level map almost completely afk.While these new characters are really strong they don't lock other characters out from content. We did all content perfectly fine with the original 4 heroes. There is a balance patch coming in a few days that is supposed to bring the old heroes on par with the new ones. I really like this approach. Other developers opt for the other way. For example Path of Exile (a Diablo-esque grind ARPG) does the exact opposite. They nerf their content until it is no longer playable.We were satisfied. It was fun and we are sure to check back when there is more content.PS: Yes, the store prices are bonkers and I hope they restructure them once they get more content rolling out. "

								Take this review (like you should with all reviews) with a grain of salt. I played Dungeon Defenders 1 back in the day on the Playstation with my bro and enjoyed it greatly. When DD2 was announced, I had a trip of nostalglia back ot the good ol' days. Initially, I got a chance for early access and didn't really like what I saw. There was so many issues with it, it wasnt worth the time or effort to play.Fast forward, I'm now playing this game with my bf and his friends and I really enjoy the game again. Its really not a game for lengthy play throughs though. I get easily bored of the same maps after a while and can predict where all the major issues with waves come into play.That being said, its still a great game and still a good strategy tester. I even love the predictability of the waves which allow me to mess around with different characters and their tower strategy. This game has room to grow and has shown that it can grow. Dungeon Defenders will always have a spot on my game shelf.			"

								tl;dr: Life's too short to expose yourself to this level of amateurism and immature design.Elaboration: I'm a huge Tower Defence and RPG fan. Childish and immature artwork irritate me greatly, but due to the former I was willing to look past that. I wanted DD2 to be good so badly that I've played it more than 100 hours, yet ended up enjoying little of it.It used to be decent. Childish, simplistic and casual, but also refreshing and unique. The servers were always a mess, bugs were everywhere and the game's UI was horribly inefficient and lacking in important information/functions.Since then, they've pushed for more content updates, ignored all the game's problems and implemented a Shard System which is so horribly unappealing and unusable that whoever designed it should be fired for gross incompetence.This is the last time I'll ever look back at this game, and probably the last time I have to: It's dying. Good riddance, moving on.			"

								I played the first dungeon defenders back in the day, was on console at the time and enjoyed every minute of it. This game on the other hand is unplayable, i have had nothing but problems when launching the game. i feel as though the game would be good if you could launch it and play it. Not only are there problems with launching the game but connection is terrible. you get error codes whenever you try and leave a lobby or make a new lobby for you and your friends. if they could work out the bugs i would change my review but frankly i think the game is absolutely terrible and is beyond saving.

								ungodly♥♥♥♥♥♥ servers, you load in without being able to open the box if you are in someones party, sometimes when you get disconnected and try to rejoin a party you enter with a phantom you in the party and fall continuously into infinity. You will have to exit the entire game and relog in to fix it.	♥♥♥♥♥♥ server coding that makes you use so much bandwidth to access any games it actually borks itself and makes you get a connection issue even after you are in the game. You can also get a match making error that pops up when you try to leave a party. So...yes. You get a connection issues for leaving the server host? ha. When you are in a game and change characters it has a random occurance to kick you out and tell you your login session expired and you have to restart the game to play. It will also do this on other occurances that tell you someone else is logged into your account. Sometimes your spheres won't equip and the network inconsistency makes it so you have to try and try until it works. When you switch characters some of the previous models will be stuck inside the other characters.There are a million problems with this game yet content is being released over the absolute nonexistence of server stability. For a game on unreal you would expect it to run better, but no. No it doesn't. Needless to say there is alot of content to observe! This is the kind of roller coaster of a game where it's so fun you go again even though the sick guy in the front keeps puking all over everyone. when you are ending a map and getting the chest if you change characters it has a 3in5 chance to randomely kill you.

								I've stuck with this game for over a year, have been very active on the steam forums and after 600+ hours of play, am very familiar with it.The short version is: I can't recommend this game to anyone.The long version is:BugsThe devs don't prioritize fixing the game at all. Bugs that have been in the game for over a year persist, broken meta goes unchanged for 8+ months, etc.They started a site dedicated to reporting bugs, that has pages and pages of bug report threads that never get addressed vs the very few pages of things that supposedly got fixed, and of those a lot of them reoccur. There's even things that are clearly broken, but they refuse to fix because they deem it ""working as intended"".The most infamous one is the ""back to tavern"" issue, where if just 1 player out of 4 picks it, and the other players had picked ""replay"", it will ignore what the other players wanted and force them to town, which for some people will also go into the ""falling off the world"" glitch or the ""infinite loading"" glitch.They refuse to acknowledge that the ""back to tavern"" thing is an issue because they meant it to work like that, even though a far better solution would be to just make the players that pick that option break off the party and return to the tavern on their own while the rest just replay.The most random things will break during updates as well, often when adding a new map, skills or abilities will stop working. Every update breaks far more than it ever fixes.Unethical treatment of players/customersThe main reason I give up on this game is because the devs have no respect for the time the players put into the game.The game has 3 currencies: Gold - used for upgrades, but kinda worthless otherwise.Medals - harder to get, used to buy new characters, exclusive pets, keys to the free cosmetics, boosters. Has a cap of 12000 for some reason.Gems - Normally only obtainable with real money, but a small amount is given as a 1 time only rewardOn the campaign revamp update, the devs made it so that new players could earn 5000 medals by the time they finish it. Veteran players were denied those with no real justification.On the trials update, the devs decided to remove spheres, some of which cost medals, between 250 and 5000 of them. Instead of refunding the players' medals, they gave them gold instead of the medals the players had earned, which is an unacceptable substitute as it's easily obtainable by playing the game normally.The same update revamped the inventory system, and if you previously had bought a bag with gems (which is the currency that you buy with money), you could had potentially ended up with the same storage space as someone who just started playing.Again, no refund.Both were situations that could had been VERY easily solved with very few lines of SQL. So we have to conclude they did this intentionally.The game runs entirely server sideProbably to prevent cheating, the game runs on the server. You client merely sends instructions to the server.The problem with this is that if there's any lag between you and the server, the gameplay is jittery, and your character will teleport around, often flinging you off cliffs. The netcode, if there is any, is awful.Moving can feel awful, and sometimes you're so afraid to teleport around you don't want to move.It's very likely the devs don't play their own gameOn Xmas 2016, they introduced a new enemy by surprise: a siege roller. This enemy isn't invincible, but was riddled with bugs and caused a ton of issues.Some skills just didn't work on it.It forced a tedious meta on all players for almost 3 months.Some heroes simply could not deal with it.It would instantly destroy trap type defenses, which is half of the defenses in the game.They would spawn as a replacement for ogres, but where nowhere near as easy to deal with, making the difficulty absolutely random, and for some players, potentially unbeatable.The hitbox was almost inside the damn thing, and hard to hit with melee characters.They put that into the game, and went on vacation the next day. Not that it matters because once they got back, they still didn't fix it til 2+ months later.On another update, the devs made poison dart towers (PDTs) extremely overpowered. a week or 2 later, they nerfed them, but they still remained the most powerful defense in the entire game, trivializing every map/difficulty for over 8 months.This was reported in playtesting, and several times on the bug report site (the poison from PDTs would stack twice for some reason), and they just let it ride like that.Art direction is becoming inconsistentThis is minor, I'll admit, but it's worth noting. And it's not just the art, but also the animations.For months, rather than fixing bugs, the devs seemed oddly focused on releasing new heroes.However, it started becoming more and more noticeable that they were cutting corners. For example, the models for the lavamancer, mystic and dryad could not look up and down like the other heroes, as a result they could attack in those directions either.The towers for the mystic and the dryad only have 1 model and don't change with upgrades.The dryad's hero model in particular doesn't match any of the other females in the game (proportions), and is really tall for some reason. However her portrait is astonishingly bad and looks like something out of a crappy newgrounds flash game.If the art style is what attracted you to the game, don't expect them to keep it up because the artist that did the first few heroes and bosses/enemies isn't working with them anymore.It's not a very fun game once you're in the endgameThis is actually a rather slow paced game and kinda tedious.Getting to the later difficulties is a challenge, and that's fun. But, being in the endgame for months with no challenge made me realize that this is a slow game, and essentially not that fun.The trials update might replace the very little skill is in the game with grinding, and that honestly sounds even worse.

								When I played Dungeon Defenders 1 on the X-box 360 I enjoyed it, until it came to multiplayer and experienced nothing but hackers and modders. However here in Dungeon Defenders 2 I can honestly say that I have found my new haven in the video game community. In my first week of playing I felt all of the nostalgia from DD1 rush back. I quit many other games that I had invested (easily) hundreds of dollars in, to start this game and dedicate myself to the immersive game play that Trendy (and Etheria, the Realm they created) are known for. The game is, hands down, on the top of my list for games. I have invested (proudly, I might add) to the continuation of this games developement. This is the open Alpha, and there is nowhere to go but up for this game.Obviously, the game is Grind intensive, but you get out of this game what you put in. In my first week I had 5 level 50's and 700 iPwr on each of them.Overall, I heavily recommend DD2. I hope that our friends here at Trendy continue the great work and continue to amaze us with new content. Happy Hunting!			"

								The game had potential.The problem is the devs are trying to distinguish DD2 away from DD1 even though DD1 was a beloved game.  Unfortunately this has lead to removing many of the fans favorite things from DD1 and focusing on things in DD2 that are not being well received.Unfortunately with the most recent update, they have doubled down on the things the population seems to dislike.  It is simple.  Increase difficulty that counters the player, not adding difficulty that counter playable content (towers).  So many buildables are now useless.  People want this to be a tower defense game, not an action adventure game with a side of tower component.  I had hopes they would get it right with the recent update, and while I think the shards and ascension were a good addition, the new mobs, rebalancing decisions, and overall design/direction have truly hurt, if not destroyed, my future with the game.I held out for as long as I could.

								Developer: Trendy Ent.Publisher: Trendy Ent.Genre: Action Tower DefenceThe emperor of the Action Tower Defence games is back. Help your friends, build towers, auras and traps; repair and upgrade 'em. Get back to endless waves of♥♥♥♥♥kicking fun!In the first installation of the series, we were playing as the Little Defenders ( sons and daughters of the real heroes). These little heroes defended the Eternia Crystals and put an end to the Evil's plans but just when these littlelings lost all their power and hopes at the end of the first game, their beloved parents came to rescue at the right time and defeat the evil of the evillest.With Dungeon Defenders II, the developers giving us the ""Real"" heroes and their real adventures. Oracular graphics, incredible character models and wondrously designed maps and gameplay mechanics that mostly operating like cogwheels; these are also what they are throwing at us. And as a Early Access it stand out like a sore thumb among others.Lets start with seperating facts of DD1 and DD2:-DD1 adopted the simplest co-op game formula; buy the game and its ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of DLC's. DD 2 will be free when it is released ( People who bought the game before f2p release get cosmetic items, in-game crystals for costumes and some other premium gifts)-DD1 has cell-shade and simple graphics. DD2's graphics are resembling a good animation movie, it has cartoon/animation like graphic concept.-DD1 use mana as currency, DD 2 differentiate mana and currency. Now we have gold coins $$.-DD1 just have 1-2 basic costume per character and you need to buy DLCs for them. In DD2 we have evolving and much more detailed costumes ( even at this stage, there are many compared to DD1), which you can buy with real money currency.-DD1 has tons of DLCs, (it is not %100 clear but) developers thinking of earning money from cosmetic items like MOBA's and supporting the game with free expansions.-DD1 has offline private option. İn DD2, you need to be online even though you are playing solo.Yes DD2 has core mechanics from the first installation; but it looks better on the surface, it feels better when you play it and it is much more refined than most of the other Early Access' and DD1. Let's get to pros and cons part:+ Will be F2P!+ Fantastic graphics and colour palette+ Refined gameplay mechanics ( developers are trying to make it much more stable )+ Developers that are listening to us.+ Good animations and rigging+ As a pre-alpha, it has less bugs than a lot of open beta phase games.+ Fun to play, get repetitive after some time but not boring.+ Except a few trolls, the community is awesome.+ Constant updates and hotfixes.- Minor graphical bugs- Some balance issues between classes- Pet system needs some work- 4 towers per character constrain some tactical elements- As of now, the content game has falls a little short.I think i managed to summerize what you can expect from the game at this stage. Hope it helps :)TL;DRGame is solid, but falls short on content. If you are not sure about buying this and haven't played the DD1 before, I suggest you to wait for it to be released for free.			"

								Lets try to make this quick. I have played DD but not DDE.This review is also written from Pre-Alpha. (7-30-2015, [m-dd-yyyy])Also I have only play Monk lvl 25 and Apprentice (Mage) lvl 15~Pros:+Great gameplay, smooth and good flowing combat feel+Matchmaking better than it was in DD1+Funny story line, Most NPCs even though 1 liners right now I already feel like they have some sort of tale to tell+Loot loot loot. (sometimes too much?)+Keeps the cartoon style of DD1 but slim and tall instead of short and stalkyBias+ I enjoy the pet system of having to hatch your pet from an egg, feels more of a pet than equipmentCons:-Still early access ofc-Premium currency? even if it isn't P2W so far (It is looking like $1 = 100 runes and cheapest skins are 400, 800, and 1600 runes so skins are not extremely expensive and a nice way to support the devs)-Once you get about the last 5 campaign lvls its hard to find people playing them in MM-You have to finish campaign before dailies/monthly (this is only con because its hard to find people for last 5 missions)Conclusion:Buy this game if you're interested and have the money. If it is on sale just buy it you'll enjoy at least a few hrs of play.This game is still in Pre-Alpha which for most games out there it looks pretty much done. For full price of $24.99 It is worth the 11hrs I've played so far. (The week I write this it is on mid-week madness sale of $15) The only bugs I've really had to deal with in my hrs of play is the Drakins will get stuck on small senery and they update almost every time I want to play :PEdit: After about 20-30 minutes of posting this review I had a DEV! comment. A++ they're asking players how the game is and getting our feedback to know how to make it better. I can no longer recomend this game more now. If you enjoy any kinds of games that are cartoony and/or dungeony and/or deffending Buy this game.			"

The passives were all removed from weapons with a replacement system called shards that socket into the gear pieces, sadly there is no list of shards and no information given about being able to return some of the effects that they gear pieces originally had removing even another layer of uniqueness from the game. The game now feels very bland.			"

								 I'm sorry I know I don't have too many hours in this game as it is but I played this game before the update made on 02/28/2017... I loved the game back then I was excited to play it but the new update literally killed this game for me! For instance one of my favorite towers was the Flameburst Tower. It did an excellent amount of damage and it did decent AOE when it hit. It was butchered to the Flamethrower Tower which now has pitiful range awful DPS and no AOE damage. The towers of the Apprentice pretty much stayed the same but now it just doesn't feel the same.  Next we have one of the other character's I loved to play the monk. His boost aura, Lightning Aura and Serenity aura were all must haves on the battle field. The Boost Aura allowed towers to become even more powerful and finish enemies quicker and easier!  The Serenity Aura healed team mates who were low on HP but didn't have enough time to get out of combat and heal up. The Lightning Aura was an AMAZING AOE tower that did a good amount of damage to anything inside of its aura. You could pair this up with the Barracade from the Squire and be set!  Now here's the thing... All three of those towers were amazing on their own... How did they screw it up? Change the previous Boost Aura to the Flame Aura, give it Lightning Aura's AOE effect but make it worse then what it did previously. Change the Serenity Aura to the NEW Boost Aura which gives pitiful amounts of boost to your towers. Seriously I couldn't tell the difference between a boosted and non-boosted tower! It's horrible! And then the kicker than may make me never want to touch Monk ever again, they change the Lightning Aura to the Lightning Strike aura... They got rid of the AOE storm damage of the amazing Lightning Aura tower and replaced it with a very slow, very unreliable, single strike tower. It doesn't do AOE and the damage it does if it even fires at all is awful! Why did they change what was so much fun to play in the first place?!  As I said they changed a lot in this patch already right? But there's one last thing they changed that I might never want to touch this game again because of... That would be the fact that they got rid of Skill Spheres, which were amazing in their boosts and quite useful in certain play styles, got rid of stat points, and replaced all of it with shards. SHARDS THAT GIVE SO LITTLE BOOSTS IN YOUR EQUIPMENT THAT THERE ARE NO NOTICEABLE DIFFERENCES WHATSOEVER!! They spat in my face when they refunded my Skill Spheres! This new shard system is not only confusing and doesn't help in the slightest but its also takes up so much inventory space! Granted you get a lot of inventory slots but that doesn't change the fact that Shards are useless with their minuscule stat boosts and their unappealing system.  Overall, this used to be a good game... I loved it so much and it was such an amazing one that I thought would last me a long time. The only reason I even got it was because of the Terraria crossover which was amazing. But after this recent update all my drive of playing this game again is gone. I'm sorry Trendy Entertainment but you butchered your game so much that I don't want to play it again until everything goes back to the way things were before the Endgame Update... They got rid of what Dungeon Defenders 2 fun and interesting to play for me... And that's something I just can't forgive.			"

Early Access Review
								Stopped playing this game before terraria update, the current update made me want to come back and check things out and like a lot of people I didn't read the patch notes about gear being changed to all hero type gear except for relics being tower gear. Honestly that doesn't bother me that much and them changing the meta was fine with me. Before the update I was one of those people who did use the pdt and serenity build and if I had to create a whole new build for this update I was absolutely fine with that but as of right now I wouldn't say the game is unplayable but I just don't feel that sense of progression or feel like im getting anywhere even though I had some ipwr 750 gear pre-update. My biggest gripe with the game currently is with offensive towers where they at this point really can't kill anything on even chaos 1 and in order to kill most enemies I have to dps them down with a hero. Now I am generally a solo player so me having to dps is normal anyway I rarely afk in my own game so having a dps is fine but as of right now with the offensive towers being as they are to where I am legitimately doing most the work is wrong for a tower defense game. One major gripe is defense range, I'm not saying that they should roll back to the defense range it was before the update but this currently needs to be looked at because this update was suppose to make it where any dps hero can also be a builder but with offensive towers being how they are this doesn't seem viable. Although there some towers that will work it like the AL ram tower and apprentice firethrower tower and couple other ones it feels like unless you use these towers or have the heroes other then the original four your out of luck. Another thing is the inventory currenlty needs to be reworked since right now it is too clunky and messy this isn't too much of problem though in honestly since they do have a search but still needs to be looked at.  As of right now I will still play but not as much as before and right now I can't recommend this game until they rebalance offensive towers and fix up the inventory UI.Contiuation after Patch 19.2:So before this hotfix I was able to clear c3 decently while dpsing solo with my gunwitch and using dryad world tree and nimbus, huntress pdt for anti air, and abyss lord ramsters. After this patch though they have made things worst and not what everything was wanting which was to make the other towers more viable again.Instead of getting tower buffs for the towers not being used we get a cost to upgrade nerf to the world tree, severe damage nerf to the nimbus and the standing near tower DP shard nerf, damage of PDT is even nerfed more with crit chance reduced. Also the emp orc they made it even worse seemingly increasing its emp range and making ti stun on every attack now. So now in terms of offensive tower the only viable towers seemingly are the ramster or the flamethrower, for blockade at this point I would say either use which ever you can get to highest HP and upgrade quick. In terms of anti air I don't even know because I was using PDT as my anti air but now you might have to switch to skyguard which has a pretty low attack range and that is with a good bit of range points in Ascension.So sum up this hotfix all it did was just nerf some viable towers even more and buff enemies. At this point I don't believe they are even listening to the community or even really addressing the feedback from the community. I was one of those that was hoping for better changes but with this update I have lost hope in what they believe are fixes and balances to their game.So based upon this hotfix I still will not recommend the game still unless towers become more viable and the only time I will spend on this game currently if at all is only on doing the medal daily or weekly only.

								Until the last update game was beautiful.What we have now:-Removed All unique properties on the objects (weapons), it is now all the same with the same runes.-Removed All unique,with different talent builds (spheres), is now ♥♥♥♥ing stones are inserted into all subjects and at all identical.-You Can play one character, there is no point at all in the other.-You Loved Goblin roller? Well then, here 10 new mobs with shields.-Instead Cheerful Insorsions you stayed only a useless defense mode.-To More or less normal play on a new difficulty u want to farm and farm more, i cant login after work to relax and play 1-2 hours.-The Game is now replete with a million bugs, like the mobs pass through the tower (to push each other in the back) and unemployed Askension points (see the glory of Diablo 3 and other similar games is haunted by developers).Thank you very much for this developer, I'm out.

								Good game. Reminds me of warframe because of all the work it takes just to get a new character. This game kind of gets grindy as you progress pass all of the levels and only have the choice to grind for a better weapon or wait for another update which is accually a good idea considering the devs release new content just as frequently as every week. But I shouldnt be complaining, the game is in early access. But it will never gain the charm the origanal had.			"

								I liked the first Dungeon Defenders a lot. It's one of the most played games on my Steam account. I've only played a little bit of the sequel so far, but man, I am struggling to find any enjoyment in it.  The structure is mind-boggling. The focus on online/social taverns, extremely limited quick match options with no server browser, having to load back into the tavern in between every map in the campaign? What are the developers thinking? Forcing everyone to be online all the time and giving us no control over who we match up with leads to every game being half full of afk players or max level characters who are wiping the floor with the low level maps for some reason.At least when playing solo in a private game, I finally get to stop and look at the maps and use some strategy. But even then if I exit out of a map and try to do another one, I run into errors saying that I have made too many matchmaking attempts recently and to wait a few minutes. Can't even play the game alone. Thanks Trendy.I cannot recommend this game at all in its current state. If a loot and stat-based tower defense/action game sounds appealing to you, I would highly suggest playing the first game instead.			"

								This game would be great but....1.) you are constantly thrown in empty servers2.) the player base is full of people that don't understand strategy as basic as ""if you put up walls so they are forced to stand in a high damage AOE they will die quickly""3.) People constantly leave games if they aren't full, an absolute rarity 4.) Once people have left there is no way, that I have found yet, to easily report them. This goes for spamming, griefing, etc.5.) This is a game that should not be played alone. The same fun as playing an entirely dead MMO. GW1, my baby, i'm looking at you.IF these problems get fixed from alpha this will be a great game. Not too buggy and fun game play. I prefer the fantasy vibe, but Sanctum 2 is executed better IMO. If you are willing to hold out, do it. If you want fun now and not in an unknown amount of time, play Sanctum 2.			"

								Honestly, half the not recommend reviews are just plain stupid. The game is great and has no paywalls. New heroes? You can get them by playing the game! I know, shocking. And no - Just because you can't get something within 5 minutes doesn't mean it is bad. Oh and the DLC you see that may turn you off from the game? Not a single one is what I would count as ""True DLC"", 2 of them are for people who wish to support the game (Defender & Starter pack) and the other ones? Skins or bag slots. They aren't making new content that you have to buy, they are selling skins. Stuff that the art team can make if they have no work to do.And for anyone who mentions how the game is still in early access? Yes, cause y'know, games take time to make. Not every company has 100 workers or whatever and can produce a game out every second. Can I recommend DD2? Yes, as my review says. I have yet to run into any problems so far - Not to say there aren't any. But early access is early access - You can't download/buy stuff like that and not expect bugs. Content doesn't come out super quick, but the devs also aren't silent like other devs. They may not post something every day, but they do keep us updated on stuff. DD2 gets my thumbs up.P.S. For anyone who thinks you should get all the new heroes for free because you bought into the game, you are stupid. You got what you payed for.			"

								I will be writing this post from the point of view of a player that has never played Dungeon Defenders I.This game is pretty much Sanctum meets Diablo and Borderlands.It is a pretty looking FPS (first person shooter) set in a tower defense game. The game itself is mainly centered around loot. Getting weapons, armor and pets which upgrade your hero(es).Pros:•	Pretty looking visuals.•	Fun loot system (rarities, traits, certain map/mission bound loot).•	Great co-op play with friends or random other players.Cons:•	Lack of/bad difficulty scaling. It will be impossible to beat a difficulty higher than hard with a low level character as it does not scale with your level but instead is set to level 50.•	Bugs. Lots and lots of bugs. For example: People joining private lobby sessions, loot being sent to bags which have autoloot disabled and many more.•	No support for Borderless Windowed mode (alt tabbing is a pain and might get your cursor stuck).•	“Early access” after two years of release. Feels like an excuse to not do/delay bugfixes.•	Pricing of “DLC” and currency. While the game is free to play, I would consider paying 20 Euros for some stuff. However that would be able to get me a single character. In order to buy all “year 1” characters I would have to pay 60 Euros, the price of an AAA game title. As long as the prices stay this way I will not make a single purchase.•	Currently unobtainable currency locks skills in certain stores.•	Very slow free to play progression for additional heroes. Your first 10K medals costing hero can be bought in about a week due to campaign rewards. After that you will be getting like 300 medals a day for daily quests on average while heroes still cost 10K medals.•	Goblin Siege Rollers.While this game has issues, lots of them, I will still be giving it a thumbs up because I simply enjoy the (free to play) gameplay, and that is the most important thing about a game.

								From the few minutes I've played and the trailers, I can already see this game took a wrong turn at the intersection. If you were a fan of the first Dungeon Defenders, this game is like a whole new game. The art style and graphics were completely changed, and now it's a leveling up grind. Almost all female characters are sexualized, making the game feel more unconfortable. This is not what I expected from Dungeon Defenders 2. Go ahead and try it, after all it's free. I can't say I reccomend it, but don't let my words stop you from giving it a go.			"

								While I was very excited about this game when it first became availible. I Played and enjoyed the game quite a bit. However the constant add on and change of mechanics and gear has turned the game south. If i had to say 1 thing turned me away is the wait for OVER A YEAR on split screen co-op on pc. Devs say it is comming but we have yet to see it. In the meantime though they have managed to further progress the game by developing new endgame and characters. But why trendy would you CREATE the same game for xbox and ps4 with split screen co op as a basic feature and not give it to us on PC.  IMO you have shown at least me you do not care for your PC playerbase and not only will not give them things that console gets even though we are the original platform developed for. No split screen co-op means time to give up on this franchise.			"

								Don't listen to any of the people writing reviews who have less than 100 hours played.It is not pay2win and it can't be since it is coop.Everything you can buy with real money can be achieved with just playing the game - including skins and new characters.(only some special skins are exclusive but they don't have any perks)Dungeon Defenders 2 is a good game with nice developers who do their best to enhance everyones experience with it, has a great, friendly community, and it is completely free to play.

								As soon as I started the game, it stoped responding. So I try the next day, the exact same thing happens. So I look for help online, and nothing fixs it. So I give it a final try on the next day and it works, the game launched and i was able to play, and the game is so buggy that it was practically un-playable. The controls were awful, it ran at a consietent 15-fps, the enemies looked generic as did the characters, and the best thing is that when I finnished the introduction stage, the game crashed, AND IT WOULDT LET ME ESCAPE. So I turn off my computer and try to open the game again, it dosn't respond and I'm all the way back to square one.			"

								i have a deep passion for games that have charm,an rpg tower defence game with different classes wich have different ways of being played?sign me up!its like the first game but more advanced and the ''kids'' have grown up to be late teens  / early 20's.there is an RNG system here wich makes it a little grind heavy, (RNG is basicly a system that haves you desiring items and they're not dropping)i feel however that the monk's boosting abilities for other towers is not really that great, the monk in general feels weak to me.i play as a tower mage on my first playthrough.as it stands in this stage, i like it!co-op only though solo kills the mood for me "

								Don't like the free to play aspect. I would have gladly paid $60 for a better experience. I recall annoucements that you would only be able to pay for asthetic items, nothing that would make the game easier. Well you have to pay to have more than 4 heroes and pay for more inventory. I personally am not dumping in the money pit. As far as content goes, only 4 heroes(which is understandable with early acess), but who knows if you would have to pay for some hero packs when those come out. Tower changes for each class which is refreshing. Not that i didn't like the old towers but something new like that is good. Maps are terrible. There is no challenge on a build. The enemy paths are so short that you could literally build anywhere and win. Armor does not show up on your hero, so you will buy costumes. Again, i would have gladly paid money for the game to have that capability and avoid a money pit. Costumes, as of right now, aren't that great. A couple of good ones for a couple heroes. Huntress costumes are garbage in my opinion. Amount of content is lacking and bugs are present. I wouldn't expect anything else from even a game that was just realeased let alone an early access. The deciding factor for me is this has been in alpha for over a year. Seems like progress is going to be very slow considering they were working on it before it was released for early access. But don't worry, the money pits are up and functional so you can dump some money in. It is free to play so it's not like you are going to regret the decision to download, but not worth the time for me.			"

								I must say. I very rarely make any kind of reviews off of games. But this is something that i just have to do.I bought this game when it was about 19,99€ on steam so i could support them. Played it a little bit. Had fun for like 1h. And realized that this game is actually just a horrible copy from the original dd. Now that it's free. You may ask: ""Well did you get anything from supporting them in the beginning?"" Well. I got absolutely nothing from it. So i literally wasted 19,99€. Oh and now this game is full of these stupid f*cking microtransactions. So i literally paid 20€ for a game that is FULL of microtransactions. It's pretty much the same as me paying 20€ for clash of clans. And i absolutely hate games that are full of microtransactions.So is this game good? No. It's not. And don't waste your time on it. Unless you for some reason like to be robbed cause of microtransactions. OVA i would say 2/10			"

Most polished Alpha game I've ever played, it should be a Beta in this state!Bare in mind, I didn't play the first game, so I don't know how it compares.I love this game, and I can't wait to see more people play it. It's about to go free to play (as intended) on October 13th. This game, blends together tower defence, and an arpg together into one game. You can play as a monk, a squire, a huntress, and an apprentice. With the hero deck system, you can swap between 4 characters (or more, if you buy the slots). Each hero has 4 abilities and 4 different tower types, and each hero has it's own specializations. Each of them feel unique and fun to play. The graphics, the art styles, and the soundtrack are all amazing. The gameplay itself is also really great, and I have yet to see any gamebreaking bugs even in this early alpha stage. Pros:+ graphics+ sound+ gameplay+ loot/pets!+ classes/abilities+ Really fun to stratagize with friends!+ Steam integrationCons: - Needs more weapon styles especially for Apprentice- Needs a better way to level 40 - 50 instead of grinding same map- Could use more maps/gamemodes (which I'm sure will be added)- Could possibly use an explanation for Hero Stats. (when I first started I had no idea what to focus on)- No trading system or player market yetIf you buy it before the 13th, your money will help develop this awesome game, and you'll get premium currency and other goodies. If you wait til it goes f2p, well, try the game out! It's very addicting and tons of fun. Thanks for reading! :) "

Early Access Review
								I played DD1 and loved every second of playing.  I was extremely excited about DD2 but when it came out as a MOBA, it bombed royally!  I was extremely disappointed with this and even paid money to support their plans to change it back into its original gameplay.  Instead of redoing the game, it appears they kept some coding and left a bit of a MOBA game play.Here are my issues with the game.1. Time - It’s been years and this game is still in alpha/Beta testing.  Extremely disappoint considering how much time it’s been.2. Price for heroes - The price for heroes jumped from $2-$5 to $99!!!!!  What were you thinking?3. Maps - The maps are just wonky to say the least.  A whole wide hallway and one blockade in the center can stop them?4. Towers - Some hero towers are either underpowered (mage) or overpowered (Lava mancer).  One Volcano can hit an entire map from the center of the playing field.  What’s the point?5. Gear - Your gears IPwr is off.  One level 50 green with less stats have higher IPwr levels than a level 50 Mythical with more stats.  This makes no sense.6. Heroes - You limit the heroes to four unless you pay more money.  Not even LOL, Warcraft, Clash of clans, or other iOS games do this.  If I am going to pay money, then you better offer me something great in return not BS costumes!7. Costumes - its overkill!  Fix the game and make it actually work instead of playing dress up with your hero.8. Abilities - The old abilities are gone and replaced with junk abilities which require mana that cost too much and feel like a MOBA game.  9. Mana - The mana is way too small to see and having everyone run around the entire map just to collect mana that only they can see is annoying.  If Player 1 already covered an area, why does player 2 have to run that same area to get mana.10. Mana - The amount of Mana a player receives is way too low.  11. Pets - You no longer receive pets like last time, instead you have random drops with random stats, with random eggs, and no real way to farm.  it’s all just luck.  Which really sucks12. Bags - I have 12 bags or so with 16 slots and scrolling and trying to organize them is a pain and a hassle.  No real way to organize all your gear, instead you have to play move and shuffle just to get gear in the right place.13. Tutorial - you really get no tutorial on anything, it all just click and figure out on your own and hope you don’t lose anything.14. Towns - You get randomly disconnected from town because a host has left.  Why do I have to rely on a host for a town meetup, shouldn’t this be a server hosted town and not based on someone’s connection.  Does this mean that one person’s PC is hosting all our heroes at once?  Seems crappy.15. End of map - You have to wait for all players to make a decision before replaying the map or going to town.  if a player disconnected or leaves the session before you all press G, you all have to wait for the countdown to be over before you can go to town.  Seems like a complete waste of time.16. Hero’s orbs/Spheres - The cost is too high and the abilities are too low.I can go on and on about how much this game is nowhere near game ready.  I recommend either waiting to even see if this game will finish or just going back to DD1.  As of right now, I cannot stand playing this game anymore.  I have four toons, all 680 ipwr levels and am bored with farming maps that have no real direction.   "

								Pay To Win game. The best deal is $100 for 12,500 Gems. You convert gems into items in this game. To get a pass into the Dragonfall Carnival for a chance at Epic Items you need to pay 150 gems. This game used to be okay but after it went the route of PTW, it lost any chance to be a great game. Pity.PROS1. CampaignThere are 16 levels for you to play, ranging from Level 1 to Level 40 (Max).2. Dragonfall CityThe Tavern, the Personal Room, the City, the Catapults and all the Merchants make the game look great.CONS1. Pay To WinYou can pay cash to get Legendary items ahead of other players. PTW just spoils the game.2. Spin The Wheel for ItemsThis is a PTW mechanic. You either use 10 tickets that come from drops or spend Gems.3. Low Player CountFor a 4-player game, there are really few players.			"

Лучше: + Ну все таки добавли еще героев и возможность кастомизации их.+ Добавили больше серверов.+ Сделали ее халявной.+ Чутка улучшили графику.+ Сдели уровни менее пожожими друг на друга+ Сделали более менее баланс героев.Хуже:- Ну это донат, он как был так и остался.- Сервера лагают.- Добавили ИМБА героя.- Графика может быть и лучше стала, но она не оптимизирована.- Так и не добавили возможность отображения вещей на герое (те которые ты выбиваешь на уровнях)			"

								Ok, so lets get a few things straight, and excuse my spelling. Dungeon Defenders 2 has essentially become P2W in a way. it's also become pretty grindy, but it is still a fun game. Sure it has many flaws and bugs, but if you can ignore them, it's actually quite enjoyable, although the time it takes to buy the Abyss lord is horrible, withought buying Defender Medals ( if you can that is) and jsut farming Betty, it would take atleast 120 hours or more, just to get him. Still, I would reccomend trying it out, you might hate it, you might love it, but it is still fun.			"

								I do not recommend that you pay money for this game.  The main reason is the server issues.  Every time I try to play this game with friends we have trouble connecting to each other in private sessions.  Sometimes the game itself will not even load because of bad server connections.  I regret paying money for the game (but that is mainly because it is free to play now).  Also, in my opinion, games that allow you to play but make you pay money for certain things that exist within the game is not cool.  If you do play, since it is free, and you do not have server issues and aren't tempted to pay a ton of money for a different costume, you will probably like the game.  It has tons of potential and I really hope they get the bugs worked out.  Until then, I am gonna have to recommend that you do not play this game.  If it gets better I will change my review.			"

								It is an interesting game especially for those who are looking for something free to play. There are many maps we can choose from and four different classes to play.I personally enjoyed playing it with friends but after the first 10 - 15 hours i got bored of it. The gameplay itself is quite grindish so this is a game that should not be played alone.There is a feature at the login screen where it gives you the option to join a group related to the game and if you do that you should receive some gems which you can spend at the in game's store. I joined it but it didn't gave me any gems. I hope it gets fixed soon...It's not a pay to win type of game! The only thing they have at the store are cosmetic items that don't really affect your gameplay! I'll give it a 7/10.			"

The forum mods and Trendy support helped me out alot, though it took a couple days I did get it working by disabling my modem firewall. The game itself is amazing, players are helpful, and the game is fun though frustrating when 1 player makes you lose. I would reccomend buying the game if you played the previous Dungeon defenders.It is amazing.			"

								""it has a long time befor it becomes a succeser to the original"", well that day has come.I'm officaly addicted, I had some mixed feelings about this in the beggining.but its safe to say, that this game is a succesor to the original!While im no where near to end game, my IPWR on my main builder being ~150, and only one charecter being max lv (in the procces of maxing another one).But lets start from the beggining;GOOD STUFF The early quests help you figure out what the h3ll is going on, and bassicly the basics.from a sertian point the quests becom something along the lines of this: ""get a charecter to lv 40"" and when you finish that one you have to go to some npc for a new feature or item and the loop starts over again.If you chose a DPS/CC charecter to start with, you must play in a group.and i even found farming to lv 50 in sertian maps diffcult without the other defenses can build, like the sky guard tower which is crucial for maps where the wyverns simply dont come out of the lanes where the mobs come out.In the very start Trendy has claimed that switching between towers and mixing the setup is crucial, and from what i see, IT IS!building with one set of towers is allmost impossible in most end game maps and modes.while element combos are not as effective as they first were, they still pack a punch.NEGETIVE STUFFThis is a free2play game, and an ""in game currency"" was a must to keep the cash flowing and to keep Trendy from not supporting the game.And the customes dont effect gameplay at all, and acttualy decreases youre currency in game, either from buying myth gear with gold or buying lockboxe's keys with wyvern tokens.but the bag system is one of the worst things i have ever seen in a free2play game.Grinding loot is the core of the game, and keeping alot of important loot is, well, important.If you have more bags, you will get further. hands down no question.some say its for more  but i call this a big load of BS!Auto pickup loot is a major thing with the bags, instead of every wave going and looking if you got good loot and then picking it up, you can just have 10 bags optomized for auto loot and in the end of the match just check everything.this is a pay2win concept, where  if you have more money to spend itll be much easier for you to get better and proggres.Pets.yes, pets have a terrible system.not the pets them selfs, or the hatching system, but the storage system.Pet food, eggs, rotten shells, ♥♥♥♥ you need to evolve the pet, all stored withing the same place of youre loot.now how is that a problem? you may ask.It is a major flaw, and makes the game even more pay2win.its connected to the point i made earlier, you now even have less space for loot, since you need slots to keep youre eggs, shells pet food and the other stuff.Trendy did make the pets a different bag, where only pets can be stored, but you still have to pay more cash to store more pets!End notes:If you made it this far i thank you, for putting the time and dedication to read all of what i just wrote.I would love to hear feedback from you, the reader!I would give this game a solid 9/10 for new comers to the series, and for hardcore original fans a still pretty solid 7/10.

								Well for ppl who played DD1 (also played btw), DD2 doesnt disapoint, Most of the negative reviews forgets that the game its still in pre-Alpha, so alot of stuff still missing like trading and  player droping gear on tavern... etc... no drastic change was made that would make u think that isnt a sequel to DD1, all the old fun stuff is there. Plus some new, but im not gona spoil it for the new player.			"

								Overall it's a brilliant free to plaay game that almost anyone can enjoy. Gather a group of friends and fight your way to the top in one of the most entertaining and exciting games of this year! Ive had this game for a week now and ive tried all the classes and I have to say every one of them offers there own unique way that makes them so noticible. I have not found a single bug yet and im extremely excited to see how this game develops! The only negative thing i have to say is that you have to pay for the outfits and outfits are one of my favorite ways to customize y ingame character.			"

								Dungeon Defenders 2 is more or less the same as it's predecessor. Although there are less characters, less maps, and less viable strategies. The only thing really new in this game is Microtransactions. Community is rude, unlwelcoming and elitism is as rampant as it was in the first game. Leveling is slow, boring and ultimately devolves into pointless loot grind. The game is also very buggy and crash prone, requiring a lot of work to get to it run in a stable state. DD2 feels like a hollow shell of what the Dungeon Defenders was. None of the charm of the original game is present. Time will tell if DD2 improves, but right now I'm not holding out any hope.			"

								Awesome game as always with Dungeon Defenders, awesome Tower Defense. Only few bugs for an Alpha, correct amount of content to start and a lot more is planned!If you were an hardcore player of DD1 you may have a rough time to get used to this new DD but it worth the try.The game will be free to play once release (with only comestics buyable in real money) but, hey , why wait a whole year when you can get it now?!

								I want to like this game, but without knowing what the game's content is about, I can't. The main issue I had was performance issues, not the usual kind of fps issues that people are complaining about on the forums, but there was few troubles just trying to get the game launched.On my first try, I clicked the Play button in the launcher, then nothing happened. When I sorted programs by RAM usage in the Task Manager, I found out that the .exe was the the bottom of the list, so I had to force close it.My second try got a step further, which got me relieved. However, the DD2 logo appeared, then the whole thing froze. Appeared as ""Not Responding"" RAM usage doesn't cost as much as running Steam.I decided to give myself a final try. Sadly the result I got was the same.You might say:The game's in closed alpha - give the developers some time. Um, how about no. Since its launch date, the developers had 9 months to work on the game, but nothing was done in terms of performance optimisation/bug extermination?My PC is not up to its performance requirements. You may be right.  Either that or the requirements listed on the store page is giving out false information. "

								TL;DR, modern tower defense with a hero element.  can build freely anywhere and everywhere in most cases.  MMO-ish looting and rarity hierarchy ex: white, green, blue, purple, orange flavor text.  all heroes in a deck level up regardless of them being active so long as they are in your deck.  all content can be obtained without spending a penny even heroes and hero slots. premium options are conveniences or skins ex: inventory expander or unlocking heroes.  you cannot purchase spheres or special things with premium currency.dungeon defenders 2 being the sequel to dungeon defenders continues the tale of the four youngsters who are now all grown up.  Etheria is in a golden age after the defeat of the old ones and eveythings hunky dory for a wile.  however, someone's running amok releasing those old ones once again and the original 4 are enlisted to fight once more.  taking place in the kingdom of dragonfall you work with the locals to ship out the eternia crystals to hopefully fix whoever's making a mess of things.the old ones have adapted and enlisted some new and old units alike to aid their advances to destroy the shards.  you'll face off against most of what you known from the first game, goblins, orcs, mages, even ogres return.  the goblins got a new ranged unit that throws bombs, the mage has been adapted to resurrect the dead, and the ogres are more geared to the teeth to do some serious damage.  the archer and dark elf assassin units have been retired, the archer has been replaced by a javelin thrower capable of piercing through defenses and enlisted the drakins as a bombardment of magical flame to shoot at things from a distance.but that's not all, they enrolled many new units to help their conquest such as the witherbeast, a supportive tanky unit that burrows itself into the ground and emits a healing field for enemies and debuffing nearby defenses to take more damage while also receiving less damage from them.  the kobolds have taken to the skies and have learned the art of paragliding, and will dive-bomb into their targets.  a new air unit has also been discovered, a lightning bug, capable of dealing chained damage to defenses.many more dangerous enemies await but what of the heroes, have their friends made a comeback? well, sort of.  EV comes back with her second edition and the summoner now retitled to 'abyss lord' also make a return.  they handle and function very differently than their previous incarnations so expect different game play.  some new faces also join in on the fight as well such as the lavamancer, a living molten rock of a man along with the mystic, who has a huge fixation to appeasing the snake gods, and, as of just recently, the dryad from terraria has also came on in to help.  the game has also been streamlined to reduce the whackyness and longevity needed to complete a map, guesstimated to 1/5th the insanity that was dungeon defender 1.  the game will adjust each lane after each wave to be more difficult.  it will spawn special enemies, such as ogres, less often and more predictably, but as a result, they are much more vicious.  you are also rewarded a chest at the end that will guarantee one item's loot quality depending on its color.  gold replaces mana in terms of spending money for functions such as upgrading.  defender medals, obtained through daily/bonus weekly missions and map completion, are used for specific things such as skill spheres and unique items.overall i think it's a solid game for it being free, although a year or so ago there was a buy in price but now that has been lifted and a lot of content adjusted for a free to play model i think it's heading in the right direction.  they got some kinks and cracks to undo and seal up as it is but they are introducing some nice new player friendly features such as an ability to try the dryad in a 'normalized' mode.  on top of the campaign giving a generous heaping amount of defender medals to be comparable to a new hero with about 1~2k missing.

								Its a shame that this game was released. Had it not, maybe the DD1 community would still be alive and DD fans could play that, but this game is inferior to the original. Taverns arent personal, where you could show off trophies and achivements, weapons, or if you were selling anything, or just hang out in with friends pre-game.The new art style isnt bad, but doesnt feel like the original much at all, which I think it should.The way you could build your weapons and character was insane.

Some people maybe just a bit salty due to their long hours of grinding  just to end up being brought back down to noob status once more, but I think they will agree its something thats tollerable.It's to be expected from wipes to have bugs in a alpha, which isnt as bad as it seems.  I have too honestly say so far I have enjoyed the refreshing remake overall, deails of the old, with quite a bit of new things I didn't expect.It just keeps getting better!

								If you like RPG's and tower defence games, this is the game for you. Choose between an apprentice, huntress, monk or squire to defend Etheria from the Old ones. They're trying to take the magical crystal back with waves and waves of orcs, goblins and all manner of crazy beasts. Level up and fully custimize your hero with stat points, spehres, pets and gear to deal with the baddies in the way you see fit. Work on your hero themselves or your defences. Each hero has there own set of defences such as walls and towers and traps to ''defend'' the chosen objective. Each mission is very colorful and completed with difficulties for your team to overcome. A great co -op and friends game , becuase you all need to work together, hero and defence wise to protect the objective and well, from experiece if you don't....you fail. You spend equal time defending, as setting up defences to gearing up and looking through loot. It's also not a play to win, they only negative is a long loading time or game crashes but i'm sure Itll be fixed and renderd ASAP...			"

								im the type of PC gamer that needs a controller to play games, and this game does have controller support but doesnt say it does *COUGH* Left 4 Dead 2 *COUGH*.  but this game reminds me a lot of TF2(Team fortress 2) because TF2 is like a more cartoonie like CoD game and DD2 is more of a cartoonie Dota 2 and LoL which are games i do not like but i do like this game.  plus its free now and that's the only reason why i have this game lol its not a game i would recommend to someone but still a fun game to play every once in a while.

								This game is better than the first and i recommend anyone that loves tower defence based games. But i have found a glitch.The glitch is of where you put 2 characters in the hero deck and quickly switch between them and you will adventually get a hybrid of them and glitch your attacks and abilties.

								A welcome addition, if at the loss of some of the charm.What did a lot of people love about DD1? I think it was the 3D tower defense mixed with RPG and third person fighting mechanics, and the charm of seeing children defend a kingdom while their masters are away.DD2 has kept the first aspect intact nearly to a T. The only issues I could see anyone having any problems with the new system is that hand-to-hand combat is nearly required at lower levels, so you can't fully rely on your towers so much. That being said, they did something great. They gave the player two mana pools, one for tower and one for hero abilities, rather than the previous game where it would pull from one pool. The tower's mana is collected from chests and killing monsters (by the way, they changed the way mana chests work so people aren't doing mad dashes to beat each other to mana privileges), the hero ability pool slowly regenerates over time, and a lot of people will be happy to know that a lot of these abilities have a much larger impact than they did before. The other thing is that the amount of usable towers have been dropped from 5 to 4. And no, the Squire's Slice N' Dicer did not make it into this game.DD2, however, seems to feel a little less... soulfull, if that makes sense. It's still fun, and it has a great art style, but something about it just feels like it lost touch slightly with the original. It's something that I have trouble placing even as I write this.That being said, the game is most likely a much easier to enter game compared to the oringal. The stat upgrading system is a little more streamlined and the reduction of one extra tower choice makes strategies a little less hard to create, which is a good or a bad thing depending on your viewpoint. The communication system is clearly better, you can ping with specific commands or straight up chat, although you probably wont need to in most matches.What about microtransactions? Well you'll be happy to know they're fairly unintrusive. "

Time for the PROS:+very smooth controls unlike anything I've ever seen.+Still multiplayer (YES!!)+Players can be as creative with their classes as they want.+New updates every day.+Ma-HOO-sive community!Now for the cons. You all knew it was to be.CONS:-no offline singleplayer-no controller support.-no local multiplayer.Over all I say this a very good game. Of course its still in alpha, so bugs are to be expected.I hope that they do as well as they did with the original DD.I give it an 11/10 for now.My rating WILL change as time progresses.UPDATE: I now give this wonderful game a 12/10			"

								It's a really good game with very nice graphics, and has awesome weapons, maps, game concepts, and game mechanics. The only thing this game is missing is a really good story, to me the story seems pretty boring and doesn't have much character voice, if the game had characters that talk, and a story that grips you in, it would be really amazing. Also if the items like armor and relics would render onto the player that would be awesome. In total the game is really great and fun.			"

								TL;DR, modern tower defense with a hero element.  can build freely anywhere and everywhere in most cases.  MMO-ish looting and rarity hierarchy ex: white, green, blue, purple, orange flavor text.  all heroes in a deck level up regardless of them being active so long as they are in your deck.  all content can be obtained without spending a penny even heroes and hero slots. premium options are conveniences or skins ex: inventory expander or unlocking heroes.  you cannot purchase spheres or special things with premium currency.dungeon defenders 2 being the sequel to dungeon defenders continues the tale of the four youngsters who are now all grown up.  Etheria is in a golden age after the defeat of the old ones and eveythings hunky dory for a wile.  however, someone's running amok releasing those old ones once again and the original 4 are enlisted to fight once more.  taking place in the kingdom of dragonfall you work with the locals to ship out the eternia crystals to hopefully fix whoever's making a mess of things.the old ones have adapted and enlisted some new and old units alike to aid their advances to destroy the shards.  you'll face off against most of what you known from the first game, goblins, orcs, mages, even ogres return.  the goblins got a new ranged unit that throws bombs, the mage has been adapted to resurrect the dead, and the ogres are more geared to the teeth to do some serious damage.  the archer and dark elf assassin units have been retired, the archer has been replaced by a javelin thrower capable of piercing through defenses and enlisted the drakins as a bombardment of magical flame to shoot at things from a distance.but that's not all, they enrolled many new units to help their conquest such as the witherbeast, a supportive tanky unit that burrows itself into the ground and emits a healing field for enemies and debuffing nearby defenses to take more damage while also receiving less damage from them.  the kobolds have taken to the skies and have learned the art of paragliding, and will dive-bomb into their targets.  a new air unit has also been discovered, a lightning bug, capable of dealing chained damage to defenses.many more dangerous enemies await but what of the heroes, have their friends made a comeback? well, sort of.  EV comes back with her second edition and the summoner now retitled to 'abyss lord' also make a return.  they handle and function very differently than their previous incarnations so expect different game play.  some new faces also join in on the fight as well such as the lavamancer, a living molten rock of a man along with the mystic, who has a huge fixation to appeasing the snake gods, and, as of just recently, the dryad from terraria has also came on in to help.  the game has also been streamlined to reduce the whackyness and longevity needed to complete a map, guesstimated to 1/5th the insanity that was dungeon defender 1.  the game will adjust each lane after each wave to be more difficult.  it will spawn special enemies, such as ogres, less often and more predictably, but as a result, they are much more vicious.  you are also rewarded a chest at the end that will guarantee one item's loot quality depending on its color.  gold replaces mana in terms of spending money for functions such as upgrading.  defender medals, obtained through daily/bonus weekly missions and map completion, are used for specific things such as skill spheres and unique items.overall i think it's a solid game for it being free, although a year or so ago there was a buy in price but now that has been lifted and a lot of content adjusted for a free to play model i think it's heading in the right direction.  they got some kinks and cracks to undo and seal up as it is but they are introducing some nice new player friendly features such as an ability to try the dryad in a 'normalized' mode.  on top of the campaign giving a generous heaping amount of defender medals to be comparable to a new hero with about 1~2k missing.

								I see a lot of reviews from people who are upset about the grind to get new characters - Devs realized it was a bit too hard to grind for the medals, so they increased the amount you receive from missions, maps, etc... I am now capped on medals after just a few days of playing. There has been a ton of content released for this game in the last few months, including new maps, incursions, weapons, and even two new characters. The community has a say in how this game is progressing, which is more than I can say for a lot of other games. I can also look at news for this game and weekly (if not every few days) there is detailed** updates on where the devs are in updates, and even a look at what is to come, whether it be a thought, or a work in progress. Overall, I've been playing this game since release, and I still play it almost every day. If you enjoy tower defense, you should not pass up the opportunity to at least try the game out.			"

								Very good game.  This game is very much like Wizard 101, which is also a good game, so if you play that you will understand this one better initially.  Characters are similar in art style and movements, the tavern meeting area is similar.  Game play is different in Dungeon Defenders, because in wizard 101 all characters are magic and fighting is turn based in a circle once you get to the map.  DD2 involves various weapons, traps and other things to defeat the enemies, which makes a nice change, but maps are smaller.   Are the Wizard 101 folks the creators of DD2??			"

So much cash has been made from the orginal game's faithful that this company had been able to purchase enough fake reviews to make it appear decent.I really wish I could get my money back...or at least the home addresses for everyone involved in making this game.

								Pros:- Mixes RPG and Tower Defense together which diversifies and gives the game a unique playstyle.- Unlock 4 classes for free.- 2 playstyles which you can build each class the way you want. (i.e. building or fighting which the game will explain).- You can switch classes based on how they are built. (i.e. At the end of a wave switch to a class that you have specialized to be a builder, then switch to a class you've built to be a fighter after you're done building.- The stat points and the equipment also support the way you want to specialize your classe in.- Simultaneously gain experience and levels for all the other heroes when only using one, this helps for grinding.- Afraid that you're alone or it's too difficult? Worry not, you can play multiplayer or go off to be a lone wolf.- Has an auto collect system where it does the equipment collecting for you.- You get 4 bags which hold equipment.- Dying doesn't punish besides respawn timer.- Challenging for those who want it.- You can play with friends.Cons:- VERY grindy- Requires you to use your brain as does every TD game- Not very F2P as grinding and playing a lot will only be the way to advance- Time consuming- Only 4 main classes are available as free, (Squire, Monk, Huntress, and Apprentice) the others you must grind a lot for or buy with gems.- A LOT of things require gems such as costumes or skins for your characters and getting pets.- NO guilds or clubs for people looking to socialize and work with others.- Gets quite boring after grinding for many hours.TLDR; Don't play if you don't have a lot of free time and don't expect the game to be full F2P as it requires gems for a lot of things, otherwise the game is unique, thrilling, and challenging.

								ATM No, The game doesn't have a true direction and is constant change. Game feels to linear and only provides a few days of fun after each patch, a TD game usually tends to not be as fun after each map playthrough. Going Open Alpha shortly id recomend you wait for that, as good graphically as the game and costumes are, the game experience is lacking.with a few more modes for longevity, some competitive modes and more maybe (they could look into other custom maps on wc3 for idea's.)The game can become great, it has potential. But its all round the place and patches are very sporadic and feel un-tested.Edit.Came back for a bit games still bad if not worse (aside from weapons) with a even more horrible patch called ""Carnival"" and patches that came with mroe bugs than fix's. Im looking forward to New heroes, but even more core rebalance and the hero deck change. I'll probably be back again after core rebalance hopefully its good enough for me to change my review then.Edit.2017 now, feels worse than before.			"

								It's a good, somewhat completed game, that's fun in LAN. :) It's free to play, and there's no real ""pay-to-win"" need, either. I love how you can collect items throughout, reminding me of Borderlands and Diablo. None of those wussy items like in Secret World and Age of Conan, either. ;) Tons of small gimmicks, like pets and skills. Later in the game you can change some of the effects on the other towers. A few downsides, though: it's buggy (it's alpha, so no surprise there). You'll be thrown out of the game and have to rejoin the match at times (fortunately you don't have to wait for the match to finish before you can rejoin), sometimes the weapon-animations suddenly stop showing, or trying to carry more than 1 gold/crystal during the Kobolt Challenge will simply delete the other, sometimes you just can't connect with a friend and both gotta restart the game... I do wish there'd be a few more towers to chose between for each character, though, but at least you can change character ingame as often  as you wish, and use several types. Yeah, there are downsides. It's a free alpha though, so can't complain and let it prevent me from giving a recommendation, because we (four of us) had a lot of fun. Some even bought the hideously expensive Hero/Costume packs - not worth it in my opinion. My tip? Download it, play it for free, enjoy it a lot (or not, and no money lost). If you like it enough that you'll buy pretty-coloured things for lots of real money, well - all power to you, I suppose. Enjoy!			"

								This is one of the most captivating tower defense games I have played so-far. Its combination of strategic tower management and hero development, as well as item collection and pet collection, makes it easy to loose track of time. Easy to learn and child-friendly.			"

								If you like RPG's and tower defence games, this is the game for you. Choose between an apprentice, huntress, monk or squire to defend Etheria from the Old ones. They're trying to take the magical crystal back with waves and waves of orcs, goblins and all manner of crazy beasts. Level up and fully custimize your hero with stat points, spehres, pets and gear to deal with the baddies in the way you see fit. Work on your hero themselves or your defences. Each hero has there own set of defences such as walls and towers and traps to ''defend'' the chosen objective. Each mission is very colorful and completed with difficulties for your team to overcome. A great co -op and friends game , becuase you all need to work together, hero and defence wise to protect the objective and well, from experiece if you don't....you fail. You spend equal time defending, as setting up defences to gearing up and looking through loot. It's also not a play to win, they only negative is a long loading time or game crashes but i'm sure Itll be fixed and renderd ASAP...			"

								This game has for the most part been garbage, and a real disgrace to DD1.Most maps seem to be made with appearance in mind (and they do look pretty good) rather then gameplay, as good tower placement is all but forgotten in the map designs (which is of critical importance to a tower defense game).Combat itself is fairly clunky, leaving you with a lackluster experience as you run about hacking at waves of mobs.Tuning is evidentaly very poor, in most cases leaving you with either extreme ease or impossible difficulty. Difficulty, in this case, a result of being undergeared/leveled.Despite not yet even being released, updates have been centered around monitization schemes. The free to play is a bait-and-switch designed to lure you in to show you pretty maps, and then ask you for money.Trendy has gone down the drain hard. Where DD1 was a fun and unique game that got great support and a thriving community. DD2 has been a half-baked game and a terrible money grab.			"

								The game is amazing, because it has the same concepts as DD1, but does feel like a different game. Just as enjoyable as the first game. I realize this game is in Alpha stage (even though it feels like it's been forever, and DD1 took forever to come out fully). I'll give a positive review, because it's a great game, but there's one problem...The jump button barely works if you're using an XBox controller. I loved DD1, and played it with a controller, and loved it. Now, when I'm in the middle of a battle, trying to do what needs to be done, I can't even get around my towers because the jump button is so bugged out! I even end up dying sometimes because I fall in a pit, because the jump button doesn't register.I think the problem might be because the ""A"" button does other things, so I've tried to remap the jump button to something else... But the remapping aspect of the controller menu doesn't work!The game is absolutely amazing, and IF they fix this problem, I will totally love it, and probably play it just as much as I did DD1 (250 hours). However, if they don't fix this, I'll probably give up after a while because it's just so infuriating.			"

								In short, Dungeon Defenders II would have been a good game, had DD1 not existed.The game is quite close to a neutral level to me, however I still can't recommend it much. That said, if there was an indifferrent option, I would select tht instead. Dungeon Defenders 2 is a decent game in its own right, although certain controls can be more complicated and somewhat difficult to remember. For some gamers, myself included, controller support is a must-have, however DD2 lacks this and uses a keyboard and mouse only. Unlike DD1, it's a generally more complicated game, in that the maps are slightly more complicated and use more paths to make things harder. That said, the game is generally easier if you've played DD1 or DDE.As a rating, I give DD2 a 4/10, because it isn't a bad game, but it dismisses some redeeming factors and negates their usage, such as the forementioned controller. The game is still early access, and as such, I would call it one to watch, and with any such improvement, my review may change to recommendation.			"

Game mechanics aren't really fleshed out or all that creative, there is always a FOTM op character (usually the just released one, so you buy them for real money) and the maps while pretty aren't all that creative either.

								TL;DR, modern tower defense with a hero element.  can build freely anywhere and everywhere in most cases.  MMO-ish looting and rarity hierarchy ex: white, green, blue, purple, orange flavor text.  all heroes in a deck level up regardless of them being active so long as they are in your deck.  all content can be obtained without spending a penny even heroes and hero slots. premium options are conveniences or skins ex: inventory expander or unlocking heroes.  you cannot purchase spheres or special things with premium currency.dungeon defenders 2 being the sequel to dungeon defenders continues the tale of the four youngsters who are now all grown up.  Etheria is in a golden age after the defeat of the old ones and eveythings hunky dory for a wile.  however, someone's running amok releasing those old ones once again and the original 4 are enlisted to fight once more.  taking place in the kingdom of dragonfall you work with the locals to ship out the eternia crystals to hopefully fix whoever's making a mess of things.the old ones have adapted and enlisted some new and old units alike to aid their advances to destroy the shards.  you'll face off against most of what you known from the first game, goblins, orcs, mages, even ogres return.  the goblins got a new ranged unit that throws bombs, the mage has been adapted to resurrect the dead, and the ogres are more geared to the teeth to do some serious damage.  the archer and dark elf assassin units have been retired, the archer has been replaced by a javelin thrower capable of piercing through defenses and enlisted the drakins as a bombardment of magical flame to shoot at things from a distance.but that's not all, they enrolled many new units to help their conquest such as the witherbeast, a supportive tanky unit that burrows itself into the ground and emits a healing field for enemies and debuffing nearby defenses to take more damage while also receiving less damage from them.  the kobolds have taken to the skies and have learned the art of paragliding, and will dive-bomb into their targets.  a new air unit has also been discovered, a lightning bug, capable of dealing chained damage to defenses.many more dangerous enemies await but what of the heroes, have their friends made a comeback? well, sort of.  EV comes back with her second edition and the summoner now retitled to 'abyss lord' also make a return.  they handle and function very differently than their previous incarnations so expect different game play.  some new faces also join in on the fight as well such as the lavamancer, a living molten rock of a man along with the mystic, who has a huge fixation to appeasing the snake gods, and, as of just recently, the dryad from terraria has also came on in to help.  the game has also been streamlined to reduce the whackyness and longevity needed to complete a map, guesstimated to 1/5th the insanity that was dungeon defender 1.  the game will adjust each lane after each wave to be more difficult.  it will spawn special enemies, such as ogres, less often and more predictably, but as a result, they are much more vicious.  you are also rewarded a chest at the end that will guarantee one item's loot quality depending on its color.  gold replaces mana in terms of spending money for functions such as upgrading.  defender medals, obtained through daily/bonus weekly missions and map completion, are used for specific things such as skill spheres and unique items.overall i think it's a solid game for it being free, although a year or so ago there was a buy in price but now that has been lifted and a lot of content adjusted for a free to play model i think it's heading in the right direction.  they got some kinks and cracks to undo and seal up as it is but they are introducing some nice new player friendly features such as an ability to try the dryad in a 'normalized' mode.  on top of the campaign giving a generous heaping amount of defender medals to be comparable to a new hero with about 1~2k missing.

								I normally stay away from doing reviews, but honestly the community who want to dog this game is absurd. The game is still in Early Access. Now sure we are going on almost 2 years (in a few months), but there are plenty of other games that have done the same. People complain about Microtransactions, people complain that they can't just buy the game, people complain that and this and bah. Skins can cost however much they want, you don't have to buy them. The heros don't have to be bought. Sure it takes awhile to earn them I have put 150 hours into the game most of which was before they even had defender medals. So, I have just now earned One of the Heroes and I barely put time into it People are complaining that they are putting out new content. I have never in all my years heard of people complain because they are getting new stuff. ""It costs too much"" Then don't buy it ""It takes to long to get"" Then don't get it. This isn't a Moba where they are going to release 60+ Heroes. They are not going to just give away what they are spending their time making without making you earn it. They are even nice enough to make it so the costs goes down after a week of the new Hero coming out. Which they have no real reason to do. (Though I admit that it costing the exact cap is kinda annoying as it means you have to stop if you get there and the hero hasn't came out yet but I digress)  "

								Its a shame that this game was released. Had it not, maybe the DD1 community would still be alive and DD fans could play that, but this game is inferior to the original. Taverns arent personal, where you could show off trophies and achivements, weapons, or if you were selling anything, or just hang out in with friends pre-game.The new art style isnt bad, but doesnt feel like the original much at all, which I think it should.The way you could build your weapons and character was insane.

It's good because, you know, it's free, but it's bad because they have microtransactions and DLC to make the game generate income.In my opinion, this doesn't matter too much, as all of the items you pay for are purely cosmetic and give no special advantage in any way.It also has better graphics than the first game, quests, daily missions, a better upgrading system, another way to upgrade your character, a better tavern, and more!And it's still in alpha.I'd rate this game 9.5/10. It still needs some more maps, but again, it's in alpha. It also needs PVP!			"

								This game has for the most part been garbage, and a real disgrace to DD1.Most maps seem to be made with appearance in mind (and they do look pretty good) rather then gameplay, as good tower placement is all but forgotten in the map designs (which is of critical importance to a tower defense game).Combat itself is fairly clunky, leaving you with a lackluster experience as you run about hacking at waves of mobs.Tuning is evidentaly very poor, in most cases leaving you with either extreme ease or impossible difficulty. Difficulty, in this case, a result of being undergeared/leveled.Despite not yet even being released, updates have been centered around monitization schemes. The free to play is a bait-and-switch designed to lure you in to show you pretty maps, and then ask you for money.Trendy has gone down the drain hard. Where DD1 was a fun and unique game that got great support and a thriving community. DD2 has been a half-baked game and a terrible money grab.			"

								This game is 2 times better than the first game. The graphics are better, the story is better, the levels are better, the weapons are better, the tavern is better, EVERYTHING is better! The first one was good but you level up too slow and there were very few levels. All they need to do to make me perfectly happy with this one is to make the game have more levels and I would be set.			"

								Even though it is Alpha (Take in count I have played since the beginning of it), the game has surprisingly few bugs and some neat little things that have been missing in the first installment of the series. It is really fun and has still managed to maintain that cartoony feel of the game but more advanced. It feels a bit goofy (In a good way!) at times and has some funny moments. The graphics are neat and colorful, though not as colorful as the original Dungeon Defenders. Trendy has also added a lot of new enemies and added new vendors to give the game some more depth, which I really like.All in all: If you can forgive a few alpha bugs here and there and you like tower defense games, then this game is definitely worth trying out.

								Like tower defense?Like loot (lots of loot)?Like RPGS?Like 4 varied classes?This is the game for you!It combines the thrill of an action rpg and loot with tower defense elements. Really addicting, and really fun! Just beating the campaign is only the start. After beating it you unlock harder scenarios of the maps you've played with new loot drops and a chance at higher quality items. Did I mention that there's no ""pay to progress"" paywall in place? Well, there isn't. Almost everything with the exception of some purely cosmetic costumes, and a few pets are achieveable just from playing the game. I highly recommend this to everyone!10/10 would fight monsters beside friends again :D			"

								Free to play in every sense of the word. Pets need to be fed with a special item, which you can buy with money, or with in game moey (at fastly increased prices) but DOES drops... sometimes. New characters need to be bought, anything beyond the first 4 at least.Chests drop that you need to buy keys for (this is by far the most aggregious of the examples IMO)If you had just made this game pay to play, as Dungeon Defenders 1 was, this game would have been at the top of my list in fun games to play. It's a shame, too, they made a lot of improvements to the game over DD1. (They stil have player collision with other players though, such an oversight in a multiplayer coop game.) A shame indeed.Do not play this game. It will waste your time, as you need to spend more money than the game is actually worth to get any enjoyment out of it.			"

								So many things went wrong in execution. It took many great features from the first game and then split them into a microtransaction format. Not necessarily a horrible thing, except they made it unusually expensive to have; almost like someone thought people will pay the ridiculous prices solely from loving the first game.Of the things it kept in, they expanded in poor ways. The larger environments don't have anything to keep them going. One thing about the first game was how tight and well designed its levels were, but that's gone now. It's like the microtransaction model was made to rely on past players, but the design doesn't attract them.			"

								It's a good, somewhat completed game, that's fun in LAN. :) It's free to play, and there's no real ""pay-to-win"" need, either. I love how you can collect items throughout, reminding me of Borderlands and Diablo. None of those wussy items like in Secret World and Age of Conan, either. ;) Tons of small gimmicks, like pets and skills. Later in the game you can change some of the effects on the other towers. A few downsides, though: it's buggy (it's alpha, so no surprise there). You'll be thrown out of the game and have to rejoin the match at times (fortunately you don't have to wait for the match to finish before you can rejoin), sometimes the weapon-animations suddenly stop showing, or trying to carry more than 1 gold/crystal during the Kobolt Challenge will simply delete the other, sometimes you just can't connect with a friend and both gotta restart the game... I do wish there'd be a few more towers to chose between for each character, though, but at least you can change character ingame as often  as you wish, and use several types. Yeah, there are downsides. It's a free alpha though, so can't complain and let it prevent me from giving a recommendation, because we (four of us) had a lot of fun. Some even bought the hideously expensive Hero/Costume packs - not worth it in my opinion. My tip? Download it, play it for free, enjoy it a lot (or not, and no money lost). If you like it enough that you'll buy pretty-coloured things for lots of real money, well - all power to you, I suppose. Enjoy!			"

								I see a lot of reviews from people who are upset about the grind to get new characters - Devs realized it was a bit too hard to grind for the medals, so they increased the amount you receive from missions, maps, etc... I am now capped on medals after just a few days of playing. There has been a ton of content released for this game in the last few months, including new maps, incursions, weapons, and even two new characters. The community has a say in how this game is progressing, which is more than I can say for a lot of other games. I can also look at news for this game and weekly (if not every few days) there is detailed** updates on where the devs are in updates, and even a look at what is to come, whether it be a thought, or a work in progress. Overall, I've been playing this game since release, and I still play it almost every day. If you enjoy tower defense, you should not pass up the opportunity to at least try the game out.			"

								Very good game.  This game is very much like Wizard 101, which is also a good game, so if you play that you will understand this one better initially.  Characters are similar in art style and movements, the tavern meeting area is similar.  Game play is different in Dungeon Defenders, because in wizard 101 all characters are magic and fighting is turn based in a circle once you get to the map.  DD2 involves various weapons, traps and other things to defeat the enemies, which makes a nice change, but maps are smaller.   Are the Wizard 101 folks the creators of DD2??			"

Looking for a free to play, non pay to win game? This one is the game.May contain mild spoilers.Dungeon Defenders 2 is by far one of the best free to play MMO's I have ever played. Sure there are in-game purchases, but you don't need to purchase anything to progress through the game, everyone levels up equally, there is NO Gameplay Advantage to those who buy in-game items.About the gameA general summery of the game.Dungeon defenders 2 is just like any other tower defense game, except you can play with your friends, and have a free roaming expirence. Protect your lands against orcs, or else you will end up in defeat! There are 4 characters to choose from at the start, the apprentice, huntress, squire, and the monk. Play with up to 4 friends in an in-game co-op party, and have fun leveling up at your own pace. Gain more ipwr by defeating the orcs, and picking up gear that you can equip at your level. Gain money, to buy power ups, that make your hero, or defenses stronger.Cons?Nope, not many at all.This is one in many free to play games that has very little cons to it. I'd have to say the only downfall to this game, is having to pay for costumes for your characters, and there is no other way to unlock them yourself.TL;DR?Too long; didn't read?In short, Dungeon Defenders 2 is one of my most highly recommended free mmo games out there right now. There is tons of gameplay, and the game is still in development with more maps and upgrades. You can play with your friends, and have fun leveling up at any pace you'd like. Levels get harder as you progress, making it funner to level up.Definitely do try out this game. What is there to lose? It's free-to-play!Like my reviews?To see more of my reviews on games, you can view more HERE!(http://steamcommunity.com/id/redsauce117/recommended/) "

								This game is a great way to pass time it is fun to play through and even play over and get loot for your class of choice. When you have leveled up and got as much loot for your character as you can it doesnt end there after you can try out another class of your choice and level them to the top. Yes the game does have its down sides like the outfits you have to pay real money for and the extra classes but besides that the game is all around fun. The game will provide lots of fun for a while with all the missions and levels i would reccomend this game to people it is great and i love it.			"

								Have you played a tower defense game before?- Of course it's grindy- Of course it's repetitiveDungeon Defenders 2 is an action hack n slash/tower defense.  It is a type of game that you play on a weekday afternoon for a couple of hours until you get sick of it. Then you do it again next week.Those 10k dragon medals are simple to get.  Just play the game like a normal person.  I only played the game for a few hours these past 2 weeks and I didnt even realised I got 1.5k dragon medals.People these days whine like babies on even the slightest hint of grind.			"

								This is a fun game to play for a few weeks, then jump back to it and see the changes they have made. Constant upgrades are nice, with a good community of players. Since I have started playing, 2 new characters have been added (and more are still on the way), new maps, weapons, armor, and pets have been added.My only complaint with the game is that the story mode ends fairly quickly (about 10 hours of gameplay), then it cycles back through all the maps again on a harder difficulty. Therefore making it a bit repetative to play consistantly. That being said, I still do enjoy playing the game and would recommend it to others.			"

								Pretty fun game (i love tower defense so thats an extra point), its not 100% solid it has many bugs which can be annoying but they are getting fixed, 4 characters to play with and with different towers which can make insane combos for stun, damage or defense like the one of the electric aura and geyser which is not used much anymore because geyser got nerfed due to infinite stun combo.Best tower defense i've ever played, why? because moving the characters as well as upgrading gear, leveling characters, getting better gear and deal damage with weapons is just awesome i love it and cant wait for game release.If you played Dungeon Defenders 1 you should try this but keep in mind is not like Dungeon Defenders 1 it is a lot more different but i cant say which is better because both gave me so much fun playing them except when i got to end game on Dungeon Defenders 1 (600+ hours) i got bored.

Early Access Review
								I played 800+ hours at DD1 and as Trendy totally gave up on it (no bug fixes, no new maps), I was super excited to hear there was a DD2. But after being release (in early access, which is still the case now) the reviews were pretty mixed, especially from the ones that players DD1. So I waited a few months hoping the game will use the same magic recipe as DD1 and will be an improvement.As the game was on sale, I decided to get it and give it a try hoping I will have a tremendous number of hours coming on. Unfortunately after 20 hours on it I was pretty disappointed and don't understand why Trendy made so many bad changes:PRO:- better graphics- details on monsters for the incoming wave- can see your defenses range by holding the Shift key.and to be honest that's pretty much it.CONS:- right after getting the game I wasn't able to join any public game, the servers weren't working properly. Seems to have gone better but it seems like that's a recurring issue. Even joining the public tavern sometimes doesn't work.- 4 heroes with 4 towers, compared to 8 x 5. They might add some more later on but right now we are missing a lot on diversity.- the stats system has totally changed and is so confusing: gear rating/comparison doesn't seem right, can't boost particular stats anymore (you've to find objects with stats you want), we've lost the range stats (no more high-range harpons).- this game will become a free to play (Yeah!) but some upgrades will require real money (Boooo!)- most of the shortcuts have changed from DD1- DD1 was having a listing of all games and it was easy to join the party you felt will be fun to play (map/mode/difficulty). Now you just join a public tavern and have to select a map+difficulty and you might join a starting game or it will create a new game (and if you quit/cancel right away you are loosing social points, wth!?)So far I haven't had any fun playing DD2, I might try to continue leveling up (I've 3 heroes lvl 20) to see if it gets better and unlock some other maps but I'm seriously considering going back to DD1...

								It's a really free-to-play game, I love it. But there's an issue that I can't find any solution and many other people have this problem too. No matter what computer you have (even a high-end pc) it'll most likely crash. Since this is a co-op game, at some point you'll either help or ask for help but with this issue it's almost impossible. The only ""solution"" right now is adding each other through steam, so whenever one of the members crash they'll have the possibilty of joining again.EDIT:Looks like the issue is fixed, however I stopped playing this game due to the balance changes that came a couple of months ago. Without having much heroes they decided to nerf one of the most important hero that was necessary in a really high difficulty level, if I'm not wrong its towers dps were decreased for around 30-40% (can't remember what were the exact nerfs) making it extremely hard to complete one of these missions (well, with every update they'll always be an adaption so players found other ways to get over it, including spending more money on the game or having better gear). Yet, I find this game incredibly good.			"

								I loved the first dungeon defenders so much. Just total stupidety of the weapons and pets you could have. Using and archer with a many gun while your Team Fortress Pyro is shooting flames around you, Hell yeah.I was really looking forward to this game, expecting the same experience as DD 1, but hell i have been disappointed. First of al the pre-order, i dont mind supporting the Devs for this game, but the fact that it is free to play now is kind of questionabel for me. But the most dissapointing thing of all is the lack of 'fun'. I could play DD1 all day every day, feeling like it was a new game everytime i played with endless possibilities. The pets were really interesting and the weapons were ridicilous but that made it so fun to play. So ofcourse i buy the new DD2, but where is the fun? Every level feels like the lever before that, i just doesn't have the fun factor as DD1. And it has been in pre alpha for hella long. The updates don't feel right, just more stuff you can get for real $$ or €€. It sucks, it is cruisin towards a game where, if you want to beat all the levels, you just have to pump your hard earned money in it.  Beside this fact all those new chars/heroes coming out. I pre ordered it for a lot of money, and know you are saying i dont get the new chars unless i pay another 20 dollars? Or i have to play for a loooot of hours. Me no likie. For a F2P game this game can/is really fun. But for the Dungeon Defenders fan, we better get back playing DD1, where the fun was real. "

								    I have played this line of games since Trendy first started the dungeon defenders series and will continue to as long as they make them. It is a very interesting game to me because i like the challenge and the grind factor that seems to be endless. I like the progression level of the game as well wiht the exception of the massive increase between nm3 and nm4. Now that said there a few things that need to be addressed with the game like the supposed fixes that cause more problems than they fix and the push to rush new content that is incomplete or broken. i am sure that most would rather have quality over quantity. This problems seems to derive from the fact they want to sell something new to you to keep the money rolling which is understandable but its not worth it to pay for something that doesnt work since they keep coming up with new things to sell you without fixing what they have already sold. It is a great game and i hope that they keep producing but would like to see more solid fixes and updates as well as better balancing.			"

It's beautiful and loads of fun.The ratings for the game reflected that, too, until March 24th when Trendy decided to sue an ex-employee who had violated his contract.  And then people started to rate the game badly.  Seriously, go look at the ratings prior to the 24th and then the avalanche of ratings on the 24th that announced how horrible that is.  BTW, nothing significant changed about the game on the 24th.So we have a bunch of liars, basically, who are willing to claim that this fine game sucks because they don't like what the company is doing elsewhere.

								Graphics:- Nice comic-style with a lot of bright colors, resulting in a very ""warm/lovely"" atmosphere- A lot of variation in maps for example old dungeons, green fields, gigantic sewers, burning cities, spooky forests or a throne room and there is much more! New maps are constantly added, each with their own layout and theming.- The characters are designed with a lot of love for details and they all look very different from each other. You can also buy skins with ingame currency to give you a bit more variation.-> Overall one of the biggest pros for me are the graphics. I could stare hours into the beautiful landscapes and also write hours about it ;)Balance/Bugs/Ingame Currency-> Trendy constantly adds new content to the game, so they can have all features they want as quickly as possible, but this also results in a lot of bugs. The worst bugs get fixed quickly. The balance issues are not that bad in early stages of the game, but in the endgame there are only a few viable towers/characters. I´m sure the balance will get fixed, since most of the old characters will get reworked soon to be as good as the new ones. The ingame currency is fine. You can get some skins and additional inventory slots with it, but nothing that would give you an advantage in the game.Gameplay:- A lot of variation in maps, difficulties, items and characters. You can even equip spheres to boost your character to the max. or take a pet to help you in battle- Tons of enemies, each with their own strengths and some with special abilitiess- The normal gamemode is nice and balanced and will take you a good amount of time to reach the last difficulties.- The second gamemode is named ""onslaught"" and is basically an endless mode. The gamemode is fun but does not provide good rewards at the end. I´m sure they will make some work on this gamemode soon.- The third and last gamemode is named ""incursion"" and is a much harder version of the map you choose. The gamemode is very challenging and is okey so far. But they currently work on adding a different task for each map and a unique reward if you win. There is already one map with this concept and i´m very happy with it.- Daily missions/monthly missions have good rewards and are well done.- Characters all have their own playstyle and look.I could write on for hours, because there is so much more to talk about, but i wanted to keep it short and just give you an idea of the current state of the game!  Result:-> The fantastic graphics, love to details and the variety of characters, pets, enemies and maps, make this one of my favorite games. I spent over 440 hours on this game so far and don´t regret anything. The Trendy team is friendly and listens to the community. Constant patches with new characters, challenges, maps and much more keep the game interesting and fun. Just keep in mind that the game is in development and still contains some bugs and balance issues, but overall I can totally recommend you to test it out yourself, you won´t regret it!!			"

								The game is great when I can play. I'll get into the game no problem then after I complete a match and attempt to exit to tavern. The game gets stuck in ""Searching for Session"" and I have to force close the game 9/10 times. The one time it does happen to work I have to click go to hub, wait for the the searching for session to bring me to an error screen three times. Then it will finally bring me to hub. However, I'm unable to join any game from the war table. So I'm forced to exit the game to desktop and re launch the app.I did some research on this and this seems like an ongoing issue since launch. I opened all the ports, turned off firewall, re-installed. Nothing seems to work.Will change review once patched or fixed.			"

								Enjoyed the first DD quite a bit, but it suffered a bit from gear creep and being flooded with things that took away from just playing the game for fun. DD2 fixes all of that.  More refined, more straight forward. Same type of gameplay with a lot more focus on actually having to take part in combat rather than just allowing your towers to do all the work.For early access, the game is better than many games at release. Only thing its really lacking is content. (more levels, more pets, more item sets, and a few other minor features). Great game to play with a friend or 3. Well programmed, and plays well. You wont need to invest hours each day into it like an mmorpg, but it will still give you some of the progression feeling and advancement that an mmorpg provides, all while being a fun, action oriented game.

								Dungeon Defenders IIHmm I didn't really have any expectations, but the longer I played the more addictive it got :)I really like this game and I enjoy it very much even tho it's still early Access ''pre-alpha''and this game would surely be even better playing with friends instead of randoms.Not saying that all the randomes I have meet have been an boring experience since I've met some really sound people :) As an early pre-alpha game I think this game would be even better later as the updates comes :)  ''Hope to see you in the game'' ;)			"

								Just recently started playing it again, and after 8'ish hours of gameplay I can safely say;Wait. So many things are still in Alpha(But surprisingly hefty prices for an alpha program....). But it is """"""free"""""" to play so if you do wanna give it a go, all you have to lose is time, and what a waste of time it would be.Basicly they're promising the world, but only ever release a new map or two once in a blue moon. While pumping out skin after skin after skin... With insane ""Gems"" price tags, and only a bare minimum of actual game/bug fixes.Reminds me a lot of Smite actually... Not in a good way.			"

								Simply put, game feels very busy, flashy, and cluttered. The equipment system is a fairly good example.  Each round you'll likely find 20-30+ items dropping left and rignt.  Most of the items are complete garbage.  Each item has 3-6 stats that are generally random.  It's not fun to play the game, grab 20-30 items of loot then spend several minutes trying to sort all of it.   I'm sure higher level players only bother picking up epic loot?  But then you have endless piles of garbage loot building up on your maps which are already cluttered with endless waves of enemies.  They really should design a better system for dropping VALUABLE loot you  might actually use rather than tons of junk with small chances for upgrade.The loot is only the first issue we didn't like.  Follow that up with some pretty messy levels that aren't much fun to play on.  I'd like to see them build some more game types as the standard tower/defense mode gets old really fast.			"

								This game is really good.Pros:- Fun gameplay.- very little lag.- i can run it on my windows 98 potato on lowest settings.- Nice-ish community.- kek.Cons:- Cant do anything untill you complete the campaign.- no single player / offline mode.- Really bad tutorial.- not really many different campaign levels, basicly all just defend the random object and kill a boss at the end.NOTE: This game is in alpha and for an alpha game with a few bug fixes and new additions it could be passed of as a semi good game.I will edit this if the game has any major updates.8 / 10 Trendy enternainment's focus on design served this game well.

								Yeah its a fun game, everything CAN be obtainable if you play long enough, like for heros. If you buy one hero, it will give you an extra slot. Therefore everyone can have every hero. It's just gonna take you while to get 10000 defender medals. (12000 for new released one) Um... What else can I say... OH this game is very fun with friends. One tip for playing this game or any game actually. Enjoy the game rather than rushing to end game content, it'll ruin your experience on the early stages on the game. If you just take your time, you'll have fun during the process and soon you'll be in the end game stuff anyways. Happy killing! *dabs*			"

								So I picked up this game despite the negative reviews because I was interested in playing a tower defense game with my friends. As it turns out, the criticism was warranted. The game expects you to grind an absolutely absurd amount in order to even get a single hero you might want. It's a shame, because the game has potential - just don't hold your breath.			"

 Deep review This is a towerdefense game of a 3rd person view. I would say this game can be comapred to diablo series. Because of the loot system and the grinding involved into it. So lets start of picking your 4 heroes, each hero has its own kit/style. Mage The mage has a  LOT  of aoe spells and places turrets that also deal aoe dmg. Hes ranged and builds turrets pretty well (The mage has a freeze turret that helps pretty well in defense also because his normal turrets deal aoe dmg he can easy deal a lot more dmg). The weapon he uses i a staff.  Fighter The fighter is a mele class hero and uses of course a sword. He can build small walls better than others (they deal dmg when someone tries to destroy them).  Hunter The hunter places traps that can CC (Crow Control: Stuns, Slows, Silence etc). Also some just deal dmg. She places turrets that can poision the target for a small amout of time. She is ranged and uses a bow. Monk I like to call him lee sin  Because in league of legends lee sin is a blind monk  . Hes weapon is a staff but different from the mages cuz he is mele. He can create totems that will heal you or buff your turrets. Gameplay As i said this is a towerdefense game with where you can roam freely building your towers and walls to not let the enemies get pass you and break the core. You have crystals (green crystals is like your building material and blue is more like your mana to let you use spells). There is a limit on how much building you can build in the field so if a person uses all that liming to build only in one lane and dosent want to destroy it youre screwd.The  loot  system is almost the same as diablo (if not the same). A big amount of grinding is nessecay for leveling up and getting the best loot. Most of the loot you get are usefull at start but at the end game lvl 38 for example, 95% of the loot you get will be useless and is just junk that you sell. Even if you get a legendary it might be useless, someway because of the level cuz youre grinding on low levels and somethimes just of its stats.So lets talk about  XP . At the start its easy to level up as you proceed the campain but after youre done it will get easier. To unlock the insane difficulty and nightmare, nightmare 2 and so on. You have to complete the called quests, but the quest are no more than just lvl up to 50 so when youre lvl for example 38, you have to replay ALOT of the same level to get the most xp out of it and do it agan and again and again till you reach lvl 50 and unlock the insane difficulty to get better loot. Here is where i think is a big gap and alot of people thinking of quiting when they reach this certain point. You can see that the developmers has helped a bit and added daily exp to the first finishing missions. But on the other hand there is still something missing. That gap from lvl (exmpl) 38 to lvl 50 takes a lot of time of replayability so i think that the devolopers can add something into that like for exaple letting them acces the unlimited modes at a lower level than at 40 and still keeping the insane difficulty there. I think that would at least do something (if not fix it). Co-Op  is in this game and i highly recommend playing this game with a friend. You can still solo it and do well. But plaing multiplayer is easier because heroes in this game has a great synergy with each others for example lee sin (Monk class) can create totems that gives your turret a lot of power and a significantly increase in dmg. Free2Pay As the develpers are saying its NOT a pay2win game. Right now you can only use special money on cosmetics and chests that you find as loot. The chest CAN have very good loot but often dosent and just gives you a small boost on your items (Other words: you get better loot but not too far away from what you had). I hope this systems will stay as the realise comes. Development The game patches is pretty common and i mean it. There was a patch yesterday and a patch today. Those patches arent that big BUT add small features that the community requested. For example the sort panel on bags that wasent before todays patch. You can see (or read) with your own eyes that the developers react to their community and helps. Final verdict I dont mind grinding and farming for loot like in diablo with a small gap between the hero lvl. Graphics are ok for a free to play game and port is well optimised. This game is specialy good to play with friends but you can still solo it. The developers are nice and  hear  the community.I give this game a  8/10  "

								Ok things are good! I had a lot of trouble enjoying DDII at first but many of my issues where shared by the community in general and were listened to! Now we have a good game. It's not flawless but for free you can check out DDII yourself and see how it works.   My only challenge was the lack of customizability and how microtransactiony DDII was. Now you can get the premium currency in game (albeit slower that just buying it but that makes sense.) and there's many ways in game to unlock customizable parts for your heroes.    Considerable Flaws? To me the gameplay feels a bit less smooth. Not in a framerate way but just trap radius seem smaller, traps seem to do less damage comparitively to DDI but this IS a sequel so hey, also character damage seems more limiting even with a hero damage build, but the game is still beatable etc. Inventory feels a bit limiting but also is a microtransaction away from having more inventory. Character slots are the same, you can have 4 characters in your roster but if you want more you have to pony up or delete a current character. I didn't find any of these to ruin my entire experience though.			"

								You know, I used to enjoy this game.  To be honest, it used to be my favorite game, until chaos came out.  I came back after a few months of not playing, due to more recent games like overwatch.  I came back to see that all of my spheres, which made it super fun to play, were deleted.  iPwr, which I spent about 200 hours farming, just to be able to finish Nightmare IV, which is now gone, has been deleted as well.  All of my kits I had spent so long building, and all of the friends I had spent so long gaining, are now gone.  Even my friends are reccomending me to quit, which I might as well do until the previous game I used to love comes back.  My kits for Nightmare IV are still there, just not as effective due to the removal of spheres.  My shields for the squire went from having approximately 500K to 55K.  My Poison Dart Towers went from about 15K dps to 1k dps.  I instantly was furious.  I had spent so much time, just to watch all of my hard work crumble right before me.  I shall not be returning to this game, until I see on the youtube channel that there was an update allowing spheres again.  Thank you to those who read this extensive review, but to be honest, I would not reccomend this game anymore.  Maybe previously, but not now.			"

								I normally stay away from doing reviews, but honestly the community who want to dog this game is absurd. The game is still in Early Access. Now sure we are going on almost 2 years (in a few months), but there are plenty of other games that have done the same. People complain about Microtransactions, people complain that they can't just buy the game, people complain that and this and bah. Skins can cost however much they want, you don't have to buy them. The heros don't have to be bought. Sure it takes awhile to earn them I have put 150 hours into the game most of which was before they even had defender medals. So, I have just now earned One of the Heroes and I barely put time into it People are complaining that they are putting out new content. I have never in all my years heard of people complain because they are getting new stuff. ""It costs too much"" Then don't buy it ""It takes to long to get"" Then don't get it. This isn't a Moba where they are going to release 60+ Heroes. They are not going to just give away what they are spending their time making without making you earn it. They are even nice enough to make it so the costs goes down after a week of the new Hero coming out. Which they have no real reason to do. (Though I admit that it costing the exact cap is kinda annoying as it means you have to stop if you get there and the hero hasn't came out yet but I digress)  "

The only thing this game is missing is a really good story, to me the story seems pretty boring and doesn't have much character voice, if the game had characters that talk, and a story that grips you in, it would be really amazing. Also if the items like armor and relics would render onto the player that would be awesome. In total the game is really great and fun.			"

								Yeah its a fun game, everything CAN be obtainable if you play long enough, like for heros. If you buy one hero, it will give you an extra slot. Therefore everyone can have every hero. It's just gonna take you while to get 10000 defender medals. (12000 for new released one) Um... What else can I say... OH this game is very fun with friends. One tip for playing this game or any game actually. Enjoy the game rather than rushing to end game content, it'll ruin your experience on the early stages on the game. If you just take your time, you'll have fun during the process and soon you'll be in the end game stuff anyways. Happy killing! *dabs*			"

Graphics arn't bad, and gameplay is fun(Not the best thuo) but--Characters are overpriced(but you can get them thru in-game currency, basiclly one free if you complete tutorial)-Bug every once and awhile(Nothing too game ruining thuo)-The junk equipment(You're going to spend awhile looking thru your junk for the ones that are actually worth something)-Unbalanced(afew towers and characters are Over/Underpowered)Overall I would give it a 7/10, If given time it can be something great.

								So I picked up this game despite the negative reviews because I was interested in playing a tower defense game with my friends. As it turns out, the criticism was warranted. The game expects you to grind an absolutely absurd amount in order to even get a single hero you might want. It's a shame, because the game has potential - just don't hold your breath.			"

								It's a really free-to-play game, I love it. But there's an issue that I can't find any solution and many other people have this problem too. No matter what computer you have (even a high-end pc) it'll most likely crash. Since this is a co-op game, at some point you'll either help or ask for help but with this issue it's almost impossible. The only ""solution"" right now is adding each other through steam, so whenever one of the members crash they'll have the possibilty of joining again.EDIT:Looks like the issue is fixed, however I stopped playing this game due to the balance changes that came a couple of months ago. Without having much heroes they decided to nerf one of the most important hero that was necessary in a really high difficulty level, if I'm not wrong its towers dps were decreased for around 30-40% (can't remember what were the exact nerfs) making it extremely hard to complete one of these missions (well, with every update they'll always be an adaption so players found other ways to get over it, including spending more money on the game or having better gear). Yet, I find this game incredibly good.			"

								I loved the first dungeon defenders so much. Just total stupidety of the weapons and pets you could have. Using and archer with a many gun while your Team Fortress Pyro is shooting flames around you, Hell yeah.I was really looking forward to this game, expecting the same experience as DD 1, but hell i have been disappointed. First of al the pre-order, i dont mind supporting the Devs for this game, but the fact that it is free to play now is kind of questionabel for me. But the most dissapointing thing of all is the lack of 'fun'. I could play DD1 all day every day, feeling like it was a new game everytime i played with endless possibilities. The pets were really interesting and the weapons were ridicilous but that made it so fun to play. So ofcourse i buy the new DD2, but where is the fun? Every level feels like the lever before that, i just doesn't have the fun factor as DD1. And it has been in pre alpha for hella long. The updates don't feel right, just more stuff you can get for real $$ or €€. It sucks, it is cruisin towards a game where, if you want to beat all the levels, you just have to pump your hard earned money in it.  Beside this fact all those new chars/heroes coming out. I pre ordered it for a lot of money, and know you are saying i dont get the new chars unless i pay another 20 dollars? Or i have to play for a loooot of hours. Me no likie. For a F2P game this game can/is really fun. But for the Dungeon Defenders fan, we better get back playing DD1, where the fun was real. "

								After seeing this game come out a few days after 2014 christmas, I decided to take some of my money and bought the pre-alpha.When the game first came out, I was near addicted. Not fully addicted as I had other games to play - Mainly dota - but those games I already spent money in so I feel inclined to show some love here and there. Mostly however I was playing Dungeon Defenders II. I was so addicted I bought another copy of the pre-alpha for a friend, who plays it with me occasionally and generally we both enjoy it.I'll be brief with the positive and the negatives, but for those of you who are lazy about reading; Buy this game.1: The game has flucuating loot. No two weapons will be the same, legendaries actually feel... legendary... and generally speaking the game presents tons of options for you to mess around with. Want to go DPS squire? Sure, go for it! Want to go poison dart tower huntress? Go for it! The game gives you freedom of choice in this scenario.2: The developers are actively interested in making their game the best, consistently adding a weekly report on what they accomplished each week. They also have a great sense of humor with patch notes. (Still can't forget ""Squire can no longer father children. Yes, I know, it's a sad day"")3: The game feels fun while reminding you that it is a bit grindy. Yes, you have to grind for your loot at higher levels, but for at least the duration of the campaign it keeps introducing new mechanics that keeps you on your toes. Incursion and Infinite-reward waves are also interesting concepts, but hard.4: The game is becoming F2P today! In a recent patch, they will be performing an open alpha - a very rare sight! Even you, that random viewer whos viewing this because it came up on your steam overlay, could play this game, right now! And don't be concerned about ""P2W"" - Trendy has made sure that the game is only ""Pay to look cool"". And for those people who pre-purchased, they get 2000 gems free - enough for some snazzy gear.5: The graphics are beautiful and snazzy, and really colourful. They even have reskins of different levels depending on what mode you are playing. (For instance, normal throne room is all bright and cheerful, while nightmare throne room is gloomy with thunder and lightning.) The anbient effects are really nice most of the time, and the animations are fluid.There's tons more I want to say, but I'd rather just say experience it yourself today, when the patch goes live! Only warning; the game is known to hog a little memory. But my PC is semi-spec, and can still run it with virtually no lag.HF!			"

								They did it!  They made lightning strike twice.  I am so GLAD I stopped playing this game early on.A little bit of story.  I played the HELL out of DD1 200+ hours.  Had some of the very best gear, and an awesome female mage.  I was unstoppable.  Then they decided to stop all development, make this new game, and drop any support or conversion from DD1.  I was rather upset over this.  But hey I decided maybe the new game would be better.It wasn't..  I played 1-2 hours after every major update.  At first it was broken, then it was passable... but now?   They did it again and screwed up their game royally.  They screwed over their players by nerfing all the weapons, making drops more rare, and completely changing the skill system around.  They want to nickle and dime you instead of giving you a good experience.  I can say with a smile, that I am happy I never gave this the time of day until later.  I figure I'd let them flesh it out a bit.  turns out that meant for them to take a knife to it and start aimlessly digging around.So in short, screw this game.  In long, Where is the damn gender change for characters?  I wanted my female mage back, but nope, can be bothered adding a simple couple of skins to add variety.  Good bye DD2, I'm sad it had to end like this, but you done screwed it up.			"

								    I have played this line of games since Trendy first started the dungeon defenders series and will continue to as long as they make them. It is a very interesting game to me because i like the challenge and the grind factor that seems to be endless. I like the progression level of the game as well wiht the exception of the massive increase between nm3 and nm4. Now that said there a few things that need to be addressed with the game like the supposed fixes that cause more problems than they fix and the push to rush new content that is incomplete or broken. i am sure that most would rather have quality over quantity. This problems seems to derive from the fact they want to sell something new to you to keep the money rolling which is understandable but its not worth it to pay for something that doesnt work since they keep coming up with new things to sell you without fixing what they have already sold. It is a great game and i hope that they keep producing but would like to see more solid fixes and updates as well as better balancing.			"

								I do find this a very enjoyable game but i'm not one to grind for nm4 gear, rather i farm more of the events and monthlies which are the only real fun thing at this time about this game.There has been talk of adding some of the DD1 events/options in and i hope they do; more variety of play will help players and this game over all.  Okay Here goes;They continue to polish this game and to read player feedback(Unfortunetly they don't always listen to said feedback but i'm optimistic they will eventually)The graphics and character changes are nice (but the bugs and coding issues cause me to play this way lower so most of their efforts are blurrs and i just bypass it)I love all the pet changes that have been made(lots of nice pets but no options to aquire more space unless you pay real money.)No banks at all is definetly a big con here; you have to carry everything on your character with no storage options just buy bags with real money and that has a cap.  Also only one inventory for all characters.Their personal interface is buggy and doesn't run well with Steam at times; definetly needs work.I am one of the first to mention their prices but with their newest event the Carnival i am pleased to say they finally put in reasonable prices for the carnival tickets (don't get me started on that $48 skin though!!)I will say to new players, the community can be fickle but not inhospitable just be open to learning and listening.  If you come in and yell at builders for not letting you build instead of asking why, you're not going far trust me.Ask questions, read the forums and be patient, people will answer and help you.  Please don't push off their advise just because you don't like it or understand it initally; there are always elitists in every game but not all are!I say try this even with the bug issues, see for yourself if this is a game for you, i feel it has tons of potential and growth if Trendy takes it the right way.  Right now all we can do is wait and hope they do.  I also say try not to be too put off by prices; 99% are cosmetic, the only things that are not are the bags and hero slots.I am recommending this game in hopes it improves and becomes what they tell us it will be.  If it was finished now, i'd say stay clear but its still growing so don't let the Early Access or the F2P turn you away! "

								I really wished I could give this a rating instead of a yes-no recommendation.It would be a 5.5/10 since I can't say that this game is too awesome.My close friends has quit this game in 1 day since early access. Some friends I meet in this game, also quits.My only reason for me to still play this game is the monthly quest, but even then, I play easier levels cause I am bored.Pro:1- Trendy is trying hard, they really want to improve this game.2- They have made several events and I think they will keep doing this to keep the game more fun.3- Monthly quest with (usually) a new nice pet each month.4- Its Dungeon defenders.5- Probably, the most important pro, its not paid to win.Con:1- Repentive and no replayablity. You just play the same map over and over only cause you want better farm which will likely not drop so that you must play more.2- No variety. Each hero has 4 buildings, but you only use a few cause they are clearly better than others. You build every map the same way too, cause if you don't you will have a harder game.3- Fashion dupe galore. Fashion can be earned with a rare currency. 3-5 dupes? Sucks. Got over 17 dupes? Welcome in my world.4- Bad community. Low levels are rude leechers which pisses off high level players. High level players then hate low level player. Got stuck in latemid level? Get hated by high level players who are no longer willing to help you because of toxic community.5- Bad team setup. Just assume that 95% of the players only has dps'er and can only build crap. If you are a decent builder, then they all rely on you. Even if you have 4 character slots, not many will realise it can be a good idea to have 3 builder and 1 dps'er for example.6- Boring gameplay at high level. Build your stuffs? Going to play? Then you have 2 jobs to do. Tank and repair walls or shoot and repair walls.			"

								After seeing this game come out a few days after 2014 christmas, I decided to take some of my money and bought the pre-alpha.When the game first came out, I was near addicted. Not fully addicted as I had other games to play - Mainly dota - but those games I already spent money in so I feel inclined to show some love here and there. Mostly however I was playing Dungeon Defenders II. I was so addicted I bought another copy of the pre-alpha for a friend, who plays it with me occasionally and generally we both enjoy it.I'll be brief with the positive and the negatives, but for those of you who are lazy about reading; Buy this game.1: The game has flucuating loot. No two weapons will be the same, legendaries actually feel... legendary... and generally speaking the game presents tons of options for you to mess around with. Want to go DPS squire? Sure, go for it! Want to go poison dart tower huntress? Go for it! The game gives you freedom of choice in this scenario.2: The developers are actively interested in making their game the best, consistently adding a weekly report on what they accomplished each week. They also have a great sense of humor with patch notes. (Still can't forget ""Squire can no longer father children. Yes, I know, it's a sad day"")3: The game feels fun while reminding you that it is a bit grindy. Yes, you have to grind for your loot at higher levels, but for at least the duration of the campaign it keeps introducing new mechanics that keeps you on your toes. Incursion and Infinite-reward waves are also interesting concepts, but hard.4: The game is becoming F2P today! In a recent patch, they will be performing an open alpha - a very rare sight! Even you, that random viewer whos viewing this because it came up on your steam overlay, could play this game, right now! And don't be concerned about ""P2W"" - Trendy has made sure that the game is only ""Pay to look cool"". And for those people who pre-purchased, they get 2000 gems free - enough for some snazzy gear.5: The graphics are beautiful and snazzy, and really colourful. They even have reskins of different levels depending on what mode you are playing. (For instance, normal throne room is all bright and cheerful, while nightmare throne room is gloomy with thunder and lightning.) The anbient effects are really nice most of the time, and the animations are fluid.There's tons more I want to say, but I'd rather just say experience it yourself today, when the patch goes live! Only warning; the game is known to hog a little memory. But my PC is semi-spec, and can still run it with virtually no lag.HF!			"

								They did it!  They made lightning strike twice.  I am so GLAD I stopped playing this game early on.A little bit of story.  I played the HELL out of DD1 200+ hours.  Had some of the very best gear, and an awesome female mage.  I was unstoppable.  Then they decided to stop all development, make this new game, and drop any support or conversion from DD1.  I was rather upset over this.  But hey I decided maybe the new game would be better.It wasn't..  I played 1-2 hours after every major update.  At first it was broken, then it was passable... but now?   They did it again and screwed up their game royally.  They screwed over their players by nerfing all the weapons, making drops more rare, and completely changing the skill system around.  They want to nickle and dime you instead of giving you a good experience.  I can say with a smile, that I am happy I never gave this the time of day until later.  I figure I'd let them flesh it out a bit.  turns out that meant for them to take a knife to it and start aimlessly digging around.So in short, screw this game.  In long, Where is the damn gender change for characters?  I wanted my female mage back, but nope, can be bothered adding a simple couple of skins to add variety.  Good bye DD2, I'm sad it had to end like this, but you done screwed it up.			"

								It's a good, somewhat completed game, that's fun in LAN. :) It's free to play, and there's no real ""pay-to-win"" need, either. I love how you can collect items throughout, reminding me of Borderlands and Diablo. None of those wussy items like in Secret World and Age of Conan, either. ;) Tons of small gimmicks, like pets and skills. Later in the game you can change some of the effects on the other towers. A few downsides, though: it's buggy (it's alpha, so no surprise there). You'll be thrown out of the game and have to rejoin the match at times (fortunately you don't have to wait for the match to finish before you can rejoin), sometimes the weapon-animations suddenly stop showing, or trying to carry more than 1 gold/crystal during the Kobolt Challenge will simply delete the other, sometimes you just can't connect with a friend and both gotta restart the game... I do wish there'd be a few more towers to chose between for each character, though, but at least you can change character ingame as often  as you wish, and use several types. Yeah, there are downsides. It's a free alpha though, so can't complain and let it prevent me from giving a recommendation, because we (four of us) had a lot of fun. Some even bought the hideously expensive Hero/Costume packs - not worth it in my opinion. My tip? Download it, play it for free, enjoy it a lot (or not, and no money lost). If you like it enough that you'll buy pretty-coloured things for lots of real money, well - all power to you, I suppose. Enjoy!			"

								Dungeon Defenders is a good game and I love it, but there is something that doesn't work properly. I went to the tavern after a match when suddenly I came to the hero creation site, and i couldn't get out. And I noticed that the connection to the servers isn't very good.This game is one of my favorite games and I love it but these two things annoys me really much. And there is more things that is annoying, but I choosed these two because they annoy me the most.But I think this game is good and it will be better in the future because its just an Alpha.

								ATM No, The game doesn't have a true direction and is constant change. Game feels to linear and only provides a few days of fun after each patch, a TD game usually tends to not be as fun after each map playthrough. Going Open Alpha shortly id recomend you wait for that, as good graphically as the game and costumes are, the game experience is lacking.with a few more modes for longevity, some competitive modes and more maybe (they could look into other custom maps on wc3 for idea's.)The game can become great, it has potential. But its all round the place and patches are very sporadic and feel un-tested.Edit.Came back for a bit games still bad if not worse (aside from weapons) with a even more horrible patch called ""Carnival"" and patches that came with mroe bugs than fix's. Im looking forward to New heroes, but even more core rebalance and the hero deck change. I'll probably be back again after core rebalance hopefully its good enough for me to change my review then.Edit.2017 now, feels worse than before.			"

								I am a DD1 player, and I have to say.  DD2 is really looking great!The new upcomeing patch will  make some great headway for the issues people are haveing. Some people maybe just a bit salty due to their long hours of grinding  just to end up being brought back down to noob status once more, but I think they will agree its something thats tollerable.It's to be expected from wipes to have bugs in a alpha, which isnt as bad as it seems.  I have too honestly say so far I have enjoyed the refreshing remake overall, deails of the old, with quite a bit of new things I didn't expect.It just keeps getting better! Great Job trendy!I look forward to the future of the great game you contunualy work to makeing DD2 to be!			"

								It's DD1 with upgraded visuals. Very enjoyable. For a while.It lacks all the little things, the depth, that makes you want to keep playing the game beyond the first 10-15 hours.In DD1, you could really delve into stats, builds, and have fun with varied maps and challenges. Plus, there was an actual feel of progression. Here, you grind through a lvl 30 map until you get to the level cap (50), simply because it's better than any other gamemode or map when it comes to XP per hour per effort.In truth, if DD2 didn't kill all activity on DD1, I'd still be playing DD1.This game is not an improvement. It's a dumbed down game with better graphics.But the potentional is there.			"

Although, your time on playing the game isn't that fun after you crash. For me I keep crashing for every 6 to 7 hours, then I have to do a process to get back to the game. Right now, when you crash, it might say that your game is still running when you try to retart Dungeon defenders 2. I sort of found a way to get back to your game again, but even if you do the process,the game will still crash. Overall, this game is fun, really fun and especially with your friends, but it can be ruined when your game suddenly crashed and you can't get back on it.  I hope the developers see this and try to fix the problem. For now, I recomend this game if you're willing to play it even though it crashes.			"

								I really liked this game, was a huge fan of DD1 when it was still new but here updates broke it its not challenging what so ever the gameplay is either you play alone on a map wich can be pretty fun if you dont mind playing a multiplayer game alone but as a group its less boring and at the same time more boring because 1 or 2 people will build their towers at first wave,... done thats it for the entire game you upgrade here and there but you dont have anymore to do.The Ogres wich were supposed to cause stress to the players usually die within seconds, and im not taking 20-30 seconds here im talking of like 2-3 SECONDS! no challenge.I can play my EV2 level 31 with a level 16 weapon not because i want to more like because i have trouble finding a propper replacement and on top of that i dont need it anyway EV2 is basically so strong that you onehit almost anything anyway but because of the ipwr (Gearlevel) you cant go to higher levels so you can choose wearing piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥gear with high ipwr and play higher difficultys the way you dont wanna play it or youre stuck forever farming items you will probably never find because the lootsystem is broken.Ive found over 500 Items with the same defense stats and maybe 10 or 12 with hero damage. I want hero damage because i want to fight actively when i pick defense power ofc id have some badass towers but in the end badass tower means afk gameplay wtf developers when maxlevel was 25 the lootsystem was balanced you found equally hero and defense stat items now i find the same legendary with useless stats 10 times in a row.... wtf?I know this is early access but the game was full of people when maxlevel was 25 now there are barely 10 lobbys... also the items themselves you find a legendary item level 26 for example then you find a green item level 28 the green item is slightly better wtf? Seriously fix it trendynet!Ive seen a Lavamancer dealing 52 MILLION DAMAGE wtf guys stop adding new content start fixing what youve done until now especially remove the ipwr barricade it does not make any sense !!

								Several crashes and Errors. Bad netowrk system. Graphics are old although at least are athestical.

Other things are kind of taste based but i didnt like them either.			"

								Wow, nice job devsyou made DD series look like those typical, ♥♥♥♥♥♥, f2p tower defenses.I don't think there's something to say about that you actualy made it f2p, after it costed like 10 Euros.And hm, I also don't think that there's something to say about that you didn't gave anything special for players that actually played this game when it wasn't f2p. But there's actually something to say about how unbalanced it is, how boring it is. You don't even need to do something. You're just putting sentries and they're doing the rest. You can literaly wait till you kill everyone. You don't even have to look if they breached defences, cause y'know , no matter where you're gonna put them, they'll do everything anyways. The plus is, you can browse imgur, text with someone on Facebook and don't even bother about the game.very good job devs, you made DD boring and f2p. wow			"

								JUST. DON'T.''the first game was good''agreed!''the second might be fun too''nope!''Why?'' cause the developers have turned into money hungry pigs with an insatiable hunger and no respect for their customers  preventing all fun in the game.sad thing is the game started out really good, but now its just at a point where i opened the game and was instantly asked to pay 40 bucks to unlock a new character or grind daily/monthly missions for ages to even be able to think of affording the new character (or any old character) you even have to unlock the hunter and the monk that way too even though they are part of the CORE team of the game!? at least they are cheap and you can afford them after winning 4 matches, as they are only 10 defender coins each, wouldn't even be strange if they changed that..all in all?gameplay 8/10paywall too damn extreme 0/10developers -10/10 sad people			"

								The lack of any kind of deposit chest or locking items feature made me delete a whole inventory full with Pet stuff.Yeah my fault they don't have this almost basic stuff.Edit: Happened again, after the Trials Update I simply pressed Z instead of S (who the ♥♥♥♥ even thinks about putting the SELL ALL button near the SELL ONE ITEM button) and I sold the whole inventory full of Pet stuff and before the Update items. No prompt asking me to sell everything appeared which was a known bug, I tried reaching the support and after one week I'm still ""waiting"" for them to answer, I will probably give up on this game, just like you should, the Trials Update is a joke for new players AND old ones.Edit 2: They did not responded at all, ayy lmao.

								I can't recommend DD2, it's just not near as fun as the original and it's been in EA for years. Trendy made a huge mistake making it F2P trash. Really no reason to play until release (if that ever happens) because Trendy constantly updates, which is not a good thing, because they have changed the game 10x over. They let a small community group update their first game (which somewhat ruined it, because they nerfed/buffed classes) and now they dropped the ball with DD2, RIP Trendy and the Dungeon Defenders franchise, if only they made it a normal paid game like the first one...

Early Access Review
								First of all, I played about 600 hours in DD1, I dont really think that DD2 can be even REMOTELY as good as DD1 now (even with the fact that 99% of good gear is duped/hacked).Very laggy, crashed after 1 hour of staying in tavern because it ate all my memory (16 gb). Game servers is laggy too, interface is non-convinient. Didnt had any chance to test gameplay in-deep because it eats all my memory and crashes. Also vsync not working. Uninstalled. 0/10 atm.Oh, did I mention that this game is absolutely P2W? I mean F.UСК free to play P2W garbage games, which DD2 is right now. Stash space for money? Additional character slots? Seriously? This is just what I able to see by the time I was wandering around tavern and playing first map for a bit, but I guess since there is some kind of gems currency which you can buy - game is complete p2w garbage. Devs say you can only buy cosmetics with it, at the same time game wants your money for char slots and stash space. Tower balance looks pretty poor at least on squire. In DD1 you could put, as I remember, 3 harpoons on starting map from all chests you got at first level (4+1 chests that give you 40 mana each and harpoon worth 80 I think). Here I just spammed some tower around crystal, I had enough mana to build like 8 towers on first level before first wave. Towers feel less important because of that, you just spam them everywhere because you cant even upgrade them before level 4.Map selection screen looks poorly made with really crappy models and overall worse than DD1's simple and good looking level interface.No option to cancel this really annoying squire attack-step animation.Tab key cant be rebinded (i guess its a console or something). Fix this please.Some weird chests appeared at the end of first mission which took about 10 seconds to appear in unskippable cutscene, then it took me a while to find a little area where I could press E to open middle chest (and why there is two gray chests around it?) and it dropped some loots. Well, easy to fix this, right?I have no idea why it gets so many positive rewiers, I guess people see that its free to play and happy about it, it also brings a lot of new people to the game. Thrust me, DD1 is amazing atmospheric game, nothing in tower defence genre will ever be even remotely close as good as it is. Endgame has its problems, hacking is a big problem, but still.I just dream of DD1 reset with new VAC system and some kind of auction house, couple of new maps and achievements, option to make graphics not so anime-like - bam, perfect all-time TD game.

								This is easily one of the most polished Early Access titles.It has hundreds of hours of gameplay and it's not even close to finished.The developers are constant responding to feedback and adjusting their game to make it better on close to a monthly basis.They have a great team that works with their community and they try to assist their Twitch community as well.Pros:Easy to learn/hard to master gameplay that's a mix of Tower Defense, twitchy-action, and role-playing.Wyvern bosses to slay.  Four characters that have build variety to make them unique.PetsCostumesGREAT 4-player Co-opDecent leveling (could be better, but it's alpha!)Perks for having multiple characters (builds, increased XP, etc.)Weekly Devstream talking about what they're working onLots of loot farmingCons:Maybe a little more work on the pricing of some itemsBetter leveling between 40-50 (50 is max level)Needs more build variety in end-game(it's coming soon, but had to list as a con)UI needs work, along with inventory improvementsOverall, this game is phenomenal for being F2P and in Early Access.There's still some bugs here and there, but the developers are responsive to their community and are constantly updating/hotfixing and making changes.

Early Access Review
								When I first got this game, I had high expectations for it. Dungeon Defenders 1 was spectacular and the 2nd needed to live up to its legacy. After some time of good updates, this game has become a very good game, to the point where i might say it is better than the 1st. The pet system is amazing, the improved animations are good, and the newly introduced towers are spectacular. One negative to Dungeon Defenders 2 is that it doesnt have as much variety as the 1st (DLC Characters and Levels). These will probaly be made later after Early Access. If you are going to get this game, I would tell you to wait till it goes free in December, however, if you want bonus in-game credits, buy it early access.			"

								Played the first one- loved it. Played second one- loved it even more. So much more added, so much more addicting now.  Best thing is that when it gets released, its going to be Free 2 Play. Ofcourse has a few minor problems, for example getting stuck on the loading screen. Even though in alpha, i totally recommend this.			"

								When I first got this game I was having framerate issues when trying to play, I started out with high because thats how i run most games but had to quickly drop to low in order to run at 10-15 fps. After talking with some of the devs as well as other players we were able to get things fixed for me and I was able to get the game running smoothly. Ths is one of my favorite series to play with friends on xbox so I'm super happy I was able to get things running on here. Thanks for the help devs!			"

Early Access Review
								    I have played this line of games since Trendy first started the dungeon defenders series and will continue to as long as they make them. It is a very interesting game to me because i like the challenge and the grind factor that seems to be endless. I like the progression level of the game as well wiht the exception of the massive increase between nm3 and nm4. Now that said there a few things that need to be addressed with the game like the supposed fixes that cause more problems than they fix and the push to rush new content that is incomplete or broken. i am sure that most would rather have quality over quantity. This problems seems to derive from the fact they want to sell something new to you to keep the money rolling which is understandable but its not worth it to pay for something that doesnt work since they keep coming up with new things to sell you without fixing what they have already sold. It is a great game and i hope that they keep producing but would like to see more solid fixes and updates as well as better balancing.			"

								This game is absolutely fantastic.  It's beautiful and loads of fun.The ratings for the game reflected that, too, until March 24th when Trendy decided to sue an ex-employee who had violated his contract.  And then people started to rate the game badly.  Seriously, go look at the ratings prior to the 24th and then the avalanche of ratings on the 24th that announced how horrible that is.  BTW, nothing significant changed about the game on the 24th.So we have a bunch of liars, basically, who are willing to claim that this fine game sucks because they don't like what the company is doing elsewhere.

Early Access Review
								Graphics:- Nice comic-style with a lot of bright colors, resulting in a very ""warm/lovely"" atmosphere- A lot of variation in maps for example old dungeons, green fields, gigantic sewers, burning cities, spooky forests or a throne room and there is much more! New maps are constantly added, each with their own layout and theming.- The characters are designed with a lot of love for details and they all look very different from each other. You can also buy skins with ingame currency to give you a bit more variation.-> Overall one of the biggest pros for me are the graphics. I could stare hours into the beautiful landscapes and also write hours about it ;)Balance/Bugs/Ingame Currency-> Trendy constantly adds new content to the game, so they can have all features they want as quickly as possible, but this also results in a lot of bugs. The worst bugs get fixed quickly. The balance issues are not that bad in early stages of the game, but in the endgame there are only a few viable towers/characters. I´m sure the balance will get fixed, since most of the old characters will get reworked soon to be as good as the new ones. The ingame currency is fine. You can get some skins and additional inventory slots with it, but nothing that would give you an advantage in the game.Gameplay:- A lot of variation in maps, difficulties, items and characters. You can even equip spheres to boost your character to the max. or take a pet to help you in battle- Tons of enemies, each with their own strengths and some with special abilitiess- The normal gamemode is nice and balanced and will take you a good amount of time to reach the last difficulties.- The second gamemode is named ""onslaught"" and is basically an endless mode. The gamemode is fun but does not provide good rewards at the end. I´m sure they will make some work on this gamemode soon.- The third and last gamemode is named ""incursion"" and is a much harder version of the map you choose. The gamemode is very challenging and is okey so far. But they currently work on adding a different task for each map and a unique reward if you win. There is already one map with this concept and i´m very happy with it.- Daily missions/monthly missions have good rewards and are well done.- Characters all have their own playstyle and look.I could write on for hours, because there is so much more to talk about, but i wanted to keep it short and just give you an idea of the current state of the game!  Result:-> The fantastic graphics, love to details and the variety of characters, pets, enemies and maps, make this one of my favorite games. I spent over 440 hours on this game so far and don´t regret anything. The Trendy team is friendly and listens to the community. Constant patches with new characters, challenges, maps and much more keep the game interesting and fun. Just keep in mind that the game is in development and still contains some bugs and balance issues, but overall I can totally recommend you to test it out yourself, you won´t regret it!!			"

								Still being worked on and does have a few issues such as a lack of maps as of now but for how hard the devs are working and how much new content and patches come out on a regular basis it's deffinetly something worth supporting.

								So many things went wrong in execution. It took many great features from the first game and then split them into a microtransaction format. Not necessarily a horrible thing, except they made it unusually expensive to have; almost like someone thought people will pay the ridiculous prices solely from loving the first game.Of the things it kept in, they expanded in poor ways. The larger environments don't have anything to keep them going. One thing about the first game was how tight and well designed its levels were, but that's gone now. It's like the microtransaction model was made to rely on past players, but the design doesn't attract them.			"

								I stopped playing this game a while back and thought I would let it progress and see how much better it is down the line....... ohh boy was I wrong I can't even clear 1 map it seems the focus of the game switched from tower defense to hero defense.  Is it me or does the towers do nothing, I use to play a squire and set up my defense with towers mainly and that was fun for me because thats the way I wanted to play it..... now I can't even clear anything the tower system sucks my towers don't do enough damage the range is utter garbage..... wow this game turned around for the worse I thought it was really good last year but how the dev's messed up real bad in my opinion anyway.  They should take out the tag on this game being a ""Tower Defense"" its more like a hack and slash now			"

In my opinion this just shows how stupidity won over creativity. Moneytizing to the max and in my opinion not worth playing. Other bias can be expected to happen in the future. 2,9/5			"

								It's DD1 with upgraded visuals. Very enjoyable. For a while.It lacks all the little things, the depth, that makes you want to keep playing the game beyond the first 10-15 hours.In DD1, you could really delve into stats, builds, and have fun with varied maps and challenges. Plus, there was an actual feel of progression. Here, you grind through a lvl 30 map until you get to the level cap (50), simply because it's better than any other gamemode or map when it comes to XP per hour per effort.In truth, if DD2 didn't kill all activity on DD1, I'd still be playing DD1.This game is not an improvement. It's a dumbed down game with better graphics.But the potentional is there.			"

								Games like these are the ones that you would spend the whole day playing, but since this is only alpha and not the full release, your area and items are limited, but there are alot to choose from. Although, your time on playing the game isn't that fun after you crash. For me I keep crashing for every 6 to 7 hours, then I have to do a process to get back to the game. Right now, when you crash, it might say that your game is still running when you try to retart Dungeon defenders 2. I sort of found a way to get back to your game again, but even if you do the process,the game will still crash. Overall, this game is fun, really fun and especially with your friends, but it can be ruined when your game suddenly crashed and you can't get back on it.  I hope the developers see this and try to fix the problem. For now, I recomend this game if you're willing to play it even though it crashes.			"

								I really liked this game, was a huge fan of DD1 when it was still new but here updates broke it its not challenging what so ever the gameplay is either you play alone on a map wich can be pretty fun if you dont mind playing a multiplayer game alone but as a group its less boring and at the same time more boring because 1 or 2 people will build their towers at first wave,... done thats it for the entire game you upgrade here and there but you dont have anymore to do.The Ogres wich were supposed to cause stress to the players usually die within seconds, and im not taking 20-30 seconds here im talking of like 2-3 SECONDS! no challenge.I can play my EV2 level 31 with a level 16 weapon not because i want to more like because i have trouble finding a propper replacement and on top of that i dont need it anyway EV2 is basically so strong that you onehit almost anything anyway but because of the ipwr (Gearlevel) you cant go to higher levels so you can choose wearing piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥gear with high ipwr and play higher difficultys the way you dont wanna play it or youre stuck forever farming items you will probably never find because the lootsystem is broken.Ive found over 500 Items with the same defense stats and maybe 10 or 12 with hero damage. I want hero damage because i want to fight actively when i pick defense power ofc id have some badass towers but in the end badass tower means afk gameplay wtf developers when maxlevel was 25 the lootsystem was balanced you found equally hero and defense stat items now i find the same legendary with useless stats 10 times in a row.... wtf?I know this is early access but the game was full of people when maxlevel was 25 now there are barely 10 lobbys... also the items themselves you find a legendary item level 26 for example then you find a green item level 28 the green item is slightly better wtf? Seriously fix it trendynet!Ive seen a Lavamancer dealing 52 MILLION DAMAGE wtf guys stop adding new content start fixing what youve done until now especially remove the ipwr barricade it does not make any sense !!

								Loved Dungeon Defenders I.  Dungeon Defenders II is a steaming pile of poop.  It isn't ready for release to the public at all and I'm very, very unhappy that they charged a fee for a game in this state.  I originally bought the game months ago (it's 7/7/16 now), and as of yesterday the game is still garbage.  I feel insulted and I feel like I was taken advantage of.  I spent more than a decade making games professionally, and what I see in this ""released"" game is horrible.The biggest problem with the first game appears to be that the art direction (which I think is lovely) attracts an incredibly young player base who isn't particularly suited to strategy gameplay.  The sequel seems to be lining up to be the same mess of incredibly young player population who play selfishly rather than cooperatively even at the cost of losing the match, and prefer to have their characters speed leveled by high level games rather than earning their levels and actually learning how to play the character classes and the maps.I wouldn’t consider recommending this game to anyone for any reason in its current state.  After the game is actually in a completed state I would recommend it as I would the original game, if you have a player group already assembled who can play together, go for it.  But, as an adult  it isn’t worth the time to deal with the immature player population.			"

								You know, I used to enjoy this game.  To be honest, it used to be my favorite game, until chaos came out.  I came back after a few months of not playing, due to more recent games like overwatch.  I came back to see that all of my spheres, which made it super fun to play, were deleted.  iPwr, which I spent about 200 hours farming, just to be able to finish Nightmare IV, which is now gone, has been deleted as well.  All of my kits I had spent so long building, and all of the friends I had spent so long gaining, are now gone.  Even my friends are reccomending me to quit, which I might as well do until the previous game I used to love comes back.  My kits for Nightmare IV are still there, just not as effective due to the removal of spheres.  My shields for the squire went from having approximately 500K to 55K.  My Poison Dart Towers went from about 15K dps to 1k dps.  I instantly was furious.  I had spent so much time, just to watch all of my hard work crumble right before me.  I shall not be returning to this game, until I see on the youtube channel that there was an update allowing spheres again.  Thank you to those who read this extensive review, but to be honest, I would not reccomend this game anymore.  Maybe previously, but not now.			"

								First 2hrs, already impressed. In my opinnion for its current stage is a big improvement from DD1. Hopefully when its on its final release the anti-cheat will stop the hackers. Since it will be free. So far I rate it 8/10. Great game! Must buy if you got the cash!^ 12/13/2014------ Updated Review.Now for a better review as I have more game time.Straight off we will start yes this game is lacking some very needed functions or should I  say core elements for the game, as trading or even just to drop items in your tavern should be in but I am just going to leave that as it's still in Pre Alpha.As you journey on playing the difficulty ""Normal"" on some levels if you are new or unexperienced, the levels seem to be some what difficult for someone new to the game. If you are playing alone that is. As again you are meant to play with people, More people more chance of bonus loot(better loot) 4 Players becomes a large chance of good loot.From DD1, I can say that the towers have been nerfed? That don't seem to feel do as much damage as I would rather expect. I was suprised when they had said there wasn't going to be PvP, slightly dissapointed but it isn't that much of a big deal as I got the game to play with friends. Graphics:In my opinnion I think they are a lot better then the previous dungeon defenders and truly like the new graphcs! But again I miss the more cartoony side of the old DD not sure if that makes sense but can't really explain it. - Overall: 7.5/10Maps:Great maps, so far loved all of them! each map is unique and some what different in a way wether your helping crystals or just a cart. Overall: 9/10AI:AI are great, so far there are some great monsters/enemys to verse in DD2, they have annouced there will be more enemys which is great and excited about that! overall: 6.5/10Towers:So far I've played as Monk, Apprentice and Squire. From what my experiences have been the towers lack power as they had more power in DD1. other then that I really like the desings of some towers that are in the current DD2. Overall 5/10Taverns:It can be quite confusing as there is an ""Entry Tavern"" and a ""Private Tavern"" (Not sure if there was a public tavern as I played in private groups) And going to the war recruiter is a bit annoying as if you have a player thats 1 level below the war recruiters you can't play, I guess it's to stop boosters? Eh overall: 6/10Inventory:Inventory is really basic at the moment all though, the ""Temporary bag""(if your bags full it goes there) just seems to be endless and you can keep getting items not sure if that was intetnional or what. Inventory can be a bit buggy, you can purchase a ""Small Bag"" for $10,000 In-game Credits and a ""Large Bag"" for $50,000 In-Game credits. I am not sure if I like this or not, I haven't purchased one as I don't need it. But seems pretty cool. Each item you get can be transferred to other characters ( just stays in your inv) which is handy as same does your money transfers across, I am not sure what happened but a mate and I both got the game at the same time, played same time and he ended up with $40,000 and I had $13,000 but had collected close to same amount of coins laying around. Not sure what happened. Overall 8.5/10Money system:I like how they approched this, insted of Mana being your currecny it's gold. Which is great! Overall: 8/10Overall:Still think with everything I have mentioned it is a fun game, and it is great to participate in the development of this game. Rating:7/10Worth Buying?:Yes and no. It all really depends on yourself. Do you want to support or just wait?If you want to help development then sure go right ahead, but aside that there are a lot of bug's that will be fixed in the near future hopefully but still great game and I do personally think it's worth buying.

								I wish I could recommend this game, however, I'm becoming tired of supporting these developers. Sure, I got a good 800+ hours of gameplay out of this, but, I feel like I'm just losing hair due to frustration and boredom than enjoyment.Every update introduces some really game breaking bugs, and there are still a few game breaking bugs that have been around for a long while, and Trendy just outright ignores them, even after the community has complained about it. a lot. for a long time. They update their game with near-useless content. We, as a player base, would honestly be happier with THE CORE MECHANICS DONE. THE IMPORTANT SYSTEMS. FOR AN ALPHA STAGE. Why would we need new heroes that don't really introduce new mechanics (that have already been done in dd1), and not actually necessary things from DD1 like a server browser, tavern trading, shopping and personalization, etc. DD2 went backwards, and is now slowly moving forwards, at a snails pace. If anything, the game will be done in another 100 years, when Trendy has gone bankrupt for wasting time on the Alpha stage making pointless add-ons that honestly don't help at the game's current state, or keeps the fanbase dedicated to the franchise.Most of the add-ons introduced seem more like content that should have been added once the game has been complete. Now, I'd like to talk more about the ""multiplayer"" aspect of this game.Sure, the game is in alpha, but with the devs adding pointless content (only worthwhile update was the UI and hero deck system), they're disregarding what made Dungeon Defenders 1 amazing, when they could be adding the things that really need to be added.There are bugs which Trendy still haven't fixed, and you know it's game breaking when the error literally says ""FATAL ERROR"".This one bug which crashes your game when you try to join a game with a party, really makes the player want to play solo to avoid all of the frustration of joining games with randoms. This bug has been around for 3 or so updates. Go figure, huh?On to the design side. Who the hell is this game's designer/s? Is there really a roadmap for this game? Who thought it'd be a good idea to focus on end-game heroes, and completely ignore the new players who are trying out the game to see if it's their cup of tea? When ever I go to the social hub, I see new players spamming ""LOOKING FOR PARTY"" or ""CANT FIND PARTY, INVITE ME PLZZ"",  which could be fixed by actually adding a bloody server browser. WHICH DUNGEON DEFENDERS 1 HAD.The way this game is going, it'll only last for so long until the userbase will get burned out.Where is the super awesome RNG loot that made DD1 awesome? I want my chainsaw that is 10x the size of my character!In reality, everyone that's maxed out with the same power level will basically have the same stats. Even in text, that really doesn't sound so fun now, does it? Anyway, sorry if I dragged this review for too long,So, please Trendy, make your game great again.			"

								""God willing we'll all meet again in Spaceballs 2: The Search for more Money.""What do you do when you've milked every possible cent out of your game via DLC, 90% off sales, remakes, and indie bundles?  You make a 'sequel' with less depth to draw in the F2P crowd.There isn't much to say about Dungeon Defenders 2.  It's practically the same game with less towers, smaller maps, fewer bosses, fewer heroes, and an even more tedious grind-to-progress system.  And while the first game could have stood to benefit from more focus this shifts the focus more towards hero action than a tower defense game.  Dropping in a multiplayer game you will rarely be able to build your own fortifications as you start with little mana and the players already there will have taken up the defense limit.  It forces you to recruit friends to play so you can manage some strategy or treat the game as if it were a shallow Diablo-clone focusing on your hero stats.Technically the game is in rough shape.  After nearly a year of Early Access on Steam (and a longer period where it wasn't available for sale) optimization is extremely poor.  Stutters and slowdowns are constant on my 770 with an i5 processor and in two days I've lost count of the number of times I've had to Alt F4 out of a loading screen that hangs forever.Updated: The loading screen issues have been fixed although there is still a degree of stuttering after transitions.To their credit there's no P2W going on.  The stuff you buy with cash is mostly cosmetic and/or speeding up the time you can acquire pets and such.  And, of course, there's daily quests, gold farming, all that 'fun' stuff.  All Trendy has done  here is repackage DD1 and wrapped it up into a nuBlizzard F2P shell.			"

								Approx. 65 hours in:I've never really been much for making reviews, but I guess I could say I would gladly recommend this, would even pay 10-20 euro for the game at it's current stage or better.I do like that they decided to make the game F2P, with microtransactions for costumes, that would never affect gameplay (many people are upset, and I don't see why since it only changes your appearance, but fair enough).Many seems to complain about having to buy extra inventory space, and why? I've reached level 50 on all 4 characters, sure I've grinded a little bit, but with the monthly mission, and daily missions, all different characters, lots of different maps, I'd say I haven't grown bored yet from always having variety of a certain kind. Sure, the characters are each amazing for one specific build and suck at the rest, but does it matter? It does come into play with tactics when you reach the end, because the dropped gear is most likely useless if you want defense gear for a tower builder, and you're playing on your hero character, since the ""passives"" will be made for that particular character you play as. That adds challenge, in my opinion, to using your characters and towers correctly.Also, fun to play with friends, I haven't put money into it, and probably won't put any money into costumes since they, easily unlocked by real money, can still be unlocked with the in-game special currency, that (as far as I know) only comes from Dailies and Monthly missions. I really think people should consider playing the game a little, before complaining about it being all ""Microtransactions? This will be a pay-to-win game for sure!""So, all in all, I recommend this game, whether you're a solo player or have friends to play with, though it's always better when you have friends to play with :).P.S. If any developer see's this, I'm curious, when we step out of Alpha, will people keep their characters and items, or will it be reset and we receive stuff based on our playing? Something else maybe?P.S.S. I noticed only 2 bugs in the game so far. 1: Sometimes (SPOILER) Harbinger may stay around even after you finish a ""phase"" with him, where you can't touch him, he can touch you easily aswell as the ship.2: Sometimes gold & tower mana (greens) can disappear from the ground when I, or a teammate, opens the tower mana chest after a round, and I do not get it picked up, neither gold nor mana, but perhaps there's another explanation to this?

Early Access Review
								Im reading the recent reviews and every review is saying that the new heroes are overpowered and behind a paywall.  After the release of lavamancer im getting too lazy to update this review so just take what you can from this.	 Spoilers	It's notDungeon defenders 2 is a tower defense game where you build towers and defend against an army of orcs. There are multiple maps to play and new maps are being added. The game is grindy and you'll need to farm for gear alot if you want to progress into the higher difficulty, if you're into grinding then this game will be for you.  Let's talk about the classes shall we?	There are 6 classes (7 really soon) monk, squire, apprentice, huntress, abyss lord and EV2.  Monk	 is more of an utility having spells which heals players near him or crowd control enemies, 1 aura which can heal and the other which can buff defenses damage (and health if you have a sphere for it) he has a lightning aura that can damage enemies and can stun them too if they are drenched in water and there's the anti-air tower which should be obvious at what it does. Shoots air targets. Squire	 Is  a tank which can be built as dps thanks to the new weapon, he has a shield to tank hits and has 3 abilities which are, a damaging spell, a taunt and a stun. His defenses are the basic ones he has a cannon tower, barricade, ballista and a training dummy. People should really focus the squire for his barricade because it has alot of health and just saves games for everyone or go dps if you got someone to build walls for you already. Apprentice	 This guy like the squire has similliar defenses. a flameburst tower, barricade, frostbite tower and earthshatter tower. His spells are a tornado, arcane volley which hits enemies that been marked by you, and a mana bomb where the apprentice explodes nearby enemies dealing huge damage. People usually focus him for frostbite towers but he can be built as dps aswell. Huntress	 If you're new to the game, this is going to be your best dps class. almost all her towers are about damage. her ablities are concussive arrow, oil flask which slows enemies and can be used as a combo with her third ability Piercing shot which fires a fire phoenix damaging enemies and making them on fire if they're covered in oil.Her defenses which are, explosive trap, a geyser trap which launches enemies into the air drenching them in water, Blaze ballon and a poison dart tower. Before i talk about the last 3 classes	Now to get the 2 classes you will need to get defender medals which are earned from playing the game, doing daily quests or weekly quests. They are totally free and can be earned in 1-2 weeks. Or you can buy them for gems and support the developers. They cost 10k defenders medals (12k for 2 weeks after release). Now people are saying the game is going the ""microtransaction way"" is just dumb, because that's not where they are going. You can buy costumes and heroes (which you can still earn for free) that's it. They aren't selling some premium weapons which offer bonus stats and are going to help you in your journey. Now let's continue with the 2 classes Abyss lord	 This guy can be built in 3 ways. Towers, dps or walls ( focusing on your barricade). He has 3 abilities, 1 which buffs any tower of his. His abilities are as follows, abyss stones, knight of the abyss, direct command.His defenses are orc blockade, skeletal ramster, bone archers and the colossus. If you're going to focus on towers then your best bet would be bone archers as they deal the most damage. If you're going dps you're gonna use your 2 first abilities abyss stones and knight of the abyss, you can buy spheres which increase your ability damage at the price of costing more mana to use or the one that increases your attack damage at the cost of increasing the damage you receive. So it's kinda like a double-edged sword. Both are worth obtaining. And the final build of his is the wall build which focuses on his orc blockade. You need to farm gear for his orc blockade which increases it's health by a %. It has more health than the squire walls or apprentices, but it takes more damage from enemies.  EV2	  EV2 has 3 spells just like every other class right now, Anti-gravity bots, death from above and proton charge. EV2 defenses either damage enemies, block projectiles or buff defenses. They are: Proton beam, reflect beam, buff beam and weapon manufacturer. All of them are good and strong. People mostly build proton beam and buff beam because of the insane damage the proton beam can make and buff beam to buff all the other towers damage to huge amounts. Proton beam will be used as your go-to ability to kill bosses which melts them pretty quickly with that ability. Gun Witch	 Gun Witch is a pure dps class, she has no towers only skills which help her kill enemies and do alot of damage oh and she can jump 2 times in the air. She uses a special resource instead of mana which regenerates after a while. Her ablities are as follows: Blunder broom, Scatter sweep, Broom vault, Ice needle. Now the other set of skills is called witchcraft: Book Drop, Two at twice the price where she takes two weapons out and starts shooting like a machine gun and the last skill Broom nado. Overall she's the best dps class right now i'd write more about her but she just recently came out so expect an update some time later about her.Don't listen to the people saying that it's pay to win because it's not. You can get them all for free rather quickly. And to the people who are saying the 2 classes are overpowered and hidden behind a paywall well that's not true. Don't listen to what they say because you can get around 4k-5k defender medals in like a week. This is my first post so forgive me if there's any mistakes in here.			"

Its still in Alpha but that doesnt stop it from being such an amazing game already. Give it a chance if you played the first one, and if you havent played the first one it doesnt hurt to try something new. Its free, its still new but its quite addicting.

								Pre Alpha Review: To any fan of DD1 I HIghly HIGHLY recommend getting this game. Even as a pre alpha game the gameplay is pretty darn good especially if you include the fact that the UI is more user friendly and also the POV is much much better than DD1. Not only that but the graphics aree really good compared to DD1 whose models and textures were pretty dark and didn't seem that much satisfying to play with. Overall the game is somewhat buggy as sometimes you might experience some usual pre alpha stuff you find in most games. The multiplayer is ok but laggy at some times. I also look forward to having more skills and towers/traps per class and also an offline mode which TBH i only want when i'm bored because soloing the maps are soo much harder than DD1.Okay. I've been playing alot more of DD2 now, and I have to say that the negative reviews this game is getting, it dosen't deserve it. People are complaining how ""grindy"" this game is, but that's the actual nature of the game. You compare this to DD1 wherein basically people have found ways to hack both the casual and ""ranked"" mode to get items that give imense amounts of stats, so that's why trendy pushed how DD2 is now. Honestly i'm a fan of grinding in games, and maybe that's a personal preference, but if you're one of those people who complain, and on the side plays monster hunter or some other MMORPG, then if you can do that there, then why not here. Please do not give me the Bullsh** that ""Because it's not thesame game"" well give it a Fu***ng chance. It may be repetetive, but so is alot of current F2P models out there, like league. If you can stand playing on thesame map, thesame 3 lanes, and somewhat basically the heroes/champs in dota and lol, then why can't you stand playing different maps, using different strategies, using different stat build, etc. I'm just sad that people would give up on the game just because of small reasons. Love or hate it I guess.			"

								Game ReviewThe game, as directed from the title is a dungeon based defence game in which the player builds towers in order to stop enemy minions from destroying the main base. As well as the main objective on the harder maps, are side objectives which the player needs to defend otherwise it will allow for more enemies, often flying types to be able to access the map making it harder especially without certain classes.Logical thinking is required by the player to complete for ever changes and more difficult maps. As the game calls upon the player to think through the use of their 'Tower Budget' whilst building defences to stop the enemy minions form reaching the main base, the better the tower the higher the cost. Along with the budget, the player has the choice of class types, which impacts the levels massively, as depending on what characters are on the team during the missions effects the difficulty as some cannot attack air units or some are not able to take as many hits as others.Along with the thinking required is the effect of the choices made, as in the game they are able to have a very negative or positive outcome as for example having a Mage try to tank hits from enemies would be a poor choice compared to having a knight tank the hits. But there is a lot more than just deciding what person defends where, each player chooses their class each one having different abilities or attributes that can help the team and as stated above the choice of towers will be one to rule all or end all within an instant.Considering these whilst looking at the game play allows you to see that things are coming together well, the game entices the player into what is called a 'one more round' mood, in which if a player is enjoying the game by winning or by having or rethink the same map several times to pass. As well as being able to invite friends to have a more cooperative team and a more thrilling experience as everyone will be able to have a laugh no matter what the outcome. Overall my experience with Dungeon Defenders 2 was a good experience and produced a lot of good points, however with every game there are a few things that can be tweaked. Such as the enchantment system as I never truly understood it whilst using it and the glitch at the main hub (tavern) where players fall through the floor.Overall i give DD2 a 9/10 rating.			"

								For all you who are fans of the origional dungeon defenders or dungeon defenders eternity, this game with be a rollercoaster of nostalgia and wft? For those of you who havent played the previous said games, this will be a fun, quirky, 3rd person shooter, tower defence that can entertain you for hours. If you do not know, DD2 is a tower defence based on the fact that you must defend your base by using towers from 1 of 4 classes. Each class can place down a vastly differnt set of towers from each other, and so it is highly suggested that you play with other people of different classes (so sorry all of you fellow defenders who would play as the squire and solo every map). Other than placing towers, you are supposed to use your third person shooter skills, that you obviously aquired from Star Wars Battle Front 2, to shoot the enemies and help defend your base. Overall, the main point i want to portray is that DD2 is BALANCED. The towers of every class are really good and helpful (yes, the huntress's traps are REALLY good!), and each class has different attacks and abillities to make every class able to dish out decent damage without the use of towers.

Save Etheria once again!They didn't break the mold with Dungeon Defenders 2. They just took player feedback for Dungeon Defenders into consideration, then upgraded, improved, streamlined entire content but maybe not everything came out just as it should be. The gameplay is fantastic; with unique yet familiar enemies and it’s well optimized engine does well for the title. The story, however, isn’t as exciting. The story line is dull, and lacks the content that everybody loved so much about the first Dungeon Defenders. Overall, I am satisfied with DD2. The gameplay is thrilling and engaging, which is all I really ask for in a game. Thankfully, there are no pay walls, so you can play through the story line without having to spend a single penny on it.			"

								First of all, I wasn't a great fan of the first game, it was kind of bad and it was too ""new generation"" for me. (DLC here, DLC that, this - that).But this one is just utterly crap, seriously, I hope that this developer doesn't actually think they're good because it ain't the case, like 98% of today developers, they don't know how to code, it's too complicated to learn something that you'll have to use to for your career, it's the career you choose but nope, everyone does it so it's all right... Right. But anyway, here ain't the problem, it is not the most unoptimized game ever.It's just that, it is crap, the gameplay is utterly crap, it almost feels like the first game but with few new things, you know, the kind of thing that was called ""expansion"" back in the days?Oh oh, expansions are fine, as long as they are not overpriced and that they actually add content.  Costumes? That should be free, optional, a gift for the players, you don't sell that kind of crap, anyone can use 3D programs and learn, make modding available to us and we'll do it... Oh wait no, of course not, DLCs and microtransactions, right, too incompetent and greedy to put that, right, my bad.Now, for the kiddies that are gonna come and say ""but they have to make money you dumb"".Right, expansions, new games (I said new games, not crap that looks and play like a expansion and a bad one while at it).Why do people even care about costumes and skins anyway? In a game such as Arma, having some camos for your guns and characters, all right but a skin for a game like this or any game that sells you skins? That is actually pretty dumb and if you think the opposite, you must be dumb as hell, is this where the new generation of gaming is going? If that's the case, I honestly don't want to be a part of it, I'll just stick with the older games that were actually good and that actually had real content.54.99 CAD for the Collector's Edition Upgrade which is let's be honest, pure crap.$100 of in-game currency ($130 of total in-game currency) 4 Exclusive Hero Costumes 4 Tower Skins designed by the Defense Council Exclusive “Dragonfall Defender” TitleThose guys must be fun... (sarcasm)That's what I call stealing, why having microtransactions in a game like this, a game that you you have to pay 27.99 CAD, yes of course, It's nothing that will makes you stronger, just some outfits and stuff but It's still dumb.Of course we are not forced to buy those but I can't support the fact that I'm stuck with a game where you can buy in-game currency with real money for some stupid costumes that looks like total crap made by some unoriginal teens and for those who looks good, I can't even get them without having to spend real money while I already have spent real money on this game (Dungeon Defenders bundle) which was a big mistake from my part.Also, the game cannot be played offline, It's all on their server which means once they decided to close the server after a while, we won't be able to play this game anymore just for fun which is pretty ridiculous, now, you'll probably say that It is so people won't be able to hack right? Well, people still can hack on a server sided game, It's not that hard when you know what you're doing plus It's just stupid, stop being lazy and make a good anti-cheats system or use VAC with some kind of overwatch, It is not perfect, far away to be, If it detects any kind of modifications or applications that modify stuff, It will gets you a VAC ban so of course It is not perfect but It gets the job done, making the game server sided won't do anything good, people won't want to buy it and you know what they'll do then, I don't need to explain do I?Anyway, not like I'll want to come back on this game since it is pure trash - Just being honest here, facts are facts, if you like this game, that means that you have not played any true games or you are easy to please with anything even if it is crap.It's funny but at the same time It is not, developers think that something is worth that much but for real It is not even worth 9.99$ For example ""$100 of in-game currency ($130 of total in-game currency)""No, just stop it, all of that is not even worth 5$ It's just skins and a few gems that you can use to buy skins with, It is NOT worth 100$ neither 50$, stop it with that crap, It's getting real annoying.They said the same with Evolve, that the game is worth 150$ The game is barely worth 29$ Stop it with that damn crap, it's breaking my balls, all that crap is seriously breaking my balls.Come on, a few worthless skins and in game currency is not worth♥♥♥♥♥♥ stop acting like you guys know everything, you don't know anything about video games neither marketing.Damn developers these days, they're such a nuisance to the video game industry.It takes 7 hours or more to hatch a pet, this is not a simulation or a facebook game, we PC gamers want the best, no phone or console crap.Do you want to know how much it takes time to make a costume? Not very long, two hours at best for a good HD costume.I had lost my characters once, but anyway, it's not like it matters, this game should just be thrown in the trash so the developer/publisher of this game.1.5/10 (I wonder if it even deserves 1.5/10, even not being a fan of Dungeon Defenders, this one is just utterly crap, stay away from it).

								They've been in alpha mode for 2 years or somewhere about there and they just patched a bug which allowed users to allocate trillions of points into virtually any armor.  With these kind of bugs, as you may imagine, devs will be stuck in beta for another 2 years at which point dd3 will be in alpha.  No other tower defence rpg competes with DD, but the Devs either need a bigger staff or they just need a better one.			"

								At the moment I wouldn't recommend this game.  It's pretty good to me but what renders it a little unplayable is how you actually play it.  To play a level, you much join a server, even if you want to do a singleplayer run.  The servers are very laggy at the moment, with 3+ second delays between when I press a key and actually seeing it in game.  I'm constantly ""teleporting"" due to this server lag and sometimes falling to my death; and the horrible sound I hear when jumping sometimes, just hurts.  I don't like hearing the same sound played multiple times when it should only be played once, but that again is due to server lag.  I would recommend the game if there was an option for local games or a singleplayer mode, just something so that people don't have to deal with BS server lag and bad connections to the current servers.Other than that, I like the game so far, but it's a little difficult for me to make much  progress at the moment.

								PRO:-RPG + tower defend. -Reople seems nice in general-Very nice graphic-Hotswap to help switching heroes is pretty niceCON:-The game is too easy.-Chat system needs a lot of work-No option blocking other player playerrs or blacklist people-Some people can be very rude. As I mentioned the game is very easy so you don't need great towers to finish a level, but some folks will trash talk your towers as yours not as good as theirs.-Even as a host you can't kick whoever you want.-Forced back to town even if only one of your teammates do not want to keep on playing.-The grinding is pretty lame. -RNG is pretty lame, I always got full bags of lengeary gears, but none got the stats I want. -Some of the outfits are too expensive (Gem store). -You can not trade gears with other players-Often with lag and you always have to wait for getting the team ready and even wait to leave the game when each match end. You can't kick people easy even when you are a host.-You can not sell other player's tower even they are on your way-You you dont need to pay for anything, but be ready to grind many hours to get what you want.

I don't have super computer, but quite a decent one: 8GB RAM, intel i5-5200U, radeon r9 m375.Before that, I actually enjoyed game for some time, but it got boring for me really quickly.

								I want to like this game I do, but for the reasons I liked DD1, I just can't like the game. I know this game is not DD1, but its just missing the aspect of the game that made me love DD1.Everything is now about item drops. I mean why even have levels anymore? In DD1, from the moment you entered the game with a new character, you assinged your first skill point, that character became yours.  In DD2, originally I had to get level 5, to assing spec points. Now they removed that feature, and replaced it with skill sphere. Oh joy another thing that become completely dependant on item drops. Waiting on item drops is what completely bogged down End Game DD1.  Now its all about finding the best items. I just can't get into this game at all.I do like some of the changes, especially to the Hero skills... but overall, its just lost the very thing that I loved about it. Leveling my own character, and creating my own build.			"

								Still a lot of work needs to be done, a lot of things to polish. But I was surprised when I found out that it's only pre-alpha. Gosh, great job. Wonder what awaits us next. On the whole, I'm glad to pay for early access, it's worth buying. Now I just hope that some of my friends will join me...Overall, the game has changed it's every aspect. It has become different, though remained the same. The atmosphere is magical and charming. And gameplay is quite smooth, actually, both in terms of fps rate and the game process itself. And, what really is importmant to me, the interface is quite intuitive, though still leaves much to be desired. For example - I've set a mouse button for some ability, and on the icon of this ability it says: MouseThumbButton1. That's very cute, but it makes me cry, as I don't want to see THIS running over other icons...But, I still strongly recommend this game. I just hope that offline component will be present in a while...			"

								Very fun game.  Few issues I hope are fixed:1. half of the games you join the host is afk, when you go to join a new one you'll re-join the same one half the time. gets annoying.2. after you win a match and everyone hit G, it goes to an overview screen that has an additional countdown that you can't skip - makes each game take longer for no reason.3. no votekick4. green mana seems a little too scarce each round - you're spending it all on repairs and not really able to expand on your towers much.5. gear seems uninteresting.  I'm still wearing lvl 5 gear on my lvl 16 mage due to not finding anything better.This is pre-alpha so i'm not complaining - so far i'm having a blast. Just wanted to note my main issues that I hope get addressed at some point.			"

Early Access Review
								Having over 400 + hours invested in DD1 i was excited to know that DD2 was on early release. rushed to buy for me and my brother who are avid fans, only for our dreams to be crushed by a gutted and completely different game. Towers - Seem to all be made out of the thinest wet toliet paper one can find, along with having the range of kid trying to toss a bowling ball. Secondly most of the ranged enemies int he game out range most of the tower making it near impossible to focus your attention elese where. The constant baby sitting of your towers is kind of counter-tower defense in my opinion. Mobs - Spear chuckers toss spears for 3 miles away out ranging everything and thier spears appear to be armor penetrating as well. Orge's one shot pretty much everything from towers to heroes.Hero's - Armed with weaksauce weapons, and slightly less damp toliet paper armor, they feel weak and borderline uselss against the bigger mobs you have to take on. No hero stats anymore like in DD1 where you could tune your gear to be DPS or Tower spec. Maps - Made by someone who odviously likes playing hack and slash, and has no knowledge of tower defense games and choke points. Almost all the maps have no good defenseable choke points that some spear chucker or dragon cant just range down from afar. Misc - This might just be me, or the game but it is extremely annoying that in order to choose a differnt difficulty range while playing with other people who are lvling up with you, that you have to leave and enter the starter tavern again, just to set the difficulty again. 4/10  - wait for free to play and pray they dont make it Pay to win. Bottom line is, if you loved DD1, dont bother with DD2 unless you like feeling like your at a contant disadvantage.			"

								Posted: 2014-12-19Probably one of the better defense games i played. Was well worth the price if you enjoy this genre of games. And for a ""pre alpha"" this is one polished game. glad to have picked it up during early access.Update: 2015-04-26Developers are constantly keeping up to date with new patches and content, as well as interacting via twitch on upcoming goodies :P This game really is alot of fun with a group of friends or even randoms. It offers that itch i've been looking for.Like i said before it is well worth the money. I realize that the goal of the developers is to make it a free to play which will allow them more options in the future, but currently its in ""pre-alpha"" and im not sure when it'll change to alpha or even beta. so if you think it looks like something you'd like. i'd say go for it. this was my first free to play purchase that i've made. And at first i was like great its going to be free to play, and yet i bought it. But i'd have to wait for this extremely fun defense game to come out.Pros:-Developer Interaction via Twitch-Increasing amount of content-Great art style-Fluid Gameplay-Fun Co-op Experience-Teamwork is essential :P-Current community is greatCons:-Minor bugs (but hey, its pre alpha :D)-Not as much fun solo-Some difficulties/maps almost impossible solo-Currently a small communityUpdate: 2015-07-28Ill be 100% honest. If you played DD1 this game may not be for you. i never played DD1. It seems as though everyone who has, has become disappointed with the turn out of this game so far. i haven't play much as of recently, but being new to the Dungeon Defenders franchise, i really like this game so far. Which probably means i'd love DD1.Its still a great game. Has bugs. Starting to see microtransaction creeping in which no ones a fan of. But so far it has a great community and i like how its turning out. Maybe wait till it goes Free To Play before you give it a shot? but i felt it was worth what i paid.			"

								This is an addicting game formula, match up with people, grind for perfect loot Diablo-style until you want to cry.As a tower defense game, it is lacking. It's more of a tower defense-lite. You can not select priority on your units, so your towers will likely focus on goblin fodder on the ground while a flying bomb passes overhead and goes straight for your objective.The AI is a joke, many of your losses will be due to just straight up horrible AI.This game is in one word; broken. I crash at least a dozen times a day, and that is not exclusive to my experience, this happens to everybody. Trendy refuses to acknowledge it. Instead they sweep it under the rug while they continue to release more content.Trendy Entertainment as a studio is a total failure. This game is being begrudgingly birthed out of the UDK engine while Trendy Entertainment sits on live stream and straight up admits they have no idea what they're doing.Recently Trendy Entertainment sued Ark development team for a whopping 40 million dollars, while I believe they were 100% justified legally, I fail to see how this money is being used to improve their game. Nothing has changed, this game is still cobbled together by misshapen, broken lego bricks. You'd think when a company makes more money in a suit then they have ever made in their entire existence that you'd see some sort of change.All in all, I recommend this game, and I don't know why. I have 500+ hours and I will continue to play it. I really wish I could explain why I enjoy it, seeing as I spend most of the time playing being frustrated by how broken everything is, but I can't.

								This game is amazing, do yourself a favor and pick it up!!I played DD1 until my fingers bled on tablet, console, and PC, and now that DD2 is out i couldn't be happier. Everything has been much improved and I can't wait to see what the future updates will bring. The devs are always on point, and seem to really enjoy interacting with the gamers and making improvements based on our feedback. After you buy this game and find out how incredible it is, I urge you to join the DD forums and become a part of their always expanding community. Everyone has always been very friendly, and it's a blast to compare strategies and finally figure out that one tweak to your layouts which makes your defences impenetrable. I love this game, and I know you will too! I hope to see you all online :)			"

								This is my first real try an actually review please tell me how I can do better and what you think thanks.I have really enjoyed this game there are four characters to choose from right now the original four from the first huntress, apprentice, squire and monk there are two blank portraits for heroes so hopefully they come out soon and free (it's early access so it better come out free) I would say that if you liked the first one this one is worth getting. So far I've encountered one bug over and over where certain mobs will get stuck on a wall or in a object along the way toward their objective. they just added pets and the first boss for this game hopefully it continues to get awesome updates. Today (the day after I wrote  this -,-) they added pets, a custom shop which you can use ""gems"", which you have to buy with real money, to buy costumes,they also added the first boss in the alpha so far and a sphere system which give your heroes bonuses.  Differences from Dungeon Defenders   Graphics could be good depending how you feel about it  Monsters drop less Mana to build towers with (makes the game a lot harder)  Tavern has more than just one shop keeper  You can only have three characters to switch between mid game  Leveling stats, you get to choose passive type things instead of stats for your hero/towers  The main objectives you have to protect are more than just crystals plus you have sub objectives to protect which keep extra spawns from opening   Hero combat is a lot funner than it use to be  You can move around and fight while building, repairing and upgrading   Pets are dropped as eggs and you have to wait eight hours for them to hatch (one at a time)  can level your pets with pet food and having them earn xp  In game currency bought with real money called ""gems"" can be used to buy costumes right now  Monsters will get stuck behind each other messing up lanes (hopefully fixed soon)  You have to use your hero in combat some monsters can out range your towers so if you don't do anything they will get destroyed    Overall it has an enjoyable experience       You can watch my video on it here:

								Everything wrong with the game below.Had to quit my match on the throne room because malaysia was having typhoon problems and it disrupted the server causing so much lag stepping and teleportation, It was just unplayable. For some reaon there is no AUS server.Also this needs to be adressed to the developers ASAP. I spend more time cleaning out my bags then playing the game due to the insane drop rate on loot. its absolutly ridicolous that my bags are 70% full after 1 round of a 7 round map. Each round increasing the enemies meaning even more loot will just drop. The loot rarly drops anything useful meaning you will spend most of the time wasted even checking what you get because you know it's not going to be very good. the game dosn't even have a auto sell lower stat items so you have to spend even longer manually clicking on EVERY SINGLE item you get. I Have many times often sold my only good loot i got becuase i just click on everything fast to auto sell because the good to bad ratio on loot is like 1/100.   Legendary weapons don't feel legendary when you come across a new one every 5 minutes and every fkn 10 seconds you get an annoying prompt on your screen saying mythic loot has been dropped. Mythic loot is just slightly better loot that just adds up to flooding your bags even faster then before. The loot system needs a rework ASAP.another reason why loot should be reworked is it scales for the enemy level and not your player level. The developers gets this impression that you will be leveling at the same pace as the enemies and that you will fail levels untill you get stronger. this is not the case. the game is EXTREMLY EASY and your characters don't level up as fast as you progress through the game. My friend and i outscaled the game at around lv 10. I am forced to use loot 10 lvs under my character lv becuase the content we are doing only drops loot that is way to high to wear. We cant even keep the good pulls because it just clogs up your bags which will be full in another 5 mins so you are forced to sell. the game desperatly needs a bank to store this high lv gear. It got to a point where we were easily doing IPWR 150 over what the game recommended for us. It also feels like the only reason you even need a DPS character is becuase you are doing content 150 IPWR higher. If you matched the IPWR lv you can easily throw down a couple of towers and just AFK. the in map traps are good idea but are so useless i forget to actually use them. stratergy is limited to: Place a wall here with a tower behind it and place a anti air tower at the crystal. I have come up with a few more stratergys such as placing walls infront of other walls so you towers dont take collateral damage from the ISIS goblins. But even even after inventing these I cant possibly think of much more to do. This is pretty much the only stratergies you can do because the game has many unviable hero moves and towers limiting you to like 1 or 2 options out of 4 for both buidlings and ablitly moves. All in All fun game, but i hope some of these features will be fixed before full game release.			"

								Looking for out-of-the box game that has features of a Hack n'Slash, MMORPG and Tower Defense? This is the game for you! It is casual (but rewards those who put their time into playing it), it has excellent equipment system with amazing variety, decent hero progression and a lot of tactical planning. You can play it solo (it allows you to create your own ""party"" of heroes), with friends or with some random people. Despite it being an alpha version, the game is perfectly playable and offers hours and hours (and hours) of content. Constant updates keep the game balanced and add lots of content. It's very intuitive (apart from map selection but well, it's an alpha after all), the engine is solid and the game as-such is quite nicely balanced. It's definitely worth supporting. The only comparably good Tower Defense game I have ever played is its predecessor, Dungeon Defenders 1.			"

								This game is garbage compared to the original Dungeon Defenders. I have 175 hrs into this game already, uninstalled it and will not look back, and I still have like $30 worth of gems or whatever but I don't even care anymore. Game was just NOT FUN. I gave it more time, waiting update after update, game play didn't improve at all. Not sure what they can do at this point to fix this game. If they made something similar to DD1, I might come back, but holy crap I am disappointed with this.EDIT 3/1/2017I decided to install the game shortly before this new update because it sounded VERY interesting. I was actually enjoying the game again to my surprise, and was eagerly waiting for the update. Turns out, I had my hopes up too high and the update pretty much ruined the game for me again. No tower range, super grindy now in order to get ascension levels, crappy UI, bugs all over the place. I don't get it, why take away tower range? It doesn't feel like tower defense anymore, it's just running around with your hero and trying to kill stuff before your walls get taken down. Yep I am aware of the range shard you can get. Why make it a shard if everyone is going to need to slot it in their towers?  That's like something mandatory that they felt like removing for no reason. Towers became useless, traps useless, they just get runned over by the siege roller, attack aura useless, same deal with traps. Hey at least the walls are good. So stupid, uninstalled again. Maybe gonna wait another year and try again to see if they fix the game for real.			"

								Dungeon Defenders II... Thou i could not personally say much as i basically only have a level 4, i will say what i do know.This game is awesome in many aspects, it rebuilds the foundations for which original Hero's were made. This is certainly something i almost did not expect with the Abyss Lord, also refered to as ""The Summoner *Dungeon Defenders*.However, the only thing that i do feel about this game that is diffrent and may make this feel lacking is the scale of where and what you can build, and defense area. I could be just saying that, because i'v only seen the small maps. But when i really think and feel about it, i can't defend as natrually as i'd like to.For anyone just starting out, this game and many others will basically feel like a game not worth your time, but i strongly suggest you rethink what you have said, if you put in as many hours as i did on the Original game, you might find that the higher your level, the more fun you start having, and the more balanced things start to feel.In the Original game, i had the Jester, Hunter, Summoner, Barbarian, Countess, Squire, Huntress, Ev Series 1, Monk and most of them i got to either level 100 or close. This is when you start setting a goal for the ULTIMATE gear which takes waves and WAVES of time to loot. The fun part is, that while your farming for this loot, you acctually get a chance to think about defense Stratagys, and maybe even what you should primarily upgrade your gear to. Personally, i started throwing all my points into Countess and Hunter for Defenses, The Monk was Area of effect and tanky ammounts of life or defenses collapsed. Also Ev for her buff beam... Yeah, the good times.I never offically started having the fun of my Life till i hit the level 80 mark, but when i did, i started thinking about playing the game all over again, maybe even with my friends :)I'd Recommend this game, and can't wait till i get ALOT of spare time to play it, also can't wait to play it with my friends.PS: I felt i had to say something, because thou i am not enjoying the game at this current point in time, i do enjoy building a character and enjoy playing more with friends. Thank's for your great and Admirible understanding!			"

Early Access Review
								I got hooked into DD1 after playing the first mission. After I finished the game and modded the crap out of it, I played dungeon defenders eternity and fell in love with it all over again.This sorry excuse for a dungeon defenders game is just that. A sorry excuse. The graphics may be 'nicer' (I personally prefer the look the old games had), and it may be less prone to awkward crashes, but damn. At the very least, DDE had some half/decent gameplay to go along with it. Back to my point about being hooked at the first mission. I played through the tutorial level as the sorceror (which was my go to character considering how the summoner was yet to be implemented) and after putting up with the crappy enemy spawn times, the crappier enemy walking pace and the even crappier enemy damage (despite not having any armour at all), I uninstalled it and am glad it's no longer taking up space on my SSD. I did head back to the hub world, but got lost as to what I was doing. The UI was wonky and difficult to navigate, the new systems failed to improve the solid old ones and there was basically no point to having such a massive scale revamp.It makes me even angrier that my favourite hero from DD1/DDE, The Summoner, had the one gimik that made his character interesting and different from the rest removed. In DD1/DDE, The Summoner had the ability to summon crystal versions of the enemies in place of towers. These crystal enemies has the ability to move and even chase enemies. Despite the AI for your minions being wonky and just plain broken at times, the gimik changed the flow of gameplay and allowed for such a dynamic sense of strategy. Suddenly, if my tower went down and I had no mana to replace it, I could choose to relocate some of my other minions to it's job. This was such a cool and different mechanic, and I loved it the instant I started using it.NOW, The Summoner (as of the writing of this review) has had his best quality removed. All his towers function like towers and blockades, which is a huge let down and a shame. On top of that, he lost his other two great abilities which allowed easy surveying of the battlefield, namely his ""Phase Shift Overlord"" ability, which turned the classic 3rd/1st person perspective into a top-down look of the entire battlefield. He could even summon and move minions from this perspective, once again adding to the extra gameplay elements. But NOPE, Trendy thought it would be a good idea to remove the interesting mechanics they had set up in the previous games.Trendy, get your act together. I'm happy that you're not actually charging anyone to trial what is essentially a shiny pile of garbage compared to your previous works, but seriously. What happen to the old magic, that made DD1/DDE so good?			"

								I think there are both pros and cons about Dungeon Defenders, but I still really recommend it because it is really fun generally and easy to level up. The thing I dont like about DD2 is that when you are level 50 it is not at all that fun and interesting anymore, it is really hard to progress, (from my experience) and you could keep leveling up different characters but it is just not worth it because you have already been through all these maps, it would be cool if they added more levels and progress maps. But it's a really fun game and you all should give it a try! :)			"

								So it seems a lot of the recent negative reviews are because these guys are sueing someone from the Ark development team and people are butthurt over it because ARK might shut down. As someone who played and enjoyed a lot of ARK, I can say if someone breaks the law then someone breaks the law. Its the developers fault for not checking contracts. That being said, the game is fine. If you liked DD1 you will like DD2, plain and simple. Its a third person tower defense with farming and character deveopment. Just like the first one. They are adding a bunch of content and seem to do regular fixes for the game.It's free to play so try the game for yourself and try not to listen to people who are only ruining the games credit because of something they cannot comprehend. Contracts are contracts. The law is the law.P.S. I have WAY more hours in ARK than DD2 so I'm not just some fanboy douching out over my favouritest game in the whole wide world, I'm giving an objective opinion based on the facts.Have a nice day!

								For a game in early access, I'm really surprised. The team at Trendy Ent has done a wonderful job at creating a great game, that plays well! It has all the fun of the original Dungeon Defenders, minus a few features like pets and so forth (but it's still in early access and they're on the way!). The core gameplay is great and I can't wait to see the game evolve as I keep playing!			"

								The game is now far too difficult to play through. NO STRATEGY INVOLVED AT ALL, just ""oh we'll just make a game with loads of monsters."" Oh and 2-3 bosses in the 3rd level is insanely hard and there is no normal. Like I said, no strategy involved with the game, the developers at first said they wanted people to buy the game, and now it's ftp. I don't have many friends to play with and would prefer soloing the game instead of playing with randoms, which is fine and you can do, just not anymore.I cannot recommend this game to people who want to solo through a game.

But, knew that it was gonna have bugs in it of it being the pre-alpha. But. when I started playing, I was on like the 3rd round and was playing with other people and it started to lag really bad and the monsters would lag out of the map and I could'nt shoot. I know my internet connection is good, so it isnt that. I would extremely enjoy and love this game if you could fix that because other then that, this game is perfect. I do recommend this though, after fixing that.			"

								I played both this game and the first one for a fairly short time each.  The gameplay got old for me fairly quickly, but it seemed to be a game that could be a decent time killer and could maybe grow in scope.However, with the recent actions of the developers of this game with regards to what it regards as it's competition, I can honestly say that I will in no way support anything that they put out, and I encourage others to do the same.  If they are worried that another game is providing too much competition, they should focus on improving their own game instead of tearing down another.  Bad show, Trendy.			"

								First off this game is in alpha. This means that the game still has issues and isn't feature complete. TL;DR The game has a few issues but is still quite good.I have enjoyed this game so far it has many features I enjoy more than Dungeon Defenders 1. The gathering mana system has greatly improved. Instead of going around to all the chests on the map you just have to interact with one. The other thing about the mana system that is a huge improvement is that you don't lose mana when you pick up a large chunk for example, if you only have space for 5 mana left and you picked up 10 in DD1 you would lose 5 mana in DD2 you gain 5 mana and 5 mana drops on your player. The only issue I have is with dropping mana, you can only drop 10 at a time and there is no drop all mana button.The sub-core system is fantastic in my opinion. You can easily just build up around your main cores and deal with extra mobs released from destroyed sub-cores or you can spread your defenses out more, take that risk and the payout is a fair bit more exp.The skill / tower build system now gives you four options instead of five. This is both a pro and a con to me. The fewer skills and fewer towers you have, the more balanced the game will be. This is because it will be that much simpler to balance, but on the other hand that extra skill or extra tower would be nice. The placement system for some of the monk's auras are slightly aggravating. If you build the monk's auras first you can then place traps or towers quite close to then, however if you build traps or towers first then you can't place the auora in the same spot as if you did the order the other way around. On a side note all the towers look quite nice.Mob pathing seems to be fairly good. I have had a few issues where mobs get stuck behind the spawner wall and have had to use skills to kill them. I get the occasional mob stuck on a wall but as the game development progresses I am finding this to be less and less of an issue. Also flying kobolds are♥♥♥♥♥holes.The maps are pretty exciting. They look quite nice and every map has it's environmental traps. The environmental traps can also be activated from a player shooting at it which is nice for when you can't get over there in time but there have been a few times when a stray shot has activated it. The maps are also where the game shows being in alpha a little bit. There are still a few ways to get outside of some of the maps, but as of the latest patch (November 21 2014) many of those have been fixed.Solo play versus group play is a huge difference. The ideal way to play this game is with a party of four. This is due to the item drop system giving higher chances to parties with more people in it. The game still lacks a trade system that makes me sad, but it looks like it's coming. There are references to it in the config files for the game.I know there is content missing and I am looking forward to seeing how the game development progresses.			"

								First off, I love this game, and it's constantly being updated to become just as addicting as its predecessor.  Genre:  Tower defence with loot finder elements.  Pros:  (- Level up system:                       * Ability points.                       *  Different towers.                       *  Stat increases.                       *  Gear level Requirments.)- The combined genre of TD (Tower defence) and Loot Finder make this game extremely unique.- Up to 4 player coop which might be increased to 6 or 8 player on select maps in the future.  - Great graphics.- Four different hero classes.  Some might complain about this in comparison to DD1, but again, there will be more hero classes in the future.Neutral:- Non boostable leveling.  This is something that I can't quite tell if I like or not.  Allow me to exaplain...- In the first game, if you wanted to level up a character very quickly it could be done easily by setting up a defence with multiple high level heros and then switching to your level one to instantly hit around level 70 after maybe 4 waves, depending on your setup.  In DD2 this is not possible, your character level is capped with a maximum level difference between both characters of 5.  Cons:  Last time I played the game was still in Pre-Alpha, might be in Alpha now, and these cons will repesent the game in Pre-Alpha.- No kicking system.  Nothing grinds my gears more than when someone ques up for coop and afks.  - No Pets.  I miss my treadmill buddies.  Maybe we'll get some elliptical pals this time around.- No survival mode as of yet, I'm sure they'll get around to it soon though.- No outfits yet, not much of a con.It's very difficult to think of cons for this game.  Eventual pro:The game will eventually become free to play with microtransactions for cosmetic overrides.  If you buy it now you'll recieve in game credit for what you paid! I highly recommend this game.  I love it.  Recommend buying with friends!			"

								First of all, I understand this is pre-alpha and a lot of the things I dislike about it might be fixed. However I don't think that will change how I feel about the game, and here's why.I played DD1, and there are a lot of similarities. The problem is there's nothing new and exciting enough to draw me to playing DD2 instead of DD1. The four main classes are all basically the same with a few differences, but nothing has changed in their mechanics or the way you play them.Combos between towers show a lot of promise, but that alone isn't enough. All this work for building a new game seems like a waste of time to me if it's basically the same game.			"

								Hollllyyyyy♥♥♥♥♥♥this is soooo ggggooooodddd At this moment (5/4/2015) it's still in its early access stages, but I've been having a ton of fun with it. It doesn't have the dlc support the first game has (yet) but the levels are vivid and well designed even when compared the prior installments Generally good level design. As well, the classes seem far more balanced and rounded than they were in the first game, while still each providing a unique set of tools to bring to the table that makes for a different play experience in every class.

								This game is fairly fun, but the length of time the game was in Pre-Alpha with very minimal progress over almost 2 years. The game is finally ""Alpha"" I guess but is still missing extremely basic content such as controller support. Maybe the beta in 2 years will be somewhat better.			"

								Played the game a bit already, 40hrs+, I like it. I personally played DD1 quite a lot.About DD2:Pros:F2P (Free To Play), with NO P2W (Pay to Win), Only Pay to boost, making life a lot easier, such as extra bags, more character slots and cosmetics, Defenders pack is worth it, and if you bought this a lot earlier you probably got some extra bags from that.  (I dunno if they will change this view)Less towers, Less characters than DD1, Making life simplier than DD1 end game, which was basically 1 misplace and you got ruined...If you played DD1, and you liked it, then I highly recomend it.Very short Bugged Enemy Timer compared to DD1 which had like 10 minutes.... Yes that's a PRO!ConsEXTREMELY limited build options at start of end game (NM1-NM2), requires specific gear, they are currently balancing drop rates, but I think the build options should be required at the end stage of Game rather than start of End GameGrinding, If you don't like it. I recomend you go away....Very small inventory space, in DD1 you had an entire Tavern to fill, Gems must be used to get more inventory sadly, I think its a con. but hey, at least you get to a F2P game.Laggy as hell sometimes {Doesn't matter computer}, please note that they state the game is in alpha, although the game content is like DD1 when they first released it, it has enough content to make you spend several hundreds of hours for grinding, but for just campaign? then no don't buy it.Would I recomend?Do you like Tower Defense in 3rd person?Do you like to DPS?Do you like to Grind?Do you like to Grind even more?Are you a grind-a-holic?Did you like Dungeon Defenders 1 (Or Eternity)Do you like Sanctum but wanted more of a fantasy setting?are you a Unreal Engine lover? (I think DD2 is unreal engine, at least DD1 was)If you answered yes to any of the questions... then YES II RECOMEND IT!----------------------------------------------------------------------EDIT - 2016 - July 26thIn terms of New Characters, Game is still PAY TO BOOST AND NOT PAY TO WIN! the only thing I noticed that is like pay to win is bag space which costs money and some skins..... but this game is still PAY TO BOOST! Game rather requires you to farm every day for medals to unlock a hero which you gain a hero slot so in the end you can get lots of characters without needing of buying gems so that's a plus (don't know if it was possible pre-medals)Game is rather GRINDY! and options are still RESTRICTED to specific builds and sadly there are no guides for the moment that is up to date with builds, was thinking of making this in a few weeks.  sadly they get out of date rather quickly due to updatesalso people complaining about updates, you really really havn't played for more than a week.... Seriously people think major patches should drop once a day..... or small fixes... .No that's not how it works unless you got a gigantic dev team. even then it takes a few days for it to be fixed (Look at Early days of WOW)Thursdays/Fridays are a lottery of being 90% NERF DAY and 10% OP DAY..... The only thing I dislike about the game is no hero sortment.... but maybe that will come on later! since its an alpha (its been a alpha for a long time)			"

Early Access Review
Please note: This is a first impressions review of the current pre-alpha build as of the 8th of December 2014. This is  NOT  an in-depth review and I'd just like to address my experience compared to other reviewers. Okay so, the first thing I want to address is the difficulty of the game. I've noticed a few reviewers talking about the difficulty of the game when it comes to playing solo. I myself enjoyed Dungeon Defenders 1 alone and rarely went online (partly due to the amount of hackers, but that's besides the point), so obviously I would be spending a vast majority of my time on this game offline or with a select group of friends, meaning if the game is much too hard for one person, I wouldn't be playing this game much at all, nor would I like it to be quite frank. However, as you can see, I've given this early access game a thumbs up. Why? Because it's not as hard in single player as others may believe. The entire game actually feels much easier overall compared to the original dungeon defenders.The mechanic that stands out as to why it's easier, is that  you no longer have to stand next to your towers and wait to repair or upgrade them.  While it's true you still need to be close to the towers to begin the process of repairing or upgrading them, you still move freely, and can carry on fighting enemies or go elsewhere on the map while it's repairing. A little bar on the side of your crosshair shows you the progress of the repair/upgrade so you're still conscious of your tower in the meantime. You can only upgrade or repair one tower at a time, like in the original dungeon defenders, but the fact you can no guard the tower yourself while it's repairing for example, ends up helping you in the longrun. Personally, this is a very welcome change to the core game as it feels like I'm now doing more than just running around the map repairing my towers; It's more of an incentive to fight yourself. Just to let any readers know, I've tried out all four of the heroes ALONE and had little trouble beating the first few maps with each of them WITHOUT grinding for experience to level up nor switching between heroes mid-game. I'll admit, the huntress is a little hard to play solo as she uses traps, but as they're so small and use little mana, you can place many of them around before filling out the max tower limit. The Monk is clearly made to play as part of a team seeing as it has health and tower boosts, but he can still very well stand his own ground alongside his defenses. Oddly enough, the Squire and the Apprentice felt very similar, as their first two towers are ranged projectile defenses and barricades. When playing as either of them, by the time I got to the final wave, I could (and did, to prove it to myself) sit back and watch as my towers did all the work. In my opinion, that doesn't make playing as them ""easy"", it just means I created a defense that was effective on the map.  Moving on, let me just say this game looks so much better than Dungeon Defenders 1. If you've seen the trailers or screenshots, as many of you have, you probably already know that. Besides the overall look and the new animations, it's just the little things I love most in games like this. On the first map, there's a tree with a squirrel on it, and sometimes it'll run down and jump on the fence posts and take a look around before running back up the tree. Things like that make the levels feel more unique and less hollow. Levelling up towers make them look drastically different, such as Squire's level 2 cannon getting taller and aining studs, or Apprentice's level 2 fireball shooter gaining eyes. This means you can know what level your tower is from a distance, just by looking at it, which is great for the fast-play action of this game.Bottom line, this game takes everything from Dungeon Defenders 1 and improves on it. Gameplay feels smoother/more inviting, the whole game looks better, the enemies are fiercer and even the Tavern is vastly improved (don't get me started on the item upgrader, I love what they've done with it). However... content-wise, there's not a lot of replayability right now besides finding weapons, changing the difficulty of the available maps and switching up characters, and that is literally the only reason why any self-respecting tower-defense fan should not have this game already, in it's current state. Final VerdictIf you're new to the Dungeon defenders franchise, then you should definitely go play the original game and wait for this game to become free-to-play. If you've played the original game, are a fan of the series, and want to help support the developers and watch this sequel go through it's development process, then you should get this game for sure, whether you want to play alone or with others. If I didn't know any better, I would never have believed this game would be free-to-play, as the quality here is much too good compared to most current games in the field.			"

Early Access Review
								EDIT: Summoner is most busted character. His ""towers"" are really strong, as well as having one with pretty massive range, that shoots forwards and back, just set up a bunch of those around the objective and win alot. They also lost what made the summoner from DD1 special, which was that he turned the game into an rts style game. In DD2 the summoner might as well just be any other character.So far its ok, its not dungeon defenders 1 or anything, but its alright. Seeing as how its going to be free to play, I don't recommend paying for it unless you actually plan on influencing the game. I would much rather a game be a one time purchase and have a good game, rather then having in game shortcuts for real world money. They say they wont have anything in the shop that will effect the game, but I don't see that lasting long.Talking about the game now, the graphics got a major boost. Very pretty, and you don't need a massive build for your pc to play on max. The simplified skills and tower building is nice, as is the fact that upgrades are all one unified price.As far as the forseeable issues... Crafting has taken a massive hit in the quality department, you used to just put mana into an item and choose a stat to boost, and mana as a currency has been removed, its now just gold coins, which is kinda dumb, and instead of the innkeeper selling you a selection of 3 items, the innkeeper is who you report bugs to, and you buy armor from some guy, and your trinkets from some other guy... now to upgrade items you just combine things till you can make a stat SLIGHTLY better... its not really worth upgradeing gear till end game.Tl;Dr Its not as good as DD1, but will be worth playing when its free.

								For absolutely loving the first game, this game is a major let down. There is a huge FPS drop from the menu into the local tavern which drastically changed the game. Tons of people complained about too many dlcs in DD1 but I honestly loved them and thought it enhanced the game further. This game is way too boring and could honestly use some dlcs. I really want to like or even love this game but how it runs and how boring it is makes it impossible to do so.			"

								First off, I am recommending the game as long as you don't suffer the same fate as me.When this games decides to work it is a fun game to play and hits the mark just as well as DD1 does with a few tweaks and changes here and there.My only setback is that having owned the game since December 14 2014, I have only maneged to put 16 hours of the play into the game, as they have a serious bug with there launcher window not wanting to correctly load the play button even with the few topics i have found with fixes most of them don't seem to work. (at time of writing I've been without a play button for 6 days).But as I have said when the game works it is a fun game and the launcher problem doesn't seem to affect everyone or seem as bad as mine is.

								I have not played much i have only played the first 2 maps. I dont think the ememies are hard enough and the levels are not creative. the maps form the first dungeon defenders were awesome. even the first map i didnt get bored with. I want to see more creativity and harder levels and enemies. In the first dd you gave us an oger to fight, i want to see more of that. I know you can create a great game because you have in the past. Also let me level up my character and equipment. I also dont like the coins, I do however like the mana system in the first game. it was simple and i need mana to build towers but also build my character. if you didnt want to spend mana in game you could save it for your character. I also do not like the chest in this game bring back the looting system from the first one or change the one you have now. the first game looting system worked so much better. Like i said before i need to keep playing but i dont not know how i like it so far. A lot more disappointments then likes. I would not recommend this game yet.			"

								The game, sadly, is far from enjoyably playable.  In its Alpha, there is much promise, but so many moments where you just shake your head and wonder ""why would the developers do that?"".  For example, why is there no live list of maps being played so you can join one?  As the game is now, you randomly join a map or start an empty one, and that is too frustrating to be a thing.			"

								council member here!DUNGEON DEFENDERS 2 REVEWWhen I bought the pre alpha trial, I was expecting some buggy, unfinished game, with a lack of textures, detailing and an overflow of bugs. What I found was a well-polished, very fun and exciting game to play, looking almost complete.Being a fan of the original DD, I was surprised by the very different style of graphics they used. The fantastic cartoon-like style was replaced by a more serious and realistic one. While it was criticized by lots of old players, I found this new look..... revigorating. Finally a company decides to end the old ""don't change it if it's selling"" and tries to change the way the game works.I found the maps VERY creative and fun to play, with some innovative and refreshing scenes, even for an experienced DD1 player to play. The graphics look very interesting and the new mechanics (such as the new carts and elements of the environment that help you clear the waves) are lots of fun to deal with.In my opinion the only things that aren't so good are the towers: trying to give them a new, realistic look ended up making some of them kind of lame (like the main knight tower), although the way they change looks when you upgrade them looks awesome.Overall, the game looks very very promising and if you are a fan of the DD1 and DD eternity you should definitely check this game- I give it 8,5/10 "

And now its a dungeon defenders game with mobile game elements (you have to wait for your pets to hatch and you have to sacrifice items to make items stronger) where as in dungeon defenders 1 you didn't have to wait for your pet to hatch and you could upgrade your weapons with mana (the in-game currency) I am glad that they are taking the communitys feedback about what to put in their game though, if you look on the dungeon defenders 2 website you will see that they are putting up polls on what people want in the game. I am sure this game will come out great, but in its current state it feels lack luster (as expected from an early access game)So far, DD2 looks pretty nice. Great colors, great animations and fun towers and weapons to mess around with.			"

A few short months later, I was left with a free game that I wouldn't enjoy touching on, with only 4 hours I don't have a majority when it comes to hours yet I feel the game needs more to fit what I expect. With it being free I can see people playing the game as it fits a titles like this, yet it doesn't compare to the greatness I experienced from it's predecesor. - Pengz ;[			"

								Fantastic game, certainly at this barely left alpha stage.The game is complete, you can enjoy everything with the occasional bug or glitch.Can the game be better? Offcourse it could be so much better, but let's remember they are still working on it.Can you compare the game to DD1? Partly, and that is what frustrates the DD1 players. You have to look at this as another game enterily.Can you play the game without spending real cash? yes you can enjoy everything playwise, you can buy costumes which cost tons of money. And with the carnival update you can ""buy"" older monthly pets, like bearkira. Why the quotes, well you buy tickets for the carnival game, and you have fixed rewards which include bearkira.Did I buy gems, yes, as I enjoyed the game very much and I want to support the creators.Do I hope the game evolves and get's better? Yes very much, and I'll be playing/following this game closely.Before this game I was an avid mmorpg lover, but all the mmorpg are just bland and boring.This is a mix between tower defense and rpg and I love that part as it keeps making to come back.I have high expectations for the game.So if you like tower defense games with a few rpg elements, this might be it.Enjoy it, as it is free "

								At first the game was literally a worst version of DD with less towers, less heroes, more basic maps and quite slow progression, however update after update I've come on to play it and always thought ""oh they finally added this and that"" an dsince the last update where you can easily level your heroes and swap in the middle of a fight to use nice combos like Squire slam then the mana explosion with your Mage to feel like your entire deck is yuor main hero instead of one. They've listened to us when we asked to bring back stat upgrades, the pet system is superior to DD, they're still adding new maps, they've improved weapon depth, it finally feels like all the qualities of DD are being shown and the developers are still working on it. To call the game as good as DD now would be a stretch but to say it shows promise is for sure.			"

								Big improvements on the first Dungeon Defenders, Fun game to play alone or with friends. And it can be as challanging as you want. It is a free game which makes friends try out the game more appealing.Also, Its not paytowin or anything like that, you can grind out free skins  by doing daily and montlhy quests.Lacks a bit of endgame once you hit level cap, gets grindy too. but thats doesnt mean its a bad thing.

								The game, sadly, is far from enjoyably playable.  In its Alpha, there is much promise, but so many moments where you just shake your head and wonder ""why would the developers do that?"".  For example, why is there no live list of maps being played so you can join one?  As the game is now, you randomly join a map or start an empty one, and that is too frustrating to be a thing.			"

								So I got this game once it became free, and it's brilliant. Like it's predecessor, DD2 does an excellent job of making a tower defense (one of the most boring game-types in my opinion) into a much more involved and fun experience. Everything from the original and more.However, it still has some problems that I assume the devs already know about and may or may not do anything about while still in EA. Some problems are...-Always Online. (From what I've seen) This is an idea that only works with MMORPGs and the AAA Multiplayer FPS's. A tower defense game that focuses on grinding (not a bad thing here) and has things in place for people that like to play solo is great, but Solo-players are forced to have a private session that's still connected to the internet. If your ISP decides to kill your connection or your wireless connection is♥♥♥♥♥♥ then you get kicked out of your private, SOLO match. It's not TERRIBLY awful, just a feature that shouldn't really be there.-Length of the Game so far. Not gonna lie to you, this game is grievously short. Yes, I know it's EA, it's gonna have more stuff, yadda yadda yadda; but it won't hold your attention too well after the campaign is over. After the story is done you essentially just screw around on the maps with tougher monsters at higher difficulties. -""Hard Difficulty"" This is something alot of games honorably fail at. It's difficult to up the difficulty of something, sometimes it's simply made unfair (MGSV:PP, Iwannabetheguy, etc.) other times it's not that much harder or maybe it's easier (Legend of Zelda games, Metroid Prime, etc.). DD2 kinda flops in this regard as ""Hard"" mode is simply just a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of enemies that hit harder. Sure, that makes it harder, but not by much. It would be nice to see a new mechanic introduced to make the challenge more of one. But what it should be, I dunno. Aside from the problems, this game is in EA, and it's free as far as I'm concerned. It's worth the look.			"

								I personally have not played the first Dungeon Defenders game, but I put a ton of hours into Dungeon Defenders Eternity, and saying I enjoyed the experience is an understatement. For something in Pre-Alpha, the amount of development that has happened in this game is extremely exceptional. What you get out of the game depends on what you put into it, and to be perfectly honest, I feel like I have put a decent amount into it.Compared to Dungeon Defenders Eternity, this game offers a variety of ways to play, since one aspect I particular enjoy is the synergy that certain defenses can undergo with one another. To name a few, There is the Geyser/Storm Combo, which can keep certain targets in place (some argue the combo is broken, but I could not care less on that point), and another combo is something I call Magic Shatter (people may call it something else) where you freeze a target, then send it airborne. The result is when they come back down, the target shatters, most of the time instantly killing it. The point is unlike in DDE, The defenses all seem to have a particular place, and do not seem to make any single tower worthless. (except for maybe the Squire's Training Dummy)The gear in Dungeon Defenders 2 is already extremely versatile , with unique abilities to a certain item type that can greatly improve a player's performance, meanwhile in DDE, gear just improved tower and player stats directly. An example of some gear affixes are improving a specific tower performance, such as ""Increased Flameburst Tower damage by 5.03%"" making the item effectively an apprentice ideal item to improve his flameburst tower damage. This allows items to cater to specific classes, and once again improving the depth of the tower and also the character. There are some rarer mods that are extremely significant, so if you want to get truly powerful items, you have to be ready to hunt for them to get the best performance. Another thing I believe is improved compare to DDE is that gear is still able to be leveled, but leveling gear does not break the game as hard as it did in DDE. When you upgrade items, the stats will go up by a fixed amount every time, unlike in DDE, where the amount that the stat will increase is dependent on the stats the item had when it spawned.The next thing I will address is the leveling system. The leveling system itself is pretty straight forward, you get experience by completing waves and defeating enemies, as well as completing certain conditions to gain fixed experience points and gold. That is pretty standard, but it's a good system. The thing that I believe that DD2 has done amazingly is that instead of being able to allocate points to character and tower stats directly as a result of leveling up, the character and tower stats go up automatically, and once you reach level 5, you gain 2 points that you can put into passive skills to improve your characters performance in a series of ways. For example, the Squire is able to place points into an ability that gives his spike barricades a chance to stun enemies when they attack targets. The more points you put into a skill, the more effective it becomes. As you put more points in, the results will have diminishing returns, so a player can decide when enough is enough, and begin skilling other abilities. Furthermore, you can completely respec your skills for free at any time, so long as you are not in the middle of a wave, allowing you to test out various builds and find a setup that suits you. Each character has 6 skills you can invest in.The next thing I will address is the enemies. A few of the classic enemies make their return, goblins, orcs, wyverns, etc. The enemies still come from a variety of spawn points, where a variety of enemies will come out of each one. Those enemies were great in DDE, and most of them return in DD2. The enemy cast also expands, offering new challenges to overcome. One particular subject that has received mixed criticism is that some enemies have the ability to attack towers from outside of the common tower's attack ranges. This makes the game a bit more of a puzzle, due to the fact that unlike in DDE, tower ranges can't be increased to such an obscene level to counter absolutely everything that the map may throw at you. This does not break the game, there are still measures that the player can take to manage the various enemies, both old and new.The final subject I will touch on is the Co-op play. I never went to public taverns and went looking for people to play with, so I won't comment too much on public matchmaking, but I have friends I have played with, and this game is just as awesome in Co-op as it is in solo play. If you have friends that you know and can communicate with, the experience is far more satisfying. The enemies will scale with the number of party numbers, both in health and overall difficulty, making it a perfect game to either play solo, or bring in some of your friends to go beat down the Old One's armies.To conclude, for a game in its Pre-Alpha state, I believe this game is exceptional, and will go far. The devs are working to update the game, listening to feedback, and working to balance the game. Some things in the game still need fixing, some things still need to be balanced, but the game is still very young, and I am certain it will develop into a memorable classic. It will turn into a F2P at launch, but to be perfectly honest, I don't mind having paid for the game. I'm actually glad to have paid, because it's a way people can say ""thank you"" to the creators, especially since the game will be free at launch unless something changes that. In a nutshell, if you enjoyed the first Dungeon Defenders, I would assume you would enjoy DD2, the same holds true for Dungeon Defenders Eternity.			"

								Super good looking game, looks 10x better than the previous games.What i loved in the first DD is that you could make your build as leader, then you could be afk (as an option). I go for 20-30min and come back, wether im just waiting solo or actually letting the towers do their thing while im afk.It makes sense that party members get disconnected, because otherwise everyone could just be afk but the leader should have that option, especially if you're solo.Otherwise im obligated to finish and i cant possibly be afk, otherwise my build and games is ruined. (Lets say i wanted to take a break from Survival, when that comes).And doesn't that also mean that the party members that join will disconnect too ?At least thats how it was in the DD1..I think DDII will get a lot better, most of things people are babbling about being able to join games, making partys, the interface, inventory, skill points etc - Those things will get upgraded and fixed, that is pretty obvious.Im just concerned about the disconnecting and being able to enjoy the gameplay as of this moment.But once that happens i will be the one spenting countless hours in this game and buying every DLC like in DDI.Also the DDII team is amazing, they update/fix all the time and listen to every opinions they can and are always looking to improve.That makes me buy their games right away, even if its a bad one like Eternity, dont really care.Update: Love the new updates, amazing new features. Love the staff.They also support kids in need that have nothing.Highly recommend this game.			"

This game might be fine for a free to play game, but I'd like my twelve dollars back considering the developers have abandoned decency and are trying to nickle and dime their playerbase out of more cash. A good portion of that playerbase has already paid for this game and should not have in game content locked away from them.			"

								I got so much loot that I no longer care about loot.  I'm dead inside now... This game is in early alpha and is already better than many games I've played.  No game breaking bugs, no strange occurrences, no texture/mesh issues (at least ones that can't be blamed on my spotty internet) and it's fun!  The only major issue I've seen is it has some balance issues.  However, those issues are in your favor so it's not frustrating.  Dungeon Defenders II is exactly like the previous title, except free.  You play as one of four heros to build towers and defenses to make sure your (usually) crystal is spared from getting destroyed by invading monsters who want it for reasons not totally mentioned (early alpha).  You can build said character however you see fit.  Want them to be a wall of defense while your friends fry, electrify, and explode them?  Would you rather take things into your own hands or let your towers do the work?  Slice them?  Shoot them?  Or...uh...magic them?  You can do this solo but it's more fun with other players.  I'd imagine it's even more fun if you play with friends and can communicate with your talking.  It's also probably easier.  There's quite a few levels to play, and all look amazing.  Each level has it's own spawning routes and challenges.  Sadly, the monsters never change so it might get boring killing the same goblins and orcs over and over and over again.  The good news is, they often die before you get a good look at them.  As I said earlier, this game has balance issues.  Enemies die, maybe, too quickly for the games own good.  Right now, it might get boring.  The developers try to alleviate this by adding excursion modes with increase the difficulty but a good party of four can still find it a push-over.  Right now, though, I think the devs have other things on their mind and to do list than increase the difficulty.  I'm sure that'll happen later on as the game gets pushed to an official release.  Either that or archers are OP!  For now, enjoy the slaughter of your enemies and dance in their dropped blue mana crystals!  There's still the issues with having way too much equipment drops from mobs but I believe there was an auto-sale option in the first one so I'm sure the sequel will have it in time, as well.			"

								Good game, nice art style, good gameplay, enough stuff to do (for an alpha). But one thing that i can tell is server instability... i understand it's an alpha but rubber banding all over the place isn't acceptable, along with the matchmaking which is shifty when the servers are all over the place.

								The first two days I had this game I had about 38 hours on it. This is just as addicting as DD1 for me, but it IS STILL LACKING but I wouldn't expect anymore from a game in PRE-ALPHA I mean wow. This game Lacks diversity but it'll all come soon, after watching some of the Dev Streams I see what I'm going to expect and I am really excited I recommend this game not to DD1 players but people who want to take a new outlook on Tower Def. Games and Strat games because you're going to need a different point of view than in DD1 imo.			"

								This is clearly ""Early Access"" right now, so I needed someone to walk me through some of the gameplay because there is not a lot of explanation dialogue built in and I didn't play a lot of DD 1.  There are a lot of features to test, but bugs are still present in the game.My understanding is the game will be going F2P at some point including microtransactions allowing a boost to XP and gold earned.  Doesn't seem like a big deal - looks similar to how League of Legends and Heroes of the Storm boosts work.  Still, a very fun game despite being in Early Access - I would recommend.			"

								I'm one of the early access club members, and while switching to F2P might have upset some members I regret nothing.  The game is fun, and will continue to improve now that they are adding new heroes.  The loot system is okay, but it needs a better upgrade system for your weapons and armor.  The tower system I love, but we could use a soft cap on them per hero to incourage using the other heroes more. Overall I'd say 8/10 love it, the game just needs time to grow.and as for the whole founders, devs need to get payed:)			"

It is free to play and you can't pay 2 win your way through it. It gets updated on a regular basis and with the April patch it will leap some more steps towards the direction of a worthy successor of DD1.Happy gaming.Fuelli			"

								I played some 500+ hours in DD1, and while that isn't a ton of time, I'd like to think that I am a fan of the games. I've only played upwards of 25 hours in DD2 and to be honest, I couldn't be more pleased so far. That said, judging this game now would be ridiculous, it's in PRE-ALPHA, which translate to this not finished game, they will add more things and the game will continue to improve. So just wait a bit, taking a pre-alpha game at face value would be silly. So a word of advice from a random gamer, if you're on the fence about this game wait until it's released to give it a chance. Pros of the game:-Great graphics-More levels-New enemy types/ bosses-New abilities-Specs-The Squire found pants. The cons:-Must be online to play. Who knows though, that may change. -Some of the spec options are ""Meh"" at best. -You're unable to out level an area, If I'm 16 in a 10-15 zone, I'm scaled down as to not over power the level. -Increasing the range of your defences can be a pain as it is not a stat, you find it on gear. All in all this is a wonderful foundation for a game, As they add more into the game, I'm sure it will continue improve and it will be a worthy successor to DD1. As for now, it's one hell of a fun game.			"

								Sadly the second installment on this series does not capture the spirit of the first game.Gone are the days of going from zero to hero and slicing through waves of enemies. What has replaced it is a grindfest of the dull, stale and tedious kind that embodies modern free-to-play games.I still have hopes that the devs will turn things around as there is potential in the game but there has been more focus on costumes (sound more expensive than AAA titles) and other trivia instead of fixing the currently broken mechanics.Go play the original until this game has matured or died.

								This is still my Favorite game but it needs local play.The problem is, with the first Dungeon Defenders you could play private matches without rubberbanding around the whole map.The online play isn't bad but considering there are only a select few servers available at the moment, I'd say wait until they are done developing (it's in Alpha now) and play it when the local play is made available.Unless your in EU (Frankfort) , Asia Pacific (Singapore), US East (Northen Virginia) or close surounding  areas you are probably going to experience some kind of latency.All in all this game is meant to be played online at all times, but it'd be nice if they could get to Dungeon defenders 1's level of completion.

								Ok so I have played around 3 hours of this game so far and I am confident on this review now. Pros of the game:- Amazing atmosphere- No pay to win stores- No ""head start"" packs- Great graphics- Amazing community of people to play with- Fun with friends- Decently optimised for a pre-alpha game- Loads of story missions to complete as well as daily missions- No frame drops on MOST maps- Great class selectionsCons:- Server can be choppy at times- Fell under the map a bunch- General audio glitches (rare when it happens)Final thoughts:This game is getting a 10/10 for me, it is a fun game to play and was done well. I am glad they made it F2P during the testing of the game and I hope they keep it F2P after the full release. You should all download this game now as it is a fun as hell tower defence game at it's finest AND IT'S STILL IN PRE-ALPHA SO IMAGINE WHEN IT GETS A FULL RELEASE :D			"

								After playing dungeon defenders 1 for a couple hundred hours or so, i was very saatisfied with the game it was. I enjoyed the combat, the towers, and the aspects of each map.After playing 3 maps from dungeon defenders 2, i have learned that the combat has more depth to it, the towers are much more interesting(especially upgrading them) and the map aspects are better as well. The character upgrading also has been upgraded tremendiously. With a much more polished feel and still in alpha i am excited to see what the game has to offer as i level up.So far i am thoroughly impressed, and although i haven't gotten into the more complicated aspects of the game i am willing to say i know it is a beautiful second version of an already amazing game!

								Despite this being early access, it feels very well polished. If you enjoyed the first game, this will feel very natural to get back in to, It feels very similar in a good way! A lot better looking and with a lot more depth from the looks of what is already in the game at this point.There are a few niggles however, the game will be coming out on a Free to Play model at release so if you can hold out that long you get it for free. This also means pay to play elements will be added. Hopefully this wont mean pay to win, but we'll have to wait and see. By buying into the game now you are granted some of the pay to play currency for free, in the future when those elements are added, as well as a few exclusive items/skins. So it's kind of paying forward some pay to play items, by buying it now.Also, it is always online, which for me isnt an issue but is a bit of a bummer for some. It also seems to have an odd lobby/session system which feels like theres an unnecessary step in there. But this is a minor problem really.Overall, if you see yourself playing this game a lot, and enjoyed the first, i'd say its worth getting now. If you're on the fence, maybe wait until the f2p release.			"

								This is my favorite game to date currently. Mostly because it resembles LOL(League of Legend) but in turn giving it the twist with the RPG style. It is really a work of art and is quite honestly beautiful. Once I get my error figure out by customer support I plan to play this daily with friends!			"

								Despite this being early access, it feels very well polished. If you enjoyed the first game, this will feel very natural to get back in to, It feels very similar in a good way! A lot better looking and with a lot more depth from the looks of what is already in the game at this point.There are a few niggles however, the game will be coming out on a Free to Play model at release so if you can hold out that long you get it for free. This also means pay to play elements will be added. Hopefully this wont mean pay to win, but we'll have to wait and see. By buying into the game now you are granted some of the pay to play currency for free, in the future when those elements are added, as well as a few exclusive items/skins. So it's kind of paying forward some pay to play items, by buying it now.Also, it is always online, which for me isnt an issue but is a bit of a bummer for some. It also seems to have an odd lobby/session system which feels like theres an unnecessary step in there. But this is a minor problem really.Overall, if you see yourself playing this game a lot, and enjoyed the first, i'd say its worth getting now.

Early Access Review
								I played the original Dungeon Defenders on the Xbox 360 and it was very fun to play with friends.  I got Dungeon Defenders 2 on steam for early access before it was free to play.  Great game with hours upon hours of content, level progression, loot collection, and a plethora of other things that make Dungeon Defenders 2 such an intriguing game.  Hard to actually explain the game, sort of a castle defense but with so much more replay value; play the game to find out for yourself!  Runs great for an early access game.  I have tested it on two other systems, an older one with an FX 4100 and HD7850 2GB, and a very powerful system with an i7 6700k and a GTX 970.  It ran pretty bad on the older one and wasn’t even able to keep a stable 60fps on a combination of settings.  On the i7 6700k and GTX 970 it runs amazing, average of over 100fps with everything completely maxed.  Oddly enough it runs at that framerate while only utilizing half of the GPU's power so not sure if they will fix it or if it is some restriction of the engine.  Overall great, fun, and addictive game.  Download it.			"

								I can't get the game to work, I can't get a decent connection and is always slow while loading. (Even when I'm on a private server alone) Sometimes I can't even get through the main menu without losing connection. Even when I somehow get to the tavern, when I try to go to a map, I lose connection. If you somehow managed to get this game to run a decent speed and don't have much lag, You can have some fun with this game.

								Ok so I have played around 3 hours of this game so far and I am confident on this review now. Pros of the game:- Amazing atmosphere- No pay to win stores- No ""head start"" packs- Great graphics- Amazing community of people to play with- Fun with friends- Decently optimised for a pre-alpha game- Loads of story missions to complete as well as daily missions- No frame drops on MOST maps- Great class selectionsCons:- Server can be choppy at times- Fell under the map a bunch- General audio glitches (rare when it happens)Final thoughts:This game is getting a 10/10 for me, it is a fun game to play and was done well. I am glad they made it F2P during the testing of the game and I hope they keep it F2P after the full release. You should all download this game now as it is a fun as hell tower defence game at it's finest AND IT'S STILL IN PRE-ALPHA SO IMAGINE WHEN IT GETS A FULL RELEASE :D			"

								This game is really fun, especially if you have friends who'd also get this. If you don't have friends, there's a matchmaker too! Reviewing this in early access, there was a bug where units would spawn and block each other on their pathway leading into battle, not allowing anybody to hit them. After a few minutes, they gradually freed themselves except for the last unit, who died standing there. At least it doesn't break the game, and it's only happened once. The game is loads of fun, and I highly recommend it while on sale in its current state. There's still more that needs to be done, but it's definitely at least a fun, playable game.			"

Early Access Review
								I loved the first game and was excited to try this with some of my friends who weren't able to pick up the original.The two of us that had played DD1 were immediately offput by the less-intuitive and unexplained changes to loot and mana, as well as the extremely clunky UI and default keybinds, especially as compared to the first game. We also had a sense that some towers were virtually useless, compared to the original in which everything had at least one good purpose.All four of us were disheartened seeing the price of new characters (10k tokens) compared to token gain (4-5 per map in the beginning, some reading told us 25 is a high amount later on, plus 100-300 for dailies and a few thousand for monthlies).We were surprised to fail the fifth level, having one of each starter character across the four players. Upgraded walls were dying in half a wave, and our resources were spread thin due to sprawling map design and two spread-out defense points. None of us could discern enemy paths before they were shown to us.Inventory and gear management were beyond nightmarish. There was no sorting that we could find, so items got lost a lot. Comparisons are fine most of the time, but totems/medallions/orbs/whatever seem to compare to a random equipped one but always replace the one in the first slot. Shards took a while to figure out.In general nothing is explained except the very obvious basic controls.From what I've heard a lot of this is due to a recent patch, but in the current state I cannot recommend the game as a game, at least to new players. It may be fine to certain groups of friends who are wanting the challenge or who don't really care much about playing the game in a way that makes sense, I guess.Overall I would have put DD1 as an 8/10 overall and a 10/10 for its genre. I'd put DD2 as a 6.5/10 for the genre and a 3.5/10 overall.			"

								My thoughts of the game so far.Pros-Better combat systembetter towersBigger tavernBetter graphicsBetter player level systemCons-Key layoutCashshopclass slots cost real moneyTavern setup its everyone in one tavernBigger bag cost real moneycostumes cost real moneyloot boxes cost real money to unlockNo trading systemYes i get with a f2p game they need money in order to keep the game going such as every thing costing real money to get. I think if they added things from first game it could be alot better. I don't like haven't buy class slots or costumes. In dungeon defenders one they gave you 12+ class slots all free you didnt have to buy any thing with real money but big dlcs with came with hoilday quest, more story mission more items, costumes, challanges and the most was 20 dollars. I just feel like they are missing some of the best from from the other two games.Its not all bad they have improved alot of things but with some of the best stuff missing from the other games. They also took out offline so you must have internet to play. There is also a lack of towers from the first game, now when i say that what i mean is they took out some of the towers from the first game wich i don't know why all towers were used and needed for the first one.DLC: parts from the first game was you did have to buy it but as i said before it came with alot of added stuff. Now if you want somthing that looks cool you have to buy gems (real money) . In the first one in order to get cool costumes, weapons or even pets you had to beat a challange or a level on normally a high difficulty. I feel from that there was some pride when you get it cause it shows you went through alot to get it. Now you can just buy it me personally i would rather earn it.Tavern: I liked the way that had it setup where you there was a list of matches. So you can see all the matches being played. You could host your own tavern. But with that there are pros and cons from that like from people hosting there own matches they could kick you if they wanted but with that its also good for it people arent helping or causing problems. Also with having taverns you could set out the items you've gotten from your troubles of hard work for trades like if you're looking for a weapon but cant get you could trade for it with money, weapons, armor and even pets. Also i just remembered that the trophies you unlocked were setup in the tavern to show what you've completed. That helps people know if you can help them with a challange or with a very challanging match.Class slots: They only give you 4 class slots which i think is **** compared to what they had in the first one 12+ class slots Which allowed you to make  tower and dps classes instead of one or the other but with that being said in the first one they did have more classes to choose from instead of the base four.

								Decent Game, Since the beginning there has been plenty of changes.It seems they finally found their course and it seems to be heading in the right direction. For a casual player very fun ,  Not much of an endgame for the hardcore player mind you.  Plenty of different style of builds, they plan to release a bunch of new classes which is nice but again, if there isnt an end game once your geared your bored.

I just use a pc and a logitech g70 keyboard with mouse.      so i have no idea.  look up in forums to similar problems a coulple of months ago... but they used a controller. so i have no idea.  If it works for you great, but unfortunately you might be like me and have nothing but issues			"

								I loved the first game and was excited to try this with some of my friends who weren't able to pick up the original.The two of us that had played DD1 were immediately offput by the less-intuitive and unexplained changes to loot and mana, as well as the extremely clunky UI and default keybinds, especially as compared to the first game. We also had a sense that some towers were virtually useless, compared to the original in which everything had at least one good purpose.All four of us were disheartened seeing the price of new characters (10k tokens) compared to token gain (4-5 per map in the beginning, some reading told us 25 is a high amount later on, plus 100-300 for dailies and a few thousand for monthlies).We were surprised to fail the fifth level, having one of each starter character across the four players. Upgraded walls were dying in half a wave, and our resources were spread thin due to sprawling map design and two spread-out defense points. None of us could discern enemy paths before they were shown to us.Inventory and gear management were beyond nightmarish. There was no sorting that we could find, so items got lost a lot. Comparisons are fine most of the time, but totems/medallions/orbs/whatever seem to compare to a random equipped one but always replace the one in the first slot. Shards took a while to figure out.In general nothing is explained except the very obvious basic controls.From what I've heard a lot of this is due to a recent patch, but in the current state I cannot recommend the game as a game, at least to new players. It may be fine to certain groups of friends who are wanting the challenge or who don't really care much about playing the game in a way that makes sense, I guess.Overall I would have put DD1 as an 8/10 overall and a 10/10 for its genre. I'd put DD2 as a 6.5/10 for the genre and a 3.5/10 overall.			"

								My thoughts of the game so far.Pros-Better combat systembetter towersBigger tavernBetter graphicsBetter player level systemCons-Key layoutCashshopclass slots cost real moneyTavern setup its everyone in one tavernBigger bag cost real moneycostumes cost real moneyloot boxes cost real money to unlockNo trading systemYes i get with a f2p game they need money in order to keep the game going such as every thing costing real money to get. I think if they added things from first game it could be alot better. I don't like haven't buy class slots or costumes. In dungeon defenders one they gave you 12+ class slots all free you didnt have to buy any thing with real money but big dlcs with came with hoilday quest, more story mission more items, costumes, challanges and the most was 20 dollars. I just feel like they are missing some of the best from from the other two games.Its not all bad they have improved alot of things but with some of the best stuff missing from the other games. They also took out offline so you must have internet to play. There is also a lack of towers from the first game, now when i say that what i mean is they took out some of the towers from the first game wich i don't know why all towers were used and needed for the first one.DLC: parts from the first game was you did have to buy it but as i said before it came with alot of added stuff. Now if you want somthing that looks cool you have to buy gems (real money) . In the first one in order to get cool costumes, weapons or even pets you had to beat a challange or a level on normally a high difficulty. I feel from that there was some pride when you get it cause it shows you went through alot to get it. Now you can just buy it me personally i would rather earn it.Tavern: I liked the way that had it setup where you there was a list of matches. So you can see all the matches being played. You could host your own tavern. But with that there are pros and cons from that like from people hosting there own matches they could kick you if they wanted but with that its also good for it people arent helping or causing problems. Also with having taverns you could set out the items you've gotten from your troubles of hard work for trades like if you're looking for a weapon but cant get you could trade for it with money, weapons, armor and even pets. Also i just remembered that the trophies you unlocked were setup in the tavern to show what you've completed.

This game is poorly optimized, It did cost to buy the game and now they made it free but made every character like 20 bucks to buy and didnt give anything to the people that pre ordered the game and actually bought it when it cost.

								Dungeon Defenders II is a free to play cooperative tower defense / third person action RPG that is in Early Access.  It worked, looked ok, sounded ok, played ok.  Has Steam Achievements.   Had people playing it.  Has four different classes of heroes. Some powers can combo with other classes powers.  Sort of like Orcs Must Die.CONS:Had lag spikes. Need more better tutorial, power tips, manual. Try it, maybe you might like it.For more info:

Early Access Review
								This game is probably one of the only games capable of going toe to toe with dark souls for entertainment sake.Dark souls for me made all other games pretty much obsolete because they where ever too easy or just have no interesting content for me to explore and build upon.Dunged Defenders II is a fun and very addicting experience it will keep your attention for the best of two weeks because there is always that chance of finding a better bow or getting those leggings that you have been looking for this whole time.The difficulty is more like a progress checker I kept going back to the first level on a even higher difficulty to see if I was ready to take on that harder challenge that would destroy me everytime.There are three modes other then Campaign there is Free play, incursion and onslaught:Free play was fun to play after I had beaten the campaign because it was like all the enemies that I had come across in the campaign all came to gether in the earlier maps to test my ability to adapted to a new situation and there was a harder difficulty that was unlocked to make me strive to become stronger. Then there is incursion mode this was an nice twist on older maps that I had previously played Because there was different concept on every map that made it interesting to see how it would playout in the end.And finally but not least there was the onslaught mode now that was the mode to test how strong you were and to get better gear like you never though possible, You would face pretty much an endless horde of enemies that would test your ability to set up defences and maintain them for as long as possible before the inevitability that the enemies would burst though you lines ending the game.But when I though I had done everything on the hardest difficulty I found there was a rude awaking that there was a mode called endgame that made the game take on a whole new light. Only by beating the game and getting to Lv40 could you play this mode and what it did was bring all the previous game modes and allowed you to play on a difficulty's called nightmare 1, 2, 3 & 4 and like the name suggest its like a nightmare.That's when I reached out to people in the community to help me and they were all to happy to help push me into the verge that was nightmare difficulty, Now i am onto nightmare 4 and still can't seem to get enough without saying to my self just one more game.

								This franchise has always been fun and it looks like the second will not dissapoint. Great fun social coop game at a reasonable price. 110% worth it.My only little niggle about the game is that it feels like a revamp of the original. That said however any fans of the first should not be put off as many elements of the game have been refreshed in a way that builds upon the flaws of the last. The game and my play through is early days however even in this prototype stage of development I find myself impressed with the developers of this game. I'm glad that one of the few games I really enjoy has such a great team working on it.			"

								I'm rating this game as a no. I have had multiple problems with it on launch. It will freeze, stop working, then tell me that it's missing a bunch of files. Most of these files are in the binaries. Until they patch this game, I won't be able to play it anymore. In order to get into it initially, I had to go through the steam store website. I was then able to play the game. I think it's a fun game, for the total of 1 hour that I played it. I then logged out. I haven't been able to get back in since. I know it's not a problem with steam, as all of my other games work perfectly. I tried disabling my firewall and letting it reinstall. That didn't work. I tried the various different .exe files, and that didn't work. I verified all the files installed, and that did nothing. My computer is very capable of handling this game. If they patch the update, and it works, I will happily rewrite this review. Until then 0/10. Oh and yes I realize this is just the alpha, but no I will not change the score because of that. If I did, then it would mean that making a game with this many start problems is okay, and it is not.0/10 upon first review.			"

								I am waiting to setup my new computer before I give this earlly access the full rundown.  But what I can tell you is this, the concept of this game is absolutely amazing.  I have DD1 on my ps3, xbox 360, pc, iphone, and android tablet.  I could not get enough of it.  My friends and I logged probably close to 1,000hrs playing co-op on the ps3.  The strategy involved in placing towers, and the upgrading of loot just had us completely addicted.  I have been awaiting this release ever since Trendy first announced the possibility of DD2.  Can't wait to give it the ol' college try coach!			"

								Dungeon defenders was one of my favorite Stategy RPG games, having a perfect blen of Arpg and strategy. DD2 improves on many features and adds some, it is a satisfying and very unique game. Very hard to solo at but still fun. Trendy improved the heroes by A LOT and they made a lot of progress in there training. So, considereing i put 70+ hours into the first one i hope to put three times as much on here.Early Access Rating: 8.2/10         -1.8 for opinions of mine, best keep to the facts.			"

								If you like dungeon defenders 1, then this game would seem like a good buy, it has a lot of aspects like the last game but they have added a bunch of♥♥♥♥♥♥that makes it unplayableMicro transactions for: Character slots, skins, weapons, gold, missions, and any stat reset. there is no earning anything in this game. you might as well be playing this on a phone because with all these micro transactions it should be one.Nothing New- Same classes. same idea.UI and Item ID's - The way they show you items on the ground and the 6 stats all the items have cause you to have to look over them twice as much before knowing if it is really a stat increase or just an attack speed buff. The UI is also really cluttered, like... not much thought or time was put in to make this thing pretty or non-invasive over the game.Honestly I was really excited for this game; I bought it as a loyal customer of the original game but ended up being disappointed over and over. Some levels are so easy that you can throw them on hard and grind to over level the rest of the game. This game is sadly nothing like the 1st and they decided to sell out to micro transactions to cash out on this as fast as possible.			"

								Grew up with TDs in Wc3, love playing this type of game as it really chills me out. This game reminds me more of the hero line wars than an actual TD which is great imo, as much as I like to afk as I plant my towers down (you still can if you want) I like how now hero damage builds actually work and can really speed up maps, when i first played this game a year ago the builder way was pretty much the only way, hero damage builds were kind of a joke. All in all I am very pleased with returning to this game but I can see how people are concerned how relativly easy it is to aquire great gear with the carnaval wheel. I returned to DD2 exactly a week ago and am currently in NM 4  with 4 lvl 50s with IPWR 580 after 70 hours of solo play, for me it is still very enjoyable as I still have 120 more IPWR to go for and with the release of a patch with a new hero (and map?) tomorrow I am very stoked. Another very cool thing that is coming is that they will sortoff unlock your hero deck where all your active heroes can be in the deck but you can use all the heroes you own to build, meaning that as they release more heroes, the combinations will be endless... specially benificial for us solo players.

								Dungeon Defenders II is easily, hands down, my second favorite game EVER, only being bested by Dungeon Defenders I. I'm not going to be that guy that says Dungeon Defenders II is a bad game because it isn't as good as the first game of the series, as Dungeon Defenders II is still in development, meaning it will get new story, characters, mechanics, and become a better game over all. So, to the point, I definately recommend this game, and for a couple reasons too.1) Loot, loot, and more loot. I personally LOVE loot mechanics to games, even just looking at an items stats and comparing it to another item in every single way.2) This game is fun to play by your self, and playing with your friends, I've played this game mostly by my self, as most of my friends weren't too into the game, which was kind of disapointing, but I've been having fun with this game by my self ever since.I would give a con list of sorts, but I honestly can't think of anything bad about the game.So overall 11/10, would let my friends ditch me to play COD Black Ops III again.

								This isn't the main game that I play, usually I just jump on this game with friends to have some fun and relax.With that in mind, the most important part for this game is the developer involvement:DEVSTREAMS: Every week the developers stream for an hour. The stream has gameplay in the background, a camera that has two developers answering questions from the chat and forums, and another camera with a game developer working on game assets (designing weapons or making animations).DEVLOGS: These are a bit more informal and usually just a sentence or two. But every developer posts what they have been working on that week. At the very least it lets you know what is coming up soon.INFLUENCE VOTES: For logging into the game (and the forums) you can get influnce points, then the team has public votes for different systems that the community prefers (how loot drops work, how to acquire certain items, etc). So you can just save up your points and actually make quite a considerable difference in something you feel strongly about.All of this in addition to other videos for events and whatnot featuring developers answering questions on the forums or emails. They also have a department dedicated to going through every bug report sent through the in game system, the game is going to be in early access for quite a while, so it is nice to be able to follow along.The game has bugs and isn't too terribly rich in the content department right now, but it's still pretty early in development.

								This franchise has always been fun and it looks like the second will not dissapoint. Great fun social coop game at a reasonable price. 110% worth it.My only little niggle about the game is that it feels like a revamp of the original. That said however any fans of the first should not be put off as many elements of the game have been refreshed in a way that builds upon the flaws of the last. The game and my play through is early days however even in this prototype stage of development I find myself impressed with the developers of this game. I'm glad that one of the few games I really enjoy has such a great team working on it.			"

								No one agrees with my reviews, but I still make em. :DNov 2016 edit: And hey! Look at that slowly collapsing playerbase. Love to shove it in all the naysayers faces and told ya so. You know your game is poor when you make a free to play sequel and there are still a measurable amount playing the first. Like a third relatively speaking. BTW the game is STILL in early access...+Attractive cartoony characters and great aesthetic visual style.+Levels are pretty nice to look at and are fairly well designed.+Controls work quite well.+Abilities and towers have some synergy.+Some talents are pretty cool.+Some weapons are goofy in a good way such as 'book on a stick' that fires pages. (This fits in with the aesthetic pretty well.)+Cute pets.+Sub objectives to protect help to shape the pathing of enemies.+Stage traps that work.+Stats were made more complex.+Free to play!+Huntress is a hottie!-Glitchy/buggy. Just starting the game up and trying to switch settings around I crashed a couple times and http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/395551484001360154/C97977F6DA79498412EF112ACECC4D8C5D1E68E3/ happened which forced me to restart again. It worked after fiddling quite a bit, but it was never quite this bad.-Random framerate drops. The game used to run smoothly, but seems to struggle now for some reason even in just the lobby.-Microtransactions in early access and already priority has shifted to making more over new content: 


Yes look at all these god damn microtransaction. Look at them all! The game isn't even out of early access...

-No recoloring. (This may not be big for others, but it is big for me.)-Extremely grindy.-You can only level 1 char at a time even though you can bring up to four after unlocking them all meaning you are only leveling 1 char and you will need to level them all if you want to play alone meaning MORE GRIND.-Level synching makes power leveling non existant meaning you will have to grind even more. (part of me wants to like this, but the fact you have to grind four people makes this a no no.)-Playing solo is very difficult and requires you to play even longer for any chance.-Stage traps are often inconvenient to activate, too difficult to activate, in a bad position to build walls or the timing is garbage on them.-The sub objectives in later levels don't seem to be too important especially in the ramparts where putting all your towers in a central location draws better, faster and more effecient results. They are a gimmick, one that is poorly thought out.-Playing with others is not a great experience. I know I am no saint, I am not a great person, but the community here puts my rage and general poor socialization to shame. Don't believe me, go right on ahead and try the game out.-Talents are locked behind gold walls forcing you to spend lots of gold to unlock them.-Gear and combos are too heavily emphasized. (Huntress water trap + monk aura is in almost every game.)-Minimal strategy involved. (You will set up your stuff the same almost every time simply because of the aformentioned combo and gear emphasis and magic/physical resistant enemies become pointless later on because you will NEED this setup regardless to progress.)-AI is very poor. Some enemies will get stuck, others will just not work:

  (The enemy sees my towers below and begins throwing his spear into the wall repeatedly. This is not the only time it has happened and it is easily replicatable trivializing certain encounters.)-Only four playable with four abilities (one of which is heal on everyone) and four towers means there really isn't that much variety.-Pets are a chore to level and just add more grind.-Not everyone knew this game would be F2P and not everyone is happy that it went F2P. (I wouldn't have paid a dime to play this game if I could've)-Inventory space is limited. There is an auto loot system in place where you can specify what loot goes where, but the problem is that if you have it on auto loot and you run out of space and you 'auto loot' something you want, it just goes bye bye. You can specify item rarity, but this is still a huge flaw as it CAN happen. There used to be a system in place that would take all items you left on the ground and put them in a temp chest, but for some reason they removed that (and there was no initiative vote for it.)-Initiave votes are a joke and have no real effect on the game. See: https://dungeondefenders.com/2/initiatives/11 Players have no real effect on the game with the votes. You are not changing anything or affecting anything as is evidenced by these joke of a votes. Here's another : https://dungeondefenders.com/2/initiatives/19  Oh boy choose the COLOR. So stupid. (I am pretty sure the numbers on them are skewed as well.)-Because the game is 'tower defense' it has little to no variety and the only boss in the game is just plain tedious to fight and the mechanic they do is place a 'curse' down making you have to move your towers/traps. That would be fun and such except the placement is random and it will occassionally cause your buildings to be 'cut off' from some pathing. I do not have an example unfortunately, but the idea is that so much of a path is cursed that you can't protect it sufficiently enough. Especially if you play solo.-very VERY little content. I went on a 4-6 month hiatus from this game and came back and there was LITERALLY NO NEW CONTENT. Just more skins. I can't believe this is acceptable for a game at any point.-There is no huntress skin where the progressive unlocks give her bigger boobs and a curvier body or the more mana she has she is curvier. (And why isn't there huh? If you're not going to put the succubus in the game at least give the huntress some more up top. Sheesh.)Look, it's free to play. Great. Should you try it? Sure why not? If you got time to spare yeah. For me I don't have time to spare. I would rather pay money for a great experience than none for a bare bones, no content experience that I don't even enjoy. If they had put it on the main page in big bold letters (THIS GAME WILL BE FREE TO PLAY AT SOME POINT) Then I would have no excuse to be upset, but money was spent on it so I am upset. Very very very little that I would want of this game came true so I am not recommending you play it or support the devs. That's it. Have a great day.TLDR - Beautiful aesthetic, good controls, great concept, way too grindy and NO CONTENT.			"

								Had a pretty rough start on this one. Once I got going however, things have been improving slowly but surely. To me, this doen't quite seem like a sequal of Dungeon Defenders so much as a spin off of it. While it starts with more grown up versions of the 4 main characters from the original game, most of their powers and traps are very different. All in all, i'm giving it a thumbs up because it is fun if you don't expect it to be just more of the same.			"

Early Access Review
								For a game that is f2p and in alpha im quite impressed by the result.DD2 is a very casual Tower Def game that suits players of all age.Theres a decent amount of dif maps to be played with each of them having a few tricks to make them easier.The game includes 4 dif heroes to choose from - pets - equipment (not only +stat) and a lot of grind. My only real problem with the game is that it's way too easy to reach the highest difficulty nm4. And progressing through the difficulties is based on getting new gear from harder maps - which drives people to join games that are too difficult for them, so that they can be carried by the others a few times to up their gear. Progressing from nm3 to nm4 and from nm4 900 to 1000 just requires getting carried once through a map to get usable gear.After a player has reached the highest possible difficulty, thats when the real grind starts. Getting the optimal gear will take a lot of time and you end up running the same map over and over. The real issue with the game is the fact that progressing doesn't feel very rewarding. You can easily grind a lvl 1 hero to 50 in 2 hours if you know what you are doing and reach the top difficulty in a day.Theres no real character customisation in the game. Sure theres stat points that lead to certain builds, but the builds are so obvious and 1 way streets that everyone ends up with the same builds. Until nm4 you can defeat the maps with a big variety of strategies, but after you reach the highest difficulty, theres 1 strategy that you might have to tweak a bit depending on the map.The game also has some weird fps drop problems for me during the first 15-20 minutes, after which they completely disappear.Over all the game is a good time sink and decently fun - but the game feels too simple and easily beaten that I wouldn't for that reason invest any money on this. After playing 34 hours I can already say that im bored of running nm4 incursion  and nm4 necro and that theres no real replay value here. The game is just very repeatative and doesn't give me the feel of real progression or uniqueness to my character.My suggestion would be to take a look at the stat point system really well and ask if theres something to be changed there. I would also want to see some type of real customisation on your hero - skill points + skill tree (for towers etc.) to choose from?I understand there ideas would make balancing difficult and would require the devs to create a lot new skills with real variety, but something needs to be done to make the game more interesting.I up voted this game, but if there was a neutral option I would have gone for that.

								If you like dungeon defenders 1, then this game would seem like a good buy, it has a lot of aspects like the last game but they have added a bunch of♥♥♥♥♥♥that makes it unplayableMicro transactions for: Character slots, skins, weapons, gold, missions, and any stat reset. there is no earning anything in this game. you might as well be playing this on a phone because with all these micro transactions it should be one.Nothing New- Same classes. same idea.UI and Item ID's - The way they show you items on the ground and the 6 stats all the items have cause you to have to look over them twice as much before knowing if it is really a stat increase or just an attack speed buff. The UI is also really cluttered, like... not much thought or time was put in to make this thing pretty or non-invasive over the game.Honestly I was really excited for this game; I bought it as a loyal customer of the original game but ended up being disappointed over and over. Some levels are so easy that you can throw them on hard and grind to over level the rest of the game. This game is sadly nothing like the 1st and they decided to sell out to micro transactions to cash out on this as fast as possible.			"

								Dungeon Defenders II is easily, hands down, my second favorite game EVER, only being bested by Dungeon Defenders I. I'm not going to be that guy that says Dungeon Defenders II is a bad game because it isn't as good as the first game of the series, as Dungeon Defenders II is still in development, meaning it will get new story, characters, mechanics, and become a better game over all. So, to the point, I definately recommend this game, and for a couple reasons too.1) Loot, loot, and more loot. I personally LOVE loot mechanics to games, even just looking at an items stats and comparing it to another item in every single way.2) This game is fun to play by your self, and playing with your friends, I've played this game mostly by my self, as most of my friends weren't too into the game, which was kind of disapointing, but I've been having fun with this game by my self ever since.I would give a con list of sorts, but I honestly can't think of anything bad about the game.So overall 11/10, would let my friends ditch me to play COD Black Ops III again.

Early Access Review
								TL;DR: If you loved the first one, you'll at least like this one. If you haven't played the first one, I'd recommend you to do that. But if you don't have the money, this is a great alternative. Let me start off by saying DD1 is one of my favorite games of all time. Therefore this review may be a bit biased. For a game in alpha stage it's definitely not bad, there is a decent amount of content and more is being developed all the time. I bought the game more or less as soon as it was available and I don't regret that decision. You could get it for free, and here's why you should:Even if you've played DD1, it feels like a new game. It's different enough, but at the same time it's similar enough to be called a Dungeon Defenders game. Leveling feels somewhat rewarding, though the early levels go by really fast while the later levels are a grind. However, it's rather satisfying to hit that level you needed for a new weapon or piece of armor.Extremely fun with friends. If you're playing this alone or with randoms, you're missing out.The graphics are beautiful. A definite upgrade from DD1The map designs are great, the only complaint here is that some maps in DD1 felt bigger. Trendy communicates with the playerbase, frequent devstreams and posts. This is something you don't see very often, especially this early in development. Some of the weapons have really cool passive effects. There's a lot of variety in weapons, especially bows. You could find 4 of the same bow and they could all have a different shot types, making them better for different situations.One of my biggest complaints is a bit of an odd one. I really don't like the fact that it's f2p. Maybe it's the fear of it becoming p2w, but I highly doubt that will happen. Another thing is the amount of paid DLC's. DD1 had a TON of them, and the game wasn't free. Now that this one is free, it feels like there will be even more DLC's. I don't mind throwing a bit of cash at the game however, but I really hope the amount won't be excessive. Most of the negative things I have to say about the game will (probably) be fixed by the time the game fully releases, so I won't get too much into them but:Upgrading weapons isn't that rewarding. There aren't as many upgrade levels on weapons, probably partly due to how they changed the upgrading system as a whole. You can only have so many items to upgrade with. The amount of legendary drops you get. In DD1 this wasn't as much of a problem. Now it's rare to go even one map without getting a legendary. It doesn't feel satisfying at all, and most of the time they're worse than the equipment you're already using anyway. They are nice for upgrading other gear though.The towers feel a bit more.. bland? compared to DD1. Though I do really like how you can change certain towers (or abilities) with uber spheres. The lack of challenge mode. I can't remember exactly what it was called but if you've played DD1 you probably know what I'm talking about.I enjoyed showing off my achievements in DD1 inside my tavern, especially with the eternia crystal. There aren't that many achievements in the game yet, but when they do add them I hope we'll get something like that. I find it kind of silly how they're already about to release an additional hero, when in DD1 it took them almost 2 years. I don't mind a new hero to play around with, but I'd prefer some other content instead. This review probably wasn't very coherent at all, but the point I'm trying to make is that the game is worth a try, especially with the $0 price tag. I have faith in Trendy, the game will improve by heaps by the time of release.			"

								Had a pretty rough start on this one. Once I got going however, things have been improving slowly but surely. To me, this doen't quite seem like a sequal of Dungeon Defenders so much as a spin off of it. While it starts with more grown up versions of the 4 main characters from the original game, most of their powers and traps are very different. All in all, i'm giving it a thumbs up because it is fun if you don't expect it to be just more of the same.			"

								I've tried to time after time enjoy this sequal to Dungeon Defenders, a game which I put well over 300 hours into, but I simply cannot seem to find that same spark that the first Dungeon Defenders had. The game has been in Alpha for well over 2 years and in that time the developer seem to have seemingly forgotten about what actually made Dungeon Defenders such an enjoyable game. And instead opted to try and get as much money out of their fans. Just look at the DLC's available, 135€ worth of DLC's for a game that is supposedly in Early Access Alpha. This without mentioning the in-game cash shop currency which is essentially needed to get even a remotely decent experience. All this while the game still runs like garbage.In the end if you are interested in the Dungeon Defenders concept simply grab the original Dungeon Defenders. It will give you a much better experience overall.			"

								this game is semi fun to play, it's still in early release, and thus not a finished product.There are constant changes and the devs are always adding things to it. At the moment if writing this review they are adding EVE2.0 into the game, whom you can earn by completing daily missions (6-10 tokens per mission once a day plus a monthly mission i have NEVER been close to finishing) Eve is 10k tokens, Or you can buy for RealMoney.....the tokens are also used to buy spheres that change your abilities or buy keys that unlock costumes. I dont like the fact that the game is FULL of micro transactions and you cannot play the new features without buying stuff for RealMoney, the last example was a carneval map that you had to buy a ticket for to play.When I bought this game it was not a free to play game, so when it did turn that way and i saw the amount of time that went into designing new costumes and maps you could only get if you paid more money for it made me somewhat bitter. I have a bunch of max level characters, and i will ocasionally log in and play with my wife, we play a few maps and then get bored. We arent powerful enough for the nightmare mode but the gear that drops 1 difficulty lower is usually 10 levels below our level so it's near impossible to get upgrades. id say this is 4/10. "

-No recoloring. (This may not be big for others, but it is big for me.)-Extremely grindy.-You can only level 1 char at a time even though you can bring up to four after unlocking them all meaning you are only leveling 1 char and you will need to level them all if you want to play alone meaning MORE GRIND.-Level synching makes power leveling non existant meaning you will have to grind even more. (part of me wants to like this, but the fact you have to grind four people makes this a no no.)-Playing solo is very difficult and requires you to play even longer for any chance.-Stage traps are often inconvenient to activate, too difficult to activate, in a bad position to build walls or the timing is garbage on them.-The sub objectives in later levels don't seem to be too important especially in the ramparts where putting all your towers in a central location draws better, faster and more effecient results. They are a gimmick, one that is poorly thought out.-Playing with others is not a great experience. I know I am no saint, I am not a great person, but the community here puts my rage and general poor socialization to shame. Don't believe me, go right on ahead and try the game out.-Talents are locked behind gold walls forcing you to spend lots of gold to unlock them.-Gear and combos are too heavily emphasized. (Huntress water trap + monk aura is in almost every game.)-Minimal strategy involved. (You will set up your stuff the same almost every time simply because of the aformentioned combo and gear emphasis and magic/physical resistant enemies become pointless later on because you will NEED this setup regardless to progress.)-AI is very poor. Some enemies will get stuck, others will just not work:

  (The enemy sees my towers below and begins throwing his spear into the wall repeatedly. This is not the only time it has happened and it is easily replicatable trivializing certain encounters.)-Only four playable with four abilities (one of which is heal on everyone) and four towers means there really isn't that much variety.-Pets are a chore to level and just add more grind.-Not everyone knew this game would be F2P and not everyone is happy that it went F2P. (I wouldn't have paid a dime to play this game if I could've)-Inventory space is limited. There is an auto loot system in place where you can specify what loot goes where, but the problem is that if you have it on auto loot and you run out of space and you 'auto loot' something you want, it just goes bye bye. You can specify item rarity, but this is still a huge flaw as it CAN happen. There used to be a system in place that would take all items you left on the ground and put them in a temp chest, but for some reason they removed that (and there was no initiative vote for it.)-Initiave votes are a joke and have no real effect on the game. See: https://dungeondefenders.com/2/initiatives/11 Players have no real effect on the game with the votes. You are not changing anything or affecting anything as is evidenced by these joke of a votes. Here's another : https://dungeondefenders.com/2/initiatives/19  Oh boy choose the COLOR. So stupid. (I am pretty sure the numbers on them are skewed as well.)-Because the game is 'tower defense' it has little to no variety and the only boss in the game is just plain tedious to fight and the mechanic they do is place a 'curse' down making you have to move your towers/traps. That would be fun and such except the placement is random and it will occassionally cause your buildings to be 'cut off' from some pathing. I do not have an example unfortunately, but the idea is that so much of a path is cursed that you can't protect it sufficiently enough. Especially if you play solo.-very VERY little content. I went on a 4-6 month hiatus from this game and came back and there was LITERALLY NO NEW CONTENT. Just more skins. I can't believe this is acceptable for a game at any point.-There is no huntress skin where the progressive unlocks give her bigger boobs and a curvier body or the more mana she has she is curvier. (And why isn't there huh? If you're not going to put the succubus in the game at least give the huntress some more up top. Sheesh.)Look, it's free to play. Great. Should you try it? Sure why not? If you got time to spare yeah. For me I don't have time to spare. I would rather pay money for a great experience than none for a bare bones, no content experience that I don't even enjoy. If they had put it on the main page in big bold letters (THIS GAME WILL BE FREE TO PLAY AT SOME POINT) Then I would have no excuse to be upset, but money was spent on it so I am upset. Very very very little that I would want of this game came true so I am not recommending you play it or support the devs. That's it. Have a great day.TLDR - Beautiful aesthetic, good controls, great concept, way too grindy and NO CONTENT.			"

This is not the only time it has happened and it is easily replicatable trivializing certain encounters.)-Only four playable with four abilities (one of which is heal on everyone) and four towers means there really isn't that much variety.-Pets are a chore to level and just add more grind.-Not everyone knew this game would be F2P and not everyone is happy that it went F2P. (I wouldn't have paid a dime to play this game if I could've)-Inventory space is limited. There is an auto loot system in place where you can specify what loot goes where, but the problem is that if you have it on auto loot and you run out of space and you 'auto loot' something you want, it just goes bye bye. You can specify item rarity, but this is still a huge flaw as it CAN happen. There used to be a system in place that would take all items you left on the ground and put them in a temp chest, but for some reason they removed that (and there was no initiative vote for it.)-Initiave votes are a joke and have no real effect on the game. See: https://dungeondefenders.com/2/initiatives/11 Players have no real effect on the game with the votes. You are not changing anything or affecting anything as is evidenced by these joke of a votes. Here's another : https://dungeondefenders.com/2/initiatives/19  Oh boy choose the COLOR. So stupid. (I am pretty sure the numbers on them are skewed as well.)-Because the game is 'tower defense' it has little to no variety and the only boss in the game is just plain tedious to fight and the mechanic they do is place a 'curse' down making you have to move your towers/traps. That would be fun and such except the placement is random and it will occassionally cause your buildings to be 'cut off' from some pathing. I do not have an example unfortunately, but the idea is that so much of a path is cursed that you can't protect it sufficiently enough. Especially if you play solo.-very VERY little content. I went on a 4-6 month hiatus from this game and came back and there was LITERALLY NO NEW CONTENT. Just more skins. I can't believe this is acceptable for a game at any point.-There is no huntress skin where the progressive unlocks give her bigger boobs and a curvier body or the more mana she has she is curvier. (And why isn't there huh? If you're not going to put the succubus in the game at least give the huntress some more up top. Sheesh.)Look, it's free to play. Great. Should you try it? Sure why not? If you got time to spare yeah. For me I don't have time to spare. I would rather pay money for a great experience than none for a bare bones, no content experience that I don't even enjoy. If they had put it on the main page in big bold letters (THIS GAME WILL BE FREE TO PLAY AT SOME POINT) Then I would have no excuse to be upset, but money was spent on it so I am upset. Very very very little that I would want of this game came true so I am not recommending you play it or support the devs. That's it. Have a great day.TLDR - Beautiful aesthetic, good controls, great concept, way too grindy and NO CONTENT.			"

First impressionI love this game so far. I haven't played DD1, so I've no idea how DD2 compares to DD1. Anyway, here's my opinion on this game:+One of the best F2P games you can find!+It's a fun game if you like tower defence games+Good content - even if it's in alpha!+Loots. Lots of loots!+Great graphics+Smooth and easy gameplay+Customize your own character!+It's not P2POverall, it's a great game you could spend tons of hours with your friends, and I definitely recommend this game!

								ok i have both DD1 and DD2 on steam.

								I genuinly enjoy this game, the graphics are great and very smooth.There still is, seeing as it is in alpha, some room for improvement.Personally, I dont like that it is a group maximum of defenses because when you play with people that just place down a great amount of traps and you can´t place any more barries, it does create some frustration.But the group maximum is also a good thing about dungeon defenders, it stimulates the players to work together.Maybe also have a little explanation what the stats exactly do when you upgrade it and maybe make it so you can actually take points back and not that you lose them.Honestly, it is a great game and everyone who is hesitant of downloading it: give it a try, it may surprise you in a good way			"

								Even in Alpha, this game is amazing. It's improved greatly over the first game; the art direction is fantastic, the way battle flows is more forgiving and challenging at the same time, the division of classes is great, the pet system is fun, being able to sell items in between waves...! There are just so many different little touches that are amazing! If you like Tower Defense, there is no reason not to play Dungeon Defenders II.			"

								Not to long ago I started playing this game and before this I played ""Dungeon Defenders"" more than I probably should have. So far compared to the first one this is okay, but things are starting to look up as we head on into some of the higher builds of the alpha test build. I main Apprentice and I'm level 32 and I'm enjoying the game quite a bit. though the EXP much like Dungeon Defenders 1 levels 60-70 is a bit rediculous. I would say the tutorial is a bit rough (needs to be more in detail) and I also think that monks need a better set of skills. you can not possibly go 1-30 solo. it's imposible. but this is just my opinion. I've played and beat the campaign and I do hope that you will make DLC's for it to make it actually worth playing after level 23. Thanks,              Zombie			"

								SCORE: 7.5/10super fun game, action packed hack and slash loot frenzy enjoyment :), great graphics with tons of details and atmosphere, great sounds and music, awesome progression and very enjoyable effects, all the stuff you want.gameplay is great, fun and hectic, in short you place defence objects and gun towers, upgrade them over time and kick♥♥♥♥♥with your RPG kind of character. lots of fun.downsides:the game constantly have to be connected to the server, even in private mode and taverns, meaning you need to join a session just to manage your character, on top of that i did experience a few connection problems and problems leaving a game, which is kind of odd..Loot is great but there is a tad too much crap loot flooding your inventory, a ""sell crap loot"" button would fix this problem :), but hey we all love loot so what the heck :)Ingame purchase, yes this game does have Ingame purchase, it seems to be mostly new character slots and cosmetics etc., i did not find it an limitation doing my 3 hours play, let's hope it stay so :).all in all, this is a great game super fun with great atmosphere, if they keep from transforming it into a pay to win game, i would absolutely play it again and again :)			"

								Dungeon Defenders II is a great take on the tower defense genre, placing you directly into the action in a third person view with 4 distinctive classes and a very satysfying combat system. I have never played dungeon defenders 1 but from what I am seeing with DD2 the dev team must be very commited to making a great game. The company actually gives each player ""influence points"" to use to vote for ideas for the dev team to make a reality in the game world. The campaign is pretty short but the replayability is pretty good, I could farm the same level for hours with the same group and still have a fun time. Discovering combos with different towers is very satysfying and rewarding in the harder stages. Comboing the monks lightning auras with the huntress' geyser traps is my personal favorite. Anyway i am rambling, but this game is definitely worth a buy and I recommend it to anyone who enjoyed DD1 or likes tower defenses.			"

								Loved playing the first game, loved the second one as well. I like to keep my reviews short and simple, so here's my opinion.I did not play this game when it was being released; I've just started playing it recently. The game has kept me intrigued and wanting me to get to the next areas of the campaign. I like to see that the game is being updated as it has a lot of potential mechanics that could be implemented.The mechanics of the game themself seem to be good.There are new Heroes to play as, which at first I was skeptical about. I do think I've grown to like the other heroes as well.In my time of playing I have encountered very few (if any) bugs! (Bugs are nasty)I definitely recommend this game, whether it be played singleplayer or played with friends.			"

								SCORE: 7.5/10super fun game, action packed hack and slash loot frenzy enjoyment :), great graphics with tons of details and atmosphere, great sounds and music, awesome progression and very enjoyable effects, all the stuff you want.gameplay is great, fun and hectic, in short you place defence objects and gun towers, upgrade them over time and kick♥♥♥♥♥with your RPG kind of character. lots of fun.downsides:the game constantly have to be connected to the server, even in private mode and taverns, meaning you need to join a session just to manage your character, on top of that i did experience a few connection problems and problems leaving a game, which is kind of odd..Loot is great but there is a tad too much crap loot flooding your inventory, a ""sell crap loot"" button would fix this problem :), but hey we all love loot so what the heck :)Ingame purchase, yes this game does have Ingame purchase, it seems to be mostly new character slots and cosmetics etc., i did not find it an limitation doing my 3 hours play, let's hope it stay so :).all in all, this is a great game super fun with great atmosphere, if they keep from transforming it into a pay to win game, i would absolutely play it again and again :)			"

								An amazing game that is full of fun, especially when you cooperate with your fellow teammates to build defenses in challenging and entertaining maps. If you are not a team-person and would prefer to get it done in your own way, the private mode is for you! With plenty of improvements from previous patches, the private mode is now more balanced. Although some would expect a tower defense game to be boring, this is far from what you would call spending tedious time to build tedious towers. With a decent variety of maps and an attractive amount of loot, this game can keep you playing on and on. This is not a pay to win game and arguably not even a pay to look good game; after a certain amount of time you can unlock many of the cosmetic items without spending a single dime! If you are into casual tower defense game, look no further.			"

								The greatest choice they made for this game is to make it free to play. It builds on the idea of playing with others and it trully is the way to play Dungeon Defenders with the synergies between classes and different strengths. But it is not finished alot of polish and tweeks is needed so I'll probably pick it up again when it's closer to launch and bug my friends to play with me.			"

								Even in Alpha, this game is amazing. It's improved greatly over the first game; the art direction is fantastic, the way battle flows is more forgiving and challenging at the same time, the division of classes is great, the pet system is fun, being able to sell items in between waves...! There are just so many different little touches that are amazing! If you like Tower Defense, there is no reason not to play Dungeon Defenders II.			"

								Not to long ago I started playing this game and before this I played ""Dungeon Defenders"" more than I probably should have. So far compared to the first one this is okay, but things are starting to look up as we head on into some of the higher builds of the alpha test build. I main Apprentice and I'm level 32 and I'm enjoying the game quite a bit. though the EXP much like Dungeon Defenders 1 levels 60-70 is a bit rediculous. I would say the tutorial is a bit rough (needs to be more in detail) and I also think that monks need a better set of skills. you can not possibly go 1-30 solo. it's imposible. but this is just my opinion. I've played and beat the campaign and I do hope that you will make DLC's for it to make it actually worth playing after level 23. Thanks,              Zombie			"

								The tutorial did no tutoring. I was left with no idea of what to do and no way to go back to the tutorial. The game play is, in my opinion, horrible. You are supposed to place defensive fortifications but I could not place any. There are supposed to be other players on the mission but there were not. Objects claim that they can be activated by pressing the E key. They do not respond.  I uninstalled it. "

The price is a bit high for an early access game but it's working very smoothly and with friends it's a lot of fun but also a nice challenge alone :)There is a in game shop as well where you can buy Gems to buy new costumes and such.But as for right now it's not pay to win :))			"

Early Access Review
								Dungeon Defenders II is a tower defense game. It has a lot of features like items, different characters, leveling system both for characters and items, pet system, and so on. There are premium contents too like extra character slots, costumes, etc. You can play with four players at a time, and you can combine your skills to get the best setup for the map and defeat the enemies. Also, there are monthly and daily missions for rewards like pet eggs, money or items. Sometimes these missions undoable because you don't have that character or you don't have enough item power. The only disadvantage is that the game is still in development, so there are little bugs, and there are lots of updates. You can have a really good time and if you have some money I recommend you to buy extra character slots so you can easily solo almost every maps/level.			"

								after about 5 hours on my own, I thought this game wouldn't be as fun as the first one was if you're playing solo, so i didn't play it for about a month or 2. i just recently hopped back into this game and the changes they made were nice. a new social  ""tavern"" if you want which is essentialy like a small town. And i convinced a friend of mine to play this game with me and we had loads of fun, i made a new character (although my old one was about lvl 18 already) and it felt like a complete new experience when you're playing with friends. Also, playing solo isn't that boring anymore.Pros:- Very stable performance, although this is still in alpha- Fun to play with you friends- Tons of gear dropping from enemies- looks beautifully- No real P2W functions and heroes can be bought with so called hero tokens (i believe) which you get while playing- ridiculous ammount of weapons available, all with different stats- Skins look cool as hell- Free to playCons:- Not very fun to play in solo, but much more than before- quite a few bugs- collecting these hero tokens can take quite a whileOverall, I'll give this game a solid 8.5/10And since i know tendy they'll include much more content to the game later on and fix all bugsFor me, personally, it's at least as fun as the first one is.The only thing I'm waiting for now are the Turkey Hunts :D			"

								Its a good game, In comparison to Dungeon Defenders, Not so much but its a different approach to the Tower Defense genre especially for Trendy, gotta give the props for trying it out and sticky with it. So basically the game gets boring pretty quick I've been playing since the first day its out and the way they keep changing loot tables is annoying but over all 8.5/10 is nice since its f2p. If anyone wants to add me and play feel free.			"

								If you like Tower Defense and FPSes, DD2 is a great game for you.  It is very different from DD1 and sure, there's a lot of people out there feeling that the gear curve is very linear in nature and there are only certain builds that matter - but the game itself remains a very fun game to play.Trendy continues to release regular improvements to the game - new maps, new heroes, bug fixes - and for the few glitches that remain, the game itself is highly enjoyable.Level up your characters to 50 and then the game really starts as you try to defeat the hardest difficulties to get the best gear in the game.  The social elements of the game still need a pretty solid bump in a better direction - most of the community seems a bit cold and stand-offish - but if you can make a few friends, the game gets a bit crazy, a lot more fun and actually even easier to win alongside other players! :)			"

Early Access Review
								Another game which has become P2W so suprisingly(!).. I loved the first dungeon defender, i guess it may be in my top 5 games list, but on the other hand this game has become seriously sucking. At the begginig of early access you have to pay to get this game which was a good beggining from my perspective, some times later it has become f2p and i got sad a bit but they have given some micro trans stuff to players to use in-game products. It was fine for me but after a while they put the new characters on sale over the game-money and the 3000 some kind of moey they give us would only be enought to buy only 2 characters which is totally unacceptable... Im writing this to show the bad evaluation of the game since the first df and the reason im writing this to here is to show how bad this game has beome and why you shouldnt buy it !!Have a good day...

								This GAME is amazing tho on early access and Alpha stage. The graphic's for the game are mind blowing for a Alpha Stratergy Rpg game. You have 4 characters to choose from Squire, Archer, Apprentice and The Monk. They all have their own unique Skills + Traps. I mean yes there are alot of Negative review's and I can understand why but I find that this is one of the best Alpha stage RPG game that existed (well that is what I see). The game has many levels in it, and the difficulty get's harder everytime you get a new enemy/boss/flying enemies/Etc so yea you wont get bored of it anytime soon. I hope this review helps some people who are looking for a good fairly cheap RPG game. Hope this will help.			"

								I loved the original DD so it was a no brainer to spend some dough to support the team making DD2. The game looks good, the same colorful quality that was so enjoyable about the first game. Collecting gear, raising pets and hacking and slashing your way through hoards of rather cute goblins and ogres? Yep, got that too.  It's still in pre-alpha so there's a lot of game rebalancing and renovating going on pretty frequently.What it is missing for me is that feeling I got in DD where I put up a few traps or towers in just the right spots and I become god of the level. They haven't fine tuned it to that level yet but I'm hopeful. All in all, it is a true successor to the original and worth a play.			"

								I loved the oringinal  Dungeon Defenders so much, that when I saw it was on Steam I bought it immediantly while, also gifting it to a friend who also loved the game, to play also which came up to a total of one hundred dollars. After playing the game for a while I decided to give time for a few updates to come out to renew the hype. Then when I noticed it was in the Free to Play section of Steam, that acually bumbed me out to see that the game I spent alot of money on, others get to play for free just so that they can add pay to win features in the game doesn't seem all that fair to me. I would love if they were to send me a refund for the hundred dollars I spent to buy the game, but I know they won't. Plus the entire basics of the the game that revolved around the towers are gone. Now it all about ugrading your hero because your towers are useless just like single player in this broken game.			"

								(Alpha Review) It's fun and average battle length is 10-20 mins meaning you can do a quick one or a marathon.  Loot is starting be show diversity and progression is coming along.  Battles are very easy right now, maybe too easy but there are harder difficulties.There is no Pay to Win to be seen.For the future, I hope they increase the difficulty somewhat and avoid the power creep Dungeon Defenders 1 had by making Nightmare battles simply have the same loot drops as Insane but with increased rarity chance. As a note, still concerned with the pricing of the costumes however they have gotten a bit cooler and the price means that you're more likely to have a Unique look.			"

								This is a game where you want to play with your friends and talk around a tactic to win, altough you may get a team that actually is into planning and thinking about what to do to get a win in social queue, it is very rare. Most of the time you just get guys who play on theyr own, don't communicate and go everywhere stealing  other lanes green mana just to boost their own defenses. So 7/10 Multiplayer with friends and 1/10 Multiplayer with randoms.Altough the game is only on Alpha, I think some more variety of Legendary Items should be released, It is quite a bit boring that you always get the same skin of legendary over and over. I believe the game has potential, but until the release if nothing changes, I don't think I will still recommend it.			"

								It's super fun but it HATES being alt+tabbed and sometimes opening the steam overlay will literally softlock you and the game won't accept any input.Needs work- polishing, balancing, and all sorts of fine tuning, but it's an okay game I guess. Also, SUMMONER WHEN? LITERALLY THE BEST CHARACTER FROM 1 GIVE IT TO ME, GIVE ME SUUUUUUMMONEERR EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE			"

								4 STARS out of 5 STARS If u you were a fan of DD1, you will like this game. ( i played DD1 on xbox and PC, and i have put many, many hours into them. DD2, is fun but not AS fun as DD1. For first timers to the series, i reccomend you go play DD1.) There is much more content in DD2, as well as graphics look stunning. I reccomend you play DD1, but DD2 is free to play and is enjoyable.			"

								Game is fun, so at a minimum it has that going for it. Standard loot grind keeps you invested in gearing up your characters. Varied enough feeling maps, but leveling up is very restricted to only a few worthwhile choices. The tower defense part is the more fun and interesting aspect for me personally, sometimes I just want to be able to sit back and let my towers do the work - you can't really do this if you're trying to actively gear up at the same time. So anyone looking for ONLY tower defense might not like it that much. As I said before, it's a fun game if you like the genre(s) and gear treadmill gameplay.And about the DLC. It's not as bad as some people make it out to be. First, for anyone who was totaling up the amount or cost - you absolutely do not need to buy every one to enjoy the game. You really don't need to buy any for that matter. I've gotten 3 of the cheapest options so far - 1 was a purely cosmetic costume pack on sale - and don't regret supporting the devs who are transparently working on the game, and I also feel like if I hadn't bought any I'd be at the same level of enjoyment. That seems like DLC done well to me.Just a warning though, I would strongly recommend holding off on the Inventory pack - they have changed up loot drops quite a bit and recently you get MUCH LESS LOOT (not a complaint because the overall quality of each piece is better), MAKING INVENTORY SPACE LESS NEEDED OVERALL. It's the only purchase I regret from this game, although it did get me extra 2 hero slots to use whenever I want, plus some gems. But hero slots are also something I would not recommend at all until you've already leveled 4 characters completely			"

								Have you ever wanted a game where the community isn't entirely d1cks or a game where you can do what you please as long as you have a full lobby? Then look no further because Dungeon Defenders 2 has it all! Strategic boss fights when you are actually a lower level than the boss (being under level for any fight is fun as hell), lot's of difficulty selections (Freeplay with easy, normal, and hard then there's Endgame with hard, insane, Nightmare 1 - Nightmare 4) each difficulty has their perks. The harder the level the better the loot. The Devs take care of bugs when you tell them about it which is useful as all hell, and as I said before the community isn't full of total d0uche bags. Play this game you won't regret it!			"

I really love this game! Why you ask?-Pros;Every Class has something to offer and there are many ways to build your character(s)It's not P2W.After u hit level 50 you get 3 new gamemodes called Endgame gamemodes. Almost everybody speaks English.Almost no toxic players, everybody is nice to one annother.-Cons;If u get damaged, your screen whill bug out with white and black flashes.The game is not fully optimized, it can lagg from time to time, especially with Squire/Mage towers.-If you haven't played this game.....-Your missing out!

								The Campaign is fun but a bit short for now. For an alpha acceptable.+ The Real Fun starts with the Nigthmare difficulty, i am happy for every progress+ For the alpha state of the game it is really smooth playable+ Many different kind of Weapons, Armor, Pets & Collectables+ Events [Halloween as example]+ Monthly Quests that cant be finished in 1 Hour+ The Developers working really well with the community+ Gameplay is Fun+ Its hard to play Solo but also not easy in a Group- Balancing with the IPWR is a big issue until now- Matchmaking [Some peops want to just get carried]- Hard to play SoloI am looking forward to play this game with new content in the later states of the game.

								Disappointed is the first impression I got.  Why?  It is a dumbed down sequel to the original.  The game forces you to play with others that may or not be ahead of you in power and basically taking the fun from challenge away.   The graphics seem to be less in quality to the first game. Buy the first game... They did good things there.			"
