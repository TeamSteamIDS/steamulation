												I enjoyed Costume Quest quite a bit, until I reached a game-breaking bug, two hours in. More on that in a bit.Costume Quest is a streamlined RPG. It's a fun game, but not particularly difficult. The combat is a simplistic timing game, and the quests have a way of fulfilling themselves as you wander around the map. But that's OK, because Costume Quest doesn't present itself as a serious RPG.I's a breezy, light RPG with a sense of humor, that begs to be played straight through in a sitting. Truely, it's an RPG/Platformer hybrid, in that there are environmental puzzles that must be worked out to advance the map and the story. It's a mix that works....until you come to the Autumn Haven shopping mall. There's a game-breaking bug in the camping equipment store: If you walk between the sleeping bag and the tent, your companion will follow you into that wedge, and block you in. None of your special skills will get you out of this position. If this happens to you, don't exit to the menu! Crash the game manually, so it doesn't have a chance to autosave your position. If it saves your position, you'll be stuck there when you start again, and you'll have to start over from the beginning of the game. Seriously. Check the Steam forums, I'm not the only one with this problem.So, yes. I like Costume Quest, and I think you will, too. I want to complete this game, but I don't want to replay the first two hours again. I give Costume Quest a thumbs up, but be careful in the mall so you don't lose your game like I did.			"

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Costume Quest Original Release: 2011 Genre Tags: RPG; Casual; Adventure; Lighthearted    My Overall Grade: A- Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 5-10 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Casual gamersREVIEWCostume Quest has a lot of good things going on for it.  The game takes you on a journey of the imagination as some children’s quest for candy on one Halloween night quickly turns into something much more.  Ultimately, this game is just very well done and has a “soul” that should easily appeal to a vast audience.The level design is charming and exploring the maps is fun.  The whole concept of “trick-or-treating” being a fundamental part of the gameplay is brilliantly done.  The story is basically one giant trope, but the way it is told is delightful.  The characters are likeable and the humor is clean but entertaining.  Even the style in which you warp into old-school, turn-based battles is executed well and synergizes perfectly with the atmosphere of the game.  This game is a quintessential example of how several good things can work together to create something great.    As I alluded to, one of the most charming aspects of Costume Quest is the way “trick-or-treating” in the game world is a central part of progressing the game.  You knock on doors and are either given candy (treat) or have to fight a battle (trick).  This leads to another splendidly charming feature of the game, which I also alluded to earlier: the battle warp-ins.  Depending on what costumes your characters are wearing, they change from little kids into various gallant warriors with nothing but the power of their imagination.  From there, the battles play out in the old-school, turn-based RPG style that was prevalent in the 90s.Aside from that, you may also want to explore the levels, find secret areas, meet characters, and do side-quests and mini-games to gather more candy and collect the trading cards.  There is plenty to do!Costume Quest is a charming little game that makes for quite an enjoyable experience.  As I said, I feel it can appeal to a wide audience.  I would posit: if it sounds like the type of game you may enjoy, it will probably be a specific game you do enjoy… if you decide to get it.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

												Really cute and fun little game. It‘s pretty short as rpg, but you‘ll have a fun time playing it. It‘s simple and pretty easy. You play as the kids, form your party and collect candies and costume parts made of cardborad. When the fight starts you‘re being transformed into your costumes (robot, ninja, knight etc.) and the fight begins. Fight system is generic turn based rpg system but it doesn‘t need to be different. Seriously go and buy it, it‘s really really good game i promise you will fall in love with this little cute gem :)			"

In short, is the game good?Yes, the game is really good.Is it worth my time and money?Depends. While the game is very fun to play, it is kind of short. You can breeze through the main game in about 4 hours. The add-on story is about 2 hours. I'd suggest waiting for at least a small price drop or sale.Is this game for anyone?Yes. The game doesn't require any specific gaming skills and can be enjoyed by anyone.Linear, open-world or something else?While the world of Costume Quest is technically open-world (that is, you are not restricted to a ""rail"", moving from A to B), the world itself is so small, it still forces the player to simply move on when the player finishes up quests in the area.Gameplay mechanics, gimmicks?It's basically Halloween meets Final Fantasy meets Persona meets Super Mario RPG meets Tim Schafer. It sounds weird on paper but it works. When in battle, your Halloween costume changes into the real thing (i.e. a cardboard robot costume changes into a real giant mecha). Additionally, each costume grants the person wearing it special attacks. Battles are turn-based, which are usually pretty slow-paced, but thanks to pretty good animation design, attack animations are fast, fluid, and don't leave the player bored while waiting for the enemy attacks to end.Graphical aesthetics, set pieces and world design?Even though the world in Costume Quest is pretty small, it is crafted with much attention to detail. The cartoony look only adds charm to the whole aesthetic.Audio design and soundtrack?Audio design is impressive. The soundtrack consists of generic Halloween-ish songs but with a few twists. Sometimes the music will actually take a sinister turn, bringing forth really creepy humming, drones, etc. A nice touch that hits the player off-guard.Plot, story?Brother and sister go trick-or-treating. One of them gets kidnapped. Sounds generic? It isn't - that's all I can say without spoilers.How does the game run?Runs perfectly fine on my 5 year old PC (Dual-Core 2.66GHz, GeForce 9600GT, 2GB RAM). No stuttering, no framerate issues, everything turned on except for SSAO (which is known to be a resource hog on older machines).Any details, character, motif, etc. you particularly liked?The costumes in battle form and their special attacks. No other game will let you have a yeti, a giant black cat and the Statue of Liberty as your party. Anything you didn't like?Yes, a few things. The music in the add-on story is of lower quality for some reason. The Battle Stamp system could be a bit more complex. Finally, the static camera can be annoying at times (especially in the early part of the game where you're navigating through suburbs). Final score?I give Costume Quest a coffin with candy in it out of 5. "

												Costume Quest is a cute, creative, charming, simple to play, easy to master RPG set in Halloween. There is definitely a sense of atmosphere that is set with the colors, lighting and art style. You'll wander through a neighborhood, a mall and a carnival. Everything is beautiful and charming with a slight spooky edge to some places, but its a charming spooky not a horrific kind. After you select a gender, you are quickly thrown into the story. Your sibling has been kidnapped by goblins that need candy and since the sibling is wearing a giant candy corn costume you understand how mistakes can be made.Speaking of candy, you'll find it everywhere, because its the currency of the game. In the map there is an attack button to knock candy out of objects. You'll find candy after battles, in treasure coffins, completing quests and you'll trick-or-treat for it going door to door. Of course there's not always a stranger giving candy, sometimes it a goblin that results in a battle.In battles, you're not just kids in costumes, you become giants. Your little cardboard robot costume turns into a towering robot, a french-fry costume becomes a mega fry crab, a statue of liberty costume becomes the statue of liberty! So its a little pretend, and thankfully the game lets you skip transformation animations to start each battle.The combat is really simple and very well animated. First your entire team completes a turn, from the leader of the party to the last member. Then the enemies will each take a turn. You have a limited selection of what to do, attack or a special power every 3 turns. Different costumes have different basic attacks, each with its own way of getting a critical hit. Timing, to press a button or key at a specific moment, others have you wiggling the analog stick, others have you button mashing the same button or key. It keeps you watching the battles and make the long animations feel like less tedious to watch. The special skills range from damaging all enemies, healing all allies, majorly damaging one enemy, hiding an ally and other things depending which costume you're wearing.When the enemies attack, you'll be given a chance to lessen the attack with a quick button press. These button presses are different each time, which is nice, but I feel like even timed correctly, there's still a chance the block won't be successful. Some enemies really telegraph their attacks, such as jumping into the air with a strike. Enemies don't just attack, they'll cast heal, shield, strength and fire. Everything you've seen in RPGs before, but this is just simple.The enemies don't have too much variety, goblins, big goblins and ravens, but each 'race' can have a 'class.' The graphics look great and they are in full 3D, its just there aren't that many of them. Each enemy has a level, which is good, but early on in the game enemies feel far too overpowered when you have a party of 2 characters. You'll never have a party more than 3, but neither will the enemy party.When you are on the map, you can see enemies march around, so there really aren't any random battles other than the trick-or-treat battles. You can even sneak up behind map enemies and attack them so when the battle begins, all enemies take a small amount of damage. Its a nice feature in what can be tedious, thoughtless battles. Every battle seems to play out the same no matter what enemy classes you face. You just need to time everything correctly and sit through your special ability animations.You can also buy stamps that you can equip to each of your characters that will give them added benefits such as dodging, more HP, regenerating HP, counter attacks, higher attack damage, higher critical damage, a stun skill, the ability to poison a foe or damage all foes next to the target. These simple stamps do a lot to really personalize the game and I feel like you need the stamps to succeed in the game.When party members fall in battle, they're back after the battle. Everyone gets full health after every battle. In fact, when your party gets wiped out. You just respawn back on the map next to the enemy that killed you. There is no consequence for failure in the game and I feel the game is smoother because of it.Every battle gives you experience points, but so does completing quests. Since the enemies are limited, so is the experience. So that's why I had to turn to stamps in order to win battles and even then a lot of battles seemed like only luck got me through the first two hours of battles. There is also a level cap on your party and you don't level up individual characters, but rather the entire party.On the map you'll talk with NPCs and read their little text boxes. The town, mall, carnival and village feel alive. There are plenty of NPCs to give you quests, such as find this or do that. Other costumed kids want non usable items that you'll find from winning battles and some quests have you finding kids that are playing hide and seek. There is even a well done apple bobbing minigame where red apples count as one point to your score and green apples count as 3 points. Its a nice deviation from goblin slaying monotony.Every costume doesn't just have its own special and basic attack, most of them have a practical use on maps. As a robot, you can speed around on your rocket skates to jump off ramps. These rocket skates are the game's run and its so much faster than just walking. The ninja costume can vanish, the fries costume baits people into following you, the knight has a shield to protect you from things overhead and other costumes help too. There is a big variety of costumes and you can find pieces to make new costumes. It adds to the game variety, even if I ended up using the robot for the skates and the statue of liberty for her healing power.In all this is a 5 or 6 hour game that is easy to play and easy to finish after the first two hours. There is even DLC that keeps the game going in a different setting. If it wasn't for the cute charm and the extras like costumes and stamps, I'm not sure I could recommend it because of how dull and mindless the fights became.			"

												Yet again Double Fine surprises me and yet again they manage to make another rather unique and great game. Costume Quest puts you in the role of a young boy who's trying to save his little sister from monsters that invaded their neighborhood on Halloween. You find friends along the way and unlock and craft new costumes. Each costume grants you with a different ability and diferent abilities to use in combat. The combat in Costume Quest it's turn based, very similar to the way Final Fantasy games handle. There's also some perks which you can buy with candy that grant you certain passive abilities such as extra damage or health points recovery after each turn. You'll probably spend alot of your time going around the place smashing stuff and the more fun, knocking on people's doors (Trick or Treat) and sometimes you'll get candies from the people that live on those houses and sometimes a monster will open the door for you and you'll jump into combat, that's pretty much how you collect candy which is used as a currency in Costume Quest. Visually, I think the game looks pretty neat, a rather unique cartoony looking which I really like, I also found the monster design to be rather funny. Other than that, the game has no voice acting, it's all text based and the story is certainly entertaining. In the end, Costume Quest was made by Double Fine and that alone puts it up on a great position, per say. You'll definitely get both your time and money worth on this. Just one last thing, the Steam version of Costume Quest also includes the DLC Grubbins on Ice which takes place, and continues, the plot of the base game.			"

												Costume Quest is a simple but well put together party based RPG game. You play the role of a child who is obsessed with halloween, and spends the night going around the neighborhood trick or treating to get his candy. At the beginning of the game, your twin sister is kidnapped and you embark on your journey to rescue her. Along the way you make friends with other trick or treaters who join your party. While you are walking around the world, you are able to pick up extra candy, talk to the residents of the town and start battles with the bad guys. The combat system in Costume Quest is turn based, each of your characters will have their own costume which all have different powers. The combat is also primarily quick time events, which is normally not something I am a fan of, but it works quite well here. The graphics are nothing special, but they do look pleasing and the cartoon style is something which fits the story and setting nicely. Sadly the audio in Costume Quest lets it down, there isn't any voice acting, and very little sound effects when you are walking around the world.The game is set across four different levels, each of them has their own theme and style, with lots of different items and hidden locations to find in each of the levels, they feel plumped out and interesting to explore. I didn't find there to be any difficulty, you can complete the game without being beaten once, so maybe a New Game+ mode would of fixed that. I'm not sure why Steam has counted me having sixteen hours, as the game took me about five hours to complete along with the majority of all the side missions and achievements. I only really ran into one technical issue, and that was frame rate, the Steam in game counter shows it running at 30 fps while walking around the world, while in the combat phases, this jumps up to 60 fps. I noticed some screen tearing with v-sync off, but this also may be an issue with my rig (I don't think it is considering the specs I run), but it was nothing major. I can recommend Costume Quest, because I had a really good time playing, and it has a different take on the party based games, and for the full price of £6,99, you can't go wrong with the amount of content that is included. If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up. You can also find more reviews over at http://www.completingthebackloggroup.com/ "

												Overall: Costume Quest is a cute and adorable game about the complicated relationship siblings have with each other, set against the backdrop of one of my favorite holidays: Halloween. While the battles in the game tend to become tiresome at some point, the game is short enough (both stories) to not become overbearing. The game doesn't try to be more than it is, and is definitely worth the playthrough. Recommendation is to get it on sale as it's been bundled several times. However, if you're in a position to pay full price, please do as the devs deserve it. Rating: 9/10 - Details belowStory: In my opinion the story was absolutely fantastic. Humor was there and though I'm not a twin, I do have a younger sister and I appreciated the sibling rivalry though I'm ancient these days. Though the main idea is to rescue someone, and though that's not very original in stories these days, it was a well told story that kept me very entertained. Further, it allowed me to revisit the child inside me and remember that power of imagination and what can be accomplished and believed in. Graphics: Though I'm not a huge fan of cel style animation, I was extremely pleased with this medium with this game. Too many details would have ruined the power of the children's imagination and the softer non-detailed aspect of cel animation felt like it lent power to the story rather than taking away from it. Controls: Simple and easy. No issues there. - NOTE: I used an Xbox One controller.Sounds & Music: All basically well done. I didn't play with other music and felt like it complimented the game rather well.Gameplay: One tiny issue was that the battles started to feel like they were more of jumping through hoops than accomplishing anything worthwhile. However, this probably has more to do with my lack of patience for grinding/leveling in games in general as I get older. Honestly, the game didn't drag at all really, and without the unknown of what knocking on the door would do, the game would lose part of the ""Trick"" aspect so essential to Halloween. Only real complaint is that I couldn't advance the text faster during dialogue and was forced to sit and wait though I'd completed reading the sentence. Nor could I pause the dialogue if something came up. Final Notes: Forcing me to read at one speed as I read fast, is something that definitely will annoy me. That being said, it's a very solid game that is worth the time and energy if you enjoy Halloween, sibling rivalry and the imagination of children. If you can afford to pay full price and want to support a good game, do so.			"

												In the glorious words of the immortal Ernest P. Worrell I bring you these words of advice.. ""Pretty soon the kids won't have to worry about eating their Brussel sprouts because the Brussel sprouts will be eating them.""Exchange the word Brussel sprouts with candy corn and you'll understand the game of Costume quest, a cute Halloween themed adventure game from the wonderful team at Double Fine entertainment.  The same group responsible for such classics as Psychonauts and Brutal Legend (Jack Black playing a rock and roll roadie.... YES PLEASE)  In this game you play as Reynold and Wren a pair of twins who have recently moved to a new neighborhood, it's Halloween night and they are planning on going trick or treating.   After selecting which sibling you want to control, either Wren, the 10 minute older sister or Reynold the 10 pound heavier member of the dynamite duo, you are shipped off into the world.  The selected sibling gets a Robot custom, the other gets dressed as a piece of Candy Corn..  Social norms be damned if you pick the female character..  who says females aren't into Robots :-D  certainly not me.  (It was here where the first bit of disbelief struck me, the parents allowed their twin children to leave the house unaccompanied to go trick or treating in a new neighborhood.  These are two children who appear to be 8 - 9 years old, wandering the streets of a new neighborhood on Halloween night which is a night when child predators are normally tremendously on the prowl looking for victims.  Furthermore, after the sibling you didn't pick gets literally kidnapped, instead of running home, or screaming for help  or literally anything we've been teaching children to do for the last 30 years, they decide to go on a crazy adventure to find the sister to avoid punishment.  Just a quick note, a police officer is literally a twenty or thirty feet away away from the abduction site...)  soap box offAfter trick or treating at the first house, the pair try a second, only this time the candy corn gets abducted by a candy stealing grubbin monster...  OH MY!!!..   So off we go on an adventure to rescue our sister/brother from the clutches of a nasty candy stealing evil corporation, I'm talking a really dirty nasty organization we haven't seen in video games since Umbrella corporation..   Along the way to rescue your sibling you meet new friends, discover a sinister plot to steal candy, and defeat some monsters making for an amazing Halloween adventure which can be enjoyed at any time of year. The Story I pretty much described the story above, siblings, candy, stealing, adventure.  The story takes place in three locations, Auburn Pines, which is the starting neighborhood, Autumn Haven Mall (easy enough it's a Mall), and Fall Valley carnival, each area offers up the chance to explore, trick or treat, bob for candy apples, defeat monsters and oh yeah... get that sweet, sweet candy baby.. nuff said!!! The Gameplay The first aspect the gamer is introduced to is trick or treating, which is just as it sounds, you go up to a house, knock on the door and wait for a trick (battle) or a trick (candy)  It's as simplistic as that.  Knocking on doors isn't the only way to collect candy, numerous interactive objects in the environment such as mailboxes, trashcans, shrubs, etc etc etc, can be pounded on by your candy pail in an attempt to wriggle loose a few extra pieces of candy, also numerous areas have candy thrown about on the ground...  I personally wouldn't pick up candy off the ground and eat it, but hey whatever floats my characters boat.  The game features three types of collectibles, the first is Costumes, you start with the Robot costume, and soon after acquire a knight outfit, others you can collect are the statue of liberty, a unicorn, french fries and many more.  Many of the costumes have two special benefits, the first being an extra ability you can use while out of combat, like the Robot which can travel faster, or the Knight, that can shield from falling items.  The second ability is a special battle ability, whether it's rockets, a shield of protection or a powerful group heal.  The second type of collectible in the game are battle cards, these cards can be used to further enhance your character, give them additional HP, defense, a stun, etc etc etc, you can buy the cards from Sadie using the candy you collect during your adventure.  With each new area, additional cards are added for you to buy, the new cards offer upgrades over the older cards.  These are very useful in helping to gain the advantage in your battles to come.  The final collectibles are called treat cards, these resemble trading cards, they really serve no purpose, outside of being necessary to complete a few quest and unlocking a costume for collecting all of them.   You gain treat cards by defeating enemies and completing quest.The Combat The combat in Costume Quest is rather unique, upon starting the battle your given one option to select basic attack (unless you have a battle card which gives you a secondary option like a stun)  after selecting that option you're taken into a quick time event.  If you succeed in the quicktime event your character does extra damage, if you fail, your character does quite a bit less damage.  During the enemy phase of combat, when an enemy attacks one of your characters, you're given another quick time event, if you are successful you defend some of the damage and minimize the damage you receive, if you fail the quick time event the enemy a significant amount of extra damage.Special ability's   -  those special abilities each costume has I mentioned above are useful here, after three combat turns each of your character unlocks their costumes special ability, this can be anything from from protection, heals, massive damage to a single or all enemies.  It's a good idea to mix and match your party to ensure you have all your bases covered in terms of combat, defense and healing.  A good defense is a good offense makes sense in this case.  It's especially important to include some type of healing for your party, as no healing exist outside of special ability or battle cards.  The combat sounds simplistic and it is, but the quick time events keep the gamer engaged and on their seat with each successive battle, letting your guard down can and probably will result in you suffering a defeat. Pro's Good story,interesting charactersunique combat systemvery fun to playeasy to 100% if you're into achievementscontroller support Con's Can be a bit too easy with the right combination of costumes/battle cardsSlightly repetitive enemiesoccasionally controls can glitch out Recommendation I'd highly recommend this game, on paper it looks rather simplistic, it seems to have many strikes against it from a gamer's perspective prior to even installing it, but trust me on this one, once you start playing and get into the story you'll be thoroughly entertained as I was.  A fun game to play and enjoy, once you start to play you'll want to keep playing until you finish the the story.  It can be a bit difficult to get into, especially when you realize you'll be playing with children as characters, but that's part of the charm, a person of any age can kick back and enjoy the thrills and exciting of going trick or treating once again..  (without having your neighbors call you a cheapskate ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for trying to collect candy from them)  I'd really suggest taking the plunge, buying the game, collecting the candy and saving Halloween for children and adults all across the world..

												Costume Quest is a fun little RPG from the folks at Double Fine. You play as one of two suburbanite siblings (brother or sister) on a quest to save the other from monsters on Halloween, but the only way to do that is by trick or treating, getting candy, and crafting more costumes, naturally. From start to finish, this game does a great job in recreating the wonder and excitement of Halloween that we all remember from when we were little. You're not in costume as a robot, you ARE a robot. Each costume transforms the character into what the costume represents when you enter combat, a brilliant idea that makes you feel like your imagination is making it happen, as it did as kids. Each costume gives you different stats, 1 special move in combat, and some also have special abilites on the world map that you need to use to progress in a puzzle like way, though I am disappointed that the different costumes look the same regardless of which party member is wearing them.This game oozes personality with its fantastic writing and entertaining characters. It creates a fun world that is both whimsical and believable and for that, Double Fine deserves a lot of credit. The game consists or 3 zones (for the normal game and 1 additional zone for the expansion Grubbins on Ice) that are each varied, noticeably distinct and very well realized. You start in the most familiar of places and gradually move to the more fantastic. The further you progress gives a feeling of going deeper down the rabbit hole. It's an adventure that, once finished, leaves you glad you made the journey.This game is not perfect though. As with most turn based RPGs, the combat can get repetitive, and the system is rather shallow. There are only 3 choices in combat, basic attack, special move, and stamp attack. The special move is only available every 3rd turn and the stamp attack only exists if you have an ability stamp equipped so most of the time you will be using basic attack and each costume only has one animation for each battle option. Though combat incorporating timed button presses to strike harder or deflect some of an attack aids in keeping the player focused. Those same presses lead to another complaint: the default keyboard mapping is a bit strange and even movement felt a bit clunky on the keyboard; once I switched to an XBox 360 controller, the controls felt great and much more natural.Another minor complaint is that sometimes the text goes by too fast (automatically) and you may miss a line here or there, which can be disappointing as the writing is a big part of what makes the game so enjoyable, but that's just a nitpick.Also I wish the game were a bit longer, I managed to 100% complete the game in around 7 and a half hours. I wouldn't say the length is a con, more that I enjoyed playing and hated for it to end.Overall: A great game with a great story, writing and atmosphere. It manages to accomplish exactly what it sets out to do. Could some things have been a bit better? Sure, but that can be said about most games out there. I'd give it 8.5/10			"

												NOTE: This is a shortened review without screenshots.For my full review, please visit  Real Gamer Reviews[realgamerreviews.com]Costume Quest is a Halloween-themed, turn-based RPG developed by Tim Schafer’s crew at Double Fine Productions. For those who don’t know, Tim Schafer is the mastermind behind critically acclaimed (but not necessarily financially successful) games such as Psychonauts, Grim Fandango, Full Throttle and more recently, Broken Age. In many ways, I feel that Tim Schafer is the Tim Burton of video games. Whilst not all of his games (or in Burton’s case, movies) are necessarily fantastic, all of them share a common, whimsical and imaginative style with a quirky sense of humour. Therefore, going in, I had big expectations going into this game. Needless to say, given the big red thumbs down above this review, these expectations weren’t quite met.Story:The game takes place on Halloween, where you (the character that you pick) and your sister/brother (the character that you didn’t pick) go out trick-or-treating, only to have your sibling kidnapped by strange monsters. You effectively spend the rest of the game in an attempt to rescue said sibling. There are three major locations to explore, including your initial suburb, a mall and … another suburb with a fair. Simple, straightforward, and not a whole lot more to say than that. Gameplay:As previously stated, Costume Quest is largely a turn-based RPG. Unlike many other turn-based RPGs such as Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest, battles are not random encounters. Instead, they are generally triggered by either knocking on doors (“trick or treating”) or walking into a wandering enemy. A large majority of the enemies that you face in the game are compulsory, as you are required to “trick or treat” every house in each area in order to move to the next area.The “class system” in the game is determined by the costume that each character is wearing. Each costume has a normal attack (which to my knowledge is the same regardless of which costume you use) and a special attack, which you can use every 3 turns, which each have their own unique abilities. This usually consists of extra damage, healing, armour or some negative effect on the enemy (such as stun). You initially begin with one character with the Robot suit. As you progress through the game, you unlock more characters (maximum of 3) and costumes (of which there are many). Unfortunately, despite the large number of costumes, many of the characters play very similarly and largely fall into 3 major classes – a fighter that deals damage, a healer and a character that provides buffs. This is exacerbated by the fact that, apart from one single boss fight (in which you are constantly reminded to use a particular sort of character), you can more or less run through the entire game without changing your costumes at all. The battles themselves play out similarly to most turn-based RPGs, with the notable addition of timing-based button prompts, which will be familiar to people that have played Paper Mario or The Mario and Luigi RPG series on handheld Nintendo systems. The prompts for each attack depend on the costume that each character is using, and successfully completing these will lead to additional damage (when on offence) or reduced damage (on defence). These prompts include things such as pressing a button immediately, pressing it at a certain time, twirling your left stick around or mashing a button repeatedly. Although these do add some depth to the battle system, in the sense that you can’t entirely fall asleep at the wheel and just mash A repeatedly, it still remains far too shallow and far too easy. I am practically an old man when it comes to gaming, and even with my old-man reflexes, I managed to hit approximately 99% of the prompts without any trouble. Winning the battles awards you with which is used to level up (which increases HP and strength) and candy, which is the currency in the game used to purchase stamps, which can be equipped to your characters to give bonuses, such as increased damage/defence, splash damage and so on. Once you’ve reached the level cap and/or have purchased all of the stamps (both of which I did prior to finishing the game), there’s no longer any purpose to the battles, making the already cumbersome and tedious battles just that much worse. The rest of the game is padded with tedious fetch-quests, hidden-object finding and an awfully unoriginal and unimaginative mini-game. Worst of all, you are required to do these same activities each time you move to a new area. Most (but not all) of the costumes that you unlock have a secondary ability that can be used outside of the battle. The Robot suit, for example, has rollerblades which allow you to travel faster (which is generally why you’ll spend most of your time in this suit) and travel up ramps, leading you to so-called “hidden areas”. The other costumes have abilities that are, for the most part, used once in a particular part of the game (most of which is right after you obtain the costume) and then never necessary again. As a result, most of these abilities seem really tacked-on, which is a real shame as I feel like they could have done so much more with it.Presentation:First things first – I loved the cartoony art style used for this game. I really have no complaints about the graphics. The characters are cute and the setting is undeniably Halloween. Remember - nothing screams Halloween more than Jack-O-Lanterns and candy, and be warned – there are Jack-O-Lanterns and candy everywhere in this game. The sound and music are, for lack of a better word, appropriately Halloweeney. One thing that they absolutely nailed is the animations used for the battle transitions, in which the cardboard boxes and cheap trousers used to create the children’s costumes are transformed into visually-impressive life-like versions. This will hit all the right spots for anyone that’s worn an awful costume in their younger years and imagined looking so much cooler. With that said, having these animations play out every single time you enter a battle wears out very quickly, which is exacerbated by the fact that there’s no way to skip them.Another major gripe that I had was the complete lack of a map/mini-map. This, coupled with the fact that most of the sub-areas in the game look more or less identical, resulted in me walking around in circles looking for the last house to trick-or-treat, or the last hidden child. By far the biggest hook for this game is the classic Tim Schafer-esque humour and dialogue that we’ve come to expect from Double-Fine. Whilst not every line will necessarily make you laugh out loud, it’s hard not to at least smirk. At the very least, you’ll appreciate the effort that Double Fine has gone through to give each and every character a unique line of dialogue. It should be noted that the game lacks any voice acting, instead opting to go with on-screen text. On one hand, it’s a shame, given how awesome the voice acting has been in some of DF’s earlier (i.e. Psychonauts) or later (i.e. Broken Age) has been. On the other hand, bad voice acting could have destroyed the delivery of the quirky, humorous one-liners. Overall verdict:Overall, the game was largely disappointing. It’s a shame, really, because the quirky presentation and humour really highlighted everything I love about Tim Schafer’s games – it was more everything else that let the game down, most notably the repetitive and shallow gameplay. I can honestly say that during the 8 or so hours that I spent finishing the game (including the DLC), I can’t think of many moments that I actually enjoyed myself.  Therefore, with a heavy heart, I can’t recommend this game to anyone.			"

												What to say? This game is definitely a classic. You play as either the brother or the sister trying to save the other, who is kidnapped by monsters on Halloween as they try to invade this world. You use the power of various costumes along with the powers of friends you meet and have join your party as you progress along to the end. You also collect candy (money) and complete various quests for various people along the way.It's arguably the cutest RPG out there and also happens to be a lot of fun. Although Double Fine has somewhat fallen from grace of late, this game remains a shining example of the sort of excellent games they are capable of producing. Definitely a game that shouldn't be missed or passed over by anybody. Make sure you play this on Halloween, and at least turn it on Christmas Day for a few minutes (you will know why if you do it).A classic, one of the best games out there, and an easy 10/10.			"

												Absolutely adorable game that oozes Doublefine charm. You play as a bunch of kids who get wrapped up in a halloween monster plot to steal all the world's candy. The gameplay is somewhere inbetween the Mario RPG games (Superstar saga, Paper Mario) and South Park Stick of Truth, with your kids actually turning into their costume for the battle. There's a heap of unlockable costumes which act as character classes and a few other clever ways to customise your guys. It's just all round fun.I really wouldn't be surprised if the guys that made Stick of Truth were inspired by this. They're ridiculously similar, in a good way! It's not perfect, but it's a lot of fun. Definitely grabbing the sequel :D			"

												An outstanding Halloween themed adventure, that made my weekend and I am so glad I own this lovely thing.Pros+ Captures the Halloween theme perfectly, very fun to play and takes a lot of time to finish.+ Characters look good, animations are great, and music and sound effects are really awesome.+ A very funny story, and the character's dialogues are really funny and very well-done.+ Very detailed world design and many places to visit.+ Various main and optional quests to do, and so many stuff to find.+ A lot of costumes to make, each with its own ability that can help you proceed to the next place.+ The battles looks great, and their layout and all are good.+ Fun for everyone, suitable for kids or adults.+ Candy candy CANDY.Cons- Weird fps performance, when at a battle or a small cut-scene it locks at 30, but if you press esc and resume it goes back to 60, I am not sure if anyone else is having this problem but it does for me, however it felt normal to me at 30fps.- Battles gets kinda boring and repetitive, you get abilities and stuff to increase your power and new costumes, but the battles are basically the same, good at first but sorta boring near the end.Rating 9/10 without doubt, If it did not have the small fps issue and faster battles it would'v easily gotten 10/10 , because it really is perfect, the story is great, the gameplay is really fun and the dialogues and everything is just perfect, its like watching a Halloween-type movie with a fun story.

												When monsters invade to disrupt the sacred trick-or-treating tradition of Halloween, kidnap your twin, and attempt to steal all the candy that is yours by right, there's nothing to do but turn your costume up to eleven and kick them back into the netherworld from whence they came. Thus is the setup to Costume Quest, a hilarious and creative RPG-lite from Double Fine that is as sweet as the candy you so eagerly collect, despite its gameplay being highly simplified.You spend most of your time exploring the world, collecting costume pieces, and of course knocking on houses with the hope that a bundle of candy will be waiting for you on the other side. There are also a handful of side-quests to complete, most in the form of hide-and-seek games or typical fetching errands. Though in most games I find quests such as these mundane and uninteresting, here they are full of so much humor and charm that it was hard for me to keep from smiling the whole way through.But supposing someone not so nice and full of candy answers the door, then it's time to for some Persona like turn-based combat to occur. This is where gameplay hits a snag, as while fully functional the battle mechanics are extremely basic, revolving almost entirely around quicktime events with little to no variation or strategy to speak of. They are also terribly easy (I failed all but once, and on the final boss no less) which made the few options you are given for altering your character's attacks even less noticeable and necessary. That's not to say battles are completely devoid of fun, as I did enjoy them to an extent, but after only a few hours the repetition becomes grating so much as to have me actively try and avoid encounters (as if the Ninja costume wasn't already awesome enough). Thankfully with the story clocking in at 6-7 hours, it never got so bad as to greatly degrade the experience, and so long as you keep play sessions to short bursts are little more than a minor annoyance.The big head celshaded look works surprisingly well with the theme of the game, making transitions between the lighthearted character models to the much more intricate (and in some cases suitably creepy) characters used for battles seamless, on top of simply being cute. The fixed camera is at times a hassle, but for the most part works well for the style of gameplay and stays out of your mind where it belongs. I do have one odd complaint about the presentation, which is the lack of any music or sound effects for most cutscenes. Even a simple text scrolling sound would have helped, as the way it is now made them feel awkward and drawn out, not to mention greatly reduced the impact of significant plot points.Regardless of any problems I mentioned, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Costume Quest to anyone who has enjoyed a Double Fine game in the past. The writing is comedy gold, the characters lively and likeable, and its concept is completely unique. If you are looking for a complex and involving RPG then you won't find it here, but if you can look past the simple mechanics for the heartfelt adventure underneath it is greatly entertaining and worth playing.

												I can't believe I had this little gem for so long in my library and have not played it.The game is about a brother and sister going trick or treating on Halloween when they come across real monsters who want to steal all the candy in the neighborhood. As one of the siblings is getting abducted by the monsters, the other, sets of to find a way to rescue them. You must go through your neighborhood and collect all the candy from all the houses. Along the way you must:- solve side-quests- battle monsters with your awesome Halloween Costume Superpowers- deal with bullies- make new friends to join your team- find as much candy as possible- find and make new Halloween costumes, each with their own unique special powers on and off the battle fields- collect Halloween Trading Cards you can trade in-game- buy upgrades for your Halloween Costumes- Level up to get stronger and have more health to battle badder enemiesThe game captures the creepy Halloween atmosphere amazingly well with the little background noises, creepy sounds and empty streets, giving it a great feel to it. The Story is very nice, dialogue is well done and the way the game is graphically presented is very cute.The quests are great and dealing with the other kid's problems in the neighborhood is fun too,While the costumes are just costumes during your adventures, during the battles you transform into what ever it is you are wearing.The Battle's are simple but the imagination in regards to how the costumes translate into the ""real"" battle suits, is brilliantly done. I would definitely recommend this game and if you are a parent and have kids they most likely will enjoy playing this with you very much. Depending on the age of your kids the atmosphere might be a little creepy but nothing to serious :)			"

												A great game in all aspects. It is a relaxing change of pace in the gaming world littered with FPS's. Don't let that fool you though ! This is a game which will involve you for the short 6-7 hours it lasts and the boss battles though easier than average will require rudimentary strategy. In all an enjoyable game with leaves you smiling ! I mean, with Glowing Unicorns, Ghost Pirates and even Ninjithsu Scarecrows, there is little chance of going wrong :) What's to Like ?  1. Good story, involving for both young and old.2. Great variety of content for a short game, lots of items and quests.3. Relaxing style of open world gameplay, with exciting battles.4. Achievement Hunters will get 100 % easily.5. Addon ""Grubbins on Ice"" DLC included by default ( Around 1/3 the length of the original game)6. Great cartoonish graphics remniscent of old games such as XIII.7. EXCELLENT PORT RUNS SUPERBLY WITHOUT GLITCHES.What's not that exciting ?1. A little more length of the game would have been nice.2. While the number of quests are nice , it would have been nice to have achievments for some more of them too.3. Although I think that a lack of map is no way detrimental for this particular game, some gamers might think otherwise.What's to hate ?Nothing :) No major flaws.Costume Quest will bring out old memories in you, even if you live in a region where Halloween is not that big of a festival/event. All those childhood fantasies of wearing a make-do costume and pretending to be a bigger robot/ninja/whatever-you-liked is what forms the premise of this game. Evil monsters are here with a sinister plan to rob the world of all its candy!! Your sister, who dressed up as a candy for halloween is abducted by them too. Hence starts your quest to rescue her. You get many costumes along the way, which turn into their big sized fantasy counterparts when you are in battle mode. Some of the fun ones include a burning fire attack Scarecrow, a Pirate that can summon ghost ships and even a glowing Unicorn to heal! You also meet friends along the way to help you in the quests, eventually increasing to a party of 3. Though this game is short, but it does not feel so as it has adequate amount of quests and in game story to keep you attracted for a lazy weekend of playing. There is the main story to follow, the addon DLC, trading cards (in game not steam) to be collected and even battle stamps to be bought with all that cany you collect ! Last but not the least. it rewards you as well with not that difficult to get achievements.The game is open world, with a linear flow, yet is not pushy at all. Humour is present and its of the pleasant kind, not the very obvious or cheesy just-for-kids type. So full marks there too. Battle system is turn based with a system of quick key presses to get the most optimum attack once u have selected your options. Battles are easy for the most part. Later bosses require a little strategy, which while keeping you sufficently involved in the story, are easy enough not to deter the calm flow of the game. In all, a recommended buy. Do not hesitate if you get it on sale.			"

												A hilarious turn-based role-playing game by Double Fine. You play as a trio of over-imaganitive kids going door to door trick-or-treating on a spooky Halloween night. Changing costumes to transform into a giant mech or sparkling unicorn during battles is super comical, and rewarding.The game is obviously inspired by older Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest titles, but contains enough tongue-in-cheek humor and casual-friendly aspects to keep the game entertaining, and not grindy or frustrating. Costume Quest is a short, but sweet game; it only takes about seven or eight hours to see and do everything, but the writing is top-notch and it is definitely worth at least one trip.			"

This game has no voice acting. At all. It's all ambient sounds and SFX. At first it's weird, but it isn't too bad at all.

												Costume Quest isn't a bad game. But is it worth playing? In my opinion - unless the Halloween theme truly appeals to you, not really. Sadly.The thing is, you'll master the game's turn-based combat mechanics in the first hour. After that, the only challenges will be the occasional boss battles. Every other battle will just be a chore of waiting for it to be over, because there pretty much is no way for you to lose or have to develop a certain strategy. And as fun as the different costumes animations are to watch (the attack animations, especially that of the eyeball costume, are absolutely the high point of the game), after a while it just feels boring; despite the combat being spiced up by mechanics like having to push the correct button at the right time to do the most damage.Apart from that, there isn't much gameplay to be had here. There's a decent enough minigame (bobbing for apples), and in the DLC (freely included) there is a little maze puzzle, which is hardly challenging, but entertaining enough. The rest of the game? Walking around and exploring every nook and cranny of it's world. Which is a charming enough world. It's a shame, really. The whole concept of the game is just really cute, the designs and attack animations of the costumes are as previously mentioned absolutely wonderful, and the dialogue is at times pretty amusing.But it just doesn't cut it. The game is boring and repetitive (it has 4 areas, and your tasks are the same every single time) and all the charm in the world doesn't make it interesting to play. There is promise there - the final boss fight had some challenge, and it took me a few tries to find the best strategy (which combination of costumes would be most useful to help me win) - but the fact the game doesn't ever really live up to that promise just makes it all the more disappointing.The game will probably provide a good time for players who are not looking for a challenge, or players who just haven't had a whole lot of experience with turn-based RPGs yet; or simply young players. Everyone else? There's better stuff out there.[After a bunch of ""unhelpful"" ratings, I edited the review to hopefully sound a bit less opinionated and a bit more informative.]			"

												Unfortunately, I really can't give this game a good review.I tried to enjoy it, I really did, I mean its Double Fine right?The gameplay is almost non-existent and all three of the chapters have the same bobbing for apples minigame over and over again. There was no originality. Why could we not see three different mini games?The variety of monsters was also very lack luster, they introduce new species that have only about 4 or 5 varieties each for a total of under 20. Plus all most of them do is just attack you, no special moves, no variables, just one attack. I get that it was supposed to be simplistic, but it was just too much so for my taste.The supposedly clever humor also fell flat in my opinion, the writing was not NEARLY as good as what I am accustomed to from this studio. I loved brutal legend and I loved Iron brigade not only because the games were fun, but they were hilarious as well. It also hurt that the dialogue is not voiced.If you are looking for a cutesy little game for a young child who has 6 hours to burn, I say go for this as long as it’s under 10$. Otherwise unless you are a Double Fine fanboy (which is not necessarily a bad thing, they make good games) then just walk away.			"

												I'm going to start this out by saying this: I loved this game. It is absolutely adorable. You play as one of two siblings out to collect candy on halloween. Alls not well however, when they discover that the neighborhood has been taken over by evil doings.Artistically, Costume Quest is great. Interesting graphics with a FFVII-esque transition between the cutsy overworld and the combat scenes. The music fits the game well, but isn't outstanding. The story is silly and fun, and not super serious.Mechanically, the game is solid. Combat and overworld controls make sense and everything is easy to pick up. Combat is menu based, but not overwhelmingly so. Each costume has different strengths and weaknesses, and different combinations can make for a very different combat experience.If you're looking for a quick, uninvolved RPG, you could do a lot worse than Costume Quest.If you liked this review, please have a look at my other reviews!

												Every year around Halloween I have to pull this game out and play a little.  It has a wonderful sense of atmosphere that really does define Halloween for a young child.  The world is a bright, colorful, slighty scary place full of surprises.  In the game you have to explore the area for candy, solve a few puzzles, and battle a few monsters.   There is some rpg aspects in fact that you level the party,  you can buy power-ups with candy, and the choice of costumes. The idea of combat is great as your costumes come to life, each wih a special ability.  In reality, the battles tend to be a bit repetitive and button mashfasts.  Still, I always look forward to each new costume to see its animations in battle.Overall, I highly recommend this game just on charm alone.  Its got great artwork and the game mechanisms work for the most part.  I even like the soundtrack with its spooky sounds interpersed with children's laughter.  The humor is great too, you can view this game as a satire on American culture.			"

												This is probably one of the cutest, most charming games I've played.The game mechanics aren't anything ground breaking. It's a pretty straight forward RPG battle system where you transform into the literally larger-than-life version of your chosen Halloween costume. But the game's world is what you wanted to experience when you were 10 years old. You wanted to BE your costume (which picking was one of the most important decisions you made all year). You wanted life to be very cartoony. Candy was more precious than money.The game oozes charm. It has child characters that are actually likable, funny, and clever, which is pretty rare in video games. The monsters and villians are pretty funny. Basically, it's just so fun!			"

												Costume Quest is a cute game where you are the brother or sister (Depending on whom you picked) and during trick or treating your sibling gets taken by a troll monster thinggy.

It also had a pokemonish styled battle thing which I actually dislike. It's a fun game where you can just go trick or treating, you ever get sweets or you have to battle! :Poverall, a very cute and detailed game. I would buy  it for the halloween season / if its on sale!			"

												This is the first and best game to ever truly capture the spirit of why Halloween is the treasured holiday that it is.  From the childlike fantasy that costumes are a transformation rather than a mask to the currency systems of candy and collectible stamps, the nostalgic whimsy is endearing and addictive.Every year I look forward to playing this game (I have it on PS3, thus the short play hours on Steam) and whenever I need a little dose of Halloween but it's not October, this game scratches that itch.If you love Halloween, this game embodies it like no other.

												Costume Quest is a cute little Halloween themed casual adventure game. This fun game had you teaming up with newfound friends to rescue your sister and save Halloween from candy-hunting monsters. The game feels like it was made for a younger audience, but certainly enjoyable by the young at heart.The graphics were really nicely done. It was appropriately cartoony, which fit the game quite well. All the animations and movements felt really smooth. Each level of the game was set in a unique setting which the art represented well.Story isn't the main focus of the game, but it is there. It's quite cute, fun and appropriate. There are certainly a couple of nods and winks in there and there's some enjoyable dialogue too.Gameplay was simplistic, requiring you to complete a number of quests on each level, all revolving around collecting candy, battle cards (which would give characters a boost in combat) and collectable trading cards. While each level was in a different setting, the gameplay felt a little too much like a copy of the level before it and that made it a tad boring. There were some unique activities on each level, I feel that more variety from level to level would have made it feel more fresh.Combat was very simplistic. Depending on which character's turn it was, it would either require a timed button press of one of four keys, a single button press or a mashing of one or more keys. Every third attack by a character had the options of choosing a special attack. Defence used a similar mechanic. I believe the simplicity of the combat can be attributed to a combination of the younger target audience as well as a relic of it being a console port. A Paper-Scissors-Rock style strength/weakness system would modify the damage given/received. The problem with this simplified approach is that after a while, it becomes rather repetitive. Given the number of battles you'll need to complete the game, the repetitive combat simply becomes boring and I found I was wanting to avoid combat rather than chasing enemies for extra candy and experience. This is compounded by the inability to skip special attack animations. While each animation isn't that long, you'll be seeing a lot of them, and if you're like me, you'll just want to skip it and move on.Achievements for this game at quite simple to collect. If you examine them prior to playing, you should be able to pick them all up bar one in a single playthrough. That bar one is ""Tisn't the Season"", which can only be acquired on Christmas Day.Polish. Costume Quest is really quite polished. I saw no bugs, screen artefacts, characters getting stuck, or the like. If I want to be really picky, the only thing I could bring attention to is that there are some minor signs that this is a port, combat mechanism for instance, but I don't think it would have been practice to have done anything about them.Conclusion. Overall, Costume Quest is a beautiful fun game. If you like a casual, light-hearted adventure and can tolerate a little repetitiveness, you'll find enjoyment here.			"

												I love it when you start a game like ""Ok, let's see what this is like"" and get hooked so badly that you end up finishing the game the same day.I was deploring a few days ago the fact that Halloween isn't celebrated in my country and came accross this adventure game, in which you play as a costumed kid ready for some trick-or-treating. But this is a heroic story from a child's perspective, as your sibling is kidnapped by a monster and the evil takes over. Costume Quest is a cute and funny RPG with a simple combat system, your abilities depending on which costume you're wearing. Get candies, trade them for special abilities, put some new costumes together, complete some quests, kick some bad guy's a** and save the world - or at least, your sibling ! A very entertaining adventure for all ages with a lot of humour and a great story.			"

												Costume Quest is a cute little game worth goofing around with in October. Once you get into it, it's pretty fun. I find myself really eager to try out whatever new costume I come across just to see its special abilities.Combat is pretty much nothing but quick time events, which is somewhere between disappointing and frustrating. Each costume has its own different take on the quick time event though, with some asking you to get timing right, some asking you to hit a button before its too late, and some asking you to mash keys. It does keep it interesting I suppose. At least defending is always the same thing.			"

												I got this game a couple years back on a steam sale and I must say I am not dissapointed.The Game itself is a nice cute comedy rpg for young and old. The Graphics are very cartoony and cute and I had no problem running it whatsoever. To Upgrade your fighting gear and ability you need to make find Costume Parts and create them. Each one has their own special ability for your own uniqe Playstyle.The Achievements are also not very hard to achieve, main Reason being is because you can unlock them almost all by just playing through it. This Game also comes with Steam Cards for extra cutness.It also comes with a Bonus Level / DLC for free called Grubbins on Ice. Which is a bit more difficult then the main campaign and requires more of a tactical thinking.All in all, this game is super cute and after 14 Hours of finishing it I can recommend this Game for its original price, however it is never a mistake to get it on Sale.

												Charmingly cute turn-based RPG. The game has a simple comic-book aesthetic, and is full of silly characters and clever dialogue. Through the power of the children's imagination, in battle they transform into towering fighters, based on the costume they are currently donning. These fighters include a robot, a ninja, a unicorn, and a giant crab made out of french fries. The four hub areas feel visually distinct, but the quest types in each zone are very similar. You will find hidden children, bob for apples, knock on doors to ""Trick-or-treat"", receiving either a handful of candy or entering into a battle. The battle system in this game is almost stiflingly simple. Each costume has a basic attack and a special move that can be used every three turns. Attacks and defense are managed through simple quick-time events, and there are no items or resistances to keep track of in battles.Your parties stats are limited to HP, Attack Power, and Defense. Levelling up increases these stats by a fixed amount. The only character management lies in deciding which costumes to wear, and spending candy to obtain stamps which give various perks in battle. Each character can only equip one stamp at a time, and some are undoubtedly more powerful than others. Difficulty is very low, especially once you have a full party.			"

												It's another great game by Double Fine. It's got the same humorous dialogue, good story on a smaller scale as compared to some of their other games.  Graphics are simple, music has that Halloween feel as it's perfect for playing something like this around October. Gameplay overall is a turn based RPG, it's easy and recommended for beginners of the genre. It does get repetitive but like a said, it's basically an RPG for beginners. My only complaint is that this game needed a map badly. Especially in the first part of the game. It's real confusing and almost took an hour just to find a house I did not go up too. Also the framerate is sort of locked at 30. I disabled the vsync and got it going up to 40 but for the most part this game is locked at 30. It's a 7/10.			"

												This game tries to give you an insight on the kids’ imagination at best time possible: Halloween trick’or’treating, with all the costumes and funny games (until someone loses an eye, and oh boy they do!). And it is designed just right to do so. Game also offers a solid amount of exploration, a few side quests and some level-upping to do. All of those would make me definitely recommend the game, and for those qualities I do, but the repetitive and unnecessarily combats make me not.

												A charming and cartoony JRPG about kids saving Halloween, bogged down by a a battle system where the best three costumes are the first three you get, and where combat boils down to everyone attacking normally for two rounds, suing their special ability on the third, and repeating until the fight's over. There's no real reason to use any of the other costumes because none of them have as good stats or as good special ability as an all area hitting massive nuke with follow up DoT damage, a powerful shield capable of turning hits into 1 or 2 damage, or the only heal in the game that doesn't require the target to be dead first to revive them. The combat system is incredibly repetitive, although active due to needing to do timed button presses. Ultimately, though, literally every fight becomes attack -> attack -> special -> repeat. Battle Stamps, the game's only equipment, don't alleviate this issue at all - some of the stamps offer side abilities that Stun or Slow enemies, but you're still doing the same attack/attack/spell trio the entire game.I'm giving the game a positive recommendation because the repetitive and dull combat system ultimately wasn't enough to dissuade me from completing the (relatively short: 4-6 hours) game. It's still fun running around, collecting candy, and trick or treating, and seeing what the costumes look like in fights. If the game was any longer, the combat system would start to do real damage, but thanks to how short it is, it's not that big a deal.			"

												It's no secret that people enjoy spooking themselves throughout October. Some may dabble into the horrific imagery, the classic monsters, the eldritch horrors or the psychological drama of fear. All of these qualities are what many would consider as connotations of Halloween.Halloween for me, however has never been about the scares. While I may sound to be admiring the commercialism itself, I've always been reminded of Trick-or-Treating, Halloween cartoons/specials, and of the creativity/love for the holiday, especially the costumes. These are the qualities adults and kids alike treat themselves to every year.These sentiments are why I find myself revisiting Costume Quest as a tradition. It provides a light-hearted, four to six hour adventure (with the DLC and all the extra quests) that captures the qualities I enjoy the most. Its shortened length and kid-like spectacle perfectly shows the forgotten fondness we have for the holiday of fears.Something ""Wicked"" This Way ComesCQ itself has nothing unique that hasn't been seen in TV specials, movies or games. Its set-up is that you play as the brother/sister of a family, and you must rescue your sibling from the clutches of an evil witch bent on taking over Halloween with all the candy. (Also possibly not to get grounded). However, what the plot lacks in originality, the game's humor and execution provide something that shows its charm for being derivative of all the things kids and adults love about Halloween. If you grew up in the '90s like myself, then you probably are familiar with the trick-or-treat game from Cartoon Network. You walked around an small map with magical costumes, collecting candy from doors and obstacles in a time-limit for high-scores. Costume Quest shares the basic idea of a magical realism setting where the costumes themselves provide supernatural powers for kids. Instead of a competitive, high-score game, CQ is a traditional JRPG game with Paper Mario-like mechanics and various HUB maps to explore.Compared to the Cartoon Network game, the maps are much larger along with providing mini-games and alternative quests for hidden rewards. Outside of combat, every costume provides an ability that varies in its utility. The quests are basic fetch or talk quests, and the level-design is a linear set of checkboxes given some player freedom to wander off. You won't be breaking the game's order of events or getting late-game costumes early.When in combat, the kids transform themselves into a larger-than-life representation of their costume in what can be thought of as a Power Rangers mech fight. Enemies' designs are dramatized as well to make the combat more visually interesting than watching a blue-box robot fighting demons in bath-robes. That visual alone is how the fighting mechanics should be thought of: Absurd and simple.  Like Paper Mario, the turn-based battles are broken up by quick-time-events that add/lower the damage you deal. The player's team and the enemy's take turns trading hits, and while you are on the defensive you can block attacks to lessen the blow. Some costumes have unique abilities like the Knight's Shield (defense buff), the Robot's Missle Barrage and the Lady Libery's Anthem (healing skill). To say that the combat system is basic would be stating the obvious. There are eleven costumes in the main game, and three new ones in the DLC. Each costume has its one-tailored playstyle and set of skills, separated by one of three costume types like rock-paper-and-scissors, and they each provide enough lasting appeal to keep the game from getting too stale with a limited roster. The game knows its combat isn't its greatest suit, so the variety and short length go a long way to keep the monotonous gameplay as low as possible.There's Only 364 Days Til' Next HalloweenAs far as the game's other problems, if the game's charm doesn't sell you on it right away, then the gameplay, in and out of combat, won't sell you on the rest of the experience. The writing isn't Double Fine's best as it relies a lot on tropes, especially the protagonist and his/her companions, but the subversions from the player's character towards not carrying about the plot helps mitigate that issue. (Kind of like how Doomguy doesn't care about the plot in his recent game.) This is something the DLC as well as CQ2 fail to grasp as the plot relies on characters explaining the techno babble of wormholes. Neither one captures the same charm as the original. While Costume Quest is certainly not one of Double Fine's greatest successes it is an experience I would easily recommend to others. Usually I would have something more profound to say to end a review but CQ is simply a decent game.  It's nothing innovative in its gameplay, story or even its basic idea, but the way everything comes together nicely makes me longing for next Halloween to replay it again.			"

												A really fun game even for someone who does not celebrate Halloween. As halloween is not majorly celebrated in my country.A creative, original and gorgeously animated RPG, you go around trick or treating collecting candy and fighting monsters in turn based  combat which is simplistic but fun as you end up with a collection of costumes that transform you when in combat and besides the basic attack, after a few rounds you can use a special attack such as for the unicorn it leaps into the air shoots a rainbow and can revive and fully heal a downed ally or just fully heal if no one is KO'ed.The game is quite short, I completed it plus grubbins on ice in 11 hours. Doesn't matter though as  the length is perfect for the game as I can see that any longer will probably become boring. I highly recommend playing through this game. I had fun.			"

Costume Quest is a Double Fine RPG set around Halloween where by some magical intervention, your character and his or her friends gain the ability to transform into super powered versions of their costumes to save your sibling who has been mistakenly kidnapped as a result of dressing in a terrible candy costume.It's very... Double Fine. I really don't know how they make their games all feel so similar despite them having different mechanics and stories and settings. Art and dialogue, I suppose. Anyway, that's my only negative-ish criticism.It's a pretty good short RPG, with quick time attacks/dodging similar to the Mario RPGs. It is actually reasonably difficult despite how it might look so if you're buying this for kids, consider that. I like the innovation of having ""random encounters"" limited to houses where you're trick or treating. The story is kind of sparse, but manages to touch on some themes of the difficulties of siblinghood. It fits into the game's world organically, so I can appreciate that.			"

												For those of you that are in for a one way ticket ride throughout a rather comical world with cool challenges and heroic action scenes should know that this game offers exactly what you are looking for. Although the game is rather short, resulting in an 8 hours play to cover completely both the game and the extension, Costume Quest has the talent of keeping you seated for hours as you are constantly plundered by the affirmation ""I'll do just this one and then quit"". From the graphics perspective the game is truly gorgeous, combining the animated themed models with comic book influences and a really well built atmosphere. Even tho you will spend most of your gameplay surfing through text lines, the game is still very enjoyable having some good humor and offering you a rather challenging comical journey, with extreme boss fights, that you won't regret.

I am never going to get far enough to weigh in on the story though, this game is unplayable.

												7.5/10Pros- Just oozes style and charm, with a great Halloween theme- Very polished finished product- Enjoyable timing-based combat (think Paper Mario)- A large number of playable “characters” (13 combat costumes + 1 noncombat)- Funny at times- Includes the DLC episode for freeCons- Not a lot of variety in the locations or enemies (3 main story levels + 1 DLC level)- Fairly short for an RPG (about 8 hours to finish)- Simplified RPG combat leads to very few options and a lot of repetition- The story isn’t exactly gripping- Very linearI actually really enjoyed this game.  It’s a very simple and short turn-based RPG that hit a lot of the right notes.  It just has a certain charm to it that is hard to describe. The combat contains a timing-based component where if you perform the correct action at the right time, your attacks will do more damage or you will take less damage on defense.  This helps keep you engaged in all of the battles.  Thankfully this component was included, because otherwise you have very few options in combat (attack, use a special if it is charged, or use a battle stamp which gives a combat ability).  In terms of battle stamps, these are reusable and basically replace items in the game, and can either confer an ability in combat (e.g. stun a single enemy) or a passive ability (e.g. more health).  The other source of variety in combat is the inclusion of 13 different combat costumes, each of which have their own abilities and play style (single target DPS, AoE, defense, healer, etc.).  That being said, even with these additions the combat can still drag at times.  Fighting a limited variety of enemies in the same environment over and over can become tedious.  Overall most battles are quite easy, but a few boss battles require strategy when selecting which battle stamps and costumes to use.  The story doesn’t contribute much, but the writing is good and there are some funny moments.  If you enjoy RPGs that don’t take themselves too seriously, this is a good game.  In addition, the simplified and streamlined nature of the game would make it a good option for someone who is new to RPGs or a younger gamer.			"

												Costume Quest is a game that unexpectedly won me over completely. While I still have not played all of Double Fine's games yet, this particular game is near the top for me, and also one of my favorite games in general for recent years.There is a lot of heart in the design and story of Costume Quest, which is a wonderfully funny kids' adventure. You begin the game on Halloween night for a brother and sister, which quickly evolves into a gigantic quest beyond any normal realm, as you must fight monsters that sweep in to take over the night.As a whole, Costume Quest is indeed a quest. As you control a set of kids going on their adventure throughout the game, you will do a variety of things from actual trick-or-treating to exploration for hidden items to performing role-playing battles. The game is indeed an RPG with main and side quests, special equipment and power-up items, along with general collectibles. Most fitting to the game is that candy is your currency.Each new area that you enter, you generally must trick-or-treat at a set number of houses or doorways. When doing so, you will literally get a trick or a treat. The treat is simply candy, as expected. The trick, however, is a fight with the monsters that are the main enemies of the game. When battles launch up, your characters have mini-cutscenes where they turn into the beings that they are wearing as costumes, e.g., a robot will suddenly stand up very tall and be prepared to fight.The style of the battles are turn-based, though you only have three options - normal attack, special power, and Battle Stamp power. When you perform normal attacks, each costume has a different style of ""timing"" that you can use to perform extra damage if you hit the right buttons in the proper manner. Special powers cannot be used until enough energy (essentially MP) is accrued, which will generally happen after a few turns in battle. Battle Stamps are part of the equipment of the game, where each character can wear a single stamp to add extra strength or a new capability. Some of the Battle Stamps just affect stats, like increasing attack power. Others will give an ability for that third battle option, such as stunning enemies temporarily.As can be seen both in and out of battle, the game has a very interesting, 3D cartoon art style showcasing the environment and characters. As already mentioned above, the battles have mini-cutscenes related to the costumes, and there are also special effects for the power attacks or for certain bosses that you fight along the way. Altogether, everything truly screams Halloween. Even the costumes that you are wearing will allow you to perform different capabilities in the ""real"" world, as you will need to switch between them to access certain areas or complete side quests on the map.The story itself is also very well-done, having both a cheesy style but also a mapped-out purpose. As you continue through the game, you will learn more information about the beings that you are fighting against and what their end goal is. Take note that once you finish the game, the story is not done. The game has a free ""Grubbins on Ice"" DLC which continues from the end of the game. And even further, there is a Costume Quest 2 which continues from the endpoint of that DLC.I highly recommend this game to just about any person. The adventure of the children is filled with fun, charm, humor, and a number of other qualities, combined into a very enjoyable game.			"

												Costume Quest is another great game made by Double Fine Productions. Set in a Halloween setting, this game brings forth both RPG elements and strategy, while not making the game too hard. This game isn't too long, but it isn't too short either, with the game duration being around 5-6 hours for the main story. The goal of the game is to rescue your sister from the clutches of an evil witch, and stop monsters from taking all the town's candy by trick-or-treating door to door. Along your way, you'll pick up allies and use many costumes with different abilities in and out of battle to progress through your journey. Completing side quests not only help you, but everyone else as well as you strive to finish your journey. Watch as your Halloween costumes come to life in Costume Quest.ProsOver 14 different Halloween costumes to try on with different roles, abilities, and special moves. Some costumes help you in situations outside of combat.Very simple and straight forward turn-base, RPG battle system, that often provides strategy at times.Many Battle Stamps to collect that give you an advantage in battle (healing after every turn, additional damage, counterattack, poison, etc.)Great, cartoony graphics and atomospheric music that helps set the environment of the gameAlthough they serve no real purpose besides unlocking achievements, you can collect trading cards from winning battles and trading with NPCs.Occasional mini games that are not only fun, but are great when you want to take a break from fighting or finishing quests.Additional story to play after the main that's equally as enjoyable as the last.ConsDodging and attacking quick time controls often don't respond, but it's not a huge issue. At only $10 and an average playtime of around 5-10 hours, this game is all-around great to pick up, and can be enjoyed at any time, not just Halloween. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys RPG games or are just casual gamers. "

												This is such a cute game. I got it as part of a bundle I purchased in order to get another game I wanted and never really intended to play it. But I did. And I ended up loving it.It's definitely a pretty casual game and you can breeze through it pretty quickly so it might not appeal to the most hardcore of gamers but I thought it was a blast. The designs are cute and quirky and thw worlds are just open enough to make them fun to explore but not too open so that you get completely lost and turned around.Since all of the different costumes the characters can wear have different powers attached to them, the fighting never actually gets boring. There's different combinations of costumes you can use to find the ones you like best and none of the costumes are actually a bad choice. They're all really powerful and have their own benefits, even the ones that seem weakest will have awesome healing abilities that make them great in a boss fight.There are some puzzles that you have to solve using your costumes but they're all pretty straightforward, if not explained outright. This is never really a hard game but I think that works for it. The battles are just challenging enough to keep you engaged but never hard enough to really destroy the whimsy of the game.The only thing I really found annoying was having to back track in order to find certain things you need, especially in the mall level. The top tier of that level just looked all the same to me and I kept getting turend around. At least your main costume comes with rollerblades so that you can just zip right along.			"

★★★☆☆I almost feel bad for not joining the love the people - including friends and family - share for Double Fine and so also for this game, because I don't think this is perfect. I think its the best looking Double Fine game to date, with its very refined cell-shaded graphical style, but I think it's just too easy, and too short. Perhaps that's what this game is not about, as it seems that the festive atmosphere and the charm the world inherits from what Double Fine games are known for.My problem is that it's a short game that feels long, in a bad way. Of the 7 hours I spent playing this game (including the DLC), I felt like I was watching the same 3 battles play over again and again, without any feeling of commitment since the battles are so easy and simple. Each character has one  basic attack and a special attack that is usable in the 3 turn. But by the time I can use it, I most likely don't even need to use it, since one basic attack is enough to be succesful. You do get the option to add another action, like stunning or poisoning, but I found those not necessary, even after using them. In fact, I used the buffs that would increase attack power and the ability to counterattack so the fights are over within 2 or 3 turns.Another small quirck, that some other reviewers also mentioned, is the fast-crolling, automated dialogues (though, mostly just in cutscenes). The is no voice-acting, but only texts. The problem that you can easily miss parts of the text when you're destracted at all. I don't read fast or slow, but I was still somewhat annoyed with this text speed.Despite the lack of difficulty and the monotonous combat, I still enjoyed the game for the look and character. Try it out when you feel like taking a break a night or two from the stress you might endure from your regular life.Edit: during a sale you can get this game (including the DLC) for a mere 1 buck. Though I wouldn't recommend this for a full 10 bucks, I do think it's definitely worth it for such a low price.			"

												Costume Quest is a really fun to play Halloween themed, turn based RPG.I recently have been getting into playing alot of smaller indie type games as opposed to the larger AAA games because im finding those bigger developers nowadays are just money grabbing Ctrl + C, Ctrl + V all their games and sequels. Small games like this for me are far more exciting and interesting to play because they can be so random.Costume Quest is clearly a Halloween themed game where you play as a child whose brother/sister has been taken captive by monsters (Grubbins) that think he/she is a giant piece of candy. Progressing through the game, there are 3 or 4 main quest areas/neighborhoods that you 'Trick or Treat' for candy and do various quests such as trading collectible Creepy Treat Cards with other kids, bobbing for apples and finding 6 children that are hiding to get a reward.There are of course Costumes that you find materials for and use to fight your enemies, you can buy Battle Stamps or receive them after winning a fight which improve your damage, hp, attack power or chance to dodge etc. Each costume has its own unique ability and attack moves which really adds a little strategy as to which costumes your characters wear to a fight.All in all, i really have enjoyed playing through this game! It has a very South Park: Stick of Truth feel to it, in the sense that you are playing as children, exploring the neighborhood, fighting other children in turn based fights, finding collectibles, doing certain quests to unlock access to new areas, having boss fights and so on. The only difference here is that Costume Quest is a fraction of the price and isnt quite as content filled as South Park: Stick of Truth, but it is worth the price by far in my opinion.I have been uploading all of my gameplay to Youtube if you would like to see some gameplay but there are of course spoilers if you do watch them :steamhappy: Costume Quest Youtube Playlist "

												I recommend this game if you can get it on sale and get it knowing there's virtually no replay value. I got it on sale and it was a fun 6-7 hour game. You can do everything in the game in just 6-8 hours, so be aware of that. The story is silly and nothing to boast about. The combat gets kind of repetitive, but the new costumes throughout the game and having to use the costumes outside of battle to access certain areas of the map for secrets and collectibles (and game progression) was fun and intrigued me. If you're looking for a complex or challenging game, this isn't it. But if you or perhaps one of your kids is looking for a nice, simple RPG to play for an afternoon-this is a good one to get. (again, provided it's on sale. I can't recommend spending $10 on a game that only takes 6-7 hours to beat-regardless of how much you might want an easy to perfect game)			"

												Double Fin Productions offers a fun little role playing game, but its simplicity can be its one flaw. The simple combat makes Costume Quest seem rather dull, but the interesting story, amazing concept, and the crazy costumes create an epic game. Costume Quest:This game tells the story of a family who move to a new town right before Halloween. Their mother sends her two children out to trick-or-treat: Reynold and Wren. You get to choose to play as either one of these two children, but after the start of the game whoever you don’t choose is taken away. Your mission is to retrieve the other sibling and save this town from the monsters who are trying to destroy Halloween forever. Grubbins on Ice:Grubbins on Ice is the expansion for Costume Quest which extends the story to enter the world of Repugia. Continuing the tale that Wren, Reynold, and their friends started this expansion offers a summary. The Grubbins are experiencing a takeover by an evil crew of monsters who are raising the taxes and steeling the candy. Can you save the foes that originally caused you so much distress from a fate worse than death, a world without candy. Gameplay:Just beat this game, other than the final boss on Grubbins on Ice being slightly challenging the overall game was incredibly easy. This game has a fun an interesting story which makes me wonder if all that occurred was just a child’s imagination or in fact was supposed to have really happened. The game drifts between reality and fantasy creating a world through the eyes of children. The game offers elements of questing, puzzle solving, and combat all without a single bit of bloodshed. The gameplay is interesting, but incredibly simple. The characters wear costumes which allow them to enter into battle with their opponents gaining the power of their outfit. The costumes have one attack and ability. No matter which costume you where the basic attack is essentially the same (doing the same amount of damage only visually different). The costumes differ based on their special ability, which makes each costume slightly unique. Results:If you are interested in an RPG that’s not a page turner, but rather just a fun little side project then this may be for you. This game has simple gameplay, relatively easy to follow plot, and very basic questing; all which adds up to a game which you can play for a while, put down for a while, and come back to without feeling like you lost a beat. Overall it’s a fun little game that doesn't offer too much on your plate, but just enough to fill you up. Pros:+Simple basic combat system which requires no real skill+Friendly characters and interesting story line.+Relatively friendly controls+Very basic puzzles which require not mental skill.+Good game for all ages as there is no gore or inappropriate dialogue. Cons:-Gets very repetitive-No replay value. Once you have completed this game there is no reason to try it again (which is fine if you can get this game at a good discount)-Cannot cycle through characters and thus must play as the first character in line; this can be really annoying if you want to quickly cycle through costumes rather than continually opening the menu to change the costumes between characters. Which results in you then have to change the costumes back to the previous setting if you want your main character to wear a specific costume for its exploration ability.			"

												I really enjoyed this game because it really captures a lot of the fun of the Halloween spirit that can be so easily ignored in favor of Christmas, especially for us adults who don't get much to do on Halloween unless we want to go to a bar or club.  Starting off, I'd say what builds this Halloween concept so well is all of the different nods to Halloween activities throughout.  This ranges from the bobbing for apples mini-game, collectible cards you can trade and swap for, gathering random household objects to build different costumes, going throughout different areas in town to attend various events (costume contest, various neighborhoods, etc.), dealing with a random bully/jerk, and of course going Trick-or-Treating.  I thought it was fun going to random doors, not knowing if you would receive a treat, in the form of gobs of candy, or a trick, in the form of a random battle.  A nice variation on the random battle aspect you normally get in RPGs.Battles are fairly straightforward and simple, with different costumes providing the player with options on which combat style and ultimate move they prefer to use.  Don't like trying to time your attack or hit the right button prompt once it appears on screen?  Then you will likely have an alternative to use instead, once you unlock enough costumes.  Sometimes different combat situations will require the player to mix and match to get the right combination, but since this game lacks grinding (since enemies don't respawn) there is always some way to get through your current fight.  Early and mid-game fights were sometimes hard to get through since I'd need to avoid making any mistakes (especially when going against 3 baddies at once), since it was so easy for them to just kill off one of my guys and make it so I couldn't win the fight at all.  Otherwise though, I saw nothing wrong in the combat as it had just the right balancing, for me at least.The game has fun and witty dialogue, which compels the player to explore and talk with various NPCs.  Sometimes navigating the map can be a bit annoying, but once you get the hang of it it's not too bad.  It does help having the robot roller skates on to zip around at turbo speed, a thankful addition since most games like this have you plod around at a constant speed.  You even get to pick between being the boy or girl, without one or the other being obvious eye ""candy."" *pun intended*Overall, I would recommend this game.  It doesn't offer much for replayability, but it's worthy of a full playthrough.			"

												This is a fun retro-style RPG that does not eat up all your time to finish, but that is completely rewarding for being so whimsical and full of interesting content. I think you'll find that certain aspects are repetitive. For instance, the monsters one fights look similar and some of the minor quests are identical--e.g., apple bobbing. I think the turn-based fighting lacks strategy once you pick up a third friend. Also, you might want to adjust the in-game brightness because I had a hard time seeing at first. Still, all of these cons are mitigated by the fun content. I just loved collecting items, which was such a key component to playing the Costume Quest games. New costumes give you new powers. My favourite costume was the Eyeball from Grubbins on Ice. Hilarious!I purchased the game in a bundle with Costume Quest 2 and Grubbins on Ice for $5 on Halloween. The price was unbeatable, although I would have probably accepted paying $20 for all three games. This won't be the game you'll be playing for an entire year, but it will be a game you'll look back on fondly for sure. For me, it filled in the void after I beat South Park's ""Stick of Truth.""

												I played Costume Quest many years ago on the xbox 360.  Now replaying on Steam for the second time the game still holds up very well.  In my opinion it is a very light hearted RPG, simple and short enough to relax with.  The story is short and cute but has enough to pull you in.  You start by picking one of the twins to play as your main character the other u did'nt pick is part of the story as a NPC.  What caught me to the game was the battle system.  The whole game is about Halloween and how different Costumes you obtain through the game will allow you to transform into whatever the costume is about ( Robot Costume allows you to trun into a giant robot that shoots a rocket fist and bombs).  As i said earlier the game is light hearted no complex battle system here which means you dont have weapons or armors no list of magic spells or skills...Each costume can attack and has one special move (which can only be used after two turns).  When attacking each costume has a different button or prompt that needs to be push within seconds in order to get a critical hit...same goes for when a monster attacks your characters you must push a button in time to reduce the damage.  I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants to play a short, simple, fun RPG.  My Rating: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED "

												When a game has as much charm and attention to presentation as Costume Quest does, you don't really mind that the RPG mechanics are incredibly rudimentary and simple. The only thing I really found irksome about this game were a couple of moments where DoubleFine let its history of creating Adventure games show, and the player is forced to perform tasks in particular sequences or in ways that nobody in their right mind would think of. While it's probably the easiest and shortest RPG I've played since Final Fantasy: Mystic Quest, it's a really fun and light-hearted way to kill a few hours while getting into the Halloween spirit.

												I smiled and chuckled a lot while playing this one. The story and music is nice, but without voice actors I really felt the little ""extra"" was missing. The text bubbles you're left with sometimes disappears too fast before you can read them, other times you can press a button when reading them, and this should have been implemented in a better way, if not for all of them. Also, there are too many unnecessary battles; because of the battles being very simplistic in nature, the game would benefit greatly if these encounters were cut in, say, maybe half. Or barring that, having a more advanced fighting system. Nevertheless, it's a really nice ""cozy"" game that I recommend getting on a sale.			"

												Your Mission: Save Halloween (and your brother)  behind the backs of your loving and oblivious parents. This is a JRPG with a graphic style that evokes Saturday morning. The combat system is repetitive, but active as it requires timed button presses on a rotation. The story is cute and endearingly nostalgic. Whumping goblins on the back of the head with a pail, Trick-or-Treating and sibling rivalry are all present. And where else would you see a crab made of French fries, a unicorn and Lady Liberty team up to take down the bad guys? Best enjoyed with a bowl of Captain Crunch.			"

Costume Quest is two games in one, you can play the normal Hallow'een storyline, then afterwards the sequel: Grubbin's on Ice, which has a winter orientated theme.

Costume QuestCostume Quest is a great halloween game!!Its a cute RPG game with a great story and the game is going to scream HALLOWEEN! at you, its hard to close the game because you just need to do one more quest.You look like a normal kid with a normal costume, but then you get into battle you get that fantasy battle many children feel when you put on your costume, you become the costume.The game contains lot of candy, costumes, quest, monsters, pumpkins, battle stamps, abilities, mini games and FUN!I got it for 0.99€ and it just make you forget about time.I gonna play this game every halloween from now on, thats for sure! 10/10 "

												I had some good fun with this game. You can either play it casually or just dive into it and go full Costume Quest. I like the idea of the game and the different costumes that they used. With the first area you also get a very nice Halloween feeling.The game looks pretty for the size of the game and the animations are nicely done. It obviously repeats very often and you might  find that more variety would have been good but its not the case here.The normal fights are not that hard and you should be able to win them with not much problems. Except if you are like me and forget to use stamps. The bosses can be tough without a strategy but are manageable.All in all I liked playing this game and can recommend it.			"

												Highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a good family RPG game.  Played this with my son a bit and he loved the action as well as the characters.  This plays a bit like Final Fantasy other than the story and the Halloween concept its embedded in.  Good art style, though I have to admit that I wish they had recorded voice overs rather than just plain text.			"

												Costume Quest is a really wonderful and fun adventure for kids and adults, who still remember how it's - be a kid. It's simple, funny, touching, it's make you laugh a little and smile a lot and there aren't many things, that can do so, so I appreceate the experience. You should know though that the game is very repetitive: rob some shop, fight with monsters, do it again and again. Still, it doesn't mean that Costume Quest aren't enjoyable - quite the opposite actually, but I just give you warning.Now for the main part: it's a Halloween adventure and we have two siblings, who want to celebrate and take all sweets for themselves. They are boy and girl, it's your choice who you want to play with (hint: the choice happens, when your mother decide who will be in charge). But quite quickly events become much more difficult - the big green monster steals your sibling and now you HAVE to find him\her. Or take the wrath of your mother. Monsters just don't look so scary now, come to think of it...Gameplay is very simple: you must take sweets from shops and homes, you must fight monsters that come your way and take some side quests and exploration if you like. It may sounds boring, but actually it's pretty fun because of battle system, story and dialogs. Battle system looks like a Dream world, where your nice costume (i didn't mention this? Come on, the game has a ""costume"" in title!) becomes a powerful weapon. Like, robot costume transforms into actual fabulous robot. There are also ninja, Statue of Liberty, Space warrior, magic unicorn... and french fries. Where else you can fight with your enemies, using your french fries powers?! Okay, to actual battles. Little warning: you need some reaction for this, because you will need to quickly press some buttons while you attacking or defending to make better results. And yeah, each costume have it's own special powers for battle. Like, healing allies or making a powerful attack, or shielding the ally or yourself. It's your choice what combination to prefer (hint: you aren't all alone, there will be friends, some from the very beginning, some later).As for the story, I just don't want to spoil it for you, but it's wery fun and enjoyable with all jokes, references for popular culture, dantists's twist plots... You'll see many absurd situations and many exapmles of wonderful wrinting. Seroiusly, it's good and not only for child's taste. I highly recommend to complete every quest and talk with everyone - dialogs are pretty hilarious here, really, you will have a good time. So, if you are kid in your heart or at least can be, try the Costume Quest. Despite all its humorous self, it tells a story about siblings, about people, who may fight and tell a pretty bad things, but they're still family. They still love each other, even if it take a monster invasion to understand such a simple fact. And if you still wondering: of course adults don't help children to fight monsters. When they ever did? *sigh* Adults.P. S. If you encounter sudden perfomance problems (characters move very-very slow), try to reboot your computer. Strange advice, but it helps me.			"

												I'm going to start off by saying to play this online at all times unless you risk doing it again.I have No internet right now and I literally missed every achievement in the main game aside from 2. I guess it's an anti cheat thing. Though I don't really see the point in cheating in a game so forgiving as this one.Anyway. The game has a very monster house feeling to it. Where you have your friend, later, friends, a little side humor and a lot of surprising events all wrapped in a properly ill lit scenery. The game doesn't even feel like an RPG until you get into your first battle. And it starts off very rock paper scissors until you get further in. And so far it is the only game I know that can potentially punish you for focusing on killing off the healer in an enemy party. You traditionally go around collecting as much candy as you can from houses around as progression to find your sister, who has been abducted or something... I don't remember. It wasn't important. It's generic. There are other quests to do and things you can choose to find or not. But you do not have to do most of them to progress. Though if you're like me, you'll get lost in the darkness and end up getting everything done before you even find the last place to trick or treat. Battles... I feel like I played a game that was like this. But I don't remember it. Battles are more tactics based and there are No end all kill all invincible sets. A couple missed defense or sloppy offense will get you beat, and you'll be seconds from trying again. Because the game is forgiving, and instead of other rpgs that have you holding your head because you forgot to equip the accessory that would make your life a whole lot easier. You'll be right there able to try again and or challenge yourself with No penalty. Costumes have many roles in and outside of battle. Though honestly the run ability should have been either standard or at least something that could be swapped. I found myself sticking to the robot costume for it, as walking through the entire game seems like a chore, especially if you're lost. The roles inside of battle are diverse and almost always useful depending on whether you feel the need to attack or defend in battle. Other suits can also health or even revive. Exploring was probably the most fun. Regardless of how often I've gotten lost finding the last windy road or silly mistake you overlooked is always gratifying and adds to how nice it is to have maps and areas you have to explore in its entirety to enjoy. Because the levelling isn't all out of whack if you left other quests behind and need to do them battling isn't a chore of going through useless cinematics to clear peon battles. It stays fresh throughout and has a simple story that is deliciously visioned to make it worth playing again just to catch the quick humor or screenshot the sarcastic joke that had you hesitant the first time.That being said, there is another story inside it that I hear is more expansive than the main one. So it is very well worth the time and effort. Even if it's just to look at the pretty visuals.			"

												A fun, accessible, bite sized ""RPG"" with a creative concept and a beautiful artstyle. I would say don't play for the gameplay, it's basically a 'Fisher-Price: Babies first turn based combat system'. There's actually more strategy in trying to not win a battle, as the game makes it extremely easy for you. Instead, play the game for it's hilariously written story and enjoyable feel.

Quest to obtain CostumesI got this game of double fine humble bundle and was the first among the three games that I played. I have to say that the game is quite short and the depth of the RPG mechanism is shallow. It might be one of the easiest RPG game that I have ever played. The total playtime is around 5 hours and the plot is simple, you basically just save your sister.I would recommend this game if you just enter into RPG scene but to those veterans, you might just pick the game up for the cuteness.Verdict: 3 out 5			"

												So, I watched the video, looked at the screenshots and figured this might be a good game for the kids but I'll never get around to playing it....boy was I wrong!  Upon giving it a go I was stunned to find an incredibly simple yet thoughtful and FUN (remember when games were more fun than work?...well that is Costume Quest in a nutshell) game that provided a good few hours of entertainment and the closest the kids made it to the controller was watching Dad play as this is a game that I just had to devour all of the content for.The combat system is ridiculously simple for all bar a couple of big boss fights (which had me thinking about team dynamic and offensive/defensive strategies) but it was only starting to feel too repetitive as I was nearing the end of a full play through for 100% in a day.  A great game, well worth the money, love changing costumes - it's fun & I even found myself taking screenshots to look back and enjoy the costume battle transformations :)			"

												Costume Quest is easily one of my favourite games. It's a very simple game, doesn't take very long to 100% completely finish it  (I wrapped the main game and its DLC in 12 hours - and I tend to fool around in games a lot). The gameplay is great, the story and dialogue are fun and engaging, and the simplicity of it all is very refreshing in a sense. It is such an enjoyable game that I wish it gave you 50+ hours of gameplay, but it doesn't, and that's okay. It's fun, well made and written, and I enjoyed every moment of the experience. That's what matters. It really is a gem, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to the most hardcore of gamers.			"

												Double Fine is a bit like Pixar. They bring a certain magic and charm to all of their products. Most of their games are quite humorous and the stories are creative and unpredictable.So if Double Fine is Pixar, Costume Quest is Double Fine's ""Cars."" It's not a bad game. The premise is nifty and the jokes will make you grin, but there are just better showings if you want the Double Fine experience. Costume Quest takes place on Halloween, and you are a kid who has to rally some friends to trick-or-treat your way through town to save your sibling. It's colorful and delightful, like playing an old-school Nickelodeon cartoon. But after about an hour the old school Nickelodeon is overshadowed by the old school RPG game mechanics, which are repetitive and don't provide much actual decision-making or challenge. The story is divided into three beautiful set pieces, but again, the game play in each set piece is identical. Same main tasks, same exact sidequests, and the costumes you collect for monster fights aren't varied enough in their abilities to matter.If you love Double Fine and you're very tolerant of JRPG-style gameplay, you'll probably have fun, but I wouldn't make this your first Double Fine game. Psychonauts is the one to go with.			"

												I almost bought Costume Quest 2 this past sale -- before playing Costume Quest 1, which I've had in my library for quite some time. I'm glad I didn't buy the sequel which is billed as much of the same. After playing Costume Quest 1 to 100% completion, I have no desire to ever revisit it or play the sequel.Is it a bad game? No, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you're a fan of turn-based fights with QTE-like button presses. The art style is cute, the Halloween theme whimsical, the story is sufficient. However, the turn-based combat with unskippable animations gets very old very fast. In addition, the surprising lack of voiceovers is very disappointing; the game's story and interactions would have been much improved with spoken dialog.If you're on the fence, watch a few Let's Play videos on YouTube in order to get a feel for the plot and the combat. My mistake was simply buying on the strength of the studio (Double Fine) and the majority of positive reviews. All-in-all, I'd say the game is like Halloween candy: it's sweet but ultimately will make you sick if you have too much of it.			"

												I'm not saying that this is a horrible game. It's a great fun game. The art, animation, story, audio and style are all great. I just don't like how much gameplay there isn't.The gameplay is repetive and I'm the type of person who loves gameplay and nudges off everything else.When you play in the starting area, the town, you go around to houses trick-or-treating, and fighting a monster every now and then. You buy upgrades/perks, do some side quests and progress through a story. I feel like that part is really repetitive, fighting monsters. I guess if you like the Final Fantasy series, then you'll like this game.But after playing through the first area. the neighborhood, then you already have an idea of how to game is going to be like till the end, gameplaywise.

												Ahh, Tim Schaffer's company ""Double Fine"" creates a ""light"" RPG adventure game revolving around kids and Halloween. Crossing the style of South Parks ""Fun with Weapons"" episode with Final Fantasy, the powers come from the costumes that each wear. A Robot with strengthened attack power, a knight with heightened defense, the statue of liberty with powers to heal the whole team. There are a total of around 9 costumes, but each only has one ""ultimate"" power.The ideas behind the game are great, the setting really puts the player in the minds of the children, how they think- even there is no voice acting, the feeling and emotions are brought out wonderfully.Story lacks depth, idea being that some witch or other is stealing candy to help her get to some other country where she can take over. It felt something that a kid thought up. At the start of the game, your twin gets kidnapped, and this is the only time I ever felt any kind of real connection to it.The art-style reinforces the setting of playing in a kids world, big eyes, very cartoony.Gameplay is either adventuring around looking for cases, hitting anything for candy (even getting candy from trash cans!), or spent in the battle sequence, where very ""Final Fantasy"" style gameplay commences. Unfortunately, both modes get old very quickly.The adventure part feels like a very ""dark"" Zelda game. It's not bad, but not great either. There were times where paths were too difficult to be seen, or understood. Finding the cases in the Mall, or even the hill on the final stage, where I thought fallen trees had stopped me walking up. (took me 3-4 hours just checking online as I thought it was a bug, or checking if I missed something). ""Trick or Treating"" became old in the first half of the game with no variation, which brings me to the...Battle sequence. This is where the action happens. Unfortunately, each costume only has one ultimate, as stated earlier. Also each person has one ""battle stamp"", which gives them a ""counter"", ""stun"", etc. Basically one trait that helps the character regardless of costume worn. Like the adventuring part, this becomes very stale from the second stage and begins to feel just like a waste of time for the player.All in all, for the experienced RPG player, this is very lack-luster. An even SIMPLER version of ""Final Fantasy Mystic Quest"" on the Super Nintendo comes to mind. So for children, this game would be a great purchase to introduce them to the genre of RPG.Other reviews stating that this game is ""too short"", may be correct. But with so little variation with Gameplay, AND a lack-luster story, I'd have to say it's a little too long.Pros:The universe is nice and well brought out by its use of graphics and sound / music.Great ideas put on the table.Nice bits of humorCons;Adventure sections too dark and sometimes difficult to navigateLacking gameplay and depth, game gets old very quickly.Overall;I give this a very average 50-60%It feels that with all of the great ideas that were put onto the table, about half of the potential was made. I'm not sure if it was a rushed project or anything, as the music and sound was perfect, but it would be nice to see what would have happened if the developer had gone the extra mile.As it is, I can only recommend this game for younger gamers who you'd like to introduce the RPG genre- outside the world of Pokemon			"

												At first, the battle scene seems really weird, but it is actually really fun after you get used to it. It's fun to mix and match characters with different battle stamps. The battle stamps actually make a huge difference in the game. It's not too slow paced, so it keeps me quite entertained and engaged the whole time.			"

												Fun little pick me up that's less than *AHEM* on *AHEM*. It's seriously a fun RPg that reminds me of Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door with it's battle system (Only that it has action commands), but there are some pros and cons to it.For one con, it's much harder if you can't do action commands, so for example....Say ""Grubin"" attacked and it told me to hit the E button. If I don't hit the E button then, I get hurt slightly more.However, if you can survive the battle, you auto heal after every battle, and losing doesn't make you load, you simply have to restart the battle. So really, there's no real concequence to failing in battle besides the humility of being defeated by a filthy grubin.But even the enemies have personality, even though some of the people in the games may not be the nicest, they're still extremely well made. One con about the NPCs however, is that they overuse the same NPC around the different places you'll visit. (SPOILERS AHEAD) And besides bosses, there's only three types of enemies, and three species of enemies you'll fight, with maybe two or three I missed. Three types, one for each species, makes 9 different varients besides bosses. However, now to think on the bright side, there's some nice humor in the game that made me let out a 'ha!' every once in a while. I did NOT get my copy on *AHEM*, however, I payed the full 10 dollar asking price (Or I might have gotten it on sale on Steam, I don't remember), but however much I payed, I believe it's worth my money entirely.7/10, a good game for an okay asking price.

This is the best game I have ever played!It has AAA graphics and state of the art anti-aliasing(FXAA).Everybody is composed of big potatoes, which is a very original and brilliant design idea, congrats to the devs!The story is extremely gripping, the heroes are awesome, the battle mechanics are the best I've seen. Clearly current AAA studios should borrow more from this game.The sounds are beautiful, and thankfully they continue playing even after closing the game. The music is a catchy little loop, which is repeated all over the game.  I love that this game does not allow you to change your resolution to foolish ones(e.g. 1920x1080) and instead crashes when you try to mess up your resolutions. There are two types of houses:One where you can find very strange bakugan, which can multiply instantly, and one where you can find kind humans giving you lots of candy.When you engage in battle with the bakugan, you can watch a pleasant little cutscene where your heroes turn into transformers and you can use many unique abilties to fight: attacking and blocking.The fight system utilizes the keys E,SHIFT,SPACE.Quick time events are used and explained perfectly, the gameplay designers sure had loads of skill.Thanks for this excellent game for not a cent more than 10 euros.I know for sure, that this game will reshape the gaming industry altogether.11/10 Made my life worth living.Thanks for this masterpiece, developers.

												This has been sitting in my library for a while so I quickly played through it as some after-work relaxation. I must say, I should've played this game sooner! Costume Quest is a highly adorable game with witty puns (sometimes it's worth being a bully in the game to get the quirky responses), cool old-school RPG style fights and a fair leveling up curve. The game is pretty linear, and from the build of it, I'd say this is more aimed for the younger gamers than an old veteran like me. Even with that in mind, it's a relatively short and fun game for all generations! I'm pretty sure I'll keep this around and re-play it someday with a young gamer-in-training in my lap. :)			"

												Super linear with the illusion of choice and control. It's like an extremely dumbed-down version of any of the Final Fantasy games. Plays like a game made for kids but designed for grown-ups. But you like this one not for the way the game plays. It's about the story and the atmosphere. (I mean, this is a Double Fine game after all). But it's a very good time, definitely. Don't get me wrong. I love the trick-or-treating atmosphere. The fighting. The odd humor. And the fact that there is no voice-acting, just silence and text (this is really creepy, in a good but unintentionally Lynchian way). Get the expansion/DLC too. It's loads of fun!			"

												One word: ""AWESOME"". That's just because I can't spell out that Supercalifragisomething word though. That and I'm too lazy to look it up. I could not stop once I started the game. Costumes that turn into the real deal, a really cool excuse to hoard candy (Costume Quest: ""Saving the World One Candy at a Time""), and an adventure with little to no adult supervision? Who wouldn't want some of THAT for even just a single night? Count me in! Hygiene-wise, the whole rummaging garbage bins and picking up candy from dirty floors was kind of questionable, but I'm guessing nobody gives a ♥♥♥♥ about these things.

												It seems that Double Fine can do no wrong, IMO. During Brutal Legend's troubled time with no publisher, Tim Shaefer let the leads on that project brainstorm with their own smaller teams. Tasha Harris, Brutal Legend's lead animator, pitched the idea for Costume Quest and THQ gave it the greenlight and here we are with a great family-friendly turn-based RPG adventure game sugar-coated with a fun Halloween theme.Setup: you are one of two fraternal twins in a new neighbourhood and you have to go out and make friends on Halloween. Your NPC brother/sister dresses up as a candy corn piece and is promptly candy-napped by a goblin (called Grubbins) and you along with new friends take off through your neighbourhood, the mall, and eventually to the Grubbins' world to rescue your sibling.Mechanics: combat employs a very basic turn-based RPG engine with quick-time events to bolster your attacks/defenses a la Super Mario RPG (press X at the right time to defend, match the on-screen commands to do extra damage, etc).There is a 'collection' aspect to the game as well in the form of stamps that you can apply to your costume as buffs, granting you extra active/passive battle effects. Mini games and side quests scattered throughout the different locations are fun diversions that are key to getting all of the aforementioned stickers, money (candy--it's Halloween after all!) and other consumeables to use in battle.You will also find random items that when combined with a 'design', form a new costume that can be equipped by any member in your party. Each costume has a special attack/support action and by mixing and matching, you'll definitely find a combination that suites your style of play.The original story and Grubbins on Ice campaigns together have a decent length. I can't remember how long I spent completing them and Steam didn't log my playtime since I played the entire game while at sea with no internet connection (damn you, Steam achievements!) I actually had to boot it up again to play for at least 5 minutes before Steam would let me post my review.. makes sense.I'll just use it as another excuse for a second playthrough, probably around Christmas time ;)TLDR: what you want, Cliffs Notes?

												CQ is another great game from double fine.The story follows a brother and sister as they attempt  to save their little town from monsters at halloween. It is all told through the use of ""speech bubbles"" around key characters. The game is pretty reminiscent of JRPGs, but without any specific classes or skills, just leveling and different constumes with different abilities. When playing the game, you're penned in to one of a few key areas. These areas are pretty large though, so there's always a fair amount to explore, such as finding hidden coffins [rather than chests], and quests to complete. When you encounter a monster, you'll be thrown into a fight scene very similar to those used in JRPGs. I've played this game with a controller and with keyboard/mouse. Given my experiences, and the fact that this was originally for consoles, I would definitely recommend using a controller to play it. However, keyboard/mouse also works well.The 3d model graphics are very cartooney, but very good as this fits well with the concept of using speech bubbles when characters are talking. They give a very nice impression of the ""feel"" of halloween. The design of the kids is also very good, although there could have been more diversity in the adult characters. It would have been nice if the camera wasn't locked in to a specific angle, however.The soundtrack to this game is simple and not very overbearing when you're in the environment, which us good, but the music during cutscenes can get a bit repetitive. There is a distinct lack of voice acting, and I did feel that the game was a bit let down by this lack, but this didn't detract too much from my enjoyment. You may be in trouble if you can't read speech bubbles.This game includes both CQ and it's DLC ""grubbins on ice"". GOI is much of the same high quality, but set in winter.CQ is a very good game, if quite short. It's not extremely challenging, but it has a very good story and art style. Definitely worth playing if you want a simple JRPG type game, or are a fan of double fine.			"

There are lots of side-quests and things to collect along the way, which appeals to me a lot. The costumes and battle opening sequences for each costume are really well done. The one thing I struggled with initially was the mechanics during battles; you have to press the specified key at exactly the right time to execute a successful attack or defence which took me a while to get my head around! After a while, though, I found this aspect to be enjoyable and the difficulty curve was just right, I think.

												Like all Double Fine games, this game is unique and well worth a play.  The characters are cute and celebrates the spirit of childhood imagination.  This is essentially in JRPG style where random encounters are replaced with trick-r-treating door to door with monsters lurking in some of the houses.  The various costumes are fun to experiment with and require different timing mechanics when attacking.  This did not work at all for me using a keyboard, so I recommend a XBox controller since it seems the natural way to play.

You may be in trouble if you can't read speech bubbles.This game includes both CQ and it's DLC ""grubbins on ice"". GOI is much of the same high quality, but set in winter.CQ is a very good game, if quite short. It's not extremely challenging, but it has a very good story and art style. Definitely worth playing if you want a simple JRPG type game, or are a fan of double fine.			"

												Custom Quest is a short adventure with a noticeable mark for cheesiness and some sort of humor. It's an enjoyable game, the thing is that both due the mechanics and plot choices the game really shows which kind of system it was developed for (consoles/mobile consoles). Overall the gameplay is kind of very repetitive, you end doing the same kind of thing in a few different levels (+1 with Grubbins on Ice). The chars skills do vary and the plot somewhat works but in the end you tend to: loot around-> knock at the houses -> start a fight -> and again loot around. In the end it's fun, the visual style is remarkable, and the animations are funny. It's worth playing, but it could've been better.			"

												A game about the fantasy of children who can use ""special abilities"" and fight monsters with their Halloween costumes. The idea is great and very well implented.Basically you take the role of a boy or a girl und walk from house to house in order to collect sweets (the currency of the game) and battle monsters for experience points. Soon you are going to find a group and a load of new costumes. Each costume has its own exploration and battle abilities which have to be used to progress in the innovative quests. The gameplay is addicting and you always feel that you are getting closer to your goals - however, the battles become quite boring after a while because they are, except for the bosses, nearly always the same and they tend to be to easy.The game is not very long, but it knows how to entertain. The humour is a bit childish but it fits perfectly to the game's atmosphere and the graphics are nice to look at.You could say it's a typical Double Fine game: short and simple but also very innovative and entertaining.

												Like all Double Fine games, this game is unique and well worth a play.  The characters are cute and celebrates the spirit of childhood imagination.  This is essentially in JRPG style where random encounters are replaced with trick-r-treating door to door with monsters lurking in some of the houses.  The various costumes are fun to experiment with and require different timing mechanics when attacking.  This did not work at all for me using a keyboard, so I recommend a XBox controller since it seems the natural way to play.

												This is a SUPER cute and charming RPG. It's short but sweet, the battles are pleasantly paced and aren't random, and it's got a lot of personality and funny dialogue.

Has some nice puzzly aspects to it too. Exploring and collecting candy and bashing everything with your Halloween bucket is very addictive and satisfying.And the free DLC, Grubbins on Ice, is a great addition that adds another, say, 2 hours to the game in the form of a new area to explore that continues from the base game.Overall, if you have an RPG itch you want to scratch but without having to dump 70 hours and endure long introductions/expositions/worldbuilding, or if you want to get into a festive mood, this is a simple and fun game for that. This is a perfect example of an RPG without a bunch of padding, short, sweet, simple fun, and a good game for all ages that really captures the spirit of Halloween and childhood imagination.			"

I can definitely see myself playing this game every october. Cute, funny dialogue at times, and cutscenes/dialogue IS skippable. Such a beautiful feature <3 BUT not needed for this game. The cutscenes were interesting enough to want to watch every time. Some of the costume transformations were hilarious, others just epic. Towards the end of the game, however, the fights started feeling super repetitive, so I kept switching the costumes up to keep some interest. Overall, this is a pretty laid back, easy game and definitely hit the spot for the type of game I want to play around October. I bought the Costume Quest 1 & 2 bundle on sale for about $4. So beyond worth it. I cannot recommend this game enough, especially if you are new to games. Just do yourself a favor and get this game <3			"

												Costume Quest is a Halloween themed JRPG-like game made by Double Fine Productions.This game is about a quest to save your sibling by fighting, trick or treating and getting apples from the barrels without using your hands.During your adventure, you will get different costumes and stickers that will somewhat allow you to change the flow of battles.Each costume got its own special attack or support moves, stickers are acting like changeable buffs and basic attacks involve different quick time events (depend on the costume) in which a successful QTE will score a critical damage and allow the combat to progress faster. This game is very fun, though gets reparative halfway through the game, I would still highly recommend it for the story and it's humor.			"

												Costume Quest is one of my favorites - unique and dripping with the innocence of halloween most of us are too old to experience anymore, it's the type of game that makes you smile on its premise and presentation alone. Throw in fun - if simple - game mechanics, good humor, endearing characters and a plot out of a saturday morning cartoon: it's a really good package, and as something I can replay every year, it's more-than worth the TEN dollar asking price.At its core it's a super simple turn-based RPG, but even its RPG mechanics have fun mechanics much like those from the original Paper Mario. You can fare better in battle with timed button presses to increase damage and defense. There are battle stamps that work like the badges from Paper Mario, which give each character a boost or a special command. It's really not that deep, but the fights are just difficult enough to require some kind of strategy. Not because they're complex or anything, but because the enemies will simply overpower you with force if you don't have a battle stamp equipped and aren't successful with the timed button presses.For example - the Statue of Liberty costume has a special attack (which charge up through using regular attacks) that heals the party a small amount. It's a very small amount, but it can make or break a fight. The game is good about pitting you against enemies that are just a little bit tougher than your party, so you can't just breeze through them. There are also no random battles: all enemies appear on the screen, unless you meet them through trick-or-treating, and they don't regenerate - so there is a set number of battles per zone. This works well with the mechanics, as there are set items and experience you earn from the enemies you fight. That means you really must fight every enemy in the zone to get the full amount of experience, candy (currency) and items afforded to you. You move between transitional dungeons and hub zones, where you have to trick-or-treat at houses or stores to progress through the story. You won't be able to do that all right away, though - you'll need to do random quests for kids around the zones, collect candy, bob for apples, trade stuff, and find parts to make new costumes which grant you new field abilities, so you can progress further. The zones are really detailed and oozing with character - they're fun to run around and don't usually outstay their welcome. My only gripes are without a map, it can be hard to find that one last house you need to trick-or-treat at to progress the story, or that one last enemy you need to fight. Also some of the dungeons drag on a little bit - but as I write below, if you're finding the game to drag, you probably just need to take a break.The plot is simple - your sister is kidnapped and you have to find her. There are goblins running around, but the adults think they're just kids in costumes. The goblins want candy for some reason, there's a main villain witch, etc. etc. It's really cute, and serviced by some great humor. The game is almost south-parkian in the way that the kids have gotten over their heads in a very real situation to which the adults are totally oblivious. It makes it funnier when the adults names are all literally ""grown up"". Costume Quest is a game to play in small spurts, as otherwise the mechanics will begin to get repetitive and you'll lose sight of the charm and atmosphere that makes the game so enjoyable. When I say repetitive, I mean the combat and actual field exploration can, yes, get really samey. It's best to play maybe half a zone at once and then take a break. You really owe it to this game and yourself to enjoy every minute of it, and that can't happen if you're just going through the motions. Costume Quest is a gem. It captures the feel of Halloween perfectly and if you're in the right mood, it can make you feel like a kid again. Like you really are out trick-or-treating with some friends, in a world of make-believe. Buy this, play it (during halloween), and then play the Grubbins on Ice DLC (that comes with it) during Christmas. I haven't actually played the Grubbins on Ice DLC yet, but I've heard great things about it. Albeit - it's a short little extra side-story that only take a few hours.			"

It's short but the length is nice for what it is, there are numerous laugh-out-loud moments with the dialogue, the environments are detailed and look quite nice, and the plot, while simple, is pretty enjoyable. The game is very easy in terms of its turn-based battles, so if you're looking for a challenge, look somewhere else. I do think it works very well as an ""introductory RPG"", though, and can be used to teach newcomers to the genre about basic RPG tactics like prioritizing enemies, diversifying your party's classes, making strategic decisions about abilities, and choosing when to use special moves so they will be most effective. A solid game that makes for a fun Halloween night.			"

												Don't let the Saturday morning cartoon art and story fool you (this game is not really suitable for most young kids), this is pretty close to an old school turn base JRPG, albeit a lite version. Think FF3 with it's job system and a dash of QTE for DMG/DEF and you get an idea of what to expect. Finding the right combo of costumes and battle stamps that compliment the party is key (to boss battles mostly), although I did find one combo that was a little to OP. Also fast QTE reflexes can be a boon for survivability.That said, sadly since it's not a high budget game, it's pretty short and not very deep in story and the battle system, but all in all it was fun and I had more than a few good laughs. I literally had a smile on my face the whole way through. So, if you like old school JRPG gaming and enjoy silly/zany cartoons do yourself a favor and check it out.			"

												Costume Quest is a carefully distilled J-RPG with a well written, light hearted story and solid gameplay. It's a good pick-up-and-play game in a genre that usually requires days of investment, with likeable characters and just enough depth. Normally, quick-action sequences ruin the pacing of a game for me, but they are well implemented here in a way that feels almost intuitive, if still a bit repetetive, after a few battles. When the main storyline wraps up, the included Grubbins on Ice add-on storyline lets you start with all your stuff from the main quest, and includes new costumes (character classes) and stamps (bonus abilities). I'd recommend this for kids or adults who don't need dimension-spanning save-all-of-time-and-space plots, ridiculously complex leveling systems, or spiky-haired, ambiguously gendered anti-heroes in their J-RPGs.

												Don't let the Saturday morning cartoon art and story fool you (this game is not really suitable for most young kids), this is pretty close to an old school turn base JRPG, albeit a lite version. Think FF3 with it's job system and a dash of QTE for DMG/DEF and you get an idea of what to expect. Finding the right combo of costumes and battle stamps that compliment the party is key (to boss battles mostly), although I did find one combo that was a little to OP. Also fast QTE reflexes can be a boon for survivability.That said, sadly since it's not a high budget game, it's pretty short and not very deep in story and the battle system, but all in all it was fun and I had more than a few good laughs. I literally had a smile on my face the whole way through. So, if you like old school JRPG gaming and enjoy silly/zany cartoons do yourself a favor and check it out.			"

												Ein sehr gelungenes rundenbasiertes RPG mit tiefer Story....Es ist Halloween süsses oder saures ist das Motto im Spiel und natürlich verkleiden.Mit der Phantasie der Kinder bekommt jedes Kostüm seine einzigartigen Fähigkeiten  , mit denen Ihr Eure Schwester die als Bonbon verkleidet und somit vertauscht wird von den dummen Gremlins retten.Das Spiel ist im Grunde recht linear allerdings wirkt alles zusammen und es wird nicht langweilig.Also startet das Spiel sammelt Material baut euch damit eue Kostüme , sammelt süssigkeiten tauscht diese gegen kampfbonis und rettet eure schwester und Halloween!! Für RPG fans der alten Schule ein Muss !! In keiner Sekunde entäuschendes Gameplay!			"

												Costume Quest is a very cute RPG-like game by Double Fine, the makers of Psychonauts and Stacking. As per usual, the design is drawn in a slightly infantile fashion, but makes it all the more adorable. The story is enjoyable for children and adults that still are part child themselves. The combat is turn-based and can be varied by wearing different costumes and some other power-ups. Fans of Double Fine games will be pleased by allusions to other of their titles within the game. I won't give it away, so play it yourself. It counts about 5 hours and the DLC is another approximate two hours. Really enjoyable!			"

												Costume Quest is one of those games that you get from a bundle and it just sits in your library for months on end. That happened to me and then I thought that I should probably play the game. So I did and I found it to be an immersive RPG that should not be over looked. The whole concept of this game is great its something original combining turn based strategy with humour and Halloween. It is something that is definitely worth playing.			"

												This game features some big problems. The biggest two being there is no map screen, and the battle system is so stupidly simple, it's actually pretty offensive.Map screen however, is the biggest issue with this game. The neighborhood is LARGE, and is VERY easy to get lost in. With no easily accessible way to see where you're going, it's too easy to get lost in. Do you need to make it so that objectives are on the map? No. But a way should be included so you can at least figure out where you currently are, and where you have already explored.The Battle System litterally consists of 2 buttons... A basic attack and an ultimate attack. That's it. There's no strategy, no extra abilities, nothing.The story is at least interesting and the graphics are pretty good.If you're an older gamer, I would stay far away from this. There's nothing there for you. However, if you have a younger gamer you'd like to introduce to the RPG genre, this would be a good game for them.			"

												I didn't know exactly what to expect when I installed Costume Quest. I was a big fan of Tim Schafer games when I was a kid (Grim Fandango and Full Throttle are some of my favorite 90s video game memories), but found Double Fine ventures like the much-loved Psychonauts to be marred by either clunky gameplay or hideous art decisions.  But Costume Quest proves that Tim Schafer's still got it, and within 20 minutes I was a fan again.Sure, the game doesn't employ high-end graphical techniques, the traditional JRPG style combat moves can take too long, and the game is quite short. It doesn't have a ""deep"" story, and doesn't really try to say much, either. But the subtley perfect art, the cute-but-not-sickeningly-so character designs, and witty dialog overcome any shortcomings.It's not complex, but it's one of the most ""perfect"" games I've played in years.Recommended to anyone with good taste, and essential to any gamer who remembers what the 90s was like.

It plays like a really simple stripped down JRPG, just set around halloween instead of around the coming of the great big evil that wipes out the world. You pick up party members, extra outfits that change play style, and it's a nice simple story with some half-decent mini-games. If you've already gotten a few RPGs under your belt you'll likely be bored out of your mind, but as I said a great ""my first JPRG"" for kids around 8-12 yrs old.			"

A Halloween EpicBecause of this game, I now have a soft spot for Double Fine and will be keeping an eye out for future projects. It's a turn-based RPG that kids will enjoy but adults will understand some of the more subtle humor. I couldn't help but be reminded of The Nightmare Before Christmas—you even get to battle as a Jack Skellington-like pumpkin—but less manic. If you're looking for difficult, intricate gameplay, this isn't your game. It's got a lot of charm, funny dialogue, feel good narrative, and a cute art style. What other game would let you duke it out as a vampire, unicorn, and a pirate all at once (my favorite in-game trio)? Definitely recommended for anyone who wants to relax with a nice story about sibling bonding and friendship.10/10 - JUNEBUG'S FAVORITES			"

												Costume Quest is a cute little casual game with a great sense of humor. Although the gameplay is very simplistic and the fighting system is fairly boring the short game length and funny dialog makes it forgivable.The game starts you as an aspiring trick or treater. Unfortunately disaster strikes when your sibling is abducted by goblins and you have to go rescue him/her. The game plays quite simply, you have to goto various house to trick and treat which gives you candy, the game's currency. You battle goblins and other monsters as you go along and through completion various quests you unlock new costumes.The combat plays quite simple. Yourself and 2 companions go into battle each wielding a costume that will grant them different powers and you then take turns attacking the enemies until one side is killed off. Each costume has only one regular attack and one special move they can perform every three turns but to try and break up the monotone a little each attack requires you to perform a quicktime event to maximize your damage.The graphics are fairly simple but the style is sharp and the locations have a great Halloween look to them which really helps. The sound and music is nothing impressive but it doesn't detract anything from the experience either.All in all it's a cute little that gives you a few hours of fun however the simple gameplay and short length means it's only worth getting as a bargain title.

												This is an adorable take on the standard turn-based RPG. As sweet as its subject matter, Costume Quest puts you in the shoes of a fourth grader who is tasked with rescuing his (or her) sibling from the clutches of a villainess whose evil schemes is going to wreck Halloween.The game features standard RPG fare such as leveling up, hit points, and turn-based combat. Instead of classes you don costumes which grant you special powers, which can be augmented with special battle stickers.I loved the art style, the humor, and the fact that I have a game about trick or treating. My only quibble was that combat was too easy, with the exception of the final boss in Grubbins on Ice, I don't think I lost a single battle. But this is probably due to enemies not respawning. So, instead of a standard JRPG where you're forced to level grind for hours against a never ending horde of enemies, you need to discover the perfect balance of costumes and battle stickers amongst your party to succeed. In this regard, I feel that Costume Quest is a very newbie friendly RPG.			"

												So, I'd like to say I've been putting off buying this game for ages.Literally, ages. What happened was with the recent summer sale in June, I bought the bundle of both games for 6$.Heres what I have to say,++ GREAT humor and storyline, (""Gus from section 5, your wife is worried SICK."" and the kid in a banana suit who said, ""This is a total banana-fest"". LOL.++ really lovely backgrounds, ++also you get to choose if you wanna be a girl or boy, which was not what I was expecting when I saw ""your sister does this"" and etc.,The game itself is really short which is a bummer to me. It has four levels, but they're all long in their own way. You have to trick or treat and solve an issue in each level, and you can play hide-and-seek (well its optional actually), and they'll upgrade your trick or treat bags to cuter and cooler things, you can make optional costumes in the game which can have a big effect on your battle; (I'm not a battling kind of person, but this game was fun and cute.) Battle stamps are the best. The Grubbin's on Ice was really interesting too, its an add on to the game's ending.I just feel sad its a bit short for me.Just a bit over 8 hours and I've finished it with all with all achivements to boot with no guide.You shouldn't need a guide for this game! It's fun and good like that!			"

												Costume Quest is much like Halloween candy: fun-sized and sweet.  Though it’s not a long game, it’s very enjoyable and it doesn’t overstay its welcome.  It employs JRPG elements that are reminiscent of the Paper Mario games and the mechanics are simple and accessible.  But the big draw is the charm that is stuffed into every aspect of the story and characters.  I thoroughly recommend joining Reynold and Wren in saving Halloween no matter what time of year it is.

												I didn't ejoy too much this game for some aspects of it. First of all, this game is the same always, turn-based battles, looking for sweets, but battles are always the same. i haven't completed the whole game but I'm quite sure that if in 4 hours it doesn't change, it will not change after that...  Also for me is frustrating that sometimes even thought you do everything well in a battle you cannot win in any way because enemies are too high level. Apart from that, I loved how this game is designed, graphics are beautiful, costumes look great and abilities and powers from these are pretty cool. I wouldn't recommend this game just because I felt so frustrated playing it and i quited. Maybe some day i will finish it but i think i will not do it at the moment...			"

   My Playthrough   Youtube Playlist    The Review I really enjoyed this game. The story and characters are fun and pristine. The creative art-style works well with the beautiful cell shaded graphics. And as a plus the PC version comes with the DLC Grubbins on Ice for free. The only issues that I have with the game is that the frame-rates are capped at 30fps and that ending of Grubbins on Ice is a cliffhanger. Double Fine Productions have stated that the game engine can't handle 60fps but they may one day have an update that fixes this. All in all this is a great game for all ages.  "

												Hope this will help other gamers, have fun! ^.^Costume Quest is a fun game, it's basically the grinch stole christmas but change the grinch with candy maniac skeleton monster and chrismas with halloween. you are playing as 2 siblings, later 1 of them together with friends, to save the other sibling who was kidnapped and posibly save haloween :)) you can equip diferent costumes for diferent abilities in turn based battles, as well as stamps to get bonuses;Cons:- short game;- not really any replayability;Pros:- short game but fun;- good variety of costume (thus abilities in combat + bonus from stamps);- cute story + side story(afterstory i guess);- not hard to 100%;- nice medium sized world, but fun to explore;- dialogue is so-so;			"

												I've first played Brutal Legend, and now Costume Quest. Once again, Double Fine leaves me with mixed feelings.Costume Quest seems to be the kind of game I would enjoy a lot when I was a kid! Essencially, you're Reynolds, and it's Halloween. In the midst of trick-or-treating, there are monsters, stealing all the candy, who ended up kidnapping your sister. So, you put on your most badass costume and go look for her, fighting the monsters with the aid of your costume's powers, along with some friends you meet along the way.That sounds like something I would enjoy immensively when I was younger! And I still enjoyed it today, but it's not quite my kind of game.The game is a mixture of an adventure/platformer game, with a JRPG(ish) type combat. In combat, each character has a normal attack and a special attack, which takes turns to recharge. Instead of simply choosing which attack you want, there's also a QTE event that you have to do in order to boost your normal attacks. Each costume the character wears influences their attacks, and have a very unique style to them. There are also stickers you can collect while exploring the world, which will then give you a passive or active ability in battle.You have from 1 to 3 characters, and the same with the enemies. Each team has their attack turn, until the battle is finished.I didn't find the combat system very deep, with the exception of the Boss fights, which sometimes required a certain ability to be beaten, making the player experiment with the different costumes until he beat it. That was cool, but other than that, it felt a bit too shallow.To its favor thought, animation was top-notch, and every attack made you feel like a badass doing it.Outside of combat, you go around collecting candy, sometimes from door to door, other times just in the environment. You also interact with NPCs, with a very DoubleFine-esque dialogue which is always welcome. You have 4 zones (3 in the main game, 1 in the DLC), each with its theme, and a group of side quests. These side quests help the player explore the world, and also provide rewards. I didn't find them particularly interesting, but they were on the way, so it did not detract from the experience. I just think they could have done something more with those sidequests. There are quite a few ""secrets"" and Easter Eggs hidden around, making exploration quite rewarding to do as well!Besides, you'll need to explore to find different costume parts, which is the best part of the game, since each costume has its twist wether inside or outside of combat.The various costumes reminded me of some 90s cartoons, and others were just Halloween themed. They didn't every feel out of place. A good concept well implemented!The graphics aren't fantastic in terms of fidelity, but it's DoubleFine, so you know what to expect! They're highly stylized and unique, giving the game exactly the vibe they were looking for.Music was up there as well, really enjoyed it!Most of the achievements were mainly there to get the player to actually go out for the sidequests and different costumes so they're pretty standard... But, there was one about a Stacking Easter Egg as well. Nothing noteworthy, but it had a few achievements that could lead the player into a better direction when playing it, so that's good!So... due to the combat's lack of depth, it often felt a bit too repetitive, and so did some of the sidequests, since they're the same style for each zone. I get why it is like that, but since I didn't find them very interesting, having them in each zone felt a bit repetitive as well.But that's my biggest complain with this game. Other than that, I've had a blast with it, specially with the Boss fights! The game isn't very challenging (if it seems so, you're doing something in the wrong intended order, which happened to me), but it doesn't leave too much space for failure. Still, with its combat system, one couldn't expect anything too strategical.It looks and sound great, it's definitely an unique game, which takes you about 6-9 hours to finish, without and with DLC, respectively. It's not something I'm likely to go back to, since I've finished it, but it was a good experience nonetheless. It's a streamlined JRPG, with a twist!I'd definitely recommend it if it catches your attention at all. Great game, DoubleFine strikes again!			"

												Gameplay wise it plays like your typical JRPG: You run around, fight bad guys in turn-based battles, collect new ""gear"", level up, do sidequests and find new companions.The twist? You're a bunch of kids that use their Halloween costumes to transform into fighters! It's not long or deep, I'd love more costumes and I really miss voice acting, but apart from that it's great little game, I can totally recommend.			"

												Costume Quest is a classic RPG with turn-based combat mixed with Double Fine style. You play a child out on halloween teaming up with other kids and fighting monsters, all while trick-or-treating.  Instead of the usual RPG equipment, the halloween costumes you wear transform into full size versions during combat, providing their associated powers to your characters.  It all meshes together perfectly, as you would expect from a Double Fine game.I'm not sure what else there is to say.  It's cute, charming, and a solid RPG experience that doesn't feel dull and repetitive like many of these types of RPGs do.  My only complaints are that the controls are a bit sluggish and the game is locked at 30 fps which will hopefully be addressed in a patch now that Double Fine has the rights to the game back.			"

												Take the worst Paper Mario game you can think of. Remove all of the items, character skills, partners, and so on. Limit your party to only one customization badge each. The combat is now reduced to only ""attack"", ""run away"", and ""limit break"".No specific enemy types to regret using a specific move on, no special properties to watch out for, just straight up hit, be hit, and occasionally get the rare opportunity for a one-shot heal or all-enemies attack, for hours on end.Sound like fun? No? Well somebody thought it was a good idea and made it anyway. That's this game. And sadly, this is one of the last games DoubleFine has made that was actually ""decent"" in any way, shape, or form.			"

												So before I start, THIS GAME IS MEANT FOR CHILDREN!! And I'm recommending it on that behalf, If you are a hardcore gamer THIS GAME ISN'T FOR YOU.Story (8/10)The story isn't bad for a children game, but it's a bit lame for older audience. A kid saves his sibling on Halloween night. a bit long and unrealistic (for one night), but it's fiction, so who cares. As an adult I liked the story at the beginning, but for a game meant for children it wasn't that simply put and the lack of audio narration makes a barrier between the child and the story.Sounds (6/10)This is one of the worst aspects of the game, and the reason for that is the lack of narration or sounding for the characters.In a game heavily based on story with a lot of dialogues, FOR CHILDREN I think that is a huge problem. What takes me 7 secs to read might take a child 1-2 mins to read, and that's a deal breaker.Other than that, the game has good in-game music, and atmospheric music when entering some danger zones made a good time for me, and I think will more for a child.Graphics (8/10)For a casual children game, the graphics are very good, I won't say they are mind blowing ones, but they are colourful enough to catch children's eyes, and decent enough for this type of games.Gameplay (8.5/10)I think the most interesting aspect of thi game -for children- is the gameplay. It's way complicated than the ordinary children game, but it's way simpler than a MOBA or RPG. I think this game might be a nice introduction for children to use controller (I haven't used one to test it to be honest). Also there's a lot of side objectives those are pretty interesting and the different interactions between different costumes (although it's not that great of a deal) may be one of the most challenging aspects for children.If I have a kid and I want him/her to start hardcore gaming this is where I might start.BUT... it's so repetitive in fights that for a hardcore gamer it'll be extremely lame. so be aware of that.Overall (7.8/10)If you are getting this game for a kid, I think it's a good gift, just be aware of the repetitiveness of it. And the kid may suffer because of the dialogue if the kid reads slowly. Other than that, the game is good. It has sequel that I haven't played so I don't know how much it has improved, but I hope they have fixed the issues I mentioned.I'll definitly recommend it for a child.P.S. I say this again... If you are hardcore gamer that only enjoys AAA games you shouldn't even consider this one....			"

												Costume Quest is a ""small"" INDIE RPG Game with a huge lovely atmosphere of Halloween. The game is short (you can enjoy it around 6~8 hours for both stories) but the story and the quests are so well made that you don't mind the shortness. Only the battles are boring after playing awhile, but for a INDIE RPG game they are still enjoyable - and you can press the animations away if you have seen it a 100th time. So if this game goes on STEAM Sale 75% you must buy it! Even for the full price (8,99€ at this time) it's worth of its money.Best INDIE RPG Game I've played so far			"

Your goals are to trick-or-treat all the houses, grab some costumes & save your twin sister from the evil hands of Dorsilla, Big Bones and Atraxia. Battle is turn based kinda like Southpark: Stick of Truth with cool transformations of your halloween costumes. Grab the game! You will not be disappointed.

												Fun and cute little rpg game. Recommended for those who just want to play an rpg without the huge time investment.Pros:-Cute-no grinding required (unless you want to 100% the game, and even then very little grinding is required)-short-lovable cast of characters-interesting dynamic where you're not really pigeon holed into making each character follow a specific role, lots of room for variation and you can always switch up your stats/abilities.Cons:-short, only took me 9 hours to 100% the whole game-movement can be a bit janky, I got stuck on the environment a lot-dialog is slow.Overall I recomment this game to anyone who just wants a short casual style rpg with a cute factor.

It's also relatively short, so for those interested in playing an RPG but don't have many hours to whittle away this may be something to consider. Either way it's definately worth playing.			"

												Well after playing the game for a while I had to change my recomendation because I was lost in it's Cutzi ways. Well sometimes it was a bit to tough for my taste but only because I misunderstood the battelstamps, you have to assign one for each character or they do absolutly nothing. So it is an easy and charming game with some twits and nice sets of ceneries. So in all if you look for a satisfying game that is just like a vacation from all the hard games around here, pick this one. Expecially if you search for something cute to play over Halloween.The Negative Aspects:The problem is that the controls feel stiff, and that is pretty rare for a PC game. It feels more fluent with a controller with analog sticks but it is ruined by the quick time events. While in the keymenu where you can rebind the keys they are labeled with 1, 2, 3 and 4 and so on (Also some keys are not bindable and just bindthemselve as they feel like) in the game they are indicated with xbox360 controller keys. Which makes this game impossible to play with a PlayStation controller or any other not xbox360 controller, (except maybe an SNES controller but no analogsticks so the stiff feeling is back). And you may think, it can't be that bad with the keyboard, well you have to precisly manouver trough seom ramps while speeding up.Also I am very disapointed that there are no voice actors. I mean it is fine but the text scroles to fast and also the big bubbles block the view.			"

												Okay, I'm not gonna judge the game unfairly since I haven't even played it for a full hour. But let me quickly list the pros and cons from what I noticed so far from that short gameplay:Pros: Cute original story, great to play during October or even Halloween if you wanna show off to your friends the game. It's hard to find decent RPGs out there that are unique and fun to play really. I give this one a 9/10Cons: The one problem I have with this game, reason why it didn't get 10/10 is on some scenes, the text bubbles go by automatically, and at some points, sometimes fast. I'm a fast typer, but my reading isn't bullet-fast. If this game could make it to where you can press ""Spacebar"" on ALL text bubbles (or at LEAST add the ability to enable or disable it in the Options settings), then this game would get that 10/10.Other than that, that's it. I'm sure I'll get around to finishing this game at some point, but I may just wait till next year around October. Have too many games on my plate as is I'm trying to knock off.			"

												8.5/10Costume Quest is a perfect game for friends and family to play on Halloween! The gameplay is smooth, graphics are clean, and the sound effects are pretty good too. The story is scripted with simplicity but is loaded with mildly witty humor, which I enjoyed. I found the battles to be somewhat repetitive at first, but the costume choices and battle stamps collected throughout the game made it all better. It took me about 9 hours to collect every item and finish every mission in both Costume Quest and Grubbins on Ice (part 2). Even if I had paid full price for the game, $10 is pretty cheap for that much entertainment. Great job Double Fine Productions.			"

												Cute little RPG game that is quite addictive. I love that all of the costumes have their own in-battle special ability. The first time I got into battle I was reminded of the South Park episode that involved anime. The quests are simple. Every chapter you end up needing to find kids, find cards to trade, and trick or treat a number of places. There are some optional quests to complete for all you completionists.Well worth the play through if you like cutesie no stress rpg games with wisecracks to make you giggle.			"

 An amazingly cute turn-base rpg with charming designsThis game is just to cute that it deservs a lawsuit, my heart almost melted of joy, not just for its charming level design, but for the storyline too.The story is pretty much about two brothers(twins) that only want to have THE best halloween of their lives by filling their little baskets with treats, sadly they stumb upon a candy theft operation set by a witch and her group of creeps who wants to steal all the candies to feed an evil lord, so she can be granted passage to their world.But an halloween wouldn´t be an halloween without good old Trick or Treat right?In this game, you dont just fight monsters, you are also able to knock doors and say the magic word for some extra sweets, but what i really REALLY love in this game is the dialogs, its funny and just adorable, also these kids have some balls, i remember being scared of monsters and adults in my childhood, but these kids face danger head on with cute foul languages, its funny to see them pick on each other.Definitely a must buy if you´re into turn-based, RPG or just down cute adventure games, i promise you wont regret it.Money well spend.

												If you're a fan of RPG's and Halloween, then this game is a must play. I played and beat this back when it was released on PS3. In spirit of this year's Halloween, I decided to play it again. I was surprised that the expansion campaign was added for FREE, kudos. This isn't some complex RPG, but merely an ode to when we were kids. Imagine how a kid feels and sees the world when he's wearing a cardboard robot costume, only to transform into a huge robot in battle that can fire missles! It's a cute idea and implemented well. That combat system is very simple, but it'll keep your attention since you need to complete various tasks such as ""press button X"" at the correct time. Small sense of accomplishment when you finally gather all the materials for a new costume and test out their special attacks. Took me about 8 hours to complete, still very much worth the 2nd time around. A kid would have a blast with this game, yet it is also for the adult that is also a kid at heart.			"

												Okay, I'm not gonna judge the game unfairly since I haven't even played it for a full hour. But let me quickly list the pros and cons from what I noticed so far from that short gameplay:Pros: Cute original story, great to play during October or even Halloween if you wanna show off to your friends the game. It's hard to find decent RPGs out there that are unique and fun to play really. I give this one a 9/10Cons: The one problem I have with this game, reason why it didn't get 10/10 is on some scenes, the text bubbles go by automatically, and at some points, sometimes fast. I'm a fast typer, but my reading isn't bullet-fast. If this game could make it to where you can press ""Spacebar"" on ALL text bubbles (or at LEAST add the ability to enable or disable it in the Options settings), then this game would get that 10/10.Other than that, that's it. I'm sure I'll get around to finishing this game at some point, but I may just wait till next year around October. Have too many games on my plate as is I'm trying to knock off.			"

												Adventure/RPG-lite where, on your quest to save your little sister, you must find patterns and components used to make over a dozen costumes with useful battle powers and overworld effects that will get you further in the game.  You'll knock on doors and defeat baddies for candy you can use to buy powerups, bob for apples and eyeballs, and complete quests to earn rewards from the townsfolk.  Battle takes place on another screen where your characters are morphed into giant awesome versions of their costumes and combat is turn-based with timed button presses for bonus attack and defense. Difficulty is quite casual, but enough that your costume and powerup choices do have an effect on the outcome. Fun game to 100% and get the achievements for and a great port apparently because I didn't even realize it was a port.  The graphics are nice; didn't even have AA set up and someone asked me how I got AA working in my screenshots.  The game's about 6-8 hours long with DLC included.			"

												5/10Costume Quest is a sweet looking little game, but you need to know what you're getting into. If you're looking for a Halloween themed ride, mostly being held by the hand and just relaxing, you might have fun. The problem is that the game offers no challenge, and grows very repetitive. There are three areas, each of them consisting of the same goals. There's a turn based fighting component but it's so easy that it's little more than an annoyance. It's a cute game for kids but I wouldn't recommend it to a 'gamer.'			"

												Great adventure/FF-combat hybrid from the amazing people at Double Fine. It is to Final Fantasy (and adventure games) what games like Deathspank are to Diablo: simplified, humorous, and story-driven derivations. Costume Quest may not necessarily be the hardest game out there, but it is thoroughly enoyable all the way through. Especially if you have fond nostalgic memories of trick-or-treating.The free dlc/expansion called ""Grubbins on Ice"" that comes with it is also fairly good (it is a sequel, so play it after), however I feel much of my personal enjoyment of the original game came from the accurate recreation of what Halloween used to feel like. I still think there is plenty of room for sequels, but I'd personally like to see a return to Halloween in a town as the primary theme next time. Neighborhoods still have a ton of room they could grow in terms of varying atmosphere and style, so I wouldn't say a sequel back in town would feel redundant.Both the original game and the expansion are full of DF-style humor, as well as lots of side tasks to keep you entertained. This is not a massive game, however, and can be 100% completed in less than ~8 hours (much less if you skip all the cutscenes). Still definitely worth the money, as the experience will leave you satisfied and wanting more.Also, as a diehard DF fan there were a few fantastic references (the Psychonauts shop music at the mall, the Stacking dolls in the mountains), not to mention all the pop-culture jokes.

												It's simple, addictive, short and sweet (pun intended) If you're looking for a compelling story, raw challenge or innovative game play... please look elsewhere.This game is meant as an introductionary game for RPG noobies. It takes elements from Mario RPG / Paper Mario with timed attacks, so the game tricks you in to thinking you're doing more than selecting ""Fight"" from a menu. The costumes are fun to change up, half of them are useless and impractical but they look cool.The challenge does ramp up a bit at the very end and the final boss can be very obnoxious if you don't bring a healing costume in with you. If you enjoy games like Final Fantasy for it's job system and Paper Mario for it's timed button strikes, you'll enjoy this game.Only downside is how slow the game can be at times, having to watch repeated animations over and over before a battle begins... also it can be a tad clunky especially when using the dash feature from the Robot costume... This brings me to final point that it was bad game design on Double Fines part to allow this costume to dash and none of the others... It makes it manditory for you to utilize this first costume at all times meaning it doesn't give you much in the way of variety... Thankfully this was fixed in CQ2 with an actual dash button.The DLC Grubbin's on Ice is around the same length as one of the in game core chapters, 2 hours in length. Worthy addition to the game and links the events of CQ1 and 2 so it's basically manditory to play if you intend to continue your Costume Quest. :P			"

												This is essentially a casual RPG for kids, but I'm reviewing it anyway as an adult.Costume Quest is a very short turn-based RPG, but the highlight of its features are what it doesn't have. It's devoid of pretty much any interesting game system. The slim turn-based combat system present is similar to the Final Fantasy games, but you'll get more depth out of Final Fantasy games or 99% of their copycats. All of the combat uses Quick Time Events as well, which gets old after the second or third combat encounter. Game balance is simple and a little skewed. The game can be difficult (but hardly) when you only have two party members, and its trivially easy once you have three.The overworld is linear. There's a tiny bit of exploration to be had, but not much. There are roughly four quests in the entire game, each repeated several times for each phase of the game: find a card off a monster (combat encounters), bob for apples (simple mini-game), trick or treat houses (random combat encounters), and find six hiding kids (semi-hidden on overworld).The game crashed a few times, and since there is no manual save feature at any time, I lost 15-20 minutes of progress each time. The game plays the same every time.There are costumes to get, which are your battle suits or ""classes"". Variation here is only relevant in the costume's ""special ability"" but the game is so easy that once you have three party members, battle strategy matters little.Graphics meh, sound meh, witty dialogue is OK but not astounding. No voice acting.I don't recommend this game. You can find much better games in all of its genres for cheaper.  If you insist on wanting it, it's worth $2-3 on a sale perhaps. My playtime says 16 hours but that included a long idling session by accident. It's a 5-7 hour game. I'm surprised this game has a sequel. It's popularity seems dependent on the Double Fine brand, which hasn't been the same for me since Spacebase DF and the Broken Age Kickstarter mishandlings.			"

												Just a very boring game. It lack any real depth.  Combat gets stale very very quickly. Story is just mediocre, tried-and-true. Items, a staple in any RPG, for whatever reason is omitted, where Double Fine could have added some 'tongue-in-cheek' elements. The only faint sense of utility or customizations is from the 'Battle Stamps"", which are 'added bonuses' like an extra skill or stats, which seemed meaningless other than the counter-strike or stun skill -- the only one which would give me a chance in battle.The costumes did not offer any stat changes other than the obvious battle mechanic changes. Personally, I was expecting the 'knight' to have a more 'tank-like' role in addition to the 'shield' ability like More HP and lower attack. I'm expecting some differences. You can find yourself very easily overwhelmed in a 2v3 battle with no 'usual' / 'crutch' mechanic to swing the battle in your favor like Items or some OP one-time use ability. Instead you are greeted with persistent in battle costumes (which could have been changed like that of FFX-2 dynamic) and 1 every three turns ""super-skill"" that aligns with the costume chosen. Oh, and the battles consist of you pressing a button to do more dmg or take less damage.I got as far as the mall and just couldnt careless. The story is unique-ish, but the gameplay is just boring and rather... lame.			"

												I strongly advise people playing custom quest 2 over this base on its repativeniss. Both games are like that it’s just those is 3 times as bad compared to 2..Not just that it does not mettle what screen you have I trend this on 20"", 17"" 15"" even 13"" screen. And you most do space or E.; to dough and hit the attack just right to have more demise that might be couse a problem it’s just it is so smell you need to do it just right. Custom quest 1 story was O.K. I built like custom quest 2 was bitter. Base on dentist white is the child her wanted revise for having no cander.In custom quest 1, the watch want's to have some human's and gousts to wake together, Like any other story or movie for intense ghost busters. Even tales of the dark side the movie.For bottering gamblins. Even feather this game has no map you can refice to see of what horses you missed. Even whish you go to 2 worlds with the same with less many tasks, by helping them with there cards.I’m not shying this game is bad, bad I believe psych notes, even go so far; that brutle legend is bitter base on story line.Please do your self a fever, and skip this and buy custom quest 2. Trust me you will not regent it.Thick from Wright Micah			"

												Ummm... The game could be alright if you enjoy nothing but quicktime events and colectable hunting. Personally, not worth the money.Edit: It's an adventure game though. This is what adventure games usually are. I should have also added, the Linux experience is flawless so don't worry about that. Still not my cup of tea though.			"

												Although Halloween have passed this is game that must be played, and would say going to 'trick or treat' would be funny and challenger. So Costume Quest is a Action RPG with a nice concept on it. As you guys already figure it this game takes place on Halloween, where two siblings, Reynold and Wren, will go ask for candies. The player at this point will choose which sibling to play as. One of the siblings will be kidnapped - depend what siblings you choose - and our missions is to find out her he/she is. During our mission, we will make some quest, and personally this was the worst part for me, because the quest are always the same. Costume Quest has 3 levels, the neighborhood, the mall and a carnival, and on all level the quest are the same, go ask for candy, do eat apple game, find some cards, get the costumes, find kids playing hide-and-seek, same thing happens on the DLC despite the level design is different. But if you put that behind your backs the game is really enjoyable, the game's graphics are a cartoonish style - thing that i love - and are well designed and very colorful, Costume Quest is more than colorful, is nice piece of art! The neighborhood and the others locations can make ous dive on feeling, is like we are on Halloween. And since is a Halloween Theme we will have lot of costumes to wear. Now to get the costumes you need to, get three different materials. When we get the costumes, besides changing our appearance we can go through places we didn't can before and will also gives special skills to use in battles. This battles can arise in two different ways, when you are searching for candy's or on street when you find a troll. When such things happens the scenario will completely change and your suit power will be activated, the battle style is a turn-based + quick time events.  When you do three attacks you will have a change to make the special attack, that can be a offensive or defense move. The special attack will be different according to the suit you are wearing. Since this is a RPG make sence we get XP for doing things, well when you complete the quest, defeat the trolls you will get some XP that will raise your level as well your defenses and your attack. Besides, you can buy in-game booster to help raise your attack and defense, although this is not very important because your enemies don't give a strong fight. Although this is a soundless game, contains a decent amount of humor there, some nice jokes and the dialogues between the characters is funny to read too. Costume Quest really grabbed me from the moment i installed, so is totally recommend! ~ 8/10  "

												Such a charming game. The graphics are cute and, even though the gameplay is the same as pretty much all the other RPGs, it still feels refreshing. Why ? Because most of the battles are based on trick-or-treating. And the gear you can collect are Halloween costumes. It's a cool idea, I really enjoyed it. But it does get repetitive near the end (it's about 5 hours long); the quests are the same in every new area. Apple bobbing, card collecting, finding hidden kids. It's a great game, but I just wish there was more variation.Still, if you love RPGs, or charming games in general, this is a must play.[Rating: 86/100]			"

												Another 30FPS locked game from Double Fine. I looked for a way to fix this defect, (and 30FPS IS a defect, anything below 60 is unacceptable on PC) and there doesn't seem to be one. Every thread I found about it had Double Fine, (often the exact same developer, DFnathan) LYING to their customers, saying ""we're looking to remove the cap in a future update"" all from threads from like 3-4 years ago or more. Every time they release a game it has this ridiculous framerate lock, and every time they say a fix is ""coming in a future update"" that never arrives. Vote with your wallet and don't buy this, it's just another console port.			"

												Costume Quest is a charming, fun take on the turn based RPG genre. Sort of condensed. Instead of individually swapping weapons, spells, attacks, and actions you choose costumes that change your appearance, battle abilities and attacks, and help solve free roam puzzles with various actions. On top of that you can choose one additional action or buff for each character and swap them as you choose. Instead of finding and swapping party members you can instead choose their costumes. It really is sort of a ""My First RPG"", which may sound dull to an adult but it works well enough to engage. My one issue with this system is that there wasn't enough difference between the costumes to incentivise change. You are forced to change to solve some puzzles but I would always switch back before a battle. The battle system is turned based and pretty simple with only a few options each turn. This style lends itself to a little repetition but I tended to enjoy them since they typically don't drag on. One twist (Maybe, I don't play a lot of turn based RPGs) is that to land more powerful attacks you have to complete a QTE. There are several variations but each attack only has one. Things like press at a certain time, wiggle a stick, or repeatedly tap a button. Personally I didn't find that it detracted from the experience and actually makes sure you're paying attention to the battle and lets you contribute in some way. In true Double Fine fashion the writing (literally because there is no voice acting. Not a problem, just a statement) is top notch. Funny, witty, and endearing with jokes for both adults and children. Don't write off Costume Quest because of its apparently juvenile theme, you'd be missing out. It's fun, funny, and really is a nice departure from what you've probably played last. It doesn't over stay it's welcome and is well worth your time.			"

Gameplay is repetitive, the battles are boring and the only real thing (other than graphics) saving the game is the battle stamps you can use to add effects.I also ran into the game breaking bug in the fry quest where the solution from TS was to restart because they don't plan a fix. Well, it left a bad taste in my mouth that a major game breaking bug is known and nothing was attempted to fix it.

												Great fun, not at all what I usually play. I got it discounted and thought I'd give it a try. Funny and engaging dialogue, simple (but more complex at later stages) and customizable combat, and baased in a world of puzzles, secret chests and exploration, Costume Quest excels itself as both a children's game and one for adults.I am six hours through at the moment and just finished the main story. There is an expansion so I'm expecting total playtime to be about 10 hours. Not bad at all for the price.If you are a fan of RPGs, levelling up, area exploration, turn-based combat, or completionist gaming, there will be something here for you. I highly recommend it.			"

You play as a child on Halloween night in search of your twin sibling.I’d recommend this game to everyone who’s mature enough to look at it for the first five minutes and dismiss it as a children’s game.

												The whole game takes place on Halloween night where you must rescue your twin brother (or sister, depending on who you choose) who has been kidnapped by candy-stealing monsters. You have to trick-or-treat at every lighted house to unlock other areas in the game world. If a monster opens a door you will engage in a random turn-based battle where your costume powers will come in handy. On your quest you will meet other trick-or-treaters and pick up more followers for your search party. Collect candy from trash bags and smashed pumpkins which can be used to purchase perks in monster battles. Complete mini-quests to earn experience so you can level up. Do classic Halloween activities, like bob for apples and compete in a costume contest. Collect Creepy Treat trading cards and materials to unlock more costumes that have special abilities.It's a unique blend of rpg-ing and casual gameplay that perfectly captures the spirit of Halloween. A must-have for those too old to trick-or-treat.			"

												Costume Quest is an amusing, anime style, adventure game with some unique dynamics. Firstly, costumes you pick up become useful in the game world in two ways. One, they each have a unique ability, like the robot costume to boost your speed and let you jump off ramps, and secondly, they become genuine fighting equipment, changing your character into what the costume represents. Be it a knight, or a fancy big robot, the costumes have incredibly power in this fun and quirky game by the creators of Psychonauts. Definelty a fun little game to play, and a get a fresh taste of Double Fine on PC.			"

												This one was a surprise. When looking at some pictures, I wasn't expecting much, but was surprised by it. This game has what you can expect from Double Fine, very funny and well written dialogue, fun combat system and a nice world to explore. The biggest flaw of this game, is it's length and scope. It's a short game. But the 6-8 hours it will take you to complete it, will be fully enjoyed. The story, although quite simplistic, is fun and entertaining. The combat system is  very nice, it's a JRPG turn based system with some quick time events thrown in between. When you enter battle, you'll transform into the costume you're wearing, so if you're using a cardboard robot costume, in battle you turn into a full laser shooting robot. The game has a lot of costumes and all of them very different from each other so you'll have to consider what costumes are best for each character and each situation. To add even more diversity, you have battle stamps to collect and use. These give some additional passive abilities, and make a lot of difference in combat. The game has a very simple level system and currency (candy). You can use candy to buy some upgrades and stamps to further develop your character. All in all, this is a very good bur short RPG, and I recommend it to everyone who likes the genre.			"

												Simply a short cute little game.  The art style is great, the story and characters are fun and the unlockables are simple enough to collect but still rewarding to find.  The game is not without its shortcomings though, the fights really started to feel repetitive around half way though the game and by the end I was starting to dread the idea of another fight sequence.  However, because the game is short (~5 to 7 hours) and fighting is not a huge part of the game, this is not the huge drawback it would be for a longer more serious game.In the end I plan on making this game a halloween tradition, it is cute and fun, and I would recommend this game.

												Costume Quest is one of those unusual games you either love or hate. It is quite original, as is the trademark of Tim Schafer and the great Double Fine Productions, and offers a mixture of RPG and Adventure quite unseen in all the role-playing games I have played so far. A possible problem is that it merely brushes the surface of the genre and never goes in-depth. Don't expect neat level up and careful customization of your party, Costume Quest need to be played for the taste of its storyline, full of humor and for the cool gust it blows on a game market filled with clones. I also continued to play this game for its atmosphere, despite the repetition and the boredom that may occur after the too many similar moments of gameplay: the combat system barely evolves throughout the (short) story and the items hunts sometimes break the rhythm.To conclude, I would recommend it only to those who are ok with playing a game for its particular taste and the polish of its storyline rather than for the mechanics of its gameplay. Once again, Costume Quest is a very short game (I maxed it out in less than seven hours) but it is definitely a great pick for those who are looking for a bit share of originality . "

After my fourth fight, I found myself avoiding enemies whenever possible. Not because of the difficulty, but because each fight is another 2-3 minute delay from that quest item that I was looking for in the game world. I challenge anyone to convince me that this style of combat makes the game fun.If there were a quarter as many enemies, and you used puzzle-solving to overcome them, this game would gel a lot better.

												Costume Quest is the journey of a few kids to find as much candy as they can on Halloween (and maybe save one of their sisters along the way... if they feel like it). It's innocent fun that conjures up feelings of nostalgia that I'm sure we can all relate to, while positively radiating with a pristine aura of charm and joy. Now if all that doesn't already sound appealing to you, there are also a ton of innuendos and jokes that only adults can connect with strewn throughout.This journey should take you around 5 hours to complete, even if you seek to obtain every single collectable. It's definitely pretty brief in terms of longevity, but I still really enjoyed my experience.If you're willing to let the kid inside of you out for a bit of fun, I'd say this game is worth at least one playthrough.

												I like the idea for costume quest. The visional style fits very well with the game. The game has some fun characters too.What I don't like with the game is that it is extremely repetitive. The first area you are in was pretty fun. But it feels like the game might as well has ended there. Because you then get to another area where you have basically the same quests again, just at a different location. The quests aren't very fun either. The combat is very repetitive because only have one normal attack and a special attack that you get after two attacks. So every fight is: regular attack which follows with a quick time event to get the maximum damage out of your attack, do this for every character. Then quick time event to reduce damage from the enemy. Then repeat this to get special attack, do special attack. if the enemy isn't dead do it again. The concept for the game is very good. It could have been an awesome game. But sadly it's too repetitive and it kind of falls flat. Even though the game is very short is feels far to long for what the actual content of the game. It feels like they made the game longer by just using the same quest again with a new background texture.			"

												I usually try to stay away from stuff that is cute and kidsy, but this game is actually not really like that. It is a charming little game with really great graphic design and a good turn based rpg combat system like Final Fantasy style. You go around a town map doing quests and it is so far a lot of fun. Double Fine ♥♥♥♥ed up Iron Brigade bad which was really unfortunate, but they have a gem on their hands here with this game. The huge flaws in this game though is that it is very short (I beat the main game + the dlc in 7 hours), there is no replay value: once you beat it there is no reason to ever play it again, and it could also be more difficult. One of my favorite short playthroughs that I have played in a long time. I don't know why exactly but it just strikes a chord with me and I love it. I think because it reminds me of one of my favorite games of all time, Earthbound on the Super Nintendo. A very good game, just way too short. Catch it on sale and only on sale.			"

												This game is just fantastic! It's a fun little halloween RPG by the amazing team at Double Fine, which are responsible for masterpieces like Psychonauts and Brutal Legend. This game does not disappoint at all. It's a short and sweet game that i enjoyed from start to finish, even though the combat can get a bit repetitive in the start of the game, Once you get out of the first area of the game the combat becomes fresh again. Introducing new enemies, new costumes, and new abilities.It also has quite a bit of challenge, i didn't die a lot, but nearing the end of the game it really gets difficult.Overall it's a really good game. 9/10 "

Definitely not the most challenging game out there, Costume Quest, is a great little RPG lite game.  Focusing on a world where the imagination of children afford them super powers all in the journey to save lost friends.Any of the individual elements of this game are at the core very simple implementations but the whole is much greater than the sum of it's parts.

												This is a really well-done game with a unique game mechanic, as you'd expect from Tim Schafer and Double Fine.  They've clearly gone over the gameplay with a fine-toothed comb, and it's largely free of any serious annoyances (unlike, say, Psychonauts).  I can't recommend this game enough.After you finish the main game, make sure to play the included sequel, Grubbins on Ice, as well.			"

												It's rare to see a game made by double fine with bland characters, obnoxious gameplay and boring story  however this game has all three. The combat system in this game is turn based with no strategy, that however I can stand I enjoy games like Final Fantasy or Pokemon, however Double Fine decided to ""innovate"" by mixing in Real Time Events which just completely ruined it for me. Similarly to Psychonauts and Brutal legend this game features collectibles, however unlike these 2 games - collectibles are not a side-quest but are the main quest of the game and you cannot proceed until you have searched every last corners for those collectibles. I don't know what happened to double fine but their earlier games were much better.			"

												Here is another beauty that I got thanks to that Double Fine humble bundle. Every time I start thinking of going back to console gaming these bundles and steam sales just drag me right back in the glorious world of PC gaming and the silly and serious experiences it has to offer.Costume Quest is a game that I read and saw a decent amount of before I played it from the various videogame news sites that I follow. As a result I went into the game with a certain amount of expectations which were not entirely met if I am being honest.Costume Quest is a pretty mediocre game. Its definitely not bad, but its not that good either. If you are hoping to find a game that can be used as an eight to ten hour distraction then you should be fine getting Costume Quest. If you want something that is more than a distraction then you need to look elsewhere. Because while this game has a lot of charm, its very superficial in some major parts of its design leaving the experience of playing this game feeling boring and repetitive in more than one instance. This is something I feel pretty strongly about, to that point that I'm not looking forward to the sequel that Double Fine recently announced. Unless there are some major changes being made to the gameplay aspect of the game which I don't think is going to happen to be honest.If you feel like reading a more detailed review you can find it here: http://mouseandcontroller.blogspot.com/2014/06/costume-quest.html.

												Do you like classic JRPGs? Yes? Then you will surely like the innovative reaction games, quick-time events and whatnot, that are required for actually winning the battles! Costume Quest really requires the hard tactical experince of a person that can understand the difficult concepts of ""a monster that heals other monsters"" and ""a monster that deals high damage"". If those terms sound difficult to comprehend and you cannot understand why they should be the primary targets, you might be more at home with some lighter strategy games.			"

												I feel like this game would have been much better without the level scaling. I absolutely detest level scaling. That noted, I also ♥♥♥♥ing loathe it when a game comes out with an expansion (in this case, Grubbins on Ice) that literally follows the same plot and storyline (someone gets captured, have to go save them, same costumes, etc) but just in a different location and differently dressed monsters. That's pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ in my honest opinion. Why you would try to make an exact clone of the last game and try to pass it off as dlc/expansion is unforgivable. Come on Double Fine, you're better than this.			"

												I have been enjoying Costume Quest a lot actually. The cartoon look is visually appealing and when you can play in 1080p it makes it even better. It is a quirky kind of RPG yet it does not fully present itself as an RPG, you can roam around and complete quest without even looking at your quest log. It's battles are fun and attacks involve timing and require you to think fast on which key to press when blocking attacks. I strongly recommend this game, worth its money, you may want to wait for a sale if you are money conservative.			"

												This is a game for kids, not kids-at-heart. I'm an adult, that likes Halloween. I like dressing up in costumes, and both handing out and having candy. I try to host a Halloween party every year.I got this game because I was hoping that there would be the same level of dialouge and characters as in Psychonauts. It's not.It's a very, very simplistic game, with choose a button and some QTE stuff. The costumes change things a bit, but anyone who has played any RPG type games at all can probably figure out the two damage dealers, one healer, or one tank, one damage, one healer, and not ever really need to switch costumes, besides to look at the different attacks.It's not a bad game for kids at all. The writing is still decent, and some of the jokes were amusing, but as an adult fan of Doublefine who purchased it for myself, I feel let down. It's also a very short game. Again, one that would more appeal to a kid audience.There IS a market for more adult-based Halloween costume style games out there that don't need horror or sex. I just wish Doublefine had realized that.			"

												Short but sweet game coming from the creative mind of Tim Schafer, who is best known for games like Grim Fandango, Psychonauts and The Secret of Monkey Island. This game is a perfect play for Halloween (and the grubbins on ice during the holiday seasons). This turn based RPG is good for all ages. During the 6 to 7 hour game you go on a quest to save your brother/sister that has been mistaken for candy by monsters. The only way you can save him/her is to go around town trick or treating, getting candy and build costumes.			"

												This is a really fantastic light RPG. It has that signature Double Fine dialog and in general the feel you expect from them. Just like I mentioned in my Stacking review this has reasonable achievements and very good accomodation for the completionist type. Appropriate since both this and Stacking was written in either 2 weeks or 4 weeks (I forgot the story) as part of a company creativity exercise.It's really a shame that EA and LucasArts are such inept pieces of ♥♥♥♥ that they didn't capitalize on Double Fine during this period and allow them creative freedoms or the sequel to this would have came out much earlier and a Psychonauts sequel might actually exist. But oh well, great game overall and much of what I said about Stacking can be applied here. Double Fine knows you love to collect things and it knows that you love to 100% things, and they love you for loving those things and so accomodate you well.			"

												This game is all about the charm. The story isn't the same ol' derivative RPG story. The characters & setting are very enjoyable. I especially enjoyed playing this during Halloween, It put me in the holiday spirit.As an RPG there's nothing truely ground breaking here. The combat is ok, It's a class based system. Classes are selected through a series of costumes. Some costumes have healing abilities, some are damage/crowd control & others are defensive. It may sound unique & interesting, but the battles generally all go the same way due to the fact that your abilities are not able to be activated till the 3rd round. Damage for 3 rounds, if the enemy is still up, stun heal & damage battle over.I'm a fan of Tim Schafer's work, but I'm going to rate his work on it's own merits. This game is fun & charming & I would recommend it, but I would say wishlist it & wait for a sale.			"

This review explains how Double Fine's Costume Quest is a shallow, repetitive, featureless example of the RPG adventure game genre.[. . .] You do 1-3 identical attacks, then 1-3 identical dodges, and on every third turn special moves. That’s the only combat rhythm, and you’ll be doing it until every battle is a chore. There are no combos; no combat varieties; no difficult build decisions; no in-battle items; and, except for ‘go for the priest first,’ there is no strategy.

												Yeah, I'm really going to suffer through a bunch of idiotic tutorial dialogue one speech bubble at a time with no option to skip to the next line when I'm done reading. It's really good and well-thought-out that all the ""important"" conversations give me two options: 1) stare at text bubble long after im finished reading it or 2) skip entire conversation by pressing escape. I'm using sarcasm btw. I'm being sarcastic. I am utilizing a sarcastic tone to convey the opposite meaning of the literal definition of my words. In truth, the instant the last Steam Trading Card drops I'm going to be quitting and immediately deleting local content.If the dialogue was at-all interesting maybe it'd be worth sitting still through the horribly-paced cutscenes, but every conversation is Nick Jr. level garbage, dripping with that awful, condescending slime of Idiotic Childrens' Programming for Idiotic Children. It's patronizing, unimaginatively hokey, constantly condescending and utterly unbearable.It's also really insanely good that the unimportant ""flavor"" conversations CAN be skipped one bubble at a time, thus proving that the designers were capable of implementing this feature, but for whatever reason they then decided all the Extremely Important Cutscene Dialogue needed to be read at a speed of approximately one speech bubble every thirty seconds.Also the overworld control is pretty clunky (with a strange ""momentum pause"" when switching directions 90 degrees at a time) - probably feels a lot better on a controller, but WASD for life. Thankfully I'm probably not going to end up being horribly horribly frustrated by it because I don't plan on actually playing this game. The battles are moderately cool I guess if you're into Final Fantasy and/or QTE-styled fights (press key to select thing, press key when slider is in the sweet spot to do thing) and maybe the costume mechanics are good, maybe they're terrible, I'm unfortunately never going to find out because every two minutes I'm interrupted by a cutscene that I end up completely skipping once my patience runs out, so I end up further and further separated from the most ""important"" plot elements or story goals or whatever these cutscenes are intended to convey.In the interests of pointing out the positives: The graphics are very nice and colorful, and since there's no voice-acting there's no terrible voice-acting to either disable or bîtch about the inability to disable.Recommended for slow readers, fans of terrible cinematic pacing, and lobotomy patients.

												One of the better examples of why indy developers should be allowed to exist, unfortunately several flaws in this game prevent recommendation.Technically, the game has limited resolution modes and generally doesn't behave like a PC game.  Being unaware of foreground windowing prevents foreground switching and causes the game to crash... that's ok, developers probably weren't aware that DirectX 3.0 was introduced in 1997, so it's understandable they wouldn't have bothered to test the game under Windows. Artwork is 3D which at least beats going 2D platformer, but it's still extremely low effort.Gameplay quickly becomes stale and repetitive, which is the only chance the developers had in way of apology for their negligence on the artwork and on making the game compatible with Windows. Simply too hard to approve.			"

												Wow.   Looked so great.  However, after playing for an hour I'm done.  To start with, the controls are counter-intuative and difficult to control.   They feel like they were ported from a game controller game.  Anyways, on a PC they don't work well.The plot is text based and the text bubbles move by -very- rapidly even for a fast reader..  Don't even try to read them outloud if playing in a group.    If you are distracted for a moment, you don't get to read what each character says.  Durning game play you must complete some tasks that require you to move accurately and quickly.  If you fail the task you start again.  Nothing spells ""fun"" like repeating a task that is only difficult because the controls are poor.In any event, after less than an hour's game play - this feels like a quick and dirty port of a console game with little testing for the PC market.  Shame, look fun, good concept, nice graphics.Horrible game play due to a quick, poorly done port.  Wish I could get my $10 back. "

Answer me please, What is Abraham Lincoln doing in that game?			"

												I like this game, but I honestly can't recommend it. I like the concept, I like the costumes and how they are represented in combat. But this game has a sucktacular camera system (that made me run around in circles and check around town for about forty minutes trying to find a ♥♥♥♥ing quest item that the game HIDES for no apparent reason) and not enough meat on the bone to make conflict interesting. This is essentially Final Fantasy light, complete with quick time events and pedantic combat. I don't see myself wanting to play this for more than an hour.			"

												costume quest is a pretty neat rpg done in the spirit of halloween. i must say this is a great rpg for gamers new and old. there is no item managing that hardcore rpg games have which means young and old both can enjoy this game without worry of having to run back to the store. there is a store in game though which has battle cards with varying effects u can use equip each charecter with 1 card swappable outside of battle.  healing wise there is none other then in battle so no worrys of dieing from being unprepared.one of the toughest parts about this game is prob the boss battles aside from that the trying to get every defense and attack perfect by pressing the right button. also to talk about the battles pretty simple just attack and defend before the enemy hits you u try to press the correct button if hit the correct one critical attack and in defense better defense or a dodge and if right card equiped counter. after 3 turns ur specials charged which they are pretty nice addition. but do not take the game lightly u can lose battles if ur not careful. but there is no such thing as gameover in this game it just places u in the area right before the battle <3also to note there is a varity of costumes which u have to find the parts to make them each comes with a special ablity which is pretty neat. oh and there is special ablitys for some of them useable in the field which adds to the fun.now if u like rpgs that arent that tough yet still fun give costume quest a go as its worth a play and i would say a replay <3   oh and did i mention candy? TONS OF CANDY!so grab costume quest and help stop the evil witch and the monsters from stealing all of the candy before its too late and halloween is ruined!   ~ will be updating after finish the dlc quest grubbins on ice that came with :3just finished the dlc grubbins on ice make sure u collect every costume before playing it and load same slot u finished in, as u will have all of the orignal costumes then ^w^ its like costume quest turned christmas quest. basicly the same gameplay new areas and new costumes and areas. also do note finish costume quest then the dlc as seems it leads into game 3 ^w^if this review is not helpful, please leave a comment as to why u feel that way so i may make changes if needed ^w^			"

												I bought this because a game based on trick or treating sounded really great. However, trick or treating has never been so lame. The game gets off to a good start and is plenty of fun, but there's nothing to keep it interesting. Going door to door collecting candy even got horribly boring after a while. The combat system was easy but it was also a snore. It was so over done that I started just avoiding enemies. The whole thing is so tedious and repetitive, performing the same actions again and again (trick or treating and fighting enemies), that by the time I got to what would be considered the first boss, I was sick of this game and thoroughly done with it.

The characters are adorable, the premise is clever, but the gameplay is bad. I appreciate that this was done during studio downtime to waste some time but knowing how awesome Double Fine are, it surpised me just how bad the gameplay was.  I got it because I love Tim, I love Double Fine, and I ADORE Halloween. But this is pretty painful. I can't tolerate it anymore and I am afriad that I have wasted 12 quid. Shame. Maybe nearer to Halloween I can give it another go but I doubt it.			"

												This game does some things wonderfully. It's a fantastic portrayal of the way a costume transforms you from a kid wearing a bucket or a cardboard box into a powerful figure who kicks ♥♥♥ and stands up for justice. The moment of suspense after you knock on the door when you don't know who or what is behind it is a really nice touch. The cel-shaded models in the battle scenes look great.But do be aware this is a very _simple_ game. It could be a good introduction to the CRPG genre for younger players, but there's not much depth to be found here. The story is charming but simple. There is some variety in the abilities you get with the costumes and accessories, but there's no skill progression to speak of, and each party member may only have a single accessory. The tactically-minded will find there's an accessory you can get mid-game that lets you cheese your way through fights for everything except bosses.So the thumbs-up here is a potential thumbs-up if you're looking for a game for your kids. If you're old enough to have your own Steam account, you've probably outgrown this.			"

												Costume Quest plays like an introductory JRPG: classes are mapped onto interchangeable costumes that are unlocked by finding materials in the environment, equipment comes in the form of 'battle stamps' that can be purchased from vendors, and there are no consumables or 'game over' moments. Combat is simple and turn-based, but made slightly more interesting by requiring the player to press a random button at a given time to maximize or mitigate damage.It's a Doublefine game, so humor is a big part of the presentation. It's suitable for younger players, though some of the jabs at consumer culture and common RPG schticks will probably go over their heads.Between CQ and its (included) DLC, there's roughly eight hours of content.

												Costume Quest is the best holiday related game I have ever played. You play as a kid on Halloween trick or treating with you twin. Your twin gets kidnapped by monsters and you have to rescue her. Luckily your costume allows you to transform into a giant robot and allows you to take down your evil opponents. The combat is turn based RPG at its most basic yet most fun. You have a basic attack that crits if you perform varied quick time events and after three turns can use a super move that also varies. There are several costumes to collect and each one had different health, damage, and supers. The supers can be buffs, heals or damage. Using varied costumes is the key to success in Costume Quest and is some of the most fun. Throughout the game you will encounter new party members and can set their costume to your liking. There are also badges that you can equip to party members in order to give them passive or activated abilities. You buy these with candy which you can get by fighting monsters or trick or treating (duh). Overall the game looks great and controls just as well. The only complaint I have is the length which is about 4-5 hours but the DlC continues the story and extends the game by 2 hours. Get this game if you are even slightly curious about it. It has an old video game feel that you don’t find in games to much today.			"

												This game will make you feel like a child again. You play as a child whose sibling, dressed as candy, is kidnapped by gremlins who steal candy on Halloween for their gremlin overlord. You collect a series of costumes and candy to work your way towards your kidnapped sibling. During a tedious RPG-style battle system, you become a Power Rangers-style gigantic form of your costume, each with a unique ability. Using the powers of your costumes, you defeat the gremlins, collect the candy in the area, and move on to the next. The humor is charming. There are many childlike jokes told as you communicate with other trick-or-treaters, but not in a sense of immaturity; the jokes will make you laugh like a child, fully encompassing the character. If you're a fan of the way Nintendo makes you feel when playing their games, or any of Double Fine's other imaginative productions, this game is a definite pick-up.			"

												A simple, yet very fun RPG made by Double Fine Productions. Not very surprising, since the company is known for making pretty fun games. Costume Quest uses a simple turn-based RPG battle system, so there isn't really any kind of learning curve to it. The story is pretty simple and not deep, but the characters are likeable. The costumes you wear decide what you fight as and what attack and special ability you have. It can be pretty fun to mess around and decide what the best team to use is. The game isn't really hard, but if you don't have a good team set up, it can be easy to lose. Even if you lose, there is no penalty or anything of that sort, which is sort of nice. If your a fan of simple turn-based RPGs, I fully recommend you try this game. (Note: If you aren't very good with quick time events using keyboard butons, I fully recommend you use a controller, preferably an Xbox 360 controller.)			"

												Great game if you have a little time on your hands.  It streamlines the RPG experience with a simpler exploration feel that keeps the user involved until the end.  The biggest drawbacks are the repetive, three button combat and length.  Sadly, you can 100% this game in less than 8 hours if you care to.  What it DOES provide though, is a unique take on a RPG system that does not really require grinding.  The game does a great job of facilitating just enough combat to keep you at the appropriate level without the need to do extra legwork.  All in all, I'd give it 4/5, and a high recommendation.			"

												I really loved this game and had loads of fun playing it. I absolutely love the unicorn and the eyeball costumes. I'm not a hardcore gamer but I managed to get all the achivements and complete the game so its not exceptionally challenging but there is enough content to keep you going and the battles are fun.The humour keeps you engaged so you want to come back for more and its not a chore to get to the next part of the story. As well as the main story quests there are various side quests (that sometimes involve minigames) that arent essential but are really fun so I'm sure most people play them.Overall I would give 8/10 for having  a fun story and battle mode but it could be a little more challenging outside of the battles.

												Costume Quest is an RPG about trick-or-treating. You control a group of kids tasked with defeating a small army of monsters led by an evil witch in order to retrieve whichever of the sibling protagonists you don't choose at the start.Did I mention that it's by Double Fine Productions? Because that would explain that previous paragraph, for you.There's a weird division in imagination and reality in this game. The monsters are real. The plight is real. There's actually a witch ordering giant crows to steal candy to further her mysterious plans. But then once you enter battle, it becomes imaginary. I believe. I could certainly be wrong, but nobody else seems to notice when the heroes transform into colossal and more impressive versions of the things they're wearing costumes of. Even the monsters look much less doofy once battle commences. This all brings up an interesting point to consider, though, which is what the final boss looks like in reality - it's only ever seen in battle, you see (Grubbins on Ice notwithstanding, as that doesn't seem as married to this rule as the main game).Gameplay mostly consists of exploring, collecting, and fighting. You'll be searching every nook and cranny for various items to complete various quests, as well as to further the plot. Battles are launched by knocking on doors for candy (and later by encountering roaming monsters, as well), and abide by a turn-based system which encourages timed button presses, a la Mario RPG. There are also, notably, a limited number of battles (except maybe in the upper floors of the mall), so you're not expected to sit around and grind levels for hours to proceed.Different costumes give the kids different powers. Outside of battle, they're useful for overcoming obstacles or completing objectives. But inside battle, costumes are essentially classes. The robot is all attack, while the knight can defend himself or his teammates. Lady Liberty can heal the entire team partially, but the unicorn can heal one person to 100% HP.Movement is kind of odd, at first. If you point in a direction, your kid swivels in place to face that direction before setting off. Once in motion, you can make smooth turns, but pointing in the opposite direction will cause them to stop, turn, and then go. You get used to it by the second area, but it'll feel pretty wonky at first.The console releases of Costume Quest eventually received the paid DLC ""Grubbins on Ice"". You'll be pleased to hear that the DLC is now included at no additional charge! This bonus Winter-themed adventure sends the kids to the Grubbins' home... world? Dimension? Something. There are new costumes, stamps, and abilities to be found, and new monster types to fight. It's a quality addition, and worth the attention once the main game is complete.Costume Quest has become something of a Halloween tradition for me now. It's just short enough to invite such replayability. There are three major areas in the main game, and one more in Grubbins on Ice. Each one will likely take about two or three hours to complete, giving the game an 8-12 hour length for each playthrough. Just perfect for a run-through once every October, and the perfect game for the holiday. Costume Quest captures the spirit and imagination of trick-or-treating spendidly. Which suits me fine. I'm too old to go out trick or treating, anymore, but you're never too old to fight monsters in your underwear at 2 in the morning.			"

												Costume Quest plays like an introductory JRPG: classes are mapped onto interchangeable costumes that are unlocked by finding materials in the environment, equipment comes in the form of 'battle stamps' that can be purchased from vendors, and there are no consumables or 'game over' moments. Combat is simple and turn-based, but made slightly more interesting by requiring the player to press a random button at a given time to maximize or mitigate damage.It's a Doublefine game, so humor is a big part of the presentation. It's suitable for younger players, though some of the jabs at consumer culture and common RPG schticks will probably go over their heads.Between CQ and its (included) DLC, there's roughly eight hours of content.

												At times you'll wonder when the game will end because the combat doesn't reinvent the turn-based wheel.That, though, is really the only negative thing I have to say about the game. The adventure game sensibilities kept me interested between fights which are the times during which most games lose my interest. Also, I read through all the dialogue even though it's skippable because I thought the writing was witty.Overall I liked the game but it was short and probably had a few too many battles.

												This is a really enjoyable RPG. Probably the only RPG in a while that i found fun to play. The basic story is you have monsters invade the kids town to collect candy which ends with you having to use different costumes for combat and exploration as well as collecting candy by trick or treating houses and by defeating monsters.  Only criticisms are thats it's a bit too easy and the combat which i liked at first for it's anime style gets boring after a while. Also the Grubbins On Ice DLC feels like a bit of a copy and paste of the original story with just a new setting and a few new costumes. But given that DLC comes with the game for free it's not a big deal.Anyway i'd recommend this game. I'd give it an 8/10			"

												A nice experience, but the main story is very short, like about 6 hours on average. It does not have a complex item or battle system rpg (quick time events for critical hits and defending) so its real easy to dive in and not get confused, but still remains challenging and involving.  My main annoyances is the fixed camera, which makes it annoying because youll sometimes find a large prop hiding your character on screen, and there are only 3 map areas.			"

												Costume Quest is a game that is both a lot of fun and incredibly gripping. This is the kind of game that wisks you away back to your childhood memories of roaming the neighborhood going door to door trick-or-treating and the whole adventure feels like the kind of 'adventures' I went on as a kid. The gameplay itself was also pretty interesting, despite most of it being completing quests and turn based battles. The ability to construct new costumes and gain different abilities in the overworld and the battle system was great. Plus I feel that some of the quest objective help reinforce the Halloween theme, as each part of the world has trick-or-treating at every house in the area, much how as a kid I made sure to hit up every house. My only real complaint is that the battle system can get a bit repetitive and it feels just a bit to easy to do well with, but other than that I had a great time playing Costume Quest. It took me a little over 5 hours to play through the main story, but I still have yet to play the ""Grubbins on Ice"" story, so I would have to say that this is one of the few games where I feel it is still worth it if you pay the full $10 for it.

I can't wait for Costume Quest 2!This game hooks you up right from the start, as you get more costumes and battlestamps the possibilities gets much deeper.For example, my favorite combination was the Statue of Liberty with splash damage, Vampire with additional damage and the Unicorn with health regen. You can heal the entire party with Lady Liberty and same for the Vampire but it's also a life steal. Then if either of them dies, the Unicorn can revive them. The Unicorn has high health and with the health regen, it is basically invincible.			"

												Well Double Fine you made another good game, I applaude you. See Double Fine continues to make good games, something few companies can do, much like RareWare in the 1990's, Tim Schafer's Double Fine seems to be dishing out game after game of quality. He is of course well known to the people who have heard of him, but that is shockingly few people. His games like Grim Fandango, and Phychonauts are glimmering underappreciated diamonds, and his lastest game Costume Quest does nothing to tarnish that reputation.Now why do I compare Double Fine to Rare? Easy, they both made a multitude of games that made them very popular, Double Fines biggest issue is it is still the unknown company, thier games come out, they look cool to some people, I play them, love them, then I tell other people how good they are for just being 20 bucks or less, then no one plays them. But I hold no resentment towards those people because I grew up with with Tim at my side, a man that made good games, I do hope that someday I can say 'Hey, you know that game that everyone likes that just came out, try this it's made by the same guys.' Then we get people playing Double Fines old catalog of games.But about Costume Quest, it's good, it's charming, it has a few pop culture references, most don't seem out of place unless you know them. But the big thing is, it shows that Double Fine can make a decent Role Playing Game. Now don't get me wrong it's not as in depth as some major RPG's, but it does what you want it to do. There are no voices, just text, which is fine, the dialouge makes me chuckle, and brings out the little things in characters. It's just enough exploration, it is a little limiting, but it cuts down on annoying long term searches, and overall the game keeps at a fairly difficult stance. See it's these types of games that I like to see game companies make, they normally make puzzle games or platformers, but then they release an explore centered RPG and then it's actually good. That is what I like to see, I like to see companies improve and expand thier game base with more than platformers, because really I will lose intrest eventually, but it is safe to say Double Fine is keeping another fan interested and excited for the future.

												For once, I'm not going to talk about hats. Although this game does have them. Lots of them. God I love hats. Uh. Anyway. This game...it's the most fun I've had with an RPG in a loooooong time. I feel like some may argue that it lacks depth, but that's kind of why I like it so much. It's got this air of simplicity, but still maintains a sense of style. Of course a weakness of the simplicity is that battles get slightly repetitive, though they are short and not abundant to the point of frustration. Overall, it was a great experience and I loved it.9/10			"

												Costume Quest did a great job of scratching my Final Fantasy itch without requiring the hundreds of hours your average FF game requires. The combat can be a bit repetitive, and the skill level is defnitely geared toward more novice players, but the game is short enough neither of these stuck around long enough to bother me. As one would expect from Double Fine, the art direction is fantastic, and the Creepy Treats cards are a great blend of Garbage Pail Kids-style art and trading cards with some of the best puns and just weird candies you can imagine. As a short treat or break from the norm, Costume Quest is sure to satisfy.			"

												   One word to sum it up? Charming.   Costume quest is a turn-based RTS at heart and enjoyable from start to end. I honestly can't think of any con except maybe the low difficulty.   Costume Quest comes with achievements, collectibles, spells, monsters,costumes, bosses. What else does a game need in the end?   Also comes with a free DLC and the promise for more and while not trying to spoil the end, it does offer an opening for future development.   My advice, get it, buy it, play it. You won't regret it. Worth every penny.			"

												Not the type of game I usually play but it came in Amazon's Double Fine Bundle and I gave it a go. I was very impressed despite the cartoon graphics and weird story. Controls & combat are simple and straight forward but the abundance of costumes adds a lot of variety. Definitely has some good humor and is still safe for kids.Highly recommend using a controller but it has to be Xinput or you need to use x360ce. Very short, 6 1/2 hours to beat game & DLC but the length just kind of feels right for the game.			"

												Costume Quest is incredibly adorable. Although it took an extra year to get it from the consoles to the PC, I don't think anything was lost in the transition. Heck, it comes with the DLC, too!Gameplay's kind of a little repetative; you trick or treat, you kill some Gomoblins, do some puzzlin' here and there, sometimes there's a boss fight. There isn't much to break up the formula, but it works well enough on its own.What stood out to me was how charming the game itself is. It's very much a trip back to childhood, with memories of homemade box robots or giant-headed felt unicorns. It's really cute and to me one of it's big selling points.If you have any sort of childhood nostalgia, this will be a game for you.			"

												Well Double Fine you made another good game, I applaude you. See Double Fine continues to make good games, something few companies can do, much like RareWare in the 1990's, Tim Schafer's Double Fine seems to be dishing out game after game of quality. He is of course well known to the people who have heard of him, but that is shockingly few people. His games like Grim Fandango, and Phychonauts are glimmering underappreciated diamonds, and his lastest game Costume Quest does nothing to tarnish that reputation.Now why do I compare Double Fine to Rare?

												Excellent game, especially for classic j-rpg fans. Great humor throughout, this game is equal doses badass and adorable. Definitely recommend playing with a controller, as the keyboard controls can be a little tiresome in this case.It bears some resemblance to the new South Park game. I do not mean to say that the South Park guys have ripped Costume Quest off, as they both pay homage to older turn-based rpgs, but anyone who loved playing one of the two should play the other.Personally I would love to see a sequel and more games like this.

Maybe it was my mind harking back to a simpler time and the premise of kids just simply trick R' treating.  The battles were very simple, they had some interactivity but not much.  They were the standard JRPG style battles we all know and...love/hate.  There were a good selection of costumes, all fun and simple.  My favorite had to be the ninja...for obvious reasons. Not to mention the decent selection of power up cards that helped you along the way.If you enjoy simple fun and miss the imagination of your childhood then this could be the game for you.			"

												I've only just started this game, and I can't get enough of it. I will hopefully update this review once I am done with it, but as of right now, I just need to go ahead and wholeheartedly recommend this game.The plot, artwork, and dialogue are cute and fantastic, and very immersive. The combat and gameplay are extremely easy to learn and fun to do. Though it may be simple, it does not come across as monotonous because of the quick variations there are to the combat, the randomness of encounters (both for going to houses and what children are around each street corner). There is a ton of mini-quests to give this game a sense of purpose, though it is still rewarding to complete them.Go ahead and do yourself a favor, and get this game. It doesn't even take up a lot of data to download!			"

												Short answer, yes, i higly recommend it.And the long one:Costume Quest is a light-hearted rpg game, made by one of my favorites developers, Double Fine. The game mechanics are really nice, there are a great variety of costumes and somewhat variable enemies. My only complaint regarding the gameplay is that the fighting mechanics get a little bit repetitive due to some unskipable animations, but nothing too big. Some peaple reported some bugs, but i haven't found any in my playtrough. The game story is light-hearted, but good and there are some really nice jokes. The game's graphics are a cartoonish style and are really well polished and beautifull. I really loved the game, it's a really escape from the same repetitive game formula of nower days, It is somewhat short, I took about 5 hours to finish it, and i'm usually slower than the average to beat a game (It took me about 4 hours to beat the DLC grubbings ice). That being said, I highly recommend Costume Quest for all players.9.8/10			"

												A mediocre RPG propped up by the considerable charm of the writers of Double Fine Productions. Combat is often agonizingly boring, with almost no options but requiring timed button presses that doesn't let you just blur it all out like you would Final Fantasy or Pokemon battles. Still, the game is adorable and features wonderfully written dialogue all the way down to the NPCs, making you want to explore the world and all of it's crannys, even if the battles frequently make you want to put it down. Hopefully some depth will be added to the upcoming sequel, but until then this is a cute, if slight, addition to the rich Double Fine canon.			"

												It's a perfect little RPG with all the humor you'd expect of Tim Schaffear, but sadly few mechanics to make it stand out. This isn't Persona or even Final Fantasy, rather it's another twisted tale of Tim's that goes down with ease. A lovely little story with some fun in between, perfect for a present, but underwhelming as a game.			"

												""Costume Quest"" is a fine opportunity to get into the Halloween mood. Or even deeper.It is a one-player RPG game involving two twin siblings getting separated by candy-greedy monsters from Repugia and two friends of theirs. So one sibling gets kidnapped and the other three children (including you as the twin brother or sister) set off for the rescue while fighting monsters, bosses and having fun by collecting Halloween stuff (costumes, candy, candy cards, battle stamps) and solving quests that get in your way.The gameplay: Most of the time you will walk around places like your hometown or the town's mall and search for items and quests. All of these help you progress in the story and getting stronger. One quest you must complete a couple of times in order to progress is to knock on every available door to ask for treats. Either you just get them or have to battle a monster (that has occupied this house). So the other part of the game are the battles. The children use their costumes they've achieved (pumpkin, black cat, vampire, statue of liberty, etc...) and their special powers to fight the different monsters. And because it's an RPG you wait for your characters' turns and choose the actions they're suppoused to do now while the monsters get their turns, too. You can loose battles but never die. You just would have to try again. Every win is rewarded with experience points, candy and other items.During all this you have your note book with you in which you have an overlook of your status, quests (and their status), costumes (with description), candy cards and a variety of battle stamps which can be used for battle by your characters.I found ""Costume Quest"" very playable, the controls are easy to learn (and they're changeable if you really can't operate with them). I played with the keyboard and it worked just fine. It's a fun RPG with a good mixture of exploring, collecting and fighting. It's also easy to play, so also RPG beginners shouldn't have trouble to finish this game sooner or later.The cartoonish 2.5/3D graphics are mostly sweet and lovely designed, that goes especially for the settings you go to.  They're colourful but not rainbow puking bright, they mostly match the Halloween season. When it goes to the characters, I find the children, their battle characters and the monsters were designed okay. I can't say that about the adult characters who either look like obese puppets, lifeless big-nosed humans or stick figures with grotesque heads and faces. They don't only look strange but also quite lifeless. I wished that a bit more effort would have went into their designs. But to the game's credit: the adults play a very minor role compared to the children.The sound is so-so: I enjoyed the musical score very much. But the sound? It completely containts sound effects (which are fine), no voices (outside the occesional grunts of monster characters and human background mumbling in more crowded places). This means that the dialogues are all text bubbles and there are even no simple sounds expressed by the characters, wether a ""Gasp!"" or ""Huh?"" or ""Ouch"" or something. I find this negative since at least a bit of voice acting brings extra life to these characters but here, everybody is totally quiet. What about extras? There are achievements, trading cards, one minigame about apple bobbing and there is also an additional chapter included called ""Grubbins on Ice"" that goes on right after the story of the main game. I can't say it's that exciting or so much fun, you practically do the same things and collect new costumes but without Halloween going on. Still, it's worth for a bit of fun and the achievements.So, can I recommend ""Costume Quest""? Yes, absolutely. It's a sweet, fun game all around Halloween and the fantasy of children celebrating it. If you can't stand Halloween or just don't care about it, then I guess this shouldn't stop you from trying but you might have less joy with that game.And if you're into RPGs or starting this, you definitely should check it out.

												I remember getting this for the PS3 on the PSN monthly giveaway.  The French Fry costume bug was an issue on there, which prevented me from being able to finish it.  However, I picked this back up on a sale and haven been going through it a second time (and now getting past where I could not!) and have enjoyed it, A LOT.  Good humor and the combat is fun.  Keep in mind this is a light-hearted take on an RPG.  So much so that my 4 year old plays it on his own (and does well, I might add) and it one of his favorite games.  If you are expecting some deep tactical turn-based combat, then you may want to look else where.  But, if you want a fun little game that has a cute story and is great to kick up your feet and get lost in for a little bit, I highly recommend it.Pros:- Cute story- Good humor (for me, at least)- Fun exploring areasCons:- Not very deep tactical combat system- Battles can be repetitive towards the end of the gameDon't let the cons scare you though.  I have enjoyed playing through this game (twice now!)			"

												My inner child identifies with this game on a spiritual level. Costume Quest is a casual, adventure RPG from Double Fine Productions (a group of people who have yet to let me down with anything of theirs that I’ve played). Let’s get rocking.The GoodI could go on and on about the things that Costume Quest gets right, but I’ll try to keep it brief.The art is outstanding. While you are adventuring, everything appears (mostly) normal aside from the magical quality that Halloween lends to everything. However, when you are in combat, everything is suddenly crazy awesome. Your character’s get huge (as do the enemies), your costumes take on a life of their own, and it all looks great.There aren’t additional weapons or anything to pick up in CQ. Instead you find different costumes, each with it’s own set of attacks/abilities. I absolutely loved this aspect of the game.The story is simple, but entertaining and the characters are all quite likable.The environments really bring back that magical feeling that you got as as a child when Halloween was nigh. The nostalgia train is coming for you if you play this one.The BadThe game was too short. I wanted it to go on for many, many moons.The MehI’ve got nothing here.Verdict: YeaEspecially with Halloween upon us, Costume Quest is a must have for any collection. It’s fun, simple, and it will earn a special place in your heart (at least for those of you who love Halloween). You can find it in the Steam Store and, with the Halloween Sale coming up, I’m pretty sure it’ll be on sale sometime this month. As always, thanks for reading.			"

												Another Double Fine game that lives up to its developer's name. The game comes with a second quest so you're really getting two games in one. Costume Quest is an exploration game with turn-based battle segments. As a kid fighting goblins to rescue their twin, yoou go door to door trick-or-treating trying to clear an area of candy to advance ot the next. It's very much like a ""my first RPG"" kind of game, but it's still a rewarding experience. You'll feel like a kid again.			"

												Costume Quest is one of those rare games that you get out of a $1 bundle and just kind of forget about. It's one of those surprise delights that you didn't know you had in your library. Such is Double Fine's track record with game's. But it's Halloween and nothing gets you in the mood for Halloween better then some good ole fashioned trick or treating.Costume Quest is very under-rated in my opinion. At first glance it's a childrens game. A simple, brainless game created for the young one's. That's where you're missing out. The game is incredibly fun. You get to go door to door trick-or-treating, collect candy, collect costumes and it doesn't matter what costume you wear, it's up to you! You want to be a pirate? Sure! You want to be a ninja? Why not? Throw in the statue of liberty and you got yourself a team! All while completing quests, collecting cards and finding yourself oddly intrigued in a somewhat predictable story. If you like games like South Park: The Stick of Truth and don't mind a much more toned down sense of humor, give this game a try. You won't regret it.			"

												This video game inspired me. I was once the empty shell of a woman you see in my profile picture, but the light and childish motifs of this videogame has awakened me to a new philosphy of life in this late capitalist society. The rapid switching of costumes spoke to me. BE FREE! LIVE YOUR MOST AUSPICIOUS REALITIY! If you want to be a robot BE A ROBOT! Just go for it! Take off your shirt! Lather yourself in auto oil and coolant. Install factory standard wiring between your nerves and muscles! MAKE YOURSELF INTO THE BEST YOU YOU CAN BE! My daughter, Nancy, once said to me, Mom, you're spending far too much of the money from the college fund for all these body modifications and Costume Quest™ brand costume pices. She seems to think that I ought be spending my money on Goobles on Ice™ merchandise, but this game teaches me the same thing so I told her I am her mother and I brought her into the world I can take her out LOL !!Great game, my only complaint is that you can't design your own characters. 8/10.

												Very easy and charming Halloween themed rpg. I really enjoyed this game and played it in one sitting today. I liked the story and aesthetic. My only big issue with the game was how repetitive it was. Towards the end the battles just got super boring. By the time I finished the main game and started the bonus content called Grubbins on Ice, I was bored with the gameplay and just didn't have it in me to play through the dlc. Other than the repetitive battle system and some other minor complaints I have, I enjoyed this game and can't wait to sit down and play Costume Quest 2 next Halloween!			"

												Costume Quest is a very short RPG can be beat in 3 1/2 hours pretty easily. Although that being said it is still a very fun game especially for this time of year (October). It gets you in the spirit of Halloween and takes you back to being a kid again. The game can get repetitive, but there are enough costumes and cards to collect that change your moves and play style, although not nearly to the extent as I would like, but for a 3 1/2 hour RPG it's enough. Overall good game, Buy it if its on sale especially 50% off or more then I would say it is definitely worth the money.			"

												If you've ever wanted a game that's almost exactly like Paper Mario, only themed around Halloween instead of the Mushroom Kingdom, you're in luck.  The gameplay is nearly identical in most respects (run around completing simple tasks, gain stamps/costumes/badges/levels to improve your characters, start combat with monsters by whacking them on the main screen, then go into turn-based battles with timed attack/defense commands), but it's fun and light-hearted, not too difficult, and has a good sense of humor, i.e. Double Fine Halloween Paper Mario.  Play it with a controller, or you'll be sad.  And not that the art style doesn't look good already, but if your video card can handle it, enable the ""secret"" command-line SSAA mode (-ssaa2x or -ssaa4x) and it looks fantastic.			"

												Costume Quest is incredibly adorable. Although it took an extra year to get it from the consoles to the PC, I don't think anything was lost in the transition. Heck, it comes with the DLC, too!Gameplay's kind of a little repetative; you trick or treat, you kill some Gomoblins, do some puzzlin' here and there, sometimes there's a boss fight. There isn't much to break up the formula, but it works well enough on its own.What stood out to me was how charming the game itself is. It's very much a trip back to childhood, with memories of homemade box robots or giant-headed felt unicorns. It's really cute and to me one of it's big selling points.If you have any sort of childhood nostalgia, this will be a game for you.			"

Costume Quest comes with achievements, collectibles, spells, monsters,costumes, bosses. What else does a game need in the end?   Also comes with a free DLC and the promise for more and while not trying to spoil the end, it does offer an opening for future development.   My advice, get it, buy it, play it. You won't regret it. Worth every penny.			"

												A Fun game for when Halloween rolls around, a unique premise for an rpg to be sure and it is full of funny and cute moments. It comes with the christmas dlc free ""grubbins on ice"". If you are too old to trick or treat this is a nice game to play while eating a big bag of discount candy on halloween and again during christmas with the dlc.			"

												In structure it's a pretty basic RPG, but making it about a kid collecting candy and costumes on Halloween in order to save their sibling from monsters makes this a fun, innocent game that's easily enjoyable.  The battles can be a bit repetitive, but overall it's a good game that's worth a look when it's on sale.  Just wish it had voice acting.			"

												This game is so awesome, I'm spending Christmas eve and probably Christmas day playing it! You are this little kid who's twin sister has been captured by monsters during Halloween and although you obviously hate her, you have to save her.You collect candy which you use as coins to buy abilities to do turn-based combat against these monsters, you run around the map opening chests, completing quests, and kicking objects for candy. You trick-or-treat from door to door, you talk to  other kids running around...I definitely recommend this game!			"

												This game is very simple, and in some ways feels like a cheaper, off-brand version of a bigger JRPG, namely one of the Persona series, given that you fight with the powers of a swappable costume.But it's got a lot of charm, delightfully cohesive theming, good writing that allows the kids to be kids, and sprawling level design with slightly retro area access puzzles that fit into the Hallowe'en theme very well.There are turn-based battles with quick time events to maximize your damage and reduce the enemies'. They aren't always easy. There is also a two layered strategic system of costume specific special abilities and 'battle stamp' special abilities that can be used with any costume. There are quite a lot of ways to build effective combinations, and in some difficult battles, you will have to adapt your strategy to the circumstances to succeed.Downsides? Well, the camera angle is fixed and with levels so sprawling and complex, it can be easy to miss things hidden behind the foreground that are mandatory for story progression and to have to search for them.Some of the puzzle solving is quite silly, and the player characters' unprompted hints to solve them can be annoying as often as they are helpful.If a baddie wandering on the overworld map initiates combat with you and you lose, you get spat back out in exactly the same place, and the baddie will immediately initiate combat again, giving you no time to switch up your strategy before being launched into exactly the same battle; that can be a bit frustrating.And finally, the lack of complexity can mean that the simple mechanics get a little bit dull even over the short playtime.So its JRPG lite, but I recommend it for the charm alone. This game has actually made me question my disillusionment with the corporatization of Hallowe'en by showing me the cuter costumes and candy in a more wholesome and fun light. If you have kids, invite them to play it too. It seems like a very child-friendly game.			"

I wasn't expecting to like this game as much as I did. I had it on my wishlist for a while and was excited to playt it. But I read beforehand that there's battles in this game and that put me off a bit because I don't like hard games but this was a super cool and casual play. It's got the kind of easiness as the Lego games. 10/10 One of my new favourite games, Can't wait to play the next one!			"

												Costume Quest might be the most casual RPG I've ever played. And I liked it.You play Wren, a new kid who on Halloween night loses her brother Reynold to some monsters that think he's literally a piece of candy. The world of costume quest is rather open as you navigate the town, collecting candy and fight monsters. The combat is turn based where you go from the semi isometric view to a combat zone and whatever costume you're wearing, well, you're now some superhero or creepy monster yourself. It was pretty cool. Throughout the course of the game, you meet other kids from the neighborhood in town, at the mall, at a carnival, and whereever you go in between. Some of the kids will tag along and eventually, you'll have a team of three kids to take on the monsters.I could go on about the graphics and audio design, but they're nothing amazing so I'm just gonna conclude here.7.5/10			"

												This game is short and simplistic. The RPG combat is kinda like Paper Mario, in that you do QTEs to deal more damage. However, you usually only have the option to do a basic attack until your special is charged up (always after 3 turns) or you have a special stamp equipped. There are about ten costumes in both the normal game and the DLC, and only about half of them are worth using in combat compared to the others.Outside of combat, there are four enviroments to explore and solve puzzles in using costume abilities. You can hit basically anyone and anything with your candy pail, which is amusing. The dialogue isn't laugh out loud funny, but I smiled from time to time.The game really shines graphically. The characters are cute, the environments are given a lot of detail, and the battles look amazing. It's all very colorful. Music is average, however.All in all, playing this game is like playing a cartoon from Cartoon Network long ago. Worth buying if it's on sale.			"

												A nice experience, but the main story is very short, like about 6 hours on average. It does not have a complex item or battle system rpg (quick time events for critical hits and defending) so its real easy to dive in and not get confused, but still remains challenging and involving.  My main annoyances is the fixed camera, which makes it annoying because youll sometimes find a large prop hiding your character on screen, and there are only 3 map areas.			"

Combat is pretty simple, missions are simple, the overall game is simple.  This isn't necesarrily a bad thing, but it does get extremely repetitive after a while.  Most of the missions feel the same.  Honestly I enjoy the game mostly for the feels and the setting.  If you are wanting to get into the halloween mood, grab it.

Score: 7/10Similar GamesEpic Battle Fantasy 4, Costume Quest 2SummaryIt's Halloween. You are a kid. Your sibling is kidnapped because some scrubs think that he/she is candy. Powered with your costume powers you must fight to reclaim your sibling so your parents aren't mad at you.The GoodThe graphics are perfect for what the game is. The upgrades you buy with candy and the different costumes you can make by completing quests and exploring are addictive. Just a great goofy vibe.The BadI honestly could have done without the button presses. I mean I barely ever missed them, but I just don't see the point in having them. The game is almost to simple for being turn based. I wouldn't have minded some type of mumbo jumbo fake voice acting to break up the pure text dialogue.ConclusionIt's a fun little game that doesn't take itself too seriously. If it did take itself serious it wouldn't work. This game has charm pure and simple.ValueI'd call it a five dollar game. I didn't play the add on, but if you did the value would probably go up to $7.			"

												Usually when you think of a Halloween game, you think of a scary game, and those are all well and good; but what about a game that really brings the magic of Halloween itself? You know, costumes, trick or treating, having fun with your friends? Costume Quest somehow does it and does it very well. The first level already brims with nostalgia of days gone by (for me anyway) of walking the neighborhood at night and going door to door with a pale for the candy. You may wonder what the gameplay is like - well, first off the story is not serious, it's a light-hearted romp that'll make you smile for all ages. The overall story begins as your brother or sister (depending on who you choose to play as) gets kidnapped by strange monsters who love candy, and you are going to rescue them. The gameplay itself mostly is you going door to door in various places, and sometimes you get an adult with candy (which is like a currency in the game), or it could be a monster, which whom you have to fight.The fighting is done like a turn-based RPG, and you can get little things to help you out, called Battle Stamps. Each stamp has a unique ability you can use, each of your character gets one stamp per person, but you can switch them out if you don't care for it.There's no real dying in the game, you lose a battle, and you can just try again. The settings are really fun, like a neighborhood with various decorations, or a mall etc. The humor is really good, and adults and children will enjoy it, it's really a game for the family. Sadly, there's no co-op but it's fun on its own.There's also the DLC ""Grubbins on Ice"" included which adds 1-2 hours more. The core game isn't TOO long even getting everything, maybe 4-5 hours? But it's a lot of fun, and if you want to feel that Halloween nostalgia, this is the perfect game for you! The sequel is also very good, and worth checking out if you like the first one.			"

												This is a really enjoyable RPG. Probably the only RPG in a while that i found fun to play. The basic story is you have monsters invade the kids town to collect candy which ends with you having to use different costumes for combat and exploration as well as collecting candy by trick or treating houses and by defeating monsters.  Only criticisms are thats it's a bit too easy and the combat which i liked at first for it's anime style gets boring after a while. Also the Grubbins On Ice DLC feels like a bit of a copy and paste of the original story with just a new setting and a few new costumes. But given that DLC comes with the game for free it's not a big deal.Anyway i'd recommend this game. I'd give it an 8/10			"

												Costume Quest is a light-hearted adventure with great ambiance, fun gameplay, and funny dialouge.  It's reminiscent of EarthBound.  Walking around is a little choppy but otherwise I have no complaints.			"

												Costume Quest is another fun game that brings back memories of childhood, especially during the nights of Halloween. This game is full of goofiness and humor, and has a great feel to it compared to most other RPG's that are gloomy or depressing. However, the lack of variety of enemies this game has to offer can make the combat seem a bit stale after awhile. Also, the game really only gets difficult towards the beginning of the second area, and becomes progressively easier from there on out. Overall, the game was still fun for what it was worth. 7/10			"

												Costume Quest is a game about capitalism and the futility of fighting the system. You play as Wren or Reynold, fraternal twins locked into a system in which happiness is always kept at arm's length. Your twin, the object of your worldly fulfillment, is taken from you, and you are forced to incorporate yourself into the capitalist consumer machine in order to free them from bondage - i.e. willfully enslaving yourself even deeper in order to cast off perceived oppression. The erstwhile heroes are indoctrinated into consumerism through perceived need. Costumes and battle stamps are tools by which they can defeat their perceived oppressors, and candy and creepy treats are the currency by which they can obtain them. The creepy treats only award a special costume upon completing a full set, forcing the consumer-hero to seek out other members of their in-group to trade with and developing a reliance upon victimizing the out-group in order to obtain more. The same is true for candy, but on a much larger scale: widescale destruction and abuse of natural resources is encouraged, and upon reentering a zone the supply magically replenishes itself. Candy is ultimately spent on battle stamps, an entirely extraneous commodity that the game can be won without, but is marketed as invaluable and a means by which to constantly sink the children's personal supply of wealth.The true capitalist hero of this story is Sadie, a brave young entrepeneur with a monopoly on the battle stamps market who is happy to aid the heroes in their fight against the villainous 'monsters.' She allows her customers to develop a dependence upon her product before beginning to dramatically ramp up the price to obtain newer and better versions of the same - designed obselescence at its finest. By the end of the game the player is lucky if they have several hundred pieces of candy in their bucket, while Sadie sits on thousands that the player spent to constantly upgrade their battle stamps. The 'monsters' of the game are cast as villains bent on hoarding all the world's candy for themselves, when in reality they are collecting it in order to save their own lives. Sadie, on the other hand, is motivated purely by profit - lying, expanding, and price-gouging to drive it ever higher.The harsh reality is that this game is designed to indoctrinate the player into heedlessly reaping the world's resources and victimizing their competition in the name of achieving fulfillment. They are taught to at the same time fear and trust the two heads of the capitalist serpent, sybomically mirrored by the twin heads of the Doublefine logo: the Repugians, who are the face of foreign investments, and Sadie, the friendly face who is always there to help. 10/10 illuminati confirmed.

												I really liked Costume Quest. I liked that it met my till now unknown need for running around collecting things and RPG fights. It's not high on variety but it's nice in the sense that you hit an area and you know what to do and there are mini quests for variety. I did think the final boss battle was a pretty steep curve, but that's me.			"

												Only Double Fine can make this type of game. Extremely creative take on the classical jrpg genre, but with a unique take on it. Turn-combat mechanics, loads of costumes giving different abilities to characters, collectibles, and Double Fine's sense of humor make this a must have for fans of the genre.			"

												Costume Quest plays like an introductory JRPG: classes are mapped onto interchangeable costumes that are unlocked by finding materials in the environment, equipment comes in the form of 'battle stamps' that can be purchased from vendors, and there are no consumables or 'game over' moments. Combat is simple and turn-based, but made slightly more interesting by requiring the player to press a random button at a given time to maximize or mitigate damage.It's a Doublefine game, so humor is a big part of the presentation. It's suitable for younger players, though some of the jabs at consumer culture and common RPG schticks will probably go over their heads.Between CQ and its (included) DLC, there's roughly eight hours of content.

												Costume Quest is so much fun. Probably one of-- if not /the/-- most fun small-ish games I've played in 2013. It's just so charming and witty and it never failed to make me smile the 8 or so hours I put into it and its little expansion. A fun little distraction, its cuteness betraying its deeper gameplay mechanics and secrets.			"

												This game is a simple game, but a fun one. Unlocking the different costumes and finding the effects is quite amusing as well as the nostolgia of being a kid and playing pretend.

												A nice and short RPG game for everyone. It has nice graphics and a really interesting concept. Beware that it gets repetitive quickly anyway, and is quite easy... but it doesn't last so long as to become a major problem imo. If you are a fan of RPG's i'd suggest to give it a shot. You can find it easily at a cheap price anyway now. If you like it, i also suggest playing the sequel right away, as it's quite simular to the first one but slightly better in everything... and if you wait you will not recognize the characters later on.

												Costume quest is a small, but fun game about saving your sibling after he/she is kidnapped by monsters who are trying to steal all of the candy. The objective of the game is to go to each area, collect candy as well as costumes (hence the name costume quest) and fight any monsters that cross your path.The game style is turn based combat with each costume giving you a different ability, and different quicktime event-like buttons to press to do more damage. The one little problem I have with the game is the fact that the (spoiler alert) French Fry and Vampire costume quicktime event/button press can prompt you to mash the shift key. On Windows, this is a little bit of a nuisance, as the game will minimize and ask if you want to turn sticky keys on. It isn't that big of a deal however, due to the fact that it's a turn based game.The game is not too much of a challenge if you can find the right combinations of costumes and battle stamps with which to fight the enemies. One can easily finish all of the quests simply by playing the game and not going too far out of the way to complete objectives.The characters are lovable (even the grubbins), the style is pretty cool, and the story, while not too exciting, is fun.I would reccomend trying it out.

												This game is really fun, and easy to play. The plot is interesting, as well as the different costumes your character can wear. Each costume serves a purpose for - and out of - battle.

												I've only just started this game, and I can't get enough of it. I will hopefully update this review once I am done with it, but as of right now, I just need to go ahead and wholeheartedly recommend this game.The plot, artwork, and dialogue are cute and fantastic, and very immersive. The combat and gameplay are extremely easy to learn and fun to do. Though it may be simple, it does not come across as monotonous because of the quick variations there are to the combat, the randomness of encounters (both for going to houses and what children are around each street corner). There is a ton of mini-quests to give this game a sense of purpose, though it is still rewarding to complete them.Go ahead and do yourself a favor, and get this game. It doesn't even take up a lot of data to download!			"

												Short answer, yes, i higly recommend it.And the long one:Costume Quest is a light-hearted rpg game, made by one of my favorites developers, Double Fine. The game mechanics are really nice, there are a great variety of costumes and somewhat variable enemies. My only complaint regarding the gameplay is that the fighting mechanics get a little bit repetitive due to some unskipable animations, but nothing too big. Some peaple reported some bugs, but i haven't found any in my playtrough. The game story is light-hearted, but good and there are some really nice jokes. The game's graphics are a cartoonish style and are really well polished and beautifull. I really loved the game, it's a really escape from the same repetitive game formula of nower days, It is somewhat short, I took about 5 hours to finish it, and i'm usually slower than the average to beat a game (It took me about 4 hours to beat the DLC grubbings ice). That being said, I highly recommend Costume Quest for all players.9.8/10			"

												Fun little baby RPG. Double Fine brings its trademark humour to keep it interesting for all despite a childish theme. Were it any longer, it would be unbearbaly repetitive, even at this length, the feeling creeps in.Animation of the battle costumes are are quite likable, especially the patriotic powers of lady liberty.Good Intro to RPG for newbies, and fun to kill a few hours if you're in for a family friendly adventure. Decent overall.			"
