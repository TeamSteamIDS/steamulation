												Having completed the Steam version and PS1 version back to back, here are a few things I noted:- The button layout can be confusing in certain sequences if using a controller, for example; telling you to press B2 or B5 as instructed, requiring you to remember your controllers personal button layout.- All polygons look much better in this version, obviously, but it often clashes very unnaturally with the low res backdrops.- A lot of the ported-to-midi music is noticably worse than the original, some peices sounding broken and off key- Character portraits look a lot nicer and more detailed in Steam version.- The gameplay seems to have been sped up by about 25%, which makes the frame rate APPEAR smoother, although animations still seem to be quite choppy. Particularly makes battles and traversing the world map seem much smoother!- Various scenes will load much faster, ie; card battles and the startup screen, which is a big quality of life difference!- 360 degree movement doesn't work by default, only 8 direction. I'm not sure if this can be modded.When all is said and done, I personally prefer the original PS1 version, but if you don't have access to it, this version is not a bad option either. Hope this was helpful. :)			"

												Hello, my old friend.Years ago, I remember walking into a local Wal-Mart to browse through the bargain bin of Psx games. There I found a green label greatest hits game called Final Fantasy VII. The blonde man on the cover holding a giant sword tore away at my curiosity. So my allowance was spent on this mysterious game I had yet to hear about. Not very long after beating it, I realized I was in love. ""Where has this game been all my life?"" I asked myself. A few weeks later, after saving up my allowances for a NEW psx title, I returned to the same local Wal-Mart and began browsing the sliding door glass case. ""Hmm...Gran Turismo sure looks fun...Tomb Raider....maybe..."", but there at the bottom in the left hand corner it sat. Final Fantasy VIII. I must've screeched from excitement. Though none of these characters on the case looked familiar...""So the games don't connect then?"" I pondered...In a rush to get the game, I flagged the worker down to open the case. Game in hand, I opened the lid of my Psx, removed Dark Stone, and placed in Disc 1...Never has a game brought as much excitement as seeing this sequel that day. It was the best, is the best, and will forever be the best. Now I am no longer a child, at 25 I have 2 children of my own and hope one day they too find their ""FFVIII""...			"

												Edit: Update to the title on 20th June 2014 added more cheats - no fixes to any of the technical issues.Before I get started, Yes I know about the mods to fix it. We shouldn't have to mod the game to get content Square Enix claimed was in the game.FINAL FANTASY VII (Yes, 7) was released on Steam a little while ago. And while many were happy, many were disappointed. Square Enix released the game with awful audio. Entire vocals were missing from some, for example, the infamous ""One Winged Angel"" BGM, and the audio in general sounded very subdued. A modder, Assimi, went out of his way to patch the BGM to the quality it should be. Many months came and went, and eventually, one day, Square Enix released a patch, which upgraded the audio to a better quality.We then hear FINAL FANTASY VIII will be coming to Steam, with what Square Enix claimed - PlayStation Quality Audio! Superb! They won't make the same mistake twice! Surely? Especially not after such a statement...We were wrong.FINAL FANTASY VIII Steam Edition is an almost identical copy of the original FINAL FANTASY VIII PC Port, except this time with added layers of DRM, cheats, and ruined FMVs, along side all the issues of the original port.So all the issues:1) Background music uses low quality midi. 2) Sound effects uses low quality audio (Quetzalcoatls roar sticks out the most).3) Limited to 8-way movement, rather than the 360 movement on PS14) Still uses B1 B2 B3 B4 B5 B6 button prompts if using a Gamepad.5) FMVs have been giving a horrible filter to ""upscale"" them. This blur removes a tonne of detail from the FMVs.6) Linear Filtering simply blurs all the textures, and makes the world map look disgusting.So let's go through these 1 by 1. Links to any mods mentioned will be put at the bottom of the review.Issue 1) Background Music. This is horrible. My main problem here is Square Enix LIED to us. When they announced FF8 Steam Edition they shouted ""PLAYSTATION QUALITY AUDIO!"" from the rooftops. They did not deliver. Here's a comparison:Steam Edition:

			Final Fantasy 8 - Balamb Garden [HQ]		

If you're using any decent speakers, you can hear the massive difference. My speakers cost me about £10, and I'm not even an audiophile (hence the £10 speakers) and I can tell the massive difference in quality.Thankfully - Thanks to DLPB of the QHIMM forums this can be fixed and modded out (and the BGM can be changed to whatever songs you want, just make sure they're .OGG and looped correctly). But. It shouldn't need to be in the first place. Square Enix claimed the game has PS Audio. It doesn't.Issue 2) Similar to issue 1. Unfortunately here I don't have a comparison. But again - SE Claimed PS Quality Audio. They did not deliver.Issue 3) 8 way movement. If you're on KB+M This is absolutely fine since you're inherently limited to 8 way. However many people, with this being a PlayStation game, would play with a gamepad, and if you do, think again about using that wonderful analog stick for 360 movement.Issue 4) So you'd expect, with this being a PlayStation game to use X Square Triangle Circle right, or maybe they updated it to ABXY? Unfortunately not. The game uses the possibly ancient Dinput, because forget updating the game to a more modern form of input, right? Way too much effort.Issue 5) So instead of doing a proper job of editing the FMVs too look decent at high-res, like the 1080p standard, or like me, 1440p, Square Enix applied a filter to the entirety of every cutscene. It's a blur filter. It blurs the FMVs to remove the ""blockiness"" that would occur from upscaling and especially when in motion. Instead of putting in effort to do this, carefully applying filters when and where necersarry, they made it global. Destroying massive amounts of detail in the progress.Fortunately, someone on the Steam Discussion forums applied a better filter, though still not perfect.Issue 6) Linear Filtering is 50/50. It looks okay. In combat, it looks good. Applied to character models, it looks good. Applied to the world map? Oh my.Just look at this mess: http://i.imgur.com/p7QGH2w.pngCompared with it turned off: http://i.imgur.com/pA9jlED.png--------So. What's better about the Steam release? Well the improved hardware compatability is nice. Chocobo World is included as it was with the original release too, so if you never got a chance to play and have the benefits of that, that's a bonus. You also get achievements if you're into those.Cheats. More controversial. The cheats this time aren't as bad as FINAL FANTASY VII. Why? It's just magic. And that's a non-issue if you read up on how to use the card game mechanics and refining to get spells very quickly, and very early. Indeed, you can get many powerful spells for junction via card refining very early on that aren't even included in the cheat. All it really does is remove some of the grind... Which I guess is okay.And well slightly improved graphics due to the higher character model polygons. But that's about it. I would not recommend this in it's current state. This is simply a re-release of the old PC port, with very minimal effort put in to actually updating it.My recommendation would go out to purchasing a PlayStation copy of the game and playing it that way. You can get it for cheaper than Steam on the PlayStation store.--------Roses and Wine BGM Mod: http://steamcommunity.com/app/39150/discussions/0/666828126495993258/FMV Replacement Mod: http://steamcommunity.com/app/39150/discussions/0/666828126807201587/?tscn=1386758049#p1Shoutout to Assimi, the FF7 BGM Modder: http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198004345221/ "

												The black sheep of the Final Fantasy series, Final Fantasy VIII is a game that divides opinion to this very day. Is it good? Is it bad? Does it make a lick of sense? Is Squall a sexy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥? No one entirely agrees on an answer to any of these questions (except for the last one, the answer of which is YES), but I have my own take it. FFVIII is perhaps the most underappreciated games in the entire series. Much like how FFVII deconstructed JRPGs that existed up to that point, FFVIII deconstructs the wave of RPGs that followed in Final Fantasy VII's wake, mocking their tropes and characters, while at the same time telling a very unique story. FFVIII follows Squall Leonheart, a student at Balamb Garden, a military academy that trains SeeDs, a mercenary force designed for one purpose: to hunt down and destroy Sorcerresses. Squall is probably my favorite lead character in a Final Fantasy game, and that has one clear reason: he's realistic. Unlike Cloud or Zidane, he isn't a teenager who can somehow fight the forces of darkness without sweat: he's a flawed person, broken by a crappy childhood and a dehumanising education that taught him how to kill. In essence, he behaves how a real person would in his situation. Over the course of the game, we're treated to a near-constant internal monologue that tells us about the struggles he faces internally and how he deals with them. He's a great lead. The rest of the cast is more mixed, with high points being Irvine, who often reflects Squall, and Laguna, who's chipper attitude is a nice respite from the grim tones of Squall, and low points being the annoying and fairly useless Zell, the bland and boring Quistis, and the game's dumb villain, Ultimecia. The plot itself is also a bit of a mixed bag, with some really good moments offset by some really dumb ones. The battle system is a clear departure from the rest of the series too. Rather than levelling up your characters to build stats, instead, stats are built by ""junctioning"" magic to various stats to increase their parameters. This is a great system, one ripe for experimentation, hampered by one thing: Drawing. Magic works like items in FF8: once you use a charge, it's gone. The only way to get magic early on is by painstakingly drawing magic from enemies: an incredibly tedious and boring prospect. It's rectified later once you get access to card refinement, but it's still a hassle. Speaking of card refinement. this game comes with a very entertaining trading card diversion called Triple Triad, and it's a blast. Simple, quick, yet endlessly addictive. So, that's Final Fantasy VIII. Honestly, I love it, and it remains one of my favorites of the series. However, it's a very flawed game, so chances are, you may not like it. However, approach it with an open mind, and I think you'll enjoy what lies in store.			"

												If you've never played a Final Fantasy game in your life, then here's a great place to start.The Final Fantasy games have suffered from their ups and downs over the years, and VIII is no exception. If you take the time to search for opinions on the internet, you'll find a myriad of opinions ranging from one extreme to the other.At it's heart though, I've found the game enjoyable, replayable - and the few aspects I do not like are swept under the rug.As with most FF games, it relies on turn-based combat, but don't let that fool you. It is possible (and quite easy when you get the hang of it) to finish the game without levelling any of your characters at all. There are side quests aplenty, including the Triple Triad card game, which is fun for the most part, and the chocobo forest mini game.The story is quite in-depth, so while I don't recommend it for the very young, based on this, it is still age and gender friendly - there is romance, comedy, plot twists, and a story and world so rich you might just not want to leave it.The art style might take some getting used to, but the menu, and how magic and summons integrate with characters, may be the biggest hurdle for new players. Simply put - I didn't use magic. Summons are ""junctioned"" to characters to grant them abilities, not the least of which is the ability to link collected magicks to your stats, giving them a significant boost. This is the primary method of getting stronger. As you level, so too do the enemies, meaning you can't outlevel them. It is a unique system among FF games, but somehow it works, and works well with practice.If you're already familiar with FF games, you might have already decided whether or not to get this game, but if you haven't, it's definitely worth a look-see.

Posted: December 5, 2013
												TL;DR?: Don't buy, yet, wait for a sound mod or SE patch.I picked up this game quite eagerly after missing out on FF8 on the PS1. Sadly I was incredibly dissapointed in the poor job Square Enix had done in porting the game to Steam. First problem, I had to navigate a menu that after refusing my Facebook account, forced me to sign up to Square Enix's website. A pain, but a minor one I would have forgotten.Second problem, which damns the game and makes it unplayable, the sound. This appears petty, but the lack of the PS1 soundtrack, one of the games defining features, is lost with the MIDI versions which seriously takes away from the games atmosphere. This is especially damning when you consider how dated the games graphics are, which whilst not a problem on its own, the poor sound artifically ages the game and damages the experience. FF7 received a number of Mods and even an offical patch to fix the sound problem alone, I'd say its worth holding out for one of these until you buy.It is a shame really, as the core gameplay is fantastic, the depth of the RPG mechanics still intact and there is a lot to pick apart in the story, though the lack of a good soundtrack (Which hopefully will be improved in the coming weeks) really does lessen the quality of the package. Hold off buying this until Square Enix or some modder updates the soundtrack, at which point I would actually recommend picking this up.			"

												Final Fantasy 8 was my first game of the final fantasy series.I absolutely loved this game and it made wanna play all the other games of the series (from 1 to 10 at least since i really liked the old style turn based system).This game is still one of my favorites . Altough i was so excited that it was released onto Steam i was a bit disappointed that they quality of the sound was still no match for the ps1 one (although there are some fixes out there that deal with this problem, I still think that SQUARE ENIX should have taken care of these issues before releasing the game).Overall Final Fantasy 8 is still a very good classic game.

												I am a huge Final Fantasy fan so a re-release of one of my childhood favourites was a must-have for me. This is an absolutely fantastic game with such a gripping story. Okay, it doesn't have the graphics that modern games do but they have certainly done a pretty decent job at improving what already existed to make it look pretty good. The only downside to this steam addition is the soundtrack being in MIDI, but that is easily fixed with the Roses & Wine mod. You can even have custom game music and load up The Black Mages for battles if you so wish. If you've never played a Final Fantasy game, I would certainly recommend this one to wet your taste buds. It has everything a good RPG should have; a turn based battle system, gripping story and characters you get emotionally attached to (well, except Selphie in my opinion but I accept that some people do like her). If you don't already own this game, you need to buy it right this second.			"

												Thinking all the time, never saying a word. Looking miserable, wearing awful black clothes. Being rude to people, mood swings.Remember when you where a teenager? Perhaps you are one, and that is why Final Fantasy VIII is a hidden gem, concealed by the fact, hype and fans of 7 & 9.Final Fantasy VIII is in many ways like other FF's, its set in a huge explorable world upon which, a situation arises, threatening its existence, companions are gathered along the journey to prevent it. But what 8 has done is extraordinary although it has to be said, unappreciated. This fantasy is through the eyes of a teenager, Squall, dubbed a Leonardo Dicaprio look-alike misery guts. Which is without doubt true, and possibly a strong reason why so many detest this game, living-reliving the life of a teenager in a world that is the closest to this one than any other FF game beyond 7. Effectively taken place in a Garden (school/college) where the students are trained to be become functioning members of an elite group of soldiers known as SEED. Ok not exactly a clever or exciting plot at first glance but this is only the beginning of something overlooked. Everything about it has that youthful learning element to it, such as the SEED tests as a means of gaining regular income, testing your knowledge of enemies, magic and general surroundings, you participate in field exams where you are graded accordingly on time, battles, attitude, spirit etc. oh and you're not aloud to buy a porn mag because you're to young.Like all successful square games, it begins slow but picks up the pace by new events, addictive mini games and tugs on your heart strings with a puppy love storyline. Clearly, gamers have taken one look at the indifferent main character they must control and shake their fist in disgust that they aren't a mysterious mercenary, fun loving optimist athlete or a womanizing thief with a tail. I'll admit there are moments in the dialogue where you get annoyed at the ignorance of said character, such phrases like ""go talk to a wall"" are aimed at someone spilling their emotional guts and ""whatever"" occurs repeatedly followed by ""....."" making Squall an essentially unresponsive cold jerk.. what he wants you to think.. however the time I played this, I was of a similar age, disposition and could defend 'some' of his actions. As time wears on though, more light is shed as to why your guy seems so hormone ridden, a past frequently visited in game that should be cherished to understand. Ahh but Square likes messing with you and cant resist a sub-plot, cue Laguna (main), Kiros & Ward, three laughable soldiers in the Galbadien Army (who later become a threat to SEED) running around like headless chickens on a journey of old, with Laguna the exact opposite of Squall - a moronic happy-go-lucky journalist. This change of setting and character can be greeted with relief or reluctance as it occurs when things are about to get interesting.Battles are both improved and altered with the addition of a new ""Draw"" system, abstracting magic from creatures and specific points in the world, and simpler nice touches like summoning times with button bashing and chance (due to low health) involved with limit breaks. GF's or Guardian Forces (that's summons, eidolons, aons to you an me) are introduced in a brilliant new way, instead of merely stumbling across them all the time, you must battle them or draw them from powerful boss's. All of which is overawed by this games surroundings. When a place has a name like Fisherman's Horizon you know its gunna be weird.. in a good way. Towns like Deling resemble London with an array of shops and structures like Big Ben. Dollet seems like an old French town with cobble roads and 18th century architecture, even the score fits thanks to the genius that is Nobuo Uematsu. I could write a thesis on how spectacular the soundtrack is but I'll just say look at the soundtrack itself for reviews. Such is the realism of the setting but don't be fooled, around the 3rd disc you'll stumble across the city of Esthar, a gigantic technological wonder the size of a continent.. then you wake up as a writer in a rustic village called Windhill, magic. Shame that such an innovative, well designed game is largely considered poor, when really its similar to all the others. It still has the apocalyptic doom threat, it still has a global scourge of an adventure if you're into doing things properly. There's the giant airship that takes you there. SPACE, 7 went into space for a few minutes, 8 goes there for a while and conjures up some of the most cinematic and thrilling events that square couldn't come up with on earth, so much so they put in a song with vocals and as you know that's a special almost rare treat. Plus you can play cards with cactuars on em!Stunning FMV's accompany the key moments that all culminate into an epic journey of self discovery and destiny. It sounds cheesy but I implore you, give it a chance, this game is superb.			"

												For many of us, we seek to relive the nostalgia that FF8 would offer to us through steam. This review will be a juxtaposition of the PS1 version and the Steam version. I guess I'll start with a few pros:+You can simultaneously play Chocobo World while playing FF8. Chocobo World was not offered on the console version of FF8, so I thought this was a nice addition to the game.+There are much faster loading screens. I think this was one of the most notable things seeing as how I would spend 50% of my time on the console version just staring at a black loading screen between transitions.+Cloud Saving - No, not referring to FF7, but this is a nice way to save your progress without having to deal with memory cards. You will always have your non-corrupt Squall wherever you go.Now, for some cons:-MIDI files are messed up. If you're a big FF fan, you will know that the music plays a big role in the series. The fact that the MIDI files sound like garbage just tells us that Square Enix did not give a **** about the PC port. Thankfully, there is a mod/fix for this, so it's not that big of a deal.-If the Square Enix servers are down, then you're not able to play your offline single player game. I'm not sure if this is primarily because of the cloud server, but it's annoying.-You need a Square Enix account to play. This can be problematic because.. well, a lot of people experience all sorts of problems. Some have problems navigating the site, while others are still waiting for their email confirmation.-This is the PC version, but that doesn't mean that the keyboard controls will be great. If you want to fully enjoy the PC experience, I would recommend a controller for your PC. I bought one for about 20$.I actually did not swap out the music, did not have (too) many problems with accessing my account and still managed to almost get 200 hours into the game. All in all, despite a handful of annoying flaws, I like the PC port. Am I adamant on strongly recommending this game? No. In fact, I would ONLY recommend buying this if you have played a previous version of FF8 and/or if it's on sale.If you are new to the Final Fantasy series, I would not recommend this as you will probably be dismayed by the frustrating flaws of the steam version. This could potentially just leave a bad taste on your tongue overall for FF8, too.TL;DR - Buy if you're a veteran and/or if it's on sale; skip if you're new to the game.			"

												I must admit, after watching my father play this game on the PS1 when I was young, and then when I was older getting to play it myself on the same console, my nostalgia glasses for this game area pretttty thick. But, I'm going to give this a good review anyways, and try to be as unbiased as possible. Pros:-An interesting ""Junction System"" that allows customization of characters stats through their ""Guardian Force"" (who in the previous games were merely summonable monsters). -While the graphics aren't great by today's standards, they're definitely a step up from the PS1 version! There's new resolutions to choose from (and you can play in widescreen! Woot!) and the character models are significantly less pixelated than before! -A Fantastic story, like seriously. Even though I haven't beat it yet, this is really a cool story that I'm really enjoying. -Good characters that I've remembered throughout my entire life of gaming. Squall is just so great, and wow his gunblade is so cool! -The combat is really fun! Honestly one of my favorite things to do in this game is just waddle around on the map and fight monsters. There's just such a good variety, with such good design, plus I'm partial to turn-based combat. Cons:-The music. Okay, the music in this game is amazing, but the quality is not. Square used the original ""midi"" files from the old PC release rather than the good files from the PS1 release, however, there is a community mod out there that replaces the files and makes it all better! So there! I tried to look through my nostalgia glasses and give you a good review of a really cool, really memorable Final Fantasy game. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have!			"

												I've played this game shortly after it was released on the ps. And it is still one of my most favorite games. However like all negative reviews, the audio is not of its original content. I do not recommend buying this game unless you are willing to go out of your way to install mods to bring the game audio to its standards.A customer should not work to fix defects on a product.Audio is one of the most fundamental ingredients in a final fantasy game. I am suprised at square enix's poor decision to allow this.			"

												By far the Playstation version is better than the Steam version:  [PROS]-Steam achievements-Smoothed graphics or original Playstation 1 graphic settings available-Great soundtrack*-Attacking can be hands-on (Example: using Squall’s gunblade or Zell’s Limit Break)-Magic Booster available via the launch menu-Cheats are available via the Function keys-Cheats do not affect Steam achievements-Tons of creative monster/landscape designs-Triple Triad card game-Chocobo World included[CONS]-In order to play Final Fantasy VIII an account must be created with Square Enix-Save files CAN BE LOST due to the Steam's cloud syncing, so be sure to turn off cloud syncing before playing (Library>Games>Right click on Final Fantasy VIII>Properties>Update>Uncheck 'Enable Steam Cloud Synchronization for Final Fantasy VIII')-*Great soundtrack but… the sound is awful on the Steam version due to MIDI; however, this can be fixed (http://steamcommunity.com/app/39150/discussions/0/666828126495993258/#c666828126498515672)-Guardian Force (GF) summoning time can be too long such as for Eden-If you’re hardcore into grammar the typos (mostly in the beginning of the game) may drive you insane-Rinoa.  (She has always driven me insane since the first time I played this game, and the few times where you have to save her in the game I never wanted to save her)Then there's the PocketStation game Chocobo World available via the launch menu to Final Fantasy VIII.  This mini-game can be muted via your computer's sound settings (Windows 7>Speaker/Volume Control>Mixer) and run in the background taking care of itself.  Personally, I find Chocobo World boring; however, Boko the Chicobo can find items (ranked A through D), which can be useful to your saved game once you finish your first Chocobo Forest (Final Fantasy VIII 'Disc 2').  Also, leveling up Boko to certain levels and meeting certain event requirements in Chocobo World can allow Boko to use powerful attacks in FF8's main story with Gysahl Green.Keep in mind that the Steam version of Final Fantasy VIII is far from a remake; therefore, the graphics, sound, and game play are still on par with the Playstation version released in 1999.

												Don buy PC version, play this game on PS1 emulator, because its very lazy port:- just 15-30 fps lock against 60 on PS1 (note for those tho cant remember 1st line which mentions EMULATOR, PS1 in this line means PS1 Emulator, ok? Try not to forget that when you will see PS1 mentioned again)-no analogue movement - very annoying 4 direction movements iwth annoying aimation phase skips, Square could have done a little bit reversing to hack in analogue mvement. Controls are really bad without that.-no filtering for backgrounds - everything is pixelated as hell, them managed to hack in MICROTRANSACTIONS and Achievements via renderer, but was lazy to do add some bilinear filtering or post effect scanlines and gauss filter.-no high quallity cut-scene - somehow they managed to blur original videos that was way sharper and detailed-no HQ music - bad midi that sounds way worse than on PS1, they could have actually make an orchestrated remastering of original music for this release-no proper widescreen support - just a stretched screent-no proper gamepad support - launcher does not support gamepad input, when game just started you have to press x on keyboard before you can use gamepad, all buttons messed up by default, not xbox 360 controller UI was patched it, hell lot of buttons stil displayed as NONEGenerally this game has no improvement over old retail release, actually it worse because of launcher and videos.Fans on forums did much better job on about everything from list, except for widescreen and analogue movement.Square need to invest more money, time and effort into remastering of their classic gems! While game is great this remaster is not, is a lazy hack job, thats why square do not deserve your money.If you just purchase this game - request refund!			"

												Disclaimer: I'm not a contrarian. At least, I try not to be. This has always stood the test of time as my favorite Final Fantasy. I don't say that lightly, as I find the era of IV-X to be one of the most impressive runs of consecutive brilliance in video game history. The characters are as well-rounded as any in the series; this is accomplished by providing the player with a cast of heroes that is less archetypal than most JRPGs. The main character, Squall, is troubled. He's not bright-eyed and eager. His compatriots provide similar contrast just when you think you have them pegged. The junction system is probably overly complicated for newbies. It takes some time to master. And while the tutorials are good at showing you how to work the system. They come at the beginning of the game and negatively effect the pacing. If you can power through that first 5-7 hours though, you are in for a treat.As a character-driven experience, it's tough to find a better entry in the series (perhaps VI?), however the story is slightly muddled by an odd duex ex machina type of plot-hole around the 25-30 hour mark. The good thing is it leads right into one of the most wonderfully action packed moments in the game, thus, in final fantasy history. If you played it and quit a when you were young, it may be a good time to give it another look. The game being sandwiched between two more beloved entries (VII and IX) probably didn't help it's place in history. For my money, it was my favorite. A flawed, but ultimately masterful entry in one of the most celebrated franchises of all-time....and that ending, whew...			"

												Well, where to start. This game is a masterpiece, great example of a jRPG genre. A lot of time spent in this game kinda speak for itself. Great story, maybe little dummed down and easier to pick then the plot from FF7, very good Junction mechanic with all around it (Refine and GFs) and, of course, the best mini-game ever to be placed in any video game, TRIPLE TRIAD!! :) The only complain I have is the music, it's not the original, PS1-like music, it's not even a MIDI version from the original PC version of the game, it's a little better then that, but If you want to play that game as it should be played with a proper music in background, Install Roses and Wine mod, I recommend it to you all. You won't regret it :)P.S. I've just finished the game for around 20th time and It's still one of the best games I've ever played. It also brings memories of my childhood :) Now if you'll excuse me, I have some achievements to unlock :)			"

												FF8 is quite possibly the most discussed FF due to how the public percieves its story and what it really means.I'll explain this game a little for players who missed this gem from back in the day. It is quite confusing to someone who's never played it before for the first time.The game uses a GF system (Guardian Force = aka Infinite Use Summons in Battle with outside of battle skills)Now you need GF's equipped on a character to use basic actions like using Summons, Drawing Magic from Monsters or using items.It's important to realize that there is NO MP at all in this game. Think of Magic like Items. Only way to gain magic is from draw points on the world or Draw it from Monsters in combat.With Magic you can Junction it onto your characters to give them a boost in Stats to greatly increase their capabilities, like putting Fire on STR to boost Damage, or stack Cure onto HP to give your characters a boost in Max Health.The more of a certain Magic you have while Junctioned onto a stat, the greater the bonus. So you'll get more STR bonuses from 100x Fire rather than just having 15x Fire. The same goes for the Level of Magic too. So you'll get even more bonuses to stats for Junctioning Higher Level Magic onto your Stats rather than Low Magics. (Like Cure vs Curage. Curaga gives much more to bonuses)Now everyone should take note that the Limit Breaks in this game are different. You don't get a limit Meter. As such it can be abused to hell if you really want it to, just leave your characters in Low (Yellow) HP and watch your Limit Breaks wreck everything for you, making the game considerably easier.This is a game EVERY JRPG player should experience once in their life. The music is top tier. Boss battles are blood pumping with the music, the story is pretty good and the Superbosses are really fun. Not to mention Squalls and Irving's limit breaks at endgame can completely wreck any boss in a matter of seconds.To sum it all up. This is by far my favourite Final Fantasy, besides Tactics of course.GET IT, GET IT, GET IT, GET IT, GET IT, GET IT, GET IT, GET IT!

												This is a very mixed bag.   First of all I recommend purchasing this release purely for the fact it is available legally, and will run without any major issues,  no hacks/mods/patches etc needed.However,  I feel like the quality of this release is sub-par, compared even to the FF7 release.   FF8 was made for the PC -after- the technical failure that was the Final Fantasy VII PC version.  One of its features was higher resolution Full Motion Videos, and it did indeed deliver on this.   But I don't ever remember them looking as bad as they do in this release.   Whereas the  FF7 videos scaled up to 720p surprisingly well for their age.    Also some videos have very clearly show deinterlacing artifacts, which is puzzling  for something that should have been progressive from the start.      Not only did they do some kind of deinterlacing on some (or all?) parts of some videos,  but they did a♥♥♥♥♥♥poor job, using cheap blend deinterlacing which can clearly be seen in some scenes.I was secondly unimpressed with the background art.   Now we know in FF7,  they were rendered in low-res and the artwork was lost or unavailable to render again at that that point in time;   did they truly make the same mistake again with FF8?    I don't have the original PC version to compare with, so I don't know.   But  some of the background art arguably looks worse than even FF7 did in some areas.   At best it looks about the same;  a pixelated mess.The most offensive act however, is one again, the MUSIC.   Square got blasted for the crappy MIDI renders they released with FF7 both originally,  and then again just recently.   They had the audacity to include the audio in OGG format;  audio of  rendered MIDI.   The finally got a clue and just recently patched the REAL  Playstation Soundtrack back into the game.So why the hell did they not do the same for FF8?   OK it clearly appears to use a slightly more non-standard  format for its MIDI music (and that's what it is.... General MIDI) but could they seriously  NOT  patch in the  OGG support like they did for FF7?   Could they not have applied fan-made  PSF hacks and included the original Playstation Music Files  and instrument samples?That is just a glaring slap in the face.   But I suppose we should be grateful that they released it on Steam from the start this time,  instead of lying to customers  that it would only ever be in the Square-Enix store, like they did with FF7.....One other minor annoyances is they appears to have changed the Overture.   The sequence of images is not only ugly and grainy (like the original PC release) but they appear to have changed the sequence and omitted one or two images, throwing off the timing,  so you are sitting at the white FF8 Logo/Title  while the Overture actually finishes.

   The required internet connection at first is a pain, they ARE lax about AFTER you do it but that is no excuse as to why its a login wall block. You can link your steam account and then unlink it from square enix's website (you still have to have a login) it auto registers the game to that account when you do that but you still play ff8 without having to keep it linked.Now for the actual review, the sound is garbage... its just garbage 


YouTube™ Video: Final Fantasy VIII - The Landing on Dollet (PC Version) 

			Views: 8,866		

			This theme is played during the Balamb examination mission starting on the shore of the Dollet beach.		

  It seems to be a very low quality midi, and upon hearing it for the first time it was rather jarring to say the least. My nostalgia was rightfully kicked in the nuts and left me seeing stars.The button mapps in game show up at B4, B2.. and so on, button 1 button 3 and all that. Getting a ps3 controller is a pain but i was able to do it with motionjoy just install the drivers under driver management. The UI also has issues in that it seems to be missing frames of animation, such as the time bar skips a bit and the window transitions on the in battle menus seem to clip a tad. The forest textures in the overworld also look entirely like garbage and i dont see any reason they couldnt at least attempt to fix them.This link shows a screencap of the forest:http://steamcommunity.com/id/marusame00/screenshot/721997070252044906ONE Positive is the cutscenes look damn good, im positive they re rendered them or did something as they look VERY nice, on the downside the models are semi nice looking but CLASH with the entirely unmodified 2D backgrounds, it would help if they at least applied a softening filter to 2D backgrounds like emulators can do.All in all this gets a 2.5/5 its a butchered port, nothing more, and they didnt even release it with a sound patch which they KNOW from the FF7 debacle to be an issue. This is their SECOND time releasing this and id hope they would of learned their lesson but they didnt.			"

												This is a bad version of this game, and it's a travesty that Square is charging 11 dollars for this. Seriously, just play the PS1 version if you really need to play FF8 again.The music in this version is PC MIDI, which causes the entire OST to sound off in comparison to the original. Square said that they would update this version with the original OST, but they never did. There are music mods, but I couldn't get most of them to work, and the one I did get to work didn't even have the songs set to properly loop. Amazing.On top of that, this version has very jittery looking eight way digital movement that feels terrible, while the PS1 version had analog support. There are also some issues, especially with sound effects, that aren't present in the original PS1 version. The only benefits from this version are the higher resolution UI, FMVs, and better quality models, but that's about it. I guess achievements too, if that's your thing.Keep in mind that this version also adds optional microtransactions for whatever reason. Just avoid it, do yourself a favor, and emulate the PS1 version on ePSXe.  Don't waste 11 bucks.			"

 This Game is a masterpiece, even if I don't like it that much. Why? Mentioned below. TL;DR at the Bottom This Game is pure nostalgic. You go into the Game and even the Intro Cutscene gets you right into the heart. Like... You'll never experience the same feeling I had, without knowing it from the past. I have to admit, that i screamed a little, like a teeny who saw his first Popstar.But besides that, i didn't like it that much. Why? Because I'm not into Love Storys. Thats it. Game is fantastic, Gameplay and cutscenes are Top-knoch, but i can't rely on my feelings when it comes to Love Storys. Same Story in Reallife. I'm not someone who thinks about his/her feelings. I mean i'm not completely retar*** when it comes to feelings but yea... Thats it.TL;DR:+ Squall Leonhart+ Story+ Gameplay+ Amount of things to do+ Guardian Forces+ Soundtrack+ Game Boosters, if you need it+ Chocobo World - Draw- Missable things- ""Disc 4"" restricts many areas			"

 Never had as much fun playing a card game in my entire life!  I would like to call myself a veteran within the Final Fantasy (FF) franchise now. Granted I am probably overstating myself, I figured it is about time I wrote a review of Final Fantasy VIII. From here on I'll refrain from using Roman numerals just to make this review easier to follow. I played FF8 near to the time it first came out on the PS1. I did not complete it, nor did I have any idea of what was going on - I was a mere child at the time dazzled by the beautiful colours, yet puzzled by the battle system and depressed by Squall’s sadness. Years later, I've returned to FF8 and I can say I have finished the game with a good idea of the actual story… But still depressed by Squall’s sadness. I confess from now that I understand why people would NOT have a liking for this game. There are a number of reasons I can and will point out which would detach the ordinary gamer from any will to finish the game, but I love this game and it is, along with FF6, my favourite JRPG of all time.*No spoilers*  Story  FF8 arguably has one of the most convoluted story's of any game I have ever played. The numerous fan theories surrounding the game seem to make more sense than the actual game! I do not take that to be a criticism of the game however - as strange as it sounds. The story is not bad in and of itself as it is very easy to follow. It is one of those games where the longer you think about whether the story actually makes sense, the less it does... So don't read into it too much is what I would say. With that aside, the story takes place in a confused futuristic world. I say confused purely due to the array of varied environments and settings, from educational institutions which feel a lot like mercenary camps, to castles and to outer space. The story itself is a good balance between being engaging and interesting enough to make the player want to be able to find out how the story concludes, whilst still being complex enough to inspire countless fan theories; some of them keep me up at night to this day!The world of FF8 has remnants of the post-apocalyptic FF7 world, whilst not being nearly as futuristic as Final Fantasy 13. The ending is extremely satisfying to the player and does not leave a feeling of emptiness. Characters To my mind, there are two main categories of Final Fantasy main characters. There is the quirky and easy-going kind (Tidus and Zidane for example), and the more aloof, lonely and emotionally confused kind (Lightning and Cloud). The main character of 8, Squall, fits in the latter category. If Cloud and Lightning had a child (which would make for an amazing game by the way), Squall would be that child. He initially comes across as blunt, cold-hearted, distant and anti-social, but over time there is a gradual change in his character as the game develops. He becomes a nicer, blunt, cold-hearted, distant and anti-social character. Despite being a character of very few words, every sentence he speaks always manages to be funnier than the last. His lack of character ultimately defines his character. The secondary characters (particularly Rinoa) provide an excellent contrast to Squall’s personality. None of the characters feel rushed or uninspired, with Zell, Selphie and Seifer standing out as my favourites (Quistis and Irvine are great too).  Music  DO NOT listen to any of the music in this game without having played it first. I say this because the OST is among the greatest I have heard in any game and explains why Nobuo Uematsu will be my favourite video game composer of all time. The music is best experienced in-game first. Whilst I do admit that there are a couple of pieces which are slightly overused, all of the pieces are memorable and unique with a persistent motif running through the whole game. Liberi Fatali, Maybe I’m a Lion, Find Your Way, Man with the Machine Gun, Eyes on Me, Fisherman’s Horizon and all of the battle themes stand out as my favourites. Eyes on Me in particular is played during one of my favourite scenes in any video game –the piece suits the scene perfectly.  Gameplay I must confess that the first time I played the game, I did not have a clue what junctioning is. I spent the entire game spamming summons until I realised using summons just wasn’t enough. To put it simply, junctioning is the system in FF8 used to upgrade a character’s stats and use magic. It is one of those mechanics which are best learnt while playing the game as it is easier learnt than explained. Nevertheless in contrast to other games in the series, characters do not permanently hold magic. Instead magic is collected by each individual character. That magic can then be ‘junctioned’ to a stat. For example, if you wanted high HP, you could collection the spell ‘Full-life’ a hundred times and junction it to a character’s HP stat. This functions alongside the usual summons you would expect to see in a Final Fantasy game. The system is slightly tricky to get your head around when you first begin playing, but with a little practice it becomes easy. It is a system which could put a player off the game, but the story, the characters and everything is worth the struggle. Triple Triad: This is easily the most overpowered mechanic I have ever experienced in a video game. It is a fairly simple card game which can be used to collect items which can then be used to buy weapons for example. I personally loved it and would love to see a similar game (albeit less powerful) in Final Fantasy 15.  Conclusion Final Fantasy 8 is easily one of my favourite games of all time, however I told one of my friends not to play this game. The reason why is that although I love it, I understand that there are many reasons (such as the battle system) why a person would dislike or even hate this game, particularly if you aren’t a fan of JRPGs in general. If you are a fan of JRPGs (particularly the older classics) I definitely do recommend trying this one out. Whilst there are many reasons to hate the game there are so many more reasons to love it. I can guarantee that you are in for the best card game in a game you’ll every play.  8/10  "

												Highly, highly recommend. This game is the definition of gorgeous game making.Remember, this is an old game. I believe I played it first in the late 90's. Back then I was enthralled by the art, graphics, and the breathtaking views. It shows it's age, but the chance to play it on PC at 1080p? Yes, please. One to keep forever.I'm not going to go into best games or best Final Fantasies, but I've played a whole slew of games with great stories or sparkling reviews over the years and very, very few have made an impact anywhere close to this. Final Fantasy VIII is, without a doubt, a must play for all gamers and anyone who wishes to experience great depth of storytelling and gameplay. I can't recommend this enough, and I've told so many friends already.However, it is not for those wanting an evening of mindnumbing shiny lights to forget and walk away from. It is a long game and requires thought, for both the gameplay and the story. It also requires it's share of 90's style game management skills. If this is a learning curve, stick with it, you'll get it and still have plenty of game to go.I'd recommend not using the game boosters though unless you've already played all the way through once or you have a REALLY casual relationship with good games and fine art. Seriously, they take you out of the game too much and cheapen the experience. This game rewards perserverance and draws in curiousity. Play it if you like Final Fantasy, love story games, or need to see a part of gaming history. Oh and get a good controller too, one with full synergy with Windows. You'll thank me later.			"

												You need a Square Enix account to play, which may be problematic because the Square website is a bit fussy with their confirmation emails. I got mine about 24 hours after I asked for it. Playing with achievements is nice, and this is the only way I've found where you can access Chocobo World, but the music is low-quality MIDIs for some reason, and you need to download a mod to restore the audio.If you're an old fan looking to come back, I'd just see if I could find a PS1 and a disc instead. Newcomers, maybe give it a shot, but be prepared to wait for that email.EDIT: Also crashes like a blind Nascar driver. You know those sections with the ticking timer that gives you game over if they hit zero? Imagine one of those ALWAYS counting down and you can't see it. That's what it's sort of like playing this. A crash ever seems to be lurking around the corner. It makes you paranoid and tense, and it's not the least bit fun.Do yourself a favor and track down a PS1 disc and a system to play on. Do not waste your money on this.			"

												Nominated this game for Steam's ""Test of Time"" award.In my eyes it truly has withstood the test of time and still holds up strong against many of today's latest releases.Final Fantasy VIII will always have a special place in my heart, being the very first game that when i watched someone play, i was so hooked upon the story that i had to rush out and buy myself the game and a Playstation 1 to play it.I won't go into the argument about which FF was best since after getting hooked on FFVIII, i bought every single one on release stopping after FFXII-2 and enjoyed all of them, some more so then others but time and time again FFVIII draws me back as no game has and i simply adore the story as much as i love the main protagonist XDSo when i saw FFVIII on sale i simply had to buy it to play the story out once more on my PC. However as you can see, RL & a major backlog of unplayed games has gotten in the way so i will update this review once i play it through. I highly enjoyed my hundreds' of hours playing this back then on console & am looking forward to doing the same on PC.I would highly recommend this game, especially if you can grab it while on sale. Well worth the money with the many hours of enjoyment you'll get from it. "

												Originally released on the Playstation and then ported to the PC, the Steam copy of Final Fantasy VIII is a fairly cheap way to access one of the PS1 era classics while also getting to use the Pocket Station game Chocobo World (a mini-game that didn't come included with non-PS1 versions of Final Fantasy VIII outside of Japan, which can give items in FFVIII.)I'll get right to the negatives, not just of this port, but of Final Fantasy VIII. [ CONS ]These are pure problems.-MIDI music. There's guides on Steam for how to fix this, but the fact remains a fresh install will see lower quality music in various situations than in the PS1 version.-Square Enix DRM on the launcher. If their servers go down for maintenance, you can't play your single player game. That's stupid. -If you already have Final Fantasy VIII, Chocobo World's really going to be your only major draw to this, since cloud saves don't justify the above DRM. -Final Fantasy VIII's story requires a lot of work on you, the player's part to make it decent. This seems to stem from odd narrative choices and mistranslations, but the fact remains you might find yourself disappointed with a world where child soldiers are led by Evil Robin Williams to battle a Double Witch. YMMV. -Gamepad support is iffy. Sometimes, if your gamepad disconnects for any reason, even if you reconnect it, you're stuck using the keyboard until you close out and re-open the game. [ MIXED ]Middle of the road. +/-The magic system in this game is polarizing. Essentially, you use a command called Draw to take some magic from what you're fighting. Then you can equip that magic onto your stats via a feature called Junctioning. You can also get this magic from other sources, like converting items (cards come to mind). I personally don't get the hate for it, the system's pretty simple and lets you inch out whatever level scaled opponents you're facing with minimal thought involved, but note a lot of people don't like it. +/-With the relatively young age of the main protagonists, the ... Gunblades, and the odd direction the story tends to go in - while there's a unique identity to the world of this game, it can feel like a high school drama with magic and gun swords thrown into it sometimes. +/-It has a better story than Final Fantasy XIII. But that's not saying much.  +/-Hard to relate with the romance build up between Squall and Rinoa (two main characters), but I'm sure there's fans for that. [ PROS ]Where the game does well.+If you don't have Final Fantasy VIII and are a Steam addict, it takes three seconds to fix that Midi issue above. Square Enix sales happen a lot too, so the game's usually dirt cheap.+Triple Triad. When the world is on the brink of destruction, play card games. +You can cheat. Cheat a lot. Use the launcher to give yourself a ton of drawn magic, or use the hidden Function Keys to cheat in all kinds of things. While no Final Fantasy game is hard, this can be very useful for speed running or getting yourself up to a certain point in the game if desired. +Lots of Steam community material on where and how to mod Final Fantasy VIII into a better looking, better playing game is available. +Final Fantasy music. Always good. +Guardian Forces (this game's summons) actually level up and unlock you new abilities. This and the square button mashing damage bump when you summon them in battle makes them a lot more interesting than Final Fantasy VII's cutscene spam. +Everything concerning Chocobos, be it the Tamagotchi style Chocobo World or the overworld chocobo mining, is enjoyable.+You serve under Robin Williams, Evil Headmaster Military King who trains children to use experimental demon magic, casually hands students he wants to see die lamps that transport them to hell to fight Satan without telling them what it does. It is implied he banged the main antagonist while possessing a minor protagonist, so he was in bed with a Triple Witch. Furthermore, when the actual owner of the Garden (think flying military base) gets mad that he tried to have a political leader -murdered and fails during an already tenuous war- and attempts to placate said understandably angry nation, Headmaster Robin Williams has the appropriate response in mind after stomping off from the well mannered NORG, his lips profusely wet from screaming. ""CHILDREN? FIGHT TO THE DEATH""Did I mention there's a dating hangout area for the students of this Garden, and so he has Tyrannosaurus Rex(multiple) stocked there for ""training purposes?""The guy's a menace. Play this game so you can discover how Robin Williams nearly doomed the world.			"

												As much as I love Final Fantasy 8, I'm finding myself wanting to pull out my origional copy and play it again.1.Visuals: While they are updated for the characters, the world map suffers. Everything looks like it was put through a blur or blend filter. The forests look horrible the towns look horrible, the world map looks horrible now.2. Monsters: They don't really look any different from the origional, ****they also don't level up as you do (like in the origional). Why would you change a feature that allows casual players to play through at their own pace while still making random battles worthwhile, into something where people are going to be equipping Enc-None for 90% of the game. The point of that system was to make the game for everyone, if you wanted to play hardcore, you level grinded at the start and the battles became harder, enemies got new moves and so on. Now, nothing changes.******EDIT***The normal monsters do level up equal to Squall's level, the Bosses/GF's don't seem to. Diablo was 7 levels lower than my whole party and Ifrit was 4 levels lower. I didn't check any other boss so far.3. Controls: The keyboard equivilant of 'select' is default set to the J key while the ""Square"" button is set to S. So when using the boost command on your summon, you end up crossing your arms to hold J and mash the S key to boost your summons. Not a horrible thing, but for people who are right handed, it's a ♥♥♥♥♥.4. Sounds: While I don't mind the normal sounds of the game, memorable although lower quality due to being original PC MIDI files. You summon Quexelotl (lightening bird) and while it look pretty the sound is horrible, listen to the origional compared to it and you will be horrified. (haven't noticed the same with other summons (yet).5. Official description of game: Really, Galbadia didn't declare war on Dollet, it attacked it in order to take the Comm. Tower. Squall and Siefer are not a part of Dollet nor is their 'Training Facility' Balamb Garden, as the name might suggest it is located elsewhere (on another continent). The person who wrote this part should be fired for not even playing the game, how can you screw up something that is explained within half an hour of gameplay.Overall, I recommend buying the game from the playstation store. Either via a ps3 or PSP (any version) or if you don't have that then I'm sorry but this lackluster game is the closest you'll get to the origional.FInal comment and biased opinion: This is the crap that happens when Square Enix gets a hold of a SquareSoft origional, please don't support this utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t because it's obvious that they don't care about you, only your wallet.

												Despite my love for Final Fantasy, the PC releases for the series were never that great. While Final Fantasy VII was salvaged by having a fairly simple implementation on the Playstation One, Final Fantasy VIII has a significant problem when compared to it's alternate platform.Let's put it simply, the PC version of Final Fantasy VIII was terrible. It looks terrible, it sounds terrible. Music shipped with this release is an unexcusably terrible cacophany of MIDI instruments that lack in detail that made the Playstation One release as great as it was. Despite the potential for better hardware, the game looks fairly terrible when on the field and in certain 3D environments. Texture tiling is rampant in the overworld, whereas the Playstation One version managed to avoid that alltogether.I love being able to play VIII on the PC, but it comes with the sheer bitter taste of knowing that what I'm seeing is nowhere near as good as it was on the first platform I played the game on. Even with it being as old as it is, it's a damned shame that the PC version of this game had it's artwork stripped bare of what made it look and sound so good.That's not even getting into the playability part. With everything in the game being referenced as ""Button 1"" through whatever, it's maddening to try and map them. While you can fumble your way through the launcher's configuration, do NOT try to mess with the configuration inside the game, else you will get your controls all sorts of messed up and you won't be able to restore it. This is where even giving me the Playstation's references would have been helpful, but in this case it just failed hard, which resulted in me having to restart my game in order to get the controls back in order.It can be done better, it has done better. For those with access to Amazon, or Playstation Network, consider finding a Playstation copy instead.			"

												(EDIT: Due to the high level of knee-jerk downvoting I've noticed as I happily play via emulator after my steam refund, I thought I'd explain a little something: I adore FF VIII (otherwise why bother even warning people about how wretched this port is?), it's my favorite PSX Final Fantasy and my 3rd favorite, full stop. I know I use big words, but you do yourself a disservice when you don't read to the end of a document - reading is a big part of JRPGs, after all)FF VIII is a deeply misunderstood Final Fantasy, probably because it breaks with so many series traditions and has a mechanics system based around stat management. This requires more responsibility on the part of the player than a lot of JRPG fans would probably prefer; you don't just gain levels and skills, it's on you to figure out how to develop your characters the best way. But there has been plenty written about the gameplay and storyline on both sides - I would like to focus on the Steam port.You'll notice on the store page that you're also required to agree to a Square-Enix EULA. This may not seem like a huge deal, just hit ""accept"" and agree not to basically break down and resell the game, right? If only. You'll first be required to make a separate account, log in via their website, confirm again via email, and then enter a setup window.Here you can arrange the buttons for your controller, and here is the ultimate deal-breaker for me. Hope you arranged everything exactly as you like it, and never want to change anything, because in-game your controller buttons will be referred to by their device names, that is, B1, B2, B3, etc. This isn't so difficult until you consider that a number of characters' limit breaks and other attacks rely on timed button inputs - hope you don't ever want to play as Zell!Also, every time you start the game you'll need to use your keyboard. You cannot boot it up, grab a controller, and go. You know, the implicit promise of a console game from the PSX era.Couple this with MIDI music left over from the 15-year-old PC port and you're left with the option of spending hours installing mod after mod to (supposedly) get the game to be (maybe) playable, and I'm forced to say that once again, Square-Enix has shown itself to be the animated zombie corpse of Squaresoft. What a mess.			"

Teal DeerDevelopers: Square Enix Publishers: Square Enix Initial release: Feb 1999 (PSX), Dec 2013 (PC)Genre: JRPG#Worth/NotWorth: #WorthExposition, Concurrence and SummationI played and finished Final Fantasy VIII on the original PSX; In all honesty, I don't believe I truly understood the breadth of variance within the GF-Junction system. It's likely I don't understand it's subtle nuance still. This is a standard JRPG. In fact, it's THE standard or at the very least the standard for this era of gaming regarding this specific genre. This is a port of the PSX version. Meaning, all the low-res static jpeg backgrounds with your polygonal character models running around you remember are here. Complete with the pre-rendered FMV sequences that made these games stand out back on the PSX. To be fair, the switch between a static background to a FMV whilst retaining control of your characters is still impressive. Not from a technical or processing power standpoint mind you but from a purely visual effect perspective it remains immersive and effective as a story telling element. I'm not about to attempt to delve super deep into the GF-Junction system but here are the basics. You have multiple GF's (Guardian Forces) and multiple party members; You assign one or more GFs to a party member. Depending on how leveled those GF's are they allow you to Junction magic into specific stats to increase your characters abilities. Aside from this point they also allow you some leeway in drafting your own list of commands in battle. GF's can also be summoned in battle as an attack or provide buffs/debuffs depending on which you are using. Some are overtly placed in your lap while others are hidden in draw points from specific enemies and other locations. Because of how integrated this GF-Junction system is, as without it, you quite literally are only allowed to do basic attacks. Something as simple as reaching into your item bag is not feasible without them; the game grants you a fairly easy to grasp “Junction exchange” in where you can swap all GF's and magic that is junctioned without having to drag yourself through setting up each party members junction setup every time your party switches (which happens a lot). There are also auto setup options to optimize attack strength, defense or to prioritize magic should manually junctioning things prove too much to handle.Addressing more topical issuesThe game does have gamepad support. I'm aware it claims it does on the store page; I am also aware of other reviews claims of it not working. I will quickly surmise my experience with a gamepad support:  I used a X1 gamepad The D-pad was not functional without some relatively tech heavy workaround by default The opening screen requires you to press 'X' on the keyboard regardless of any gamepad setup you may or may not be using With the utility known as JoytoKey or any other keymapping software, it's a fairly simple process to setup up a gamepad to use both analog and digital controls. As well as be able to assign a face button to that pesky 'X' prompt at the title screen. It's not a big deal.THE GISTFinal Fantasy VIII is, in truth, the only Final Fantasy of the PSX era that I got past the first Disc (out of four). It remains one of my favorites to this day. Sure, it's definitely dated but at some point you might be asking for too much from a game this old.Follow my curation for more "

												(no spoiler review) Final Fantasy VIII:  A pretty good RPG with some really interesting mechanics. It is now the highest number FF game I've beat, so you can tell I'm behind in the series. Even though I only just beat it, I actually owned and played FF VIII the year it came out, but got so addicted to Triple Triad that I never progressed the main story more than a few hours; so it felt really good to go back and finally beat it.A lot of the game systems threw me off at first.  Understanding Junctioning and GFs took me a really long time to figure out. Once I got used to the system, I really liked it. It was addicting to level up by GFs to get new abilities and stats on them, especially when it meant I could open up a stat to junction magic onto, which made the characters much more powerful.  However, as the game progressed, the attaching gfs and abilities to each character became probably my biggest complaint about the game. The reason for this is that every friggin' 10 minutes your party either splits off, or certain characters become unavailable, or you switch between parties, and every single time you have to switch junctions, abilities and magic to your new group (and if it affects their hp then you have to waste cure magic to bring their hp up). This drove me crazy and really disrupted the flow of the game.I highly enjoyed the Steam version of FFVIII. I read a bunch of complaints about the Steam version, but the only one that I thought was valid was that all the music was in midi format, which made it all sound horrible. Luckily, someone created a mod that replaced all the midi music files with non-midi ones, so once I installed that, I got all the regular music back again. Another bonus of the Steam version is that the game comes with a lot of cheats. They have some pretty heavy ones, like always have full health, or always do 9999 damage. The only ""cheat"" I indulged in was the amazing high-speed mode. By pressing F1, you could activate high-speed mode which sped everything up by a factor of five. I found this to be a great QoL feature that I used mainly during the game's ridiculously long summon sequences, grinding regular battles, and parts that I had to repeat due to me dying and reloading a save. This feature, along with the Half-Encounter/No-Encounter abilities one of my GFs learned, made it so I could cut through overly long segments and random encounters if I didn't want to deal with them.As for the story and characters, overall I thought they were good. The story got really complicated and weird towards the end, but I liked it. I had to research some stuff during the game and afterward, because the game didn't explain many things that the characters would talk about and reference, which was frustrating. I know a lot of people found Squall too moody, and he was very moody, but I really enjoyed the arc of his character. I think my two favorite characters were Quistis and Zell. I also really enjoyed Laguna, Ward and Kiros. "

												I was excited for this game. I beat it into the ground in 1999 and was looking forward to playing it again with the new features offered in the Steam edition. I wasn't able to get the game launcher to load past 10%. This is a pretty big issue on the forums with no straight answer on a fix. This is the first game I've had refunded in my 10 years on Steam. Apparently the music is also a bad MIDI reproduction of the OST but I couldn't play it to verify myself. Square-Enix doesn't have a good track record of console to PC ports. I'm better off dusting off my PS1 and playing it that way.			"

												Like many players, I dislike the magic system used in FF8. However, many other people hate this game for just that reason, while I decide to overlook that issue and learn to love the game for what it is. The idea of giving summons (known as Guardian Forces) HP instead of draining your MP is actually pretty well done, because it gives you more reason to use your summon abilities more often in non-boss encounters. In conclusion, this game has its share of flaws, but people should learn to overlook those flaws and see the game for what it is.			"

												I, personally, don't know why the bloody hell people dislike this game so much.  Sure, the junction system takes some getting used too (especially if you're used to the traditional MP system) and continually drawing magic from enemies can, and will get tedious, (have your GFs learn them refining abilities!)  not to mention the teen drama style story might not be up everyone's ally, but in all fairness, FF8 is a solid game with a ton of nostagia surrounding it, for me anyway.  The smooth looking Steam version is very appealing to the eyes, but the stock midi format music kind of kills the trip down memory lane for me. I mean come on! FF8 has, in my opinion, one of the best soundtracks in the Final Fantasy collection. I can understand making the game smaller in size, but the music is a key factor in the whole Final Fantasy experience.  (Nobuo Uematsu is a game music GENIUS!)  But fear not friends, get the Roses and Wine mod for oust the midis and replace them with the original PS1 music, or add some of the different songs that come included, I recomend the orchestrated Balamb Garden, Blue Fields, Boss music and Battle themes. The replacement Winhill flashback music is a good break from the original music box version too.  All in all, the Roses and Wine mod is a major saving grace for this purchase, and I highly recommend it.			"

												I'm mixed on this one. I would only recommend the steam version of this game if you're going to take the time to mod it in order to fix all the sound and graphics problems. However, if you're not willing to mod the steam version you might as well use an emulator or pull your old playstation out of the closet instead. When I first installed and played the game I was highly dissapointed. The gorgeous music I remembered was replaced by horrible sounding midi and the textures are far more pixelated than I remember the game being. On top of that, I was having trouble getting my PS3 controller to work and had to play the game on keyboard, which I did not desire to do. Upon searching for a controller fix I also found fixes for the graphics and music. After installing a set of mods (Tonberry w/ Seed Reborn, Project Eden, and Tripod) along with replacing the music files and getting the controller to work, my opinion on this game completely changed for the better and I am incredibly happy with my purchase. Yes, we shouldn't have to spend an hour modding a game we just purchased in order to make it pleasing to play, but this game is worth it. It is, and has always been, my favorite of the Final Fantasy series for it's story line, characters, environment design, music, and atmosphere.			"

												This game is widely known to be a great entry in the series, one that has great pre-rendered cutscenes (both for the time and still today), fantastic music, an intriguing plot filled with action and drama, and a heartfelt love story that starts with two unlikely people and builds over the course of the game. I personally love this game and believe it lives up to its standing - but the Steam / PC port is simply not the version to get thanks to the ridiculous and ugly Square Enix DRM popup that shows up every time you run the game, as well as the soundtrack sounding like trash since they used MIDIs instead of MP3s.There are many ways you can enjoy this game. Go out and seek an alternative.			"

												I thought my ears were deceiving me but they were not. Square seems to have an issue keeping the original osts in the Steam releases of the Final Fantasy games. As of now, playing the game in this current state doesn't bring the same ear-pleasing experience as playing from the original FF8. There most likely isn't a good enough reason why the tracks were replaced considering Square made that mistake once with FF7 and corrected it soon after many complaints. I'll leave this as a recommendation because this is my favorite childhood game and surely Square will fix this so you can experience one of the most underrated Final Fantasy games out there.			"

												Bad port of my favorite game ever.This is my favorite game of all time. It's also a downgrade from the original version. The music is lower quality. To even start up the game is awkward. I also keep getting some notification in the top left corner during battle which has something to do with Steam and achievements. It's still a great game. But poor ports like this should be frowned upon. Oh and you also have to create a Square Enix account to even play this game.Square is an awful company. Late 90s Square is the greatest company of all time; they put out the following games in a between 1997 and 2001:Final Fantasy 7, Final Fantasy Tactics, Xenogears, Final Fantasy 8, Final Fantasy 9, and Final Fantasy X. Let me put it another way. In less than 5 years, old Square put out 6 of the greatest games ever made. I'm also not counting other fan favorites like Chrono Cross, Parasite Eve, and Vagrant Story. This company was a serious beast. After the release of FF12 (which was mediocre), it took the company 7 years to come out with FF13. FF13 is one of the worst games I've ever had the displeasure of playing.New Square is garbage and only their Eidos brand puts out good products. Square itself develops trash and creates terrible ports of amazing games. How many version of FF4 are there now?It's really hard for me to recommend this game. If you have no other way of playing this game, you should probably go ahead and buy it. Just know that it's not meant to be like this. I'm ashamed to even give this version a recommendation.An aside -- don't purchase Square games on Steam. Not even great Square games. Square is just looking to churn out half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ports to Steam users.			"

												When I was a teen, placing in my PlayStation for the first time, I knew I would be a gamer for life.  This wasn't Sonic jumping on robot creatures or the pixelated curiosities that were the original Final Fantasy's on the NES.... This was a heartwarming journey weaving an epic and timeless tale of the human spirit.I collect and play Final Fantasy games, and this one is my classic favorite.  The story and characters are more realistic than the previous games starting a trend in the series.  It hurts to relive the pixelated limits of 5th generating gaming, but if you can look past (as we all had to back then), you will see a beautiful 3D rendered world featuring elements from modern architecture, classic fantasy, sci fi, and steam punk.  This was one of the first multi-million dollar game productions, and it shows.  I'd love to see high-res versions of these backgrounds.The magic draw system is tedious to play as a completionist, but it is a fun diversion for adventurers because with every enemy encounter, there is an opportunity to draw something unique you can use in gameplay.  Also, each of your party is setup like a blank slate and you strengthen them with magic you've drawn.  So, unlike other RPGs, you can create your own jobs using any of your favorite characters.  And the backgrounds, Enemies and GFs are artistically rendered, and it's easy to feel a sense belonging to this world.  For newcomers to classic RPGs, think of a large open world game like Skyrim or Fallout 3 with quests, but with a turn-based battle system.Pro draw tips: Make every character able to draw and Mag-J if you can.  Find one weak enemy, draw with each character and hold down the confirm button.  I use Xpadder to toggle-hold it down.  If you have to draw from a stronger enemy, you can put one person on cure-duty, and I like to make Selphie weak on attack (no or weak Str-J and low level) and give her mug and put Stop on Status-J.  This is a good setup for the draw, and also a weak attack can help you bring their hp low without killing so you can finish them off by turning them into a card (which is refinable and also gains AP).  In the beginning of the game, I find galbadian soldiers (which have 4 spells) and Fish from Balamb are strong early draws.  When you convert a Fastitocalon fish to a card and refine it, you get 20 Water which is a midrange attack spell and a powerhouse on Str- J early in the game and defeating them yields 3 AP each which I think is even more lucrative for grinding than the famous cactaurs.Also, there is a chance to play the game non-violently which should appeal to some including women and girls who may also appreciate the game's romantic undertones.  Most of the enimies are not evil minions.. They are more like nature's creatures in this fantasy world.  Gaining experience from killing is not really rewarded because the enimies gain xp as you do.  However, you can non-violently draw magic.  I have a combo team: One freezes the enemy and steals items with a weak whip attack, a second draws magic, and the third heals any damage recieved.  You can also gain the coveted AP (used for building abilities for the Guardian Forces which are like spirit-assistants in battle) by turning enimies into cards (which I like to imagine is like keeping them as a pet).  Not that this release isn't without problems.  To me, the most noticable omission is analog controls.  They were a great improvement over FF 7 and brought the more realistic characters to life.  Also, it's a shame the face lift didn't make the cards in the in-game card game, Tripple Triad, higher resolution.  I also didn't like the control customizations which don't support the triggers or the D-Pad on the X360 controller; although the extra buttons are really needed.  I used Xpadder to keyboard emulate to fix that and emulating the keyboard's ""confirm"" key because the gamepad one doesn't work everywhere. Unfortunately, this means setting up both gamepad and kb controls in the game's settings.  I wish I could just disable gamepad support in the menu and do full keyboard emulation.  That way, I could keep it all in one place.In fact, first, the fact that it wasn't exactly the same as my mint condition Play Station 1 version infuriated me.  However, when I took my rose colored nostalgia glasses off for a moment, I can appreciate that it has HD 3D (although they had to preserve the original lo res background images).. and there are things you can do to achieve a more original look including lowering game resolution and checking the ""original graphics"" box in the settings.  Also, the high resolution character and GF profile pictures are a nice touch.  I found the MIDI music an acceptable with those nostalgic melodies, but I hear you can community patch it with original sound.  I imagine they had copyright issues with sony requiring them to use PC-MIDI effects.  Modern games tend to have a lot less music, so appreciate the themed soundtrack that accompanys you throughout your journey.Thank you, Square, for bringing these Final fantasy games to Steam.  I hope everyone interested chips in and rewards Square with a little fresh support for these efforts.  Not everyone can collect classic consoles like I do, and very few FF fans can collect every console every FF game was originally released on.  Even for a console collector, it can be more convenient and practical to download from steam and avoid using outdated hardware (I admit: my PS 1 joysticks are getting a bit stiff d: )  Also, we have a chance to share the classics with the younger generation.  But trust me, if you can overlook the outdated graphics, the near-futuristic sci fi and fantasy atmosphere will feel modern and timeless.			"

												I would definitely recommend this game to any Final Fantasy fan and any person new to this series. At first, I did not like this game, but when I replayed the game after a few years, I realized how good this game is. It has complexity to it and once you get the hang of the magic and leveling system, it is so vastly different from all the other Final Fantasy games. I have this game on Playstation and Steam. The music is another plus to this game and adds a whole other dimension to the games story.			"

												  This is the first time I have had the opportunity to review a game I have played for years! First off for the winers and detractors remember this game was released when win98 was the hot new operating system and you had to spend a ton of cash for the great new 486 computer with maybe a 16meg video card and 4megs of ram!! Yeah guys gigabytes were a programers wetdream! The PS1 had just come out and this game was the cutting edge in graphics! Yes I played this game on such a computer.    My profile may say 11 hours played on record but I still have the original PC version installed on my system! I have played this game for hundreds of hours and have loved every second of it. Well maybe not every second cause you do have the odd OPPS! moment and there are some tough battles.    Now for the game. The port system that has been used does have it's querks like the 720p window ( what ued to be called 640 by 480) inside the fullscreen port. Starting and ending the game are a bit cumbersome as I have a cordless rumblepad so the keyboard controls do mess with me. 5.1 sound takes care of the need for ingame volume that was designed for the PS1 plugged into an old CRT possibly stero tv anyway! I did notice one graphics glitch when riding in the garden car to Balam but the sceen is short and not to important. The magic boost in the start menu was a nice touch and saves a lot of work early in the game. You still have to build up your GF levels and ablities which means your characters still get leveled up pretty fast. What I would recommend is a patch to remove the echo screen command in the sync to server message, but for the most part I can ignore it.   I have played FF1 through 8 and 12. I have FF9 but it is still on my to do bucket list YAY! Every one of those FF games has been an experiment or should I say a work in progress. Each one had a huge list of things to find make or create to advance the game and build your characters. One game does not a series make or break for that matter. This all came together in FFVIII. The side quests the card game and all the other features make this the best in the series to that date. Yes I mean way back when it came out in 98!    As for the grand expiriment that is FINAL FANTASY I can only hope to live long enough to put on the harness strap into the cage put on the VR helmet and play the game LIVE!!!   All I can really say is bravo 10 out of 10 they did not change the game during the upgrade!!!  "

												My absolute favorite game of all time. <3Where to begin. Hmm. //StoryI think the story is probably the most important aspect of a Final Fantasy game. The story in FF8 is, well, weird. It starts off simple enough, you are a student in a military school on your way to your first assignment. After a while things become very weird, almost dreamlike, introducing characters from different timelines and so on. This is probably one of the cons for many people, because the story doesn't really make sense. But if you read into some of the theories circulating the web (*cough* Squall Is Dead *cough*), the story starts to make sense and in my opinion becomes much more enjoyanble!//CharactersThis game has a list of lovely characters. Well, some might think the main protagonist is a bit Emo and not fit as a party-leader. And that's the beauty of it, he ISN'T fit as a party leader, he doesn't even WANT to be that, he sort of was just put in that situation and has to deal with his social anxiety and peoples problems that he can't even get his head around. In my opinion that makes this game so beautiful, because Squall reminds me of me and my personal struggles I've had. Squall seems very hounest and almost autistic in his behaviour, that makes him very real and not so much a ""cliché hero"" character. //GameplayWell, mostly you're stuck in cutscenes and dialogues (as sadly is the case with most FF games).The battle system is simple enough, with a gimmick, you can get a Crit attack with Squalls Gunblade if you time the attack correctly (only Squall, not the other party members). Something I almost wish they would implement on ALL characters, as it actually feels pretty satisfying.The other thing that is a heap of a mess before you really get into it, is the Junction system. Basically you Equip a GF (Guardian Force (Esper / Aeon)) in your mind, that GF in turn gives you certain Stat slots in your mind, where you can equip magic, that you gather from monsters using Draw (confused yet?). All I can say is that, it took me a 3rd playthrough as a kid before I actually fully grasped the system. That being said, I actually LOVE it now, it gives alot of customizability and you can fine-tune characters a bit more than most FF games. //MusicDefenitely one of Nobuos finest masterpieces, it suits the game very well and has several memorable pieces that sticks to me to this day, nearly 20 years later!//OtherTriple Triad is a card game in FF8 that is really good!I've played through this game more than 10 times (both PC and PS1 versions) and I'd defenitely recommend it if you have the patience, and like JRPGs in general. If not, I guess it's ok to pass, as I totally understand that this game isn't for everyone.Edit: I nominated it to "" The “Test of Time” Award "" in Steam Awards as it's a game I come back to very often and still enjoy.

												Final Fantasy VIII is a game that was an experimental shift from the traditional Final Fantasy series. This is a game where you do not need to level and grind in order to beat the game. For that reason alone, someone can beat this game in under 12 hours if they truly wanted to. To fully embrace the characters, that is a whole different situation. To sum up the mechanics and key differences, FF8 focuses around enemies that will scale to your highest level hero. You will be allowed to have up to 3 heroes at any given time. Your main source of power comes from your summons, which act as something you can equipt in a new system called Junctioning. In Junctioning, you must attach summons and pick their respective abilities. They act as stat boosters and provide unique skills. Through this new system, you must ""Draw"" unique magic. These are much like your traditional spells/magic such as Fira, Cure, Esuna, only with Junctioning, you attach these limited spells like equipment and can potentially attach one spell to each attribute stat to boost them. In fact... this is your main method of powering up, not traditional grinding. Drawing magic is possible through almost every monster you encounter, or ""Draw-Points"" that are located throughout the game. These magic spells you ""draw"" are expendable and limited. If you run out, even if you have the best spells, Ultima, Holy, Demi, you must re-draw them from key locations, monsters, or through a craft system called ""Refinement.""A lot of people will miss the point, but this series adds a bonus method of Crafting or Refinement by means of a card game, Triple Triad. It's a simple game where you have 4 numbers for each direction, top, right, left, bottom, and you must play your strategy to beat the numbers of the previous set cards. There will be additional rules that come into play to make this much more challenging. Using these cards, you can potentially refine powerful items, some of which may make you immortal for a short duration, which is needed for the dreadful final boss.Now for the plot...You start off as Squall, who aims to pass his SeeD exam to become an official member of the most prestigious honor in the Garden. Squall and his companions take on various assigned missions, acting as mercenaries. Eventually, they are assigned a special task by Master Cid. The one who gives this task is Rinoa, our main heroine. Together, this sparks the start of a long, treacherous fight against the ambitious Galbadian Dictatorship that plans to use the Sorceress Edea to take over the world.The story will be a hit or miss for most people. Squall is your typical lazy teenager who doesn't have any plans in his life. He has a very ""Why should I do this...?"" attitude and does not want the burden of responsibility to rest on his shoulders. Later on, you will discover Rinoa is actually a spoiled girl from a powerful family, and everyone has a negative impression of her cause of it. She will learn to become fearful of loss as well after her first confrontation with the Sorceress. As for Squall... because Squall's ""older sister"" left him at an early age, he isolated himself from the world to prevent himself from being hurt. In essence, you could say these two are the most paranoid heroes you will ever come across in the FF series. But because of this, the heroes in FF8 are also the most human you will ever meet. It makes them relate-able to the average person and requires a rather mature audience to play.By the end of the game, you will discover that majority of the characters will have something personal that they struggle through. Learning about their insecurities and pasts will, without a doubt, draw you closer to loving the characters. Several parts of Final Fantasy VIII will have your heart tugged. I played this game throughout 3 very different parts of my life. Almost 10 years later, I finally got around to beating it. I appreciated it more and more each time I played it. Become the characters. Relate to them. Be prepared. This game will change you.			"

												So, I randomly decided to buy this game for the nostalgic value. I hadn't played it for SO many years. It was one of the first games that piqued my interest in the RPG genre. I definitely didn't regret it.  Have been a fan ever since and the Final Fantasy series would still have to be my favourite, this game being number one. Totally recommend it to people who love a great story featuring so many different genres and elements. The characters, witty dialogue, as well as their development throughout the game are exceptional(Although Rinoa was slightly annoying this time round, all these years later). The slightly touched up character graphics featured in the PC version are really nice and far less pixelated. I found the battle system in this game to be rather unique and the game isn't very grindy. You can basically level as you please, most monsters/encounters level up with you. You can also turn random battles off after obtaining a specific GF (summon) and learning a certain skill .The card  mini-game known as Triple Triad would have to be one of my favourite aspects of the game also, it's a very fun and sometimes an extremely challenging mini game. Funnily enough after winning almost every card I still haven't become bored of it! Gotta win em all. >=o  The controls in the game are a little klunky, but nothing to really complain about.			"

												Unfortunately the game sounds awful. Musics seem to be played by the computer (midi lecture) which... destroys a lot of the game's atmosphere. Someone who played FF VIII once on PSX can't bare it. Actually, it's sad to say, but emulators on Playstation Network (and else) do a better job running the game than this version.+ cinematics, which truly are an important part of the game's narrative as much as an impressive historical performance in animation and gaming history, are so compressed they now look and sound ugly.12 dollars / 13 euros is an insulte from Square to their fans. I feel like I've been ripped off.I do not recommand this for anyone, neither nostalgic or curious gamer. I really hope it'll be patched soon to enjoy it in a decent way.			"

												Final Fantasy 8 is one of the more overlooked entries in the series. Talk to fans of the franchise and you will generally find that opinion is neatly divided on both gameplay elements and storyline. The easy to abuse Junctioning system and J-drama high-school esq plot will not appeal to everyone, but are worth experiencing if you are in anyway a fan of Final Fantasy or jrpgs. The music however is like having an entire casio keyboard ground up then forced roughly into your ear canal. Whilst the recent HD remake of Final Fantasy X had its score rearranged and brought up too our refined modern standards, with this game Square Enix seems to have taken the opposite approach and ‘de-made’ its soundtrack back to era before the original game was even created. The original PC release of FF8 featured the same MIDI chip tunes used here, possible to save space, however in 2014 I would expect the quality to be at least that of the console version from 15 years ago. Unfortunately I consider this to be a fatal issue. One of the key attractions of the Final Fantasy series has always been its music. It’s a core aspect of every game in the series and one which Square Enix’s marketing department defiantly recognises. So if you are going to go to the trouble of adding these extra features (the Japan only ‘Chocobo World’ mini-game is fully welcome) is it not worth polishing up one of the games major selling points whilst you are at it? It’s like putting sprinkles on a cupcake but not bothering to brush off the ants. In my mind the addition of an achievement system is not enough to outweigh ear wrenchingly poor music in any game, especially Final Fantasy. Unless you really really like achievements or have had your ears shaved off by a murderous barber, seek this game elsewhere.			"

												I believe this game is very underrated perhaps due to it's very cheesy storyline and new and odd game mechanics.But if you can somehow get past that, you will find a game that is equally as addicting and well put together as any other game in the Final Fantasy series, at least in my opinion. Also don't let my low amount of hours deceive. I played the hell out of this game on PSX back in the day.			"

												Bought the game for one reason......Triple Triad. Don't get me wrong FF8 is a great game, personally one of my all time favourites, however i probably spent most of my time just relaxing and playing TT. Also if you know what you're doing with TT you can get yourself a nice little headstart in the early game with some powerful magic and nice weapon upgrades.What drew me into FF8 was that it moved away from the typical FF roots and featured a setting very much like the real world. A focus was put on large cities with bustling populations, the introduction of driveable cars to the game and even a space station. For long time fans of the franchise this change in setting to a more modern day comes at a cost. We see fan favourites such as the moogles and chocobo's take a back seat and hardly feature whereas previous title had these character incorporated heavily into the game. The moogles are replaced by moombas whilst the chocobo steps aside for the more up to date method of transport the car and train.Personally i felt that compared to other FF titles the character development in 8 was pretty poor. Too many of the characters you encounter seem to fade into the background, either you don't come across them again or like some of your party memebers, seem to just be there for the ride. Other than the main characters don't expect to get to know your other party members too well.The true emphasis of FF8's combat is the Guardian Forces, or Summons as they are known in earlier titles. GF's are now vital to every aspect of combat/gameplay. When a GF is equipped or ""Junctioned"" GFs may be summoned. They also activate various commands such as Magic, Item, Draw, steal etc. They also allow obtained magic to be junctioned to your characters stats to give them boosts. Without a GF equipped your characters can do nothing other than a basic melee attack.The way you obtain spells is also changed for this series. Rather than buying or finding materia like you would have in FF7 you have to find Draw points throughout the world. These draw points allow you to a random quantity of a certain magic. Unlike previous titles magic acts like an item in FF8. You can hold a quantity of 99 for each spell per character meaning that unless you plan your usage out well and keep stocked up you can easily run out of a specific magic. It also makes stronger magic harder to obtain although this can be subsidised with Triple Triad if you convert cards.The thing i do like about this game is the levelling. It is possible to hit level 100 in the starting area if you have the patience, unlike previous titles you will always only need roughly 1000 exp to level up each time. The game balances this out by having the enemies scale with your level, meaning you don't have to spend hours power levelling your characters unless you enjoy doing so. Play your junctions right and you can overcome most boss fights whilst remaining a relatively low level.I could go on for ages covering every aspect of the game but it's better if you just jump in an experiment and give it a go.I would give Final Fantasy 8 a rating of 7/10 i'm basing this on:Music - 8Battle System - 7Originality - 9Plot - 7Characters - 6Replay Value - 4Visuals - 9 (for it's time)Like most FF games it's a solid title just don't expect replay value or great character development. Go in with an open mind to a different direction and setting and you will most likely enjoy this installment to the series.RIP Moogles			"

												Final Fantasy 8 is a black sheep in the franchise. It's got a really different battle system and a weird story.Final Fantasy 8 does away with MP and replaces it with the Draw ability! This ability makes it so you have to 'draw' magic from your opponents or from specific areas in the world in order to use that magic. Magic is now treated like an item, you can only use as many 'fire' spells as you have stocked. In order to use magic (or any ability that isn't 'attack') you have to junction GFs. These GFs are the equivilant of Eidolons from the other Final Fantasy games and can be summoned during a fight. It can be a real pain to grind on enemies to obtain magic, but fortunately, the Steam version includes a 'magic booster' which gives you 100 of a few spells.Now onto the story. Squall is... a strange character to say the least. If you thought Cloud Strife was dull, you're in for a surprise. Squall is silent, calculating, and has more internal dialogue then external. He has issues relying on people which becomes quite apparent throughout the game. The plot of the story is weird and confusing and has led to may theories on what actually happens during the game. The beginning is a lot more normal however. You are Squall Lionheart. You are a SeeD (pretty much a mercenary) in training and are about to perform in an exam to become fully ranked. You have a rival (kind of like pokemon) and you have a love interest later in the game. After the first disk, things that border the ridiculous start to happen, although they can be completely 100% explained.I liked this game because the farther you got into the game, the more you found yourself enjoying it. This game has, in my opinion, one of the hardest final boss encounters in Final Fantasy. The ending's pretty dope too.			"

												You would have thought after the FFVII debacle SquareEnix would make sure the latest Steam FF did NOT have the compressed, horrible MIDI music. Sadly this is not the case and once again you have to deal with ear diarrhea. Nevertheless, they did patch FFVII to have the high quality PSX music eventually so there is hope.Apart from that, the port is as good as can be expected. Game runs smoothly and looks better than my PSX version slightly. There are some fun achievements if you're into that too, more interesting than FFVII's terrible ones at least.The game itself is fun. Somewhat easy/game-breaking if you understand the Junction system but remains a game I usually beat every 1-2 years. Triple Triad is the highlight of the game, addictive, fun and a welcome distraction when the story begins to go off the rails slightly. I recommend this (£10 is nothing for the time you'll get out of it).			"

												The game is awesome!But this port sucks BIG TIME! I'VE SPENT THE LAST HOUR TRYING TO MAKE THE CONTROLS WORK!I should NOT have to use a controller emulator in order to trick this original CONSOLE GAME to read my controller as a keyboard.Oh, for those of you who are unable to reassign your keys/buttons, don't worry, the command you are reassigning is not indicated (that would be too convenient I guess). Also, why do I have to sign up to Square Enix Online to play this? Does it have some new online commponent?As I mentioned, the game is still awesome, but I recommend you either buy it digitally on a console (which is also cheaper btw) or wait for a discount.			"

												This was my favorite game when I was younger so it's hard to knock it down as a whole. However steam release feels half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ The upscaled character models make the backgrounds painful to the eyes, the world map looks like a poorly tiled floor, and not to mention the requirement of signing up to squareenix website on a game that has no network affiliation.There is original graphic mode that allows you to play the game with graphics closer to the original ps1 release but that doesn't make up for the poor controller layout, the d-pad is inactive and the stick only emulates the d-pad giving only four way movement rather than the full movement of the original analog function. Also the ""L2 R2"" buttons of the original game are inactive if you're playing with a controller here and have been replaced with Joystick buttons which makes little sense.There are other minor annoyances such as audio but I'll not get into em. All in all great game butchered due to laziness. Not recommended as a steam game, seems like more of a moneymaking scheme by square. Do not support it.			"

												I've always had a strong affinity to this game. Way back when, it appealed to me so much more than VII, due to the more realistic graphics. I have to say, I think the junctioning system is ingenious. I know it gets a lot of stick, but I really think it add a fantastic dimension to the game.Triple Triad, what can I say? It's painfully frustrating, it appears cards flip at their own will, but once you understand every rule, you'll see why the not-so-mini game is arguably more loved than the game itself.			"

												The mandatory account sign-up rubs me the wrong way. If we could use a star system here on Steam that would certainly cost this purchase a star. It doesn't take away from the game itself, though. I had no technical issues with the installation, account sign-up, or the game itself.FF8 is an underrated title in the series. I see a lot of people saying it was the beginning of quality downturn for the series, and I mostly disagree. The ""draw"" system for acquiring spells is a bit monotonous at times, but that's the only flaw that could have been thought out better. I may not like every feature of the game, but I chalk all of my other issues up to simple taste preference. You can't please everyone.Where this game fares well is storytelling, and that's really what these games are known for. Relatable characters on journeys that pull you into the game, and almost make you feel as though you have a personal stake in defeating the antagonist(s). The length of the cut scenes may seem a little excessive at times, but I enjoyed the vast majority of them.The mini-game is card-based, for those concerned with making this game last as long as possible. It isn't as repeatable long-term as Chocobos from FF7, but on the plus side you can start playing cards a lot sooner in the game, and most rare cards are attainable even if you choose to skip the task (or miss it) originally. Like I said, it's not as fun as breeding and racing Chocobo from 7, but they were never going to top that for my enjoyment anyway.Overall it was well worth the purchase. I have the original discs for PS, so I waited until I saw a nice sale on it.. but for those who are looking to play for the first time, or play again and no longer have it on Playstation, I think it's worth the full price.

												Same old awesome game. No bugs and everything seems to work fine, though the graphics I wish would look a little less blurry/fuzzy when adjusted for my monitor. The only negative thing though that really stuck out I would say it's the music. I can stand this more because I actually first played this on the PC version, but the old MIDI music is a bit annoying (though I'm sure it was not easy to program). It becomes glaringly obvious during some of the more complicated pieces of music that represent shifts in the story, and it takes me away from the game more than I would like it to. I would guess though that they will get around to updating the music soon enough, since they did the same for ff7, so I will probably not play any more of this until then, as music is very important to me in the Final Fantasy series. I mean, the Final Fantasy series is essentially a melodrama plus an RPG, and in melodrama music is half of the entertainment.			"

												This is an excellent game of the franchise, frequently under stated and disliked by the Final Fantasy fanbase it lacks some of the plot of the predecessor FFVII but makes up for it with beuatiful video scenes and music tracks.The conversion from the Playstation was well done but as with any game converted for PC after its creation there are a few flaws, none of which detract from the playability, most notably in the fluidity and layout. (Rather than completely redesign all interfaces the decision was made to alter the controls to a keyboard system simmilar to many emulators making some key combinations a bit challenging.) On the up side its entirely possible to hook a USB PS2 controller into your PC and use that instead of your keyboard and return to the original feel of the game.Overall I would say its a great game, a great buy, and a great choice.

												One of the more under rated final fantasy games. Why is this you ask ? Mainly due to its draw and junction system. Magic exsists in the title only by drawing from enemies useing the gf abilities such as life magic refine and or draw points scattered everywhere in the world. why dont people like this sytem? let me explainMost people think you have to draw 100 of each magic to become extreamly powerful when that is not the case. you can infact refine powerful magic  from items early on in the game if you learn the right abilities. The junction system works like the equipment system. Basically you can junction magic to your base stat. Heres an exzample Junction curaga >hp = 8000 base hp 1500  From that you should get the general idea  you can be at an extreamly low level (which is reccomended) and still beat the game. Monsters level up with you so lets say your strongest character is level 17 monsters will also be at level 17 including bosses. Some saymonsters level up with squall thats not the case. There are items that increase your base stat with out leveling a lot of people that i know that play this game grind out those item so they have max hp as well as a 255 (max) base strength stat ect. I would not go that far its easier just to junction. you do not gain gil in this game through battles instead you are given gil based on how many steps you take on a regular occurance. How much you get will be determained by your seed rank highest rank= a. I am not sure howmany steps it is but i am pretty sure it is based on that.Triple triad ....

			Shuffle or boogie is a track from Final fantasy 8. Don't forget to like and subscribe!:)		

got that song in your head yet  ?  No  ?  Well you will. Playing cards in this game is almost a must. Each card in the game refines in to an item with the card mod ability. Some items you get can refine in to really good magic. Others refine into items you may need. If you played ff9 efore you played this then you should know how the card game works its fairly simalier and easy to learn. The only thing that sucks are the same and sameplus , random rules .  PRO TIP : Save your game before playing any card games. You do not want to loose your stronger cards such as gf and or character cards. you can win them back but its faster if you save and reset. This is where 50% of my time was put  :P  that and i am doing a playthrough on youtube Shameless self promoting begings now ! Heres my latest video (as of this post) I try and update daily.

												Pure nostalgia, it takes you to the time when Final Fantasy was the king of the JRPG genre, and even if it is hated by many because of the combat system or the ""cheesy story"", it is still one of the best in the saga.It has improved 3D models compared to the ps1 version and some new things added, but it has a problem. It uses the old PC version music files, which are much worse than the Playstation 1 files. It can be easily fixed by modding it though, so it's not a big problem.For me, it is one of my favorite games of all time, and I'm happy to finally have it on Steam. If you've never played Final Fantasy, you might prefer other games of the saga or other JRPGs, but if you already played it and want to live those special moments again, get it now.			"

												Another classic JRPG. The story and characters are great. The gameplay is arguably one of the best in the series (for me anyway). The combat is fun, interesting and surprisingly deep. Music is amazing! (Of course)This port isn't the best but it's playable.			"

												What can I say, Final Fantasy VIII is my favorite Final Fantasy and one of my all time favorite games. The story line is fantasic and this game will give you many feels and laughs. Though I am a bit disappointed with this PC version because the audio sounds different..especially the music which is a complete and utter shame because the soundtrack to this game is beautifully phenomenal, Nobuo Uematsu is truly a musical genius. Would I recommend this game? You bet. Anyone who hasn't played this game is really missing out and needs to play it as soon as possible. Although it doesn't feel the same playing it on a PC instead of a PS1, its still enjoyable. Also, at some point listen to the entire soundtrack to this game so you can fully enjoy the real music instead of the weird ""recreated"" versions.			"

												Final Fantasy VIII was the first game i bought in my life and i still feel a little bit of nostalgia playing it. Pros	  Triple Triad - Still love to play it to this day. One of the best minigames of all time.  Music Score - As any FF game the Music score is great.  Graphics - Were Great back in the day, FMV still look breathtaking to this day.  Story - Good. Could have been better but I still felt engrossed by it.  Cons	  Lazy Port - Sound is Midi ported from the Pc version of this game. Playstasion sound was way better. No button configuration. Original button configuration is terrible.   GF Animations - Although they look great the first 15/20 times you see it, after a while it gets really boring to not be able to skip this animations. It makes battles tedious.  Main protagonist - Squall simply isn't likeable. For half of the game he actually passes for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ most of the time. Limbo The Junction System - Great customization, you can junction elemental magic to your attack or defence (fire,ice, lightning etc), status magic (poison, blind, etc) and also junction magic to your stats. The problem is the grind you have to go through to get magic since it is drawed from monsters. Mostly you find yourself spending hours drawing magic than actually fighting most of the monsters and bosses.Good game, but you should only buy it on sale. Too expensive for a game that is 17 years old and has been poorly ported. Mods help.			"

General info~Genre: Japanese roleplaying game (JRPG), belongs to Final Fantasy series~Number of players: 1~Completion time: 45-100 hours~Partially enhanced (HD) version of already existing titleStrong points+Story: A tale about the coming of age, the fear of loss, the acceptance of responsibilities, the need of expression, the importance of friendship and the warmth of love. Younger gamers might find the aforementioned topics quite boring, as I did back in the day, but as I grew up I understood why the developers chose to enrich their product with such thematology.+Content: A game suitable for both young and mature audiences.+Music: Don't take my word for it; just listen to the complete soundtrack (uploaded on youtube by TantrisOST)


YouTube™ Video: Final Fantasy VIII - Complete Soundtrack 

			Views: 1,624,510		

			Music from the video game Final Fantasy 8 from 1999, by Square Music by Nobuo Uematsu ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Musique du jeu...		

+Tradition: Many well known figures and themes of the Final Fantasy universe make their appearance in Final Fantasy VIII: Prepare to fight Malboros and Tonberries, summon Shiva and Ifrit, cast Reflect and Ultima and ride chocobos. Also, many artists already involved in previous installments are back: Yusuke Naora, Kazushige Nojima, and composer Nobuo Uematsu.+Team spirit: Create teams of three characters (from a total of six) and face challenging foes in a turn based battle-system. Experienced Final Fantasy players will tread on familiar ground while newcomers will adapt gradually thanks to the game's instructional early stages.+Not another grinding fest: Final Fantasy VIII introduced the juctioning system with which you may team up with various summoning entities and enhance your stats, abilities and defences. Thus, instead of killing enemies for hours and hours in order to level up, you are able to apply various combinations of spells to enhance your characters. You can actually finish the game with your initial level (steam achievement) thanks to this innovative progress system.+Road to the riches: You don't have to worry about buying your expensive equipment in FFVIII. Most items will be dropped from slained monsters or they can be crafted by collecting various ingredients with the help of your summoned creatures. +Along came Behemoth: Enemies level up as you do. It's your choice where and when to increase your level of experience as well as how to fortify your team in order to overcome enemies who change attack pattern as your levels go up.+Characters, NPCs, companions with interesting background and distinctive personalities. Most of them answer to the principles of japanese manga and anime culture; if you have played any other Final Fantasy game you know what to expect; and that's not necessarily a bad thing.+Environment: Both urban and rural. You can visit cities, ports, schools as well as beaches, deserts and the infamous chocobo forests; by renting a car, riding a chocobo or exploring on foot!+Chicobo: The famous pocketstation game Chocobo World which accompanied the original title is back! Train your little chocobo to the highest level, slain enemies and transfer all acquired loot to your main saved game in order to aid your team with powerful items.+Rich background: Despite starting the game ""in medias res"", the complex background of the game will be revealead to players piece by piece as they progress. Visit the in-game Information section often to learn new things about the world you are exploring.+Controls: Customizable in-game settings, controller support.+For seasoned adventurers and newcomers: You can level your characters up to the maximum or stay at  a low level and depend on your juctions and individual skills only.Weaknesses-Problematic PC port: This port suffers from a few issues which can be fixed with various mods or community unofficial patches. The two major problems can be found on the sound and graphics department:  Despite the fact that characters, spells, summons and vehicles are graphically enhanced , the background remains in low resolution. Click  here for an example. As for the sound, the main issue is its bad quality. You can fix this problem by downloading a mod called Roses and Wine. Consult the Steam guide section  for links. SquareEnix could have spent more time improving their product.-Juctioning: Ironically, one of Final Fantasy VIII's best features is at the same time one of its flaws. Juctioning can make your team almost invincible and it's quite simple to comprehend as long as you have spent time on the tutorial understanding how the system works. Unfortunately, while the game extricates the players from many hours of useless killing, they must still draw spells from various enemies at large quantities for maximum junctioning effect. This can be time consuming as well.-Spam this sword: Although the juctioning system gives a lot of choises as to how you wish to develop your team, in the end you might end up saving your acquired spells and magic for stat enhancement only and just spam the attack command to dispatch your enemies. This issue might frustrate or disappoint some players who prefer to play with mixed teams (fighters and mages) or the older fans of the series who prefer variety and strategies during boss fights.-Smithing: Final Fantasy VIII features limited character costumization. Your characters' appearance cannot be changed since you do not have access to armor or other protective equipment. The only item you can actually costumize is each character's weapon. Ironically, weapon enhancement is not advisable until the latest stages of the game due to the the fact that enhanced weapons feature negligible upgrades compared to the initial weapons equipped on each character. Long story short, upgrade your weapon to their ultimate forms only.Neutral ground±Price: Preferably buy it during a sale.±Permanently missable content: Meticulous players who enjoy searching every nook and cranny of the world, won't have serious problems finding most items in the game. But for the rest of you, it might be a good idea to consult a detailed guide if you want a perfect run with all the achievements unlocked on one playthrough.My rating4/5Final Fantasy VIII was cursed to grow under the shadow of its predecessor. Up to this day, many gamers form an opinion about this game without having played it themselves. It might not be as flashy or fancy as VII or IX but thanks to its thematology, soundtrack and juction system it deserves a spot among the greatest games of its genre. Concerning the issues I mentioned on the “Weaknesses” section, try consulting Steam guides on how to surpass the low quality sound or graphic issues you may have. "

I shouldn't have to google to work out how these things are done.♥♥♥♥ing hell I know these are cheap rushed ports but at leastspend one minute thinking about the fact that humans are playing your game and so think about how you can make your product enjoyable to use.

												I may only have 11 hours on this game, but I've played this game on the PS1 a number of times. It's an absolutely gorgeous game that has withstood the test of time. This game is a solid gem, and it's beautifully ported for Steam. Nostalgia ensues! Pros- Cheats such as infinite magic and max health (Warning- PERMANENT once you apply it to a save data)Save ANYWHERE when you're roaming outside in the open world. Those pesky save points hindering your ability to take a break? Not a problem. Save ANYWHERE when you're roaming the open fields.Retextured graphics, but you can choose the original PS1 settings if desired.Chocobo World is INCLUDED..for FREE.Cons- The music is composed of MIDI Tracks. I recommend downloading the Roses and Wine music mod to truly enjoy the game.Some of GF summoning sounds are reworked, so it takes some time to get used to.Cheats as mentioned above, cannot be reverted once you apply it to a save data. USE WITH CAUTION.All in all, it's an amazing game. I recommend it wholeheartedly, for old fans and newcomers alike, especially if you can get this when it's on sale!Happy Gaming.			"

												This game has a love/hate relationship with some fans but It's always held a place in my heart being the first major FF game I got into after seven when I was younger and I grew to like the world, characters and story. I would say the  junction system can be a bit of a mess and kill the game for a few people but once you get the hang of things it's not too bad and it does add a bit of a challenge to the system.

												  FF8 is a good game. For those new to FF this would be an odd start. Each FF has a little gimmick within their gameplay. FF8 introduces a ""junction"" system which can be confusing at first. In actuality it's pretty lame, but a cool concept. In previous FFs magic would drain MP, but in FF8 magic is drawn(upto100) from various points in game, and from monsters. All while requiring a GF(gaurdian force) to be ""junctioned"" to that character. In order to actually buff your characters, junctioning magic is required. Unlike in other FFs leveling hardly boosts stats. It is required to draw a lot of one spell just to buff a character efficiently. What makes plain leveling useless is the fact that enemies are level'd according to the party's average level. People have beaten the game low level'd with proper junctions alone.   Also... you can find yourself mashing GF summons early on... which means watching a cutscene, damaging enemy, and continuing fight. Not only is combat a bit dull compared to other installments, there doesn't seem to be much enemy variety. The final area's random encounters are monsters that you fight throughout the game. Although the little summon cutscenes are pretty great for 1999.   Other than the combat the game plays like a novel. A very nice story, and smooth character developement. Even with a story that is all over the place, literally, it is shown beautifully. Oh, there is also extra things like ""Triple Triad"". It's a card game played with cards collected while progressing. There's a whole bunch of other things involving the cards, but no need to mention it. Just more things to do rather than blowing through the story. Never bothered playing any card matches(or using cards) in my playthrough.   Like I said in the first sentence... FF8 IS a good game. IMO not the best FF, but definitely better than some of the  recent releases. ON THE SUBJECT OF THIS PARTICULAR PORT: It has some issues.   The sound isn't on point  Takes a bit too much space. Apparently not compressed well.  Square Enix has an annoying requirement of making an account for their servers. Bad enough it's on the steam DRM. Feels even more distant.... BUUT it doesn't intrude much and y'all can still play offline, I believe.  "

												It's probably the most convenient way to play the game these days, and that counts for something. And it really is worth playing; it's the black sheep of the Playstation FF games, but that makes it interesting. It's broken, has an even more ridiculous plot than usual, dungeons are very often literally copy-pasted together, and the ever-present card game brings the pace to a crawl. But, it also has a great cast, interesting changes to the typical FF ruleset, the card game is fun, and the settings are varied and beautiful while creating a more consistent universe than its immediate predecessor.THAT SAID...If you have a Playstation/PS2 hooked up to a CRT TV/XRGB-type scaler, or an emulator with a good CRT TV simulation mode, you will have a vastly better experience. The game is designed around the limitations of the Playstation, and the PC version makes no attempt to hide the ""strings"", such as they are.  The backgrounds are 320x240 scaled up with nearest neighbour scaling, while the characters are rendered for native resolution and filtered, and it creates a distracting mismatch - only exascerbated by ""crowd scenes"" where the crowds are baked into the backgrounds, designed to match up with low resolution Playstation models but completely out of place with the smooth, detailed characters.It's actually kind of fascinating to get a the behind-the-curtain perspective on the game like this, it gives you an appreciation for the craft and cleverness of the developers - but it takes you out of the game, looks like crap, and that sucks.  Games designed for low resolutions should be played in low resolutions.Also, by default, the music uses awful general MIDI versions of the soundtrack.  There are mods to fix this, but it's kind of unacceptable to put out a rerelease of a game praised for it's music with a general MIDI soundtrack in the year 2014.  My god, you don't have to fit it on 4 CDs anymore, you can distribute it with a recorded soundtrack!I recommend it because it's good, but the presentation is awful.  Step up your game, Squeenix.			"

And saving the World.Every character have his own nature and destiny.I don't know, why I love this game. Maybe it's a story, or gameplay, or characters. But, mayby, all together. As I said, It's a beautifull story. Awesome music and characters and CGI cutscenes. Incredible dramatic scenes, like Squall and Rinoa in Space (Song: Eye on Me), which make me sad . If you love good story, you must play FFVIII (VII). Don't look on graphics. It's really hard to me,describe my feeling on foreign language, sorry. "

												The second Final Fantasy game to grace the Playstation console, Final Fantasy VIII had some big shoes to fill after the success of it's predecessor. Though considered by some to be a flop, I see FF VIII as one of the greatest stories in the series. With very well developed characters and hours of cut scenes, FF VIII delivers an epic and emotional ride. While the magic and combat system is a little quirky and easy to exploit, over all the game delivers on most fronts. At no point in the game does the story feel contrived or boring, keeping you on the edge of your seat the whole way. I highly reccommend this game if you are a fan of the series or just looking for a fun game to keep your interest.			"

												If you enjoyed playing Final Fantasy VIII on the PSX you should definitely consider getting this version.  It's nice to earn achievements along the way, plus the Steam version allows you to play Chocobo World, a mini-game not previously available in the US.  This version of the game does have a few downsides, however.  As many mention, the default music is subpar compared to the PSX version, so you would have to find a mod with the proper music files and install them.  Also, while the character models are cleaner looking than the PSX version, the backgrounds all seem to be a little lower quality.  They seem a bit more pixelated than I remember, which just stands out that much more against the various characters.  I've also noticed a few NPCs pixelating very badly at times.  First it was a nameless girl in the classroom at the beginning of the game, and shortly after Headmaster Cid turned into an unrecognizable blob of colored squares.  It doesn't seem to happen often, and I haven't noticed it happening to the various party characters.This version has some flaws, but if you enjoyed playing the game in the past this is still worth snagging here on Steam, especially if you can catch it on a good sale.

												This is my favorite Final Fantasy.  It's not the best in the series but it's my favorite.  I like the junction system, even if it's breakable, because it let's you customize the characters on a deep but simple to use system.  I love the story even if Squall is an emo teenage idiot.  If you like Final Fantasy, you probably already have an opinion on this one.  If you haven't played Final Fantasy, I don't know how you  got here, but play them all.			"

												This was the 2nd Final Fantasy game to originate on the original playstation. The first being Final Fantasy VII.In this game you'll follow the journey of Squall from his start in Balamb Garden to wherever he and his friends end up as the story progresses. Many of the common Final Fantasy creatures return which are also known as Espers, Summons, or however each game in the series differentiates between them such as Ifrit or Shiva.One of the shining qualities of this game is of course in my opinion the music which is done by Nobuo Uematsu.For those new to the game: I'd suggest playing this for the story and the music. Also even though it's been out of style lately, the turned based combat system I still enjoy.			"

												Final Fantasy to me has always been one of my favorite video game series. Now most people are obsessed with Final Fantasy 7 though I love that game as well I had to buy this game on steam first having played both in the past. This game features a great story, Wonderful music, and though the graphics arent up to say modern games at the time this game amazed me with its fantastic graphics when it first came out for its time. I must say the music is different from the ps1 version you can change this but having already owned the ps1 version on my ps3 i see no need. Even if it's slightly different Eyes on me is still there and its kind of interesting listening to the pc version of the soundtrack. They are both in my opinion equally as good soundtrack wise. I give this game a 10/10 for its story. It's also got some pretty awesome characters.SLIGHT SPOILER ALERT!:There is also a scene where you end up in space!			"

												Final Fantasy VIII was one of the first Final Fantasy games I ever played (along with VII), and even after all the years that have passed since I first picked up this game and have played more and more Final Fantasy games in the series, I always find myself coming back and playing this game. This game was something special for me, maybe it was because it was one of the first RPG's that I ever played or some other reason, but this game has not lost its luster to me. I absolutely love this game and I very much recommend to anyone who is wanting to start playing a game in the Final Fantasy series. A lot of the things that I love about this game is the story (the only few complaints that I may have is for people new to this game, the story may be a little hard to follow at certain points, and people like to complain about how much of an emo that the main character happens to be which kind of turns some people off to this game), the cast of characters range from emotionless to flameboyant, the magic system is a good change of pace from the typical MP system that had been a part of the games before for a very long time, and overall is a nice change of pace from a lot of the other games in the series as this game tries to blend fantasy with realism (the cities for instance show many signs of fantasy and realism in them), plus the soundtrack is beautifully composed. However the one major complaint I have about this port is the butchering of said soundtrack (which I recommend to anyone to go and get the Roses and Wine mod which replaces the butchered soundtrack with the original). Overall, this game is something special and I think for anyone who is either new to the series, or someone who's played Final Fantasy games before but has never picked this game up, I highly recommend playing it, it's a game that can be played over and over again, either trying to play seriously, or waste away playing Triple Triad.

												I remember playing this game in the early 2000s I think I played it the most out of all the Final Fantasies. I was searching YouTube one day and I came across some game theories so to get a better understanding of it I decided to get it on a whim. The game is as great and enjoyable as I remember it even though I played it all the time I always feel like it is a brand new experience. I grew up with it and have always loved it and my appreciation for it only grows as I get older anyway enough gushing you clicked this for a review so here we go.Graphics: The game does look good it always looked good however sad to say upscale pre-rendered graphics do not hold up well the art though really well done does show its age as they can be blurred and through the sharpened quality you can see errors in the textures a lot easier. Character models however are very well done the pre rendered cut scenes are well made and are well shot and the in game sprits are smoothed out almost flawlessly (blocky Rhinoa legs anyone). Despite these gripes it in no way takes away from the full game. This is my first review so please give me your feed back so i can give you all better ones in the future.Music: It's final fantasy nuff said the music is excellent and fits the game perfectly. There are scores that strike my nostalgia cords as well as my feels and never fail to get me invested.Characters: Again it is final fantasy the characters are genuinely likable and compliment the story well except you Irvine stay away from Selphie you fiend she's mine!Story: It is a well done story however around the second story arc it gets confusing but again what final fantasy doesn’t the story takes you on a journey that will have you locked in place until the very end though some of the story aspects seem clichéd by today’s standards they are however clichéd because they work.Challenge: The enemies in this game scale up with you so as you grow stronger they will become more dangerous this is a welcome change or a really hated change from previous Final Fantasies depending on who you are. It takes a very good understanding of the Junction system to keep up with the difficulty curve you will undoubtedly find yourself getting smacked around with if you do not prepare well. SAVE OFTEN I can't stress this enough because sometimes this game can be downright frustrating and brutal at times but the payout is rarely not worth it.Overall: This game was an excellent piece of work in 1999 and the port is an excellent piece of work almost 17 years later it holds up well and is very enjoyable to play with it has a romantic story and plentiful side quests as well as super bosses and hiddend summons that come with their own abilities that you can learn you will not regret playing this I give this game a solid 8/10 despite the clichés the brilliant twists, the musical score, the likable cast and a solid world to explore at your leisure make up for it. The game has flaws just like any other but it is well worth its asking price.			"

												Final Fantasy VIII is one of my favourite RPGs and my favourite game in the Final Fantasy series.The game is alot different from other RPGs due to the fact that magic must be taken from the enemies you battle and instead of mp you have a stock of all the magic you've takenMagic spells are also the best way to increase your characters stats as enemies get stronger when you level up, and will end up stronger then you if you don't junction magic to your stats, as doing this will increase them (and can also make you extremely powerful.) It is this unique system that makes it one of my favourite RPGs.The story is pretty good and will make you want to keep playing, around the middle the story feels to me like it was struggleing but it picked up again towards the end.If you want a decent RPG to spend some time on, or are just looking for a unique RPG then you should give this game a shot!Also Triple Triad.

												I first played this game when I was around 11 years old. I hated it to be honest, the game was too confusing for me at the time and the system was weird, nothing like the almighty Final Fantasy 7 that I loved. Naturally, some years later I wanted to make a better judgement of it, and I did, and I absolutely loved it. Now that the game is on Steam, I can make a review with my memory completely freshened up after beating the game for the 3rd time, after many unfinished playthroughs.Everything from this game seems to be way above and beyond of what gaming was at the time. The game is modern, it feels modern and even the system is unlike any other title. The way you build your characters is very unique in the sense that you can costumize every single detail and no character is like any other, the choices are also limited so you can't have a character doing absolutely everything while the others do nothing, which makes the concept of a party much more likely to happen. Aeons or Summons have always been a big part in Final Fantasy games, but never like in FF8, not even in FF10 are Aeons as important as Guardian Forces in FF8, this makes the amazing GF cinematics in FF8 much more wanted, which for me was an issue in other games, they looked awesome, but physical attacks just cut it better in FF7, for example.The characters all have a big role in the story (which will be the last part I'll talk about), and they're all well crafted, none of them are spot-fillers, they're there, they're unique in their personalities and traits and they're just not annoying. In other titles I've always felt there was this one character I didn't like, but I think it's the fact that in FF8, there's only 6 characters that makes it so much easier to like them all.The side-quests are bad and few. And this is all I should say about this, but it won't be. The only ''side-quest'' you should be partaking in is the Card Quest, but unfortunately even to obtain all the cards you have to complete most of the other boring, dull, hard to find and hard to complete without guidance side-quests, this is the biggest flaw in the game in my opinion, the game barely gives any hints on how to find or complete most side-quests and you're forced to search the internet for most, such as the PuPu quest (after the 3rd occult fan, no more hints are given), or obtaining the Tonberry King GF (There's one mention of it in Trabia Garden, but one would only get so far to getting the GF by sheer persistence and guessing.And before we move on to talk about my favourite part of the game, let's talk about how I love the draw system. Many people hate this system, some think it's unfair, some think it's boring, I personally think it can be whatever you want it to be. I have a system when I play that I get the magical and the defensive character do the drawing and have the offensive character do the killing. It works because it raises the stats equally and it's not boring at all, so I reach the middle of the game with all my characters balanced and even the ones outside the party get to have spare magic. And it's also super fun finding out magic from monsters.Now, the story. The perfect, yet flawed story that makes me think this is the best game I've ever played (I've never have a game that I wanted to replay right after finishing it). The story is incoherent? Maybe. Maybe the story is confusing and has a lot of twists and weird happenings throughout the game. But it's all resolved in the end... Or is it? There are 2 theories to the story of this game that I love to discuss about, and they both make a lot of sense, but they're just theories, because the story allows for them to exist, the story isn't vague but it has this open space for creativity that's just right. I won't go into many details because of spoilers, but when certain things in the game come together and you start figuring out certain things, it just makes you go ""wow..."", and everything unfolds and makes sense in front of you, it's brilliant.Also, Selphie is adorable.

												Final Fantasy VIII is a bit ridculous.No, really - this game had a huge impact on me when I was 12 years old, so when I saw it up for grabs on Steam I acted fast. And you know what? Holy cow is this just goofy as hell. Of course, we should all be willing to admit that cliches are what FF is all about, and that's not a bad thing. It's just that VIII attempts to be a deconstruction and the story is frequently tripping and falling on its own ""and now a twist!"" approach that gets a tad bit tired by the ""disc 2"" segment. That being said, I do enjoy the  settings as they're consistently well-rendered and imaginitive. I'd expect nothing less of the team from this era.The characters? Pretty damn bland. There's a certain backstory that ties in importantly, but it doesn't really explain why (with the exception of a couple) these characters are all so ridiculous. Only Squall, the mainest of main characters, has a degree of depth and even then it falls into borderline-woe-is-me nonsense. The models are certainly worth snickering at (to be fair, that's the age showing).As for the gameplay itself - it's pretty fun! It's also pretty easy to manipulate if you know what approach to take with the juncitoning system. Putting the right spell on the right stat makes things so quickly breakable that it blew my mind how much trouble I had as a kid. Still, it's fun trying in mix and match what element you're going to smack what enemy with. And that Eden summon never gets old. Stuff like this is why I've avoided strategy guides ever since I turned 14. It's going to be fun if you don't know exactly what item does what function.In summation, this is certainly a game that can be fun to play if you've never played it before... Just know your tastes.

												I got to say: this was a waste of money (Thank goodness I got a refund for it.)I did like FFVIII a bit, but I didn't get all that far when I was young, and didn't get a good opinion on it. On a sale, I got this computer port, but man what a mistake.For one: The Music. Square Enix said that this port has the same music as the PSX version. I would say that they don't know what is the same/difference in the Final Fantasy VIII songs, because it's NOT the same music. The boss battle music is amazing imo, but it lost it's charm in this version.Original:

			Views: 45,095		

			Excellent Boss theme in PC version of FF8		

For two: Messy textures. I mean, the characters look good, but the world/areas look worse than the PSX version. The areas are super pixelated, but that's understandable since it's a PSX port, but the world map is a mess, and comparing with the PSX version, you clearly see that they just blurred the world map textures to not give that pixelated feel, which results in a huge fail of nice textures.For three: Controls. I mean, yah this is a PSX port and those controllers had only the directional pad, but it had full joystick support, meaning that you can move in any direction freely. This though, if you use a gamepad, you can only move in the 8 directions, D-pad or Joystick. This game is hard to get around without the freedom of moving in any direction. Even when using a controller, it's Button 2, Button 5, etc, not giving Xbox 360/PS3 controls. That just shows how rushed and lazy this port is.Don't buy this port. I am really disappointed with this.			"

												Final Fantasy VIIIRPG-Developed by SquareSoft / Square EnixYear 1999/2000 The Story  8/10You are Squall Leonhart an orphan and SeeD of Balamb Garden. SeeD is a mercenary group trained to fight the sorceress. You awake in the hospital wing after your training session with your fellow student Seifer. As your progress you go on your final exam to become a SeeD and be deployed around the whole world. Your first mission helping out a resistance faction. Sets you on a course that will change the entire world.Grahpics 7/10The graphic are better than Final Fantasy 7 fewer blocky textures. More movies they transition seemlessly between gameplay. The way monsters die is cool. Some will turn of stone or explode. Most just fall over and die I like that more than them turning red and dissappering like in Final Fantasy 7.  There are graphics mods that will improve the game if you can install them.Music 0/10  after JunkyBiggs music mod 10/10The music on this release of the game is poor... not of worry though it's a simple fix after you install the game just replace the muisc files with the converted ones thanks to JunkyBiggs. It takes less then 1 mintue to do this. Just look in the Guides section you will find his and many of music mods there.The music in the game is amazing all the songs ""Eyes on Me"" The Man with the Machine Gun"" those are my favorites. The opening theme ""Liberi Fatali""  The battle theme ""Don’t Be Afraid"" and the nice ""Waltz For The Moon"" all amazing. The songs all fit and game and fit what you are doing at the time.Gameplay 10/10The gameplay I love as it makes you have to think about what you are doing. In Final Fantasy 8 the monsters all level along with your party, Their level is ramdonly decided as a few levels higher or lower than your average current partys level. If you had say Squall at level 100 and Zell at lvl 8 than monsters you run into would be from lv60-80. Summons or Guardian Forces / GF The GF play a major rule as they allow you to junction. The Junction system allows you to junction magic to your stats to makes yourself more powerful. Monsters do not level with your GF. It's really the base of the game it's easy to figure out and the in game tutorials explain it very well. The animations for the GF can become repetitive over time. Otherwise I really like this system myself it's fun and allows you to play the whole game without leveling at all.Money / GilYou are paid in this game based on your SeeD rank. Your SeeD rank is really based off of how many monsters you kill. There are a few other times in the story where doing your job right will up your rank but, not many. What I didn't like about this is that your rank falls after a short time. There are tests you can take to up your rank they as well. Making money becomes very, very easy once you get GF tonberry. So don't worry about money after you get him and train him you will never run out of funds.Chocobo WorldMake sure you start using this as soon as you get boko from your first forest. Boko will make getting items very easy. Do not start chocobo world while Boko is set to Home. You will gltich the game and have to start over with a new boko. Just remeber to close chocobo world bring him home get his items and send him back before opening it agian. I'll save you some time the best ID is in fact ""211"" use the do over button till you get ID 211 it'll make the game much easier as boko will be a total pwnage machine.The Card Game Triple TriadI found triple Triad to be fun not challanging though. You are providing with cards of insane power by the time you get the GF brothers. Don't mix rules as they are very hard to get back to normal. The game is played on a 3x3 size board. You and your npc opponent start by selecting 5 cards and using the number rating and rules to flip and cards placed down. It's very simple and enjoying as long as you don't mess up and rule system. I'll say this again do not ever mix rules!Chocobo ForestsI didn't like how they used chocobos in this final fantasy. After 7 had such fun with them all you can do in this one is ride them around the map. I would have liked to have had another race track or something along those lines sadly chocobos fall short in this game. I give the Chocobo Quest in this game a 3/10 it was boring. I give this game a 8/10 I recommend you play it if you love RPGs			"

												While it may not be the best in the Final Fantasy series, FF8 holds a big place in my heart. This is the first time I've played the game, so I'm not speaking with feelings of nostalgia here.Gameplay: Initially, I was turned off. The Junction system wasn't something I was used to. MP doesn't exist here with magic being a consumeable item. It's just something you draw from enemies or synthesize. I rarely casted magic against monsters and used it as a stat upgrade, which left a bad taste in my mouth. Eventually though, I learned to like the system. Once you get the hang of it, it's like a fact of life that you don't put much thought on. It's also easy to power up your party, making this one of the easier FF games.Sidequests: Not a lot. Plus most of the sidequests are not difficult to accomplish. They are just time-consuming. To note a few challenges, there's a Steam achievement called ""Contrived Victory""; you may have to play through the game a second time. Card collecting is also a big hassle.Story: I really enjoyed the story even if it was presented in a confusing manner. For a game that had schools training teen soldiers, warring factions, and a time compression scheme by a corrupt sorceress, I didn't feel the gravity of the world's situation until the middle of Disc 3. That's just something funny to observe. You could tell that the game's theme was about friendship and love being the most precious thing that surpasses past, present, and future. Cheesy but endearing. (Squall and the gang are #squadgoals; Laguna and the gang are #squadgoals)Music: Memorable. There are strong pieces in the game that you will download and listen to on repeat. They go very well with the various places scattered in the world. My favorite scene was when ""Compression of Time"" started playing. To me, that will always be an iconic moment in the game.(Just make sure to replace the bad steam port music with the orginal PS1 version!!! It makes the gaming experience significantly better!)All in all it is highly-reccommended you play FF8. The whole game plays like a sentimental memory because time is what brings this whole game together. There's a lot to be had in FF8 that will give you a great experience despite its' imperfections.

												Final Fantasy VIII: HD, Triple-Tiad and MusicWell, I finally bought Final Fantasy VIII for my PC and I'm glad I did, but there's one problem. After playing 7 and 8 for the first time on the PS3, I was so impressed by how these old games made me fall in love with its worlds and characters, it proved to me that AAA graphics, Sound design and even voice acting doesnt make a great game. By todays standards, these game are dated. When i first played FF VII last year I laughed at the terrible graphic, cheesey music and blocky characters. after destroying the first Mako reactor, I was hooked: The pre-rendered backgrounds looked beautiful, The music was emotional, and combat was rewarding and fun, the blocky characters still look bad. In short terms, I no longer look at these games based on their graphic's or age. FF VII is one great game, even by todays standards. theres a reason why everyone calls it the best. which brings me to FF VIII. Just like VII it was an excellent game. Not as mind blowing as VII, but still great. Playing the mini card game Triple-Triad was a blast. Can you believe it? I was playing a game......within a game (that was actually fun). Yes these games where so good, I decided to throw my money into Gabe's face and buy them both on Steam. FF VII = perfect PC port. HD graphic's, same music from PSX and achievements. The same could be said about FF VIII, everything is great, but the MUSIC!. Seriously, what the hell am i listening to? everything is a note too high or too low, it sound awful compared to PSX music. Its a real shame, because if you've already played the thing on PlayStation, then the music will stick out like a sore thumb. Apart from the sound issue, this is a great game to play. I just hope SquareEnix release Final Fantasy 9 on steam to make yet another game that much better. Just dont touch the sound. Kupo.			"

												While it's no Final Fantasy VII (Yeah, I'm one of those guys...) I have to say that 8 ranks number 1 for story line.  True, many dislike the way magic was handled in this title, but if you can swallow the drawing and stick for the story, it's well worth it.If you're a Final Fantasy fan, you don't need a review to decide.  If you're just entering the franchise, I reccomend Final Fantasy 7 (Also on Steam).  Try that one first, if you like the mojo of that game you'll enjoy this one too.			"

												The game is one of the under-appreciated game of the series. This game suffers being in the shadow of FFVII which in the time was a masterpiece. This game excels itself and I actually prefer this game to FFVII. One thing that FFVIII excelled over FFVII is the lead character.IMHO Squall is a much better protagonist than Cloud and he's one of the best of the series. You know what he's always thinking, and he's actually human compared to the other lead characters in the series. Throughout the game you can see his conflict in life caused by his troubled childhood. He wants to be alone because he's lost so much, he's not tough, deep inside he's weak and he cant accept losing anyone important to him, which is why he prefers to be alone, so he never has to lose anyone. The plot has many holes, but the overall story and the characters more than make up for it. The battle system is nothing like the other FFs. Drawing system to stock magic is a nuisance, and frankly it deters me from using magic completely, only for the sake of junctioning. The junctioning system has always divided opinion, but it is easily mastered if you put some effort into it and I really enjoy experimenting with each character's stat.Overall, this is a great game but the port is quite poor. The music for some reason is ported poorly and that is the main highlight of this game so if you do pick this game up,do something about it.			"

												I read a lot of reviews for this port and was really disapointed with the amount of people not giving it it's fair chance.It's a ps1 port. Do not expect amazing graphics and over the top hd effects. The graphics are fair and te cutscenes are very well done. The music and score are legendary, brought to you by Nobuo same guy who made 7 and 10. The gameplay is fun and the new junction system was really creative But what makes this game for me is the story. The fantasy and in this particular game it is enchanting. It transports you into that magical yet futuristic world where you follow the story of a young men just trying to find his place in that world.10/10 would recommend			"

  A great buy    Category Score   Gameplay 8/10   Music 8/10   Graphics 8/10   Controls 5/10   Replayability 10/10  Overall Score 7.8/10    Perks	  This game is a great port. Escellent in fact, but nothing is without flaws. Thank fully this game doesn't have too many of them. First lets look at some purchase perks. The game comes with baked in cheats, mods, acheivements, and chocobo world. To thouse who've played the original Chocobo World on it's own should be enough to want to purchase this remake as previously the only way to play it, and take advantage of the unique to the game items, were through cheats/hacks, or having a playstation pocket, and a playstation that could read it, so for this content alone you might be getting your money's worth. Next square enix has included acheivements. I don't have to tell you how achievements (or trophies if you think with a playstation mindset) didn't became mainstream until around 2005, so they are new and it gives you something to do along the way while playing, although there is plenty to do without them. The mods, are great. most importantly, the speed mod is great. If you've ever been pressed for time and not a lot of time for sitting through un-skippable cutscenes, or watching about 3-4 mins of traversing a map it definately comes in handy. Lastly the cheats. The game comes with some cheats built in such as the 100 spell cheat where you can draw a spell, and either press the cheat button, or save the game and run the cheat and you will have 100 of that spell. I haven't actually used any of the cheats, because I don't want to deprive myself of the bits of grinding here and there, but It's there if you need it.  Gameplay Lots to love here. This game gives you options. No you will not have a different ending, but you have options to give yourself a different playthrough. The game levels itself up as you do, so you can play it a stratight shoot, or you can withold your level and work on crafting and farming items. You can grab the first magic that comes to mind, or you can be selective to carry the best magics. A lot of people will drill that the stat's suffer from using your stronger spells, but it's perception. I think of it as it expends energy to use the stronger spells making you weaker with use. With no GF challenges, or other self made playing challenges you can replay the game and have a whole different experience.  The cons You've heard the positives now here are a few sour spots. The music. As you may have heard plenty beofre the musing isn't the best. It's heavily synthesized and sounds like a fan did all the music in their favorite mid player. It's the same as it was in the original game but with the concerts put out, most have grown acusomed to the higher level of music. It's a minor setback, one that could have been corrected by square enix much like the visual updates. The magic system. It is unique, and has a lot of give and take, but just as much as I applaud the using mgic drains your stats idea, the magic just isn't that strong. There aren't that many powerful spells, and because of it you're likely not to try creating any mages, or see your characters have much in differentiating stats. The controls for this port are bad, you can change your controls, but I haven't found out how to succesfully setup a controller, even with an xbox controller and support for them in the game. Even worse you can't turn off (or I haven't found out how to) controller controls and as you use your keyboard. In any dialogue that involves the controls the control controls display until you press, and/or hold down your keyboard keys. it's very frustrating.  Conclusion As the title imples the game is defeinately a great buy due to the many perks, and how they way outweigh the cons.  If you want a very engrosing story, amazing cutscenes, music you will catch yourself humming to, Interesting gamign mechanics that offer plenty of replayability and hours upon hours of standard gameplay. Plenty of secrets, so much that you may need a guide or two to find them all. Lastly, the mini games chocobo world, and triple triad are good enough to be spinoffs of their own, and are beneficial, albeit optional, to the game. If you've been on the fence about it, or you have wanted to try it previously but haven't yet pick this one up or regret it.			"

												This is still one of my favorite Final Fantasy games, and the PC benefits over the PS1 are pretty nice. I love the ability to speed up the cinematics to 60 fps, which make the scenes look fantastic, although everything is moving at twice the speed, thus making it a much shorter cutscene, which is the closest thing to being able to skip it. But if you've already sunk hundreds of hours into it before, then it's definitely worth checking out, especially when it's on sale. If you havent played it before, its still definitely worth the money. The cutscenes still look good (for the time they were released, especially) and the overall game doesn't look too shabby compared to others from its time. The ability to summon GFs  (basically pets) and unlock loads of skills for then as well as everyone in the party is awesome. The magic/GF/Ability junction feature is also one of my favorite implemented systems, making it much easier to help overcome more powerful opponents once you've gotten used to utilizing it. Only downside to that is that you constantly need to stock magic in order to keep your stats as buffed as possible, which can take awhile and becomes a bit tedious. But overall, the mechanics are very smooth and simple. The story is very well done too. It's enough of a driving factor to keep people who may not like grinding very much to stay interested, although there's no journal or anything of that nature to keep you focused on where to go next, which may become a problem if you decide to stop playing for a while and resume later. That's one of my only real problems with this game. Most adventure/open world games have some sort of journal or objective list in case you forget where you're supposed to go next, or at least who to talk to. That aside, I'd still highly recommend this game to just about anyone who loves the old school RPG style of game play with some unique mechanics and a good storyline.TL;DR Buy this game. It's a great part of the FF series.			"

												Final Fantasy VIIIRPG-Developed by SquareSoft / Square EnixYear 1999/2000 The Story  8/10You are Squall Leonhart an orphan and SeeD of Balamb Garden. SeeD is a mercenary group trained to fight the sorceress. You awake in the hospital wing after your training session with your fellow student Seifer. As your progress you go on your final exam to become a SeeD and be deployed around the whole world. Your first mission helping out a resistance faction. Sets you on a course that will change the entire world.Grahpics 7/10The graphic are better than Final Fantasy 7 fewer blocky textures. More movies they transition seemlessly between gameplay. The way monsters die is cool. Some will turn of stone or explode. Most just fall over and die I like that more than them turning red and dissappering like in Final Fantasy 7.  There are graphics mods that will improve the game if you can install them.Music 0/10  after JunkyBiggs music mod 10/10The music on this release of the game is poor... not of worry though it's a simple fix after you install the game just replace the muisc files with the converted ones thanks to JunkyBiggs. It takes less then 1 mintue to do this. Just look in the Guides section you will find his and many of music mods there.The music in the game is amazing all the songs ""Eyes on Me"" The Man with the Machine Gun"" those are my favorites. The opening theme ""Liberi Fatali""  The battle theme ""Don’t Be Afraid"" and the nice ""Waltz For The Moon"" all amazing. The songs all fit and game and fit what you are doing at the time.Gameplay 10/10The gameplay I love as it makes you have to think about what you are doing. In Final Fantasy 8 the monsters all level along with your party, Their level is ramdonly decided as a few levels higher or lower than your average current partys level. If you had say Squall at level 100 and Zell at lvl 8 than monsters you run into would be from lv60-80. Summons or Guardian Forces / GF The GF play a major rule as they allow you to junction. The Junction system allows you to junction magic to your stats to makes yourself more powerful. Monsters do not level with your GF. It's really the base of the game it's easy to figure out and the in game tutorials explain it very well. The animations for the GF can become repetitive over time. Otherwise I really like this system myself it's fun and allows you to play the whole game without leveling at all.Money / GilYou are paid in this game based on your SeeD rank. Your SeeD rank is really based off of how many monsters you kill. There are a few other times in the story where doing your job right will up your rank but, not many. What I didn't like about this is that your rank falls after a short time. There are tests you can take to up your rank they as well. Making money becomes very, very easy once you get GF tonberry. So don't worry about money after you get him and train him you will never run out of funds.Chocobo WorldMake sure you start using this as soon as you get boko from your first forest. Boko will make getting items very easy. Do not start chocobo world while Boko is set to Home. You will gltich the game and have to start over with a new boko. Just remeber to close chocobo world bring him home get his items and send him back before opening it agian. I'll save you some time the best ID is in fact ""211"" use the do over button till you get ID 211 it'll make the game much easier as boko will be a total pwnage machine.The Card Game Triple TriadI found triple Triad to be fun not challanging though. You are providing with cards of insane power by the time you get the GF brothers. Don't mix rules as they are very hard to get back to normal. The game is played on a 3x3 size board. You and your npc opponent start by selecting 5 cards and using the number rating and rules to flip and cards placed down. It's very simple and enjoying as long as you don't mess up and rule system. I'll say this again do not ever mix rules!Chocobo ForestsI didn't like how they used chocobos in this final fantasy. After 7 had such fun with them all you can do in this one is ride them around the map. I would have liked to have had another race track or something along those lines sadly chocobos fall short in this game. I give the Chocobo Quest in this game a 3/10 it was boring. I give this game a 8/10 I recommend you play it if you love RPGs			"

												Final Fantasy VIII seems to exist in a crossroads. The game is either loved by fans or dismissed as being not of Final Fantasy norm. Due to some changes in its core mechanics and its reliance on much more realism in the characters and worlds compared to other Final Fantasy games of the era, many prefer its predecessor Final Fantasy VII or its successor Final Fantasy IX that utilize more fantasy driven environments and characters. Final Fantasy VIII however is a title not to be missed by any story afficianado or RPG enthusiest. The story is of top notch quality and the depth to which you will find yourself emersed is unparallel.Having purchased and completed Final Fantasy VIII twice on the original PlayStation I decided to purchase it again to relive one of my favorite games of all time on the PC with its slightly better visuals and increased resolution.  I still have yet to play a game with as much emotional connection to the characters as this game did back in 1999. The controls are a little awkward and take time to get used to but other than that the game as a whole has been running flawlessly for me. Load times are MUCH faster as compared to the PlayStation version, and the sounds are intact with no glitches for me. If you’ve never played the game before, you’re in for a ride that you won’t forget.			"

												While it may not be the best in the Final Fantasy series, FF8 holds a big place in my heart. This is the first time I've played the game, so I'm not speaking with feelings of nostalgia here.Gameplay: Initially, I was turned off. The Junction system wasn't something I was used to. MP doesn't exist here with magic being a consumeable item. It's just something you draw from enemies or synthesize. I rarely casted magic against monsters and used it as a stat upgrade, which left a bad taste in my mouth. Eventually though, I learned to like the system. Once you get the hang of it, it's like a fact of life that you don't put much thought on. It's also easy to power up your party, making this one of the easier FF games.Sidequests: Not a lot. Plus most of the sidequests are not difficult to accomplish. They are just time-consuming. To note a few challenges, there's a Steam achievement called ""Contrived Victory""; you may have to play through the game a second time. Card collecting is also a big hassle.Story: I really enjoyed the story even if it was presented in a confusing manner. For a game that had schools training teen soldiers, warring factions, and a time compression scheme by a corrupt sorceress, I didn't feel the gravity of the world's situation until the middle of Disc 3. That's just something funny to observe. You could tell that the game's theme was about friendship and love being the most precious thing that surpasses past, present, and future. Cheesy but endearing. (Squall and the gang are #squadgoals; Laguna and the gang are #squadgoals)Music: Memorable. There are strong pieces in the game that you will download and listen to on repeat. They go very well with the various places scattered in the world. My favorite scene was when ""Compression of Time"" started playing. To me, that will always be an iconic moment in the game.(Just make sure to replace the bad steam port music with the orginal PS1 version!!! It makes the gaming experience significantly better!)All in all it is highly-reccommended you play FF8. The whole game plays like a sentimental memory because time is what brings this whole game together. There's a lot to be had in FF8 that will give you a great experience despite its' imperfections.

												It's the same game it's always been, so it's impossible to do anything but recommend it.  Granted, the music is still the awful tinny PC Midi soundtrack, but as with VII, Square-Enix will fix this (i'm more surprised people didn't complain at the classic Doom releases retaining it's PC soundtrack, instead of including, or perhaps even giving the option of, the far more creepy and atmospheric PSX soundtrack, but hey, PC gamers are a funny lot at the best of times :p)Anway, none of this takes anything away from the fact that 14 years on, this is still not only one of the best FF titles, but one of the RPG's ever made.  Definitely recommended!			"

												This is a must have game.  If you've played the Final Fantasy Series, especially #7, then you'll enjoy this game...but you won't rave about it.  Why?  Because everyone who has, raves about 7.  Well let me tell you something.  I played 8 before 7 and yes, 7 was good.  But 8 is far better, graphics are irrelevant, the characters feel more alive in 8, they're easier to connect with.  And above all, you feel sorry for every single one, this includes the evil characters!  This game humanizes the characters, you feel their sorrows, triumphs, defeats.  The storytelling does it all, beginning with that first spar before the Seed Test...good luck and have fun all.  I know I am! :)			"

												Final Fantasy VIII is my all time favorite RPG. Why? Because it's one of the first video games I ever got into, so naturally I have some sentimental value. That being said, I'll give as unbiased of a review as I can on this game.StoryThe story of Final Fantasy VIII is somewhat strange and can be hard to follow at times, but, it's Final Fantasy. I wouldn't consider any of the games normal story wise. I find the characters to be very individual and personable. While Squall does start out as somewhat cynical and brooding, you, as the player, slowly watches him grow and develop into a new person in a very natural way. Not to mention he has one of the most badass weapons ever created, though it's nowhere near as interesting as Selphie's comically large nunchaku that everyone is just kind of okay with.GameplayA lot of people gripe about the system in VIII. Truth is, you aren't understanding it. If you think you have to sit for hours and draw magic from random monsters, you aren't playing the game right. Learn the system inside and out and you can make absolutely insane characters. I tested just how strong you could go, and ended up soloing most of the game with Selphie. More so, the battle system is fun, and a little bit more interactive than just hitting Attack over and over again. The GF's (Summons) are powerful, and completely infinite use, and the center of the whole system. While the animations for the GF's can be somewhat long, if that doesn't bug you, it can make for pretty epic battles visually, with respects to when the game came out. Magic works like Ammo, with no MP system, and you can obtain more through various ways. There are a lot of extra abilities you can learn as well, which can help specialize each character.VisualsAgain, it's a PSOne game, and while the character models recieved a nice upgrade, the field took a pretty serious hit. I honestly have no idea why they couldn't upgrade everything on a PC but I'm not gonna complain too much. The art of the world is very sci fi and quite beautiful in my opinion. There is a lot of realism, which both characters and field. While a bit futuristic, it's very believable to see these towns as places that could actually exist (barring Esthar).AudioUnfortunately, all the music in the PC version of this game is in the MIDI format. It's not nearly as good as the original soundtrack, but if you can get over that hump, it's still the same music, just crappier quality. There are ways to patch it if you really want to, but it doesn't bug me enough to want to change it. Oddly enough about 90% of the sound effects stayed the same. There are some minor differences, most notable in Quezacotl's summon sequence, but for the most part, they are all the same. Force Your Way will forever be my single most loved video game song ever.BugsSo far, I haven't encountered any serious bugs. If you tab out of the game, sometimes all of the music will stop playing, which is weird. Incredibly weird. Final Fantasy VIII with no music makes for an odd and awkward experience. Everything just kind of feels... empty.OverallI would highly recommend this game to anyone really. Hell, I bought this game for a good chunk of people for the holidays. If you are an RPG fan, give this a shot. It might just be your next favorite.			"

												One of my personal favorites, arguably as good as 7. Glad to own this again, worked great on my comp no problems. All the people complaining about graphics issues/crashing must have have pre 2008 comps or something. Triple Triad is the best mini game ever. Very addicting.Squall (MC) is kinda minimilistic and stand offish but the side characters make him shine. You'll be quickly lost in this story and will forget about the at times fustrating junction system (more difficult than 7's matieria). Even this system is so unique that it makes this game stand apart from other FFs.			"

If you're a Final Fantasy fan, you MUST purchase this game.			"

And even if the control feels a bit rusty (360° thumbstick control is not supported, because the game was developed for ""D-pads"") the gameplay is the same like 14 years ago. 9.5/10 just because it's classy & culty.

												Final Fantasy 8 is the best RPG game I've played. It was incredibly fun when I first played it on the playstation 1 and for a game that was released in 1999, it definitely lives up to today's expectations in terms of quality of gameplay and cinematic beauty. The cutscene's are simply beautiful and the storyline is entertaining enough to keep you occupied for hours, making this RPG truly replayable. The mini card game bundled into this game is a nice bonus, that coupled with the steam achievements makes this old classic a real steam RPG of 2013. "

												Alright. Here's my obligatory review. I've played this game too many times to count, and I'm just as grateful to have it here as ever. Yeah, there are some sound issues. They're all midi's of somewhat low quality. Additionally, from what I can tell, Renzokuken slows framerates just a little. Finally, control settings aren't the best. Still, it is nothing I can't get over. I can enjoy this game just as much as I have in the past, and I can get around all of that, to have a very beautiful nostalgia kick. I recommend this game as highly as I can. It's a true epic, brought back to life.			"

												One of the best game ever created is now on Steam and I had to buy it as soon as I saw it was available. The graphics are vastly improved and has two special features. A variation of the booster from VII makes an appearance but instead of making it a character booster it gives you 100 of level 1 and 2 magics. There is also a nice addition of Chocobo World, a mini game of Chocobo exploration, with items that you can use in FFVIII, that was never released outside of Japan.The story is emotional, mysterious and thrilling and the music is beautiful. (Square has used low quality midi at the moment but most likely will be patched just as VII was.)This is an essential for any Final Fantasy and RPG fan alike. This is one that must be played.10/10			"

												Does this game even needs a review ? What are you doing reading review for one of the best jrpg ever made, just play it.I'm not gonna compare this FF to any of its predecessors, or any of its successors, it is one of the greatest, and that shoud suffice.- Turn-by-turn combat- Impressive summonings (called G-Force in this game, Nvidia didn't invent anything, I tell you)- Nice story (if you like those J-RPG stories - I do)- Cliche characters (You'll find them in pretty much all the FF)- Amazing cinematics. I mean, even for an old game, the cinematics are still awesome.And the most important point: Triple TriadThis is a card game you can play with many NPCS in the game, it is AWE-SO-ME!It's nerve wracking, the rules change from one game to another depending on who you met in the game and who you played against. You get the strongest cards by fighting other players, and sometimes you even loose your own cards and you go home your head lowered in shame !I have no idea why you even bothered reading this far, if you ever wanted to try Final Fantasy, or if you enjoyed any of the great ones (I'm looking at you FF 6 through 9) and are still wondering about this one, stop: just buy it.Honestly, for 15$/€ you still get more playtime than most 60$ latest RPG you might find on the market.

												Truly an incredible game. I can't say tho which one is better, this or 7 ... but I'm sure this is one of the most underrated Final Fantasy game. Maybe because it was released almost instantly after 7? I don't know but you really won't go wrong if you start playing this. Also Squall was kinda closer to my heart than Cloud. His personality is something I can relate to but also the fact that character development has a bigger focus in this game than in 7.It's hard to talk about the story without any spoilers but I've really liked it. Even the ending which is something ""controversial"" or at least heavily debated by the fanbase.Obviously the game is almost 20 years old so the graphics are a bit dated but that doesn't take away anything from the experience. But it's highly recommended to use some mods to make the game better. Here are the ones I've used:1. Tonberry: Ehanced. You need that for modding. http://forums.qhimm.com/index.php?topic=15945.02. SeeD Reborn. Full menu overhaul. http://forums.qhimm.com/index.php?topic=15320.03. Roses and Wine. Full high quality PSX music instead of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ MIDI music we got with the PC release. http://forums.qhimm.com/index.php?topic=13715.04. Xbox360 controller icons. That's optional ofc but I recommend to play with a controller. http://forums.qhimm.com/index.php?topic=15905.0Also this is not a hard game but it can be difficult! The game is kinda vague about what you should do (there is no quest system!) so I highly recommend to use a non-spoiler walkthroughhttp://jegged.com/Games/Final-Fantasy-VIII/Walkthrough/Disc-1/01-Balamb-Garden.htmlThat leads to the biggest con of the game. It's not the story, the art, or the characters... it's the fact that the game is mechanically broken. Basically imbalanced. By the end of disc 1 (which is still the early game) you can max out your GFs, all your party members can have 5k HP and one shot every enemy. And don't even mention the infinite money glitch. I don't say it's bad but in the end it makes the game really easy (much easier than 7). In the other hand you can ignore these things but it's in the game, in front of your eyes. Hard to pass it when otherwise you would need to grind the same NPC for hours just to get the desired loot. It didn't take anything away from the game for me but it has to be mentioned.Also don't ignore the Triple Triad card game! Collecting cards is fun and the game is also fun to play. The best game inside a game ever.I recommend to use Gamer Corner FF8 database for researching items and cards (what to refine to what, where to find X items and monsters etc.)http://guides.gamercorner.net/ffviii/Also it has a nice Junction Workshop where you can optimze your GF setup http://guides.gamercorner.net/ffviii/workshop/What else to say? A great game. Just go and start playing it. Now!			"

												Much akin to the steam verison of VII, the port runs perfectly. Improved character models are good, more so than VII's, and comes with the pocketstation game chocobo world if you want to make your already overpowered characters absurdly more so by wiping and re-customizing all your GFs with the items you can net yourself in that.Major drawback of this port is that unlike VII, they didn't fix the music so you're stuck with lower quality MIDI versions unless you mod it. As far as I know they haven't fixed this and likely don't plan to, so mods to the rescue.			"

												At first, this game took me a while to get into due to the strange magic and stat system as well as the general world of the game, but I ended up surprising myself by how likable it ended up being.In this game, you can gather magic spells from enemies via battle command, and then recast the spells, or equip them onto your stats to make them increase. This felt like a very weird system, having to gather and collect spells just to cast them later, as well as how slow you'd gather the spells. I later learned that the higher your magic stat, the faster your magic gathering would become, and I also learned that magic generally wouldn't be used a lot in normal combat anyways, so you'd rarely touch your huge pile of magic spells unless a boss or healing.What really makes me like this system is equipping the spells to your stats, since the more magic you have of that type you're attaching to a specific stat (maximum 100 stack of any spell), the higher boost that stat would recieve. It also takes into account what kind of magic is being placed onto the stat, so placing something like... haste onto your speed stat would give it a massive boost. Casting spells equipped to your stats would cause that stat to lower, due to a smaller stack being there now, so you might end up finding a use for many spells you'd never even give the chance in other FF games.I've personally only played FF4, 5, 6, and 7 (as well as this game), but I find this manages to be my second favourite, even beating out games I have a nostalgic feeling for. A well-written and interesting story, wonderful soundtrack (even though I think this port has a different one, but I haven't heard the original), and a cast of characters I ended up warming up to the same as the protagonist. If you haven't played this, I strongly recommend you give it a try if you're into ""turn-based"" RPGs, since it was a wonderful experience for only $12.			"

												Does this game even needs a review ? What are you doing reading review for one of the best jrpg ever made, just play it.I'm not gonna compare this FF to any of its predecessors, or any of its successors, it is one of the greatest, and that shoud suffice.- Turn-by-turn combat- Impressive summonings (called G-Force in this game, Nvidia didn't invent anything, I tell you)- Nice story (if you like those J-RPG stories - I do)- Cliche characters (You'll find them in pretty much all the FF)- Amazing cinematics. I mean, even for an old game, the cinematics are still awesome.And the most important point: Triple TriadThis is a card game you can play with many NPCS in the game, it is AWE-SO-ME!It's nerve wracking, the rules change from one game to another depending on who you met in the game and who you played against. You get the strongest cards by fighting other players, and sometimes you even loose your own cards and you go home your head lowered in shame !I have no idea why you even bothered reading this far, if you ever wanted to try Final Fantasy, or if you enjoyed any of the great ones (I'm looking at you FF 6 through 9) and are still wondering about this one, stop: just buy it.Honestly, for 15$/€ you still get more playtime than most 60$ latest RPG you might find on the market. At least the ones that won't scar you forever (ain't that right, Dark souls?).			"

The game is just as great as I remember it. Epic story, fun game play and combat system. I have no complaints on this game at all and look forward to the next final fantasy game that ports to pc.Any one who played this game back in the day and want to relive the fun you have, don't be afraid to buy! It's a great port though id suggest using a xbox controller to play wired if possible.			"

												After FF7 I was rly excited to play FF8 on steam after unbelievable 15 years :D I remember having loved this game and I was curious what I would think about it after so many years.As in all Squaresoft (Square Enix) RPGs you can spend A LOT of time playing this game and some sidequests are rather annoying but if u dont ant to play them then just dont :)The game itself isnt rly difficult...well obviously it depends on your characters skill but I got through without any big problems. Though there are some tough enemies which you dont have to kill but u will feel great after defeating them.Again the battlesystem is quite goood. You should speed it up in the menu though then u wont have to wait ages for each character to have a go. Magic isnt used by junctioning special materia to your character like in FF7. Here u have to collect the spells. U can either draw them from enemies or refine them (quickest way is refining them). U will have access to the open world pretty fast and can go exploring. Story takes place in pretty calm and colourful world. You can use magic for the battles and have the possibilty to summon Monsters to help you out. You are a soldier of SeeD a special force who fights against witches. Yeah... witches... but luckily not the medieval witches :D They r just mean rly mean women with exceptional power who always want more... (sounds familiar?). Main focus, next to saving the world, is the rather complicated relation between the main character and one of his clients. Yes! This is an epic lovestory :DThe characters can be annyoing from time to time but after long speeches u will be rewarded with awesome cutscenes :D All in all I enjoyed playing the game after 15 years and it is the second best RPG Squaresoft (Square Enix) has developed :D			"

Always the right sound for a scene. BUT ... the right soundtrack is not is this game. It was replaced by midi sounds and really .. this is pain for the ears.

Go ahead and downvote this if you wish.Another PC port of a PS1 classic that is pretty much the same as it was back then. Get this on sale if you didn't play it before or if nostalgia dictates that you try it again. Or because you want achievements. Whatever reason best suits you.Though you do need to mod the game to get the correct soundtrack, which is really annoying. If the review system here wasn't so binary i'd give this a ""maybe"" for that reason alone. This is just a cash-grab by Square-Enix.			"

												Final Fantasy VIII is a game that peaks my list of favorite games. It also will go down in history as a huge source of debate on all of its innovations, story, game play, and graphics. The one thing that all of it's passionate fans will agree on is how great this game is. With in the sea of criticism and broken theories to make since of what's going on, all of us found ourselves comming back to it. Is that not what a great game is all about? Being able to come back and re-live the joy it handed to us the first go around? If we find ourselves going back, who are we to not reccomend this to anyone else? Sure the steam version has it's flaws but it still contains the heart of FFVIII. This is a game everyone should enjoy. It's not getting easy to just go buy the ps1 version of this game, and people willing to actually play this style of game are increasingly dwindling. Serisously if you are looking at reviews to decide rather or not to buy/play this don't let the people itching for nostalgia ruin your decision. If you can handle some grinding, turn based fighting, and a rich story line, this game is something you should delve into. As I said it may not be perfect, but there is a reason people keep coming back.			"

												This is the ultimate love/hate game for me. I'll begin with the negatives. The junction system can be a chore to set up since you have to draw magic from enemies and casting it by the amount you have drawn instead of having the traditional MP (mana) system.  The story is pretty shallow and some characters just seem unnecessary. The soundtrack is pretty hit or miss. Lastly, the game can be pretty easily beaten by spamming Aura+GF combos from a certain point onward.Now with the good. Despite the rather shallow story, Squall and Rinoa's character development is pretty neat to watch unfold. Once your junctions are set up, the battle system can be pretty fun at times. There's plenty of fun sidequests and of course, there's the well known card game: Triple Triad. The game does have a certain charm to it and big part of it are the cohesive and well-timed cutscenes. The cutscenes were ahead of their time when this game was released and graphically still hold up very well. The final boss fight also rivals that of Kefka (FFVI) and Sephiroth (FFVII) in terms of epicness and challenge.To keep it short, this game is worth playing as long as you can accept it being very different from the traditional Final Fantasy game. Don't try to play through it as if you're playing VII or IX. Learn the junction system and use it properly. I've seen so many others try to play the game and end up not enjoying it because they didn't ever learn the junction system and played by just pressing 'Attack.' It's not worth getting if you're looking for a story that'll keep you wanting more. IV, VI, VII, IX, and X will provide much better stories than this installment. If you can accept its flaws, it can prove to be a good game with a certain whimsical charm to it and will provide you with plenty hours of playtime.			"

												For me it's one of the best j-rpgs ever made and the best from ""Final Fantasy"" series. I love the plot here, world  from this part and especialy characters. I like Squall much more than Cloud from predecessor. I like how Squall's change is show right from start until very end. From a lonely type who doesn't share his feelings with others to opposite. Well, yes. This is the easiest ""Final Fantasy"" but that never spoiled me fun from playing, especially that this one has the best mini-game from the series: Triple Triad. (""Final Fantasy IX"" has similiar mini-game, but here was first.) Drawing magic from the enemies may not be the best part of game, but still, it's okay.  I remember when I played this many years ago on PSX, that time graphics was fantastic in this game, especially the FMV cutscenes, which looks great even now. And I can't forget about this fantastic music in game! So, if you're a ""Final Fantasy"" fan or you never played this and you like j-rpg games, this is one of the must have titles.Pros: Story Characters Music Triple Triad Graphics ( of course it was, and I like it even now.) One of the hardest bossess in ""Final Fantasy"" series - Omega WeaponCons: Draw system ( which is not that bad, but not the best either) Too easy difficulty level.My rating: 10/10A classic in the j-rpg games.

												A poor port but the game still is worth it.Reasons to buy:1) Achievements. Especially ""contrived finish"" which just makes you play the game in a totally different way. Such cool! WOW! But I guess some people can't be bothered with trophies.2) The Hi Speed (F1) option. Makes traveling back and forth a lot less tedious. I love it.3) Nostalgia. Yes, the game is as good as you remember.Reasons not to:1) The port is TERRIBLE. Espcially for music. Don't despair! Mods make up for it. I only grabbed the Music Replacement mod (Roses&Wine) and the mood was set, but if you want, there's a lot of graphics enhancers/texture replacement and whatnot. They make it equal or better than PS1 version. And Achievements still work!2) Buttons are very hard to set and remember on a controller (""enter code: B4 B2 B3 B4"" yaaaay). Still, it only bothered me on the Train mission and in the battle of the two Gardens, so not too bad.			"

												Where do I begin? I've never been a huge fan of final fantasy with 8 being the only one in the series that I've beaten. To put it simply I love this game and it pairs up with Dragon Quest 8, another game by Square Enix that i absolutely love. I'll start off by saying Squall has to be one of the best characters I've seen in a long time and the character development of Squall over the course of FF8 is nothing short of spectacular. The love story is brilliant and anybody whos beaten the game and seen the ending you know how amazing it is. The reason I like Squall so much is that I can relate to him and being able to relate to the main protagonist of any game is a good thing. My favortie scene would have to be Squall and Rinoa on the ragnorak with the eyes on me theme song for the game playing. Truly beautiful scene. For all of you that have never played this I strongly recommend playing it because it has a fantastic story with fantastic characters. 10/10			"

												Nice story and character moments, and the visuals hold up surprisingly well. Aside from modding potential, this release has 2 specific advantages to simply emulating the original, getting in on PSN, etc.1) Hi-speed mode. This is like unlocking the FPS limit on an emulator, but the music doesn't get warped. Since you will spend a lot of time either in the field or an unskippable cutscene, this could save you multiple hours in a single playthrough. Also, during certain timed segments the timer will not be sped up - this is kinda cheating, but arguably justified since you're dealing with some annoyingly long battle animations. I think you can use this hotkey (F1), avoid the rest (F2-F5, which are unquestionably cheating) and still feel like you are playing legitimately.2) Magic Booster. This is a built-in hack that gives you 100 copies of every spell in your inventory, for each character. But it does not give you spells you don't have. This is definitely cheating, but if you've played the game before, you might see this cheat as acceptable compared to max Gil/damage/etc... you can easily farm 100 copies of most spells, but it is very time-consuming.That said, this game has some design issues regardless of what platform you're on. The Junction system is kinda broken, and the game ends up becoming very easy once you've obtained enough spells (which takes time and/or effort, but not skill). For me, one particular character could completely demolish every boss with little to no strategy involved. It's not awful, but it's not great either, which is why I think stuff like the magic booster isn't a big deal. Overall, this is one you'll enjoy for the story over the gameplay.			"

												This is absolutely the greatest Final Fantasy title ever made.It has the most touching story I have ever witnessed and has a huge complexity regarding the managing of your characters.Huge numbers of characters, spells, skills, commands, variety of combat, enemies and gameplay in general.The card game and the junctioning system probably consumed most of my play time but it also was almost the most fun to do.11/10 for the sheer awesomeness and of course the fitting soundtracks and the previously mentioned aspects.

Yes I reccomend this game to Anyone that lieks the Final Fantasy Series, The Originals that is. This game is turn based, and it comes in the format of somewhat of a romantic novel between a Soldier and a Faction Leader. I Highly reccomend that You take your time reading and please for your own sake DO NOT RUSH, you will miss out on a breath taking story and its world; And i do mean this DO NOT RUSH. This is my favorite Final Fantasy in the series, and yes i played 9, 10 , and reasonably 7 [i will get back to it]. Anyway here it goes:The Graphics.. don't give a damn about it, this isnt a remake is re-release of the game. Still love the original one on PS1The Audio: It was very interesting to hear the MIDI structure Nobuo Uematsu put together, I was able to tell how he approached the themes, and where he could have possibly had trouble playing. [ Check out EDEA's Theme i believe is called sucession of witches, or the sucessor. Also check out Balamb's theme you would hear a  dissonant sound from both themes. So from musician to musician it was very exiting to hear what the next track would sound like in MIDI :D. Though I like the MIDI version in its own way, the orchestrated versions of the OST is by far better, and i mean waaaaay better. The Gameplay: Turn based, OR NOT really. There is  ATB which is Active Time battle and you can basically bump this all the way up and it wont feel turn based. what this does is that it makes the battle waiting faster, and as you level up so do your sorroundings so it will be even faster! The magic in this game is not learned as an ability but drawn from Draw points and or monsters, and they do not take away any magic power, or MP, but they are stored in Quantities. To some this might be an abomination BUT to me this feels a bit interesting and maybe, challenging, because you will then learn not to waste magic, lets say you have for instance 10 curagas or 5 Meltdowns....ehheheh. you best use them wisely. I also love the Junction system because this gives the characters and the GFs more uniqueness, enough said. One con, and this is a big one for me, I DO NOT LIKE THE MAGIC BOOSTER, i think that takes away from the game, and also encourages people to cheat, which in my opinion  is a bad thing to do, because it takes away from the experience & who would want to cheat with such a good game? this turns off people. On a side note if they were to do more Final Fantasy remakes' they should add an option that Filters the graphics of these games, they arent demanding anyways, to give them different tones.. that would be very very very cool. I will highly reccomend this game , dont worry about what people say about this title, everyone has their own taste,10/10 - Personally.. Oh yeah & PLEASE IF YOU ARE A FF NEWBIEGO PLAY CLASICS LIKE THIS FIRST.			"

												Why I like Final Fantasy VIII more than most: (Warning contains major spoilers to the plot)1 - The music. Sure every Final Fantasy has a few good songs out of their soundtrack, but Final Fantasy VIII, almost every other song is excellent!2 - The Characters. Yes, sure most say that Final Fantasy VIII has the weakest character selection and is a cliche. And the student/teacher relation plot is overused. But it's not the relationship, it how you relate to them. Everyone can be like Squall; quiet, sticks to themselves, and puts themselves first. Say you don't have any of those qualities, I dare you! If Squall isn't you then you must be Zell (Jock) or Irvine (Playboy)?3 - The Secondary Plot Line. Sure, I'm not big on the whole war thing... But hear me out. It's not really about fighting the sorceress from the future who corrupted the sorceresses of the past and today. Well, it kinda is. But the back plot is: As much as Squall looks quite on the inside, he really want's acceptance. Most orphans are like that; stick to themselves because they don't want to get hurt again. 4 - The Story. Now I'm going to the primary plot line. Squall is a SeeD (a mercenary) who's sole job is to defeat the Sorceress Edea along with the other SeeD cadets to ultimately gain peace. Though the story to Final Fantasy VII was a bit better... But this is about VIII! But then... Squall finds out that Edea is/was the lady in charge in the orphanage (What a twist!) along with the other party members, they all were orphans together (except Rinoa) And now Squall want's the Sorceress to live. Fights her hoping for the best, then Rinoa gets possessed. Later in the game, he will forgo all he knew and lived by if Rinoa wasn't cured and become a Sorceress' Knight. That's what makes this story so compelling and an emotional journey. The emotion put in this game is stronger than VII.5 - The Side Quests. Triple Triad was the best side quest out of every Final Fantasy. Sure Final Fantasy IX had a card game... But there were no REAL rules or at least none that were explained in depth. In VII you could raise Chocobos which was fun to a point, but very repetitive! The card game in VIII if you got one of Quetzalcoatl's abilities you could mod the cards into items. That made getting a perfect 100% hard!6 - Sis, come back to me... I'm all alone (Ellone). She is the key to the whole game. She doesn't get much screen time. But is a very key character! She takes Squall and gang to 'The Dream World' where they see through Laguna, Kiros and Ward's eyes. To understand the sorceress and what went on before the war. But that wasn't really her motive. Her motive was to make Uncle Laguna stay with her. This is where Rinoa comes into play. Laguna was madly in-love with a singer at a bar named Julia. And Julia's song 'Eyes on Me' (voiced by Faye Wong. That song makes me want to cry...) was all about Laguna. But since Laguna kept getting called all over the world (since he was a soldier and all) she married another, General Caraway. Even though her last name is Heartilly (Presumed to be Julia's last name). So that would make Laguna a very key part in the story... Well he is! He put a stop to Sorceress Adel (Though... Adel looks like a man...). But I guess where I'm going with this point is: Knowing the past, is the key to the future. He then became the President of Esthar (who was the very enemy when he was a Galbadian Soldier). All in search of his little Elle. Ellone was searching for Laguna, whilst he did the same. Well, I can go on-and-on on how perfect Final Fantasy VIII is, but I won't. I'm probably boring you all to tears. Well I guess ""It's like killing two pigs with one stone. I'm just so awesome... Genius, I tell you..."" ""Pigs? I think you mean birds."" Well no... I was just trying to get a point across! Final Fantasy VIII is one of the most unappreciated Final Fantasies of all time!			"

												I think this game gets overshadowed by its predecessor. This game is inventive for the seventh sequel of any game. Without spoiling to much, the story is unpredictable (well, sometimes very predictable) due to not knowing what your doing half the time. The gameplay in battle is well made, giving you may options for attacking. The characters are diverse, they're personality spanning from highly motivated to just bored. Although the gameplay outside of battle is much worse though. Random encounters are frequent, which wouldn't be a problem if half the time your weren't either looking for something that gives you no clue as to where it is, or running back and forth, rellaying messages between characters, cusing encounters constantly. Overall, the graphics are MUCH better than FFVII, which was pretty much the only thing FFVII got wrong. Maybe MUCH is a bit of a leap, but the models are slightly more polygonal, but the backrounds look... meh, at best. But the story and characters are what won me over. I may just have bad taste, but I'm impressed by this game.7/10 I think that for the price, it is worth experiencing the last in the trilogy of SquareEnix's best games.			"

												Final Fantasy VIII, on steam, just as in 1999, fails considerably to equal its predecessor and yet still manages to be one of the best RPGs ever created. The graphics, in a different style, seem to have aged terribly on our HD monitors today. But this can take little away from the beautifully crafted world and pretty interesting (if rather unnecessarily confusing) storyline. Cards are still a blast to play and remain one of the best side-games to this day. Final Fantasy VIII is well worth another look on PC, although the mods are neither as plentiful nor as comprehensive as those for VII, this is perhaps also due to the fact that it was released much more recently. If you're looking solely for a nostalgia trip to 90s Final Fantasy, the 8th installment of the series is a very, very solid title, but I'd still always recommend its predecessor. 9/10. "

												A classic to play again.  The graphics have been improved upon, I'd say more but for those of you who played this when it was brand new, I will save the description so that you can see for youself.  A personal favorite of mine of all of the final fantasy story lines.  Game play seems a little simplified from the original game play version in that commands for the gunblade as well as other small functions in the game and it is enough of an improvement that it makes the game much kinder to a first time final fantasy player.  Final Fantasy is hard to get wrong, especially the originals but if you're new to the final fantasy experience I would recommend getting into it with these older versions as learning how the game works in these versions is easier and allows you to learn quickly when moving on to the newer versions of the game (you dont feel as lost when you know what you're doing).  Final Fantasy VIII's story line is one of the more light hearted ones so if you're looking for one that is feel good, this is one of the few.  I would recommend this game to any one and especially to RPG fans out there.  If you have not played it yet you really are missing out.  The game is fun, chok full of 90's jokes/referances and of course as with all Final Fantasy games, look forward to the grind ;).			"

It's a great addition to the Final Fantasy series and allows you to tailor your characters any way you want. None of them have a predisposition for a type of activity (black magic, white magic, thief), so it's up to you to decide which stats they gain. I'm also impressed how well the graphics have held up.

												To preface, this is now the third time I have bought FF8.  I own a disc version for PSX, a digital classics for PS3, and now this for Steam.  This rerelease is basically a very very minimially touched up rerelease of the original PC version.  Graphically it's mildly better, the audio sounds mildly worse (although I believe there are mods to get the psx audio installed,) and they have added cheating to help deal with the magic grinding.To anyone who has not played an PSX generation Final Fantasy (7, 8, 9) they're all worth the time to play through and generally all have their own faults.  FF8 is generally very easy to beat, but does require substantial grinding, so the built in ""Magic Boost"" is a nice touch to make the game a bit less of a chore.  In general, if you like JRPGs, give this one a shot.  For all of its plot holes and grinding, it's a game that offers quite a few hours of play for not a whole lot of money.  For me, its a trip down memory lane, one of my favorite childhood video games, and a reminder of what an emo kid I was back in 1999.			"

												Look, this was my first and favorite Final Fantasy. I love everything about the core game, the fighting system, Junctioning, GFs, the story, the music, the characters, all outstanding. Unfortunately this port leaves a lot to be desired. The music is subpar, tolerable but actually below PS1 standards, as it has the original PC port's MIDI tracks. Most of the music and sound isn't affected drastically but when you notice a difference it sticks out like a sore thumb, and music in Final Fantasy is one of the most important aspects of the experience. Without the Roses and Wine mod it's really not that great a port, and it has few good features that are new to the release. Maybe they'll patch the music like with 7, maybe they'll just make their money and be happy, but either way, if you can't tolerate the music being a bit worse than the original, it may not be for you. If you've never played FF8 or any Final Fantasy, well, you're missing out, and should seriously consider picking up this game.			"

												- I never had the chance to finish this game, until now. I liked. You can't compare with Final Fantasy VII, but still worth playing. Sadly, it lacks of real markable characters. There are some interesting fellas, but nothing too much special. Squall saves the game. His own conflits are very interesting. Kinda remind me a little of Cloud Strike. There is a nice romance (a little corny but I can live with that), an amazing soundtrack and a lot of cool missions. - The villains are useless, Seifer (Squall's rival) is useless, the mini-games are lame and I think they should have shown the secondary characters a little more on CG's. Plus, when I was fighting the last boss, the game ran pretty slow during almost half of the battle. Like lagging. I dunno if there's something related to the music mod that I installed. But it was only on that fight. 8/10			"

												Final Fantasy VIII is a wonderful throwback to the multi-disk, open world RPG's of the Playstation Era. It has an interesting (albeit somewhat convoluted) story, multi-dimensional characters that have compelling motivations behind their actions, and a world full of incredible environments and enemies.No game is without fault. The experience system of the game is flawed in that it actually rewards the player for NOT leveling up, and the Draw system (which allows you to stockpile enemy magic for junctioning) can become tedious at times, but with the inclusion of the Magic Booster modification and playing enough Triple Triad (the trading-card minigame within the FF8 world) you can bypass the more tedious parts of the game. Final Fantasy VIII, like any other Final Fantasy game, has 100+ hours of playability, is chock full of quests and side missions that take you around the world, into outer space, and deep, deep into the dark ocean depths. For veteran players looking for a nice piece of nostalgia or players who want to experience a classic RPG, Final Fantasy VIII is certainly a good buy.			"

												Not as good as the one before it, it's still fun and for a cheap price.  The battle system was a bit more annoying in 8, however at least you don't need to always hold the run button down...   so yeah, not as good as 7 but still worth checking out if you liked 7.			"

												Loved the PC port finally gave me a chance to replay the game. The gameplay still stands strong today and is a lot of fun. The updated graphics were a little here and there, some areas were updated and cleaned up but everything around them is really pixelated by comparison.Overall well worth buying and playing			"

												It was funny to see this again and it shows how old it is, but even so the fun is still there. However they do make you sign up unneccesarily, and you cannot change the music volume in windowed mode which is rather irritating. The magic booster was a nice touch and if you're looking to burn some time, well FF never fails! But don't use magic booster early on, it will just give you most of the powerful spells and you'll be way too overpowered at the beginning (if you junction right with GF). All in all, exactly the same, just a bit of fun 8) Oh and the card game, I LOVE YOU AND HATE YOU!			"

												Man there is nothing better then comming back to the first RPG i had ever played! This game is the one that sparked my love for rpg's but for the love i have for mass effect and all them games , nothing beat good ol's FF8 !!!! I Highly recommened this game to people especially because of the fact that we have that second chance in life to play a true good ol classic ! its easy to understand the ingame setup and once you do get the hang of it you will be trying to find different spells to make your character the most ultimate bad♥♥♥♥♥around !!!! now lets see if you can take the challenge and do what i did when i owned this for playstation ! lets see if you have what it takes to beat the game and not level your character once !!!! IT IS VERYPOSSIBLE AND QUITE THE FUN CHALLENGE !!! that is if your man or women enought to take the challenge !!!!! THIS GAME IS DEFINATELY A 10 OUTTA 10 !!!!  Thanks a million steam !!!! now maybe you can try to get Eternal Darkness on steam lol !!!!			"

												For the Final Fantasy fan (especially the hardcore fans), I highly recommend buying this.  To everyone else, if you enjoy the old JRPG style gameplay, I, again, recommend this and even if you arnt a big fan of that style, the story alone is enjoyable.  While they have -not- upgraded the background, kept the original music files (yeah, it's a repeat of the FF7 release), nor adjusted the CG movies for widescreen, or done very little for resolution... the character models are MUCH better than the original blocky pixelated monstrousities of it's original release.  The big negatives for myself are the obvious music and horribly blocky background.  The positives are nostalgia and a great story with some fun old schoolish gameplay.  Hopefully the fans who enjoy making mods will make them (if they havnt already) to improve the negatives, should Square-Enix not do it.  Which they should.  Overall, worth it to fans of the series and to the old school RPG gameplay fans as well.			"

												This game is exactly the definition for the saying: ""Haters gonna hate, players gonna play!"".You love it or you hate it! Since it was released back in PS it had been always the subject of arguments (and comparison to FF7 mostly) for it's characters (Squall 's EMO - better nerf Cloud Strife and etc :P), its mechanics ( GFs- Junctions- Draw Command) and more. As a player who has played almost all FF game in the old generations consoles (from SNES to PS and later on to Android/DS versions and Onlines from FF XI - was in beta for XIV also) IMO is worth getting. The only minus is that thing with the sound which has these butchered midis but still its EPICNESS and AWESOMENESS levels are beyond 9999.			"

												Yay! Another game from my childhood released again for me to play. Nice story, fun characters. The magic system is kinda funny, you have to stock up on spells from monsters, and then you can slot them into your stats for stuff. Summons are back, same moogle time. Overall this game rates a 7.5 out of 10. Definitely worth the price tag, if you play for the story like I do.			"

												I think with the FF series you either love it or hate it.  I am a huge fan of the series although FF8 was maybe one of the more confusing when it came to junctioning GF's magic etc.  It works beautifully on the PC and I have not encountered any issues (Im a windows 8.1 user).  Did have to set up a Square Enix account but its not really any hassle takes 2 minutes.  Works with a controller (using the xbox360 one myself) although the only issue is working out which control its refering to as it lables them B1/B2/B3 not Y X A etc.  Still highly recommend this game even after picking it up many times over.

												A lot of mixed opinions comr from FF8. The draw system, where you pull spells from your enemies and then equip them to your character, seems fairly devisive to most players. You either love it or hate it. I always loved it. You can become so poweful from simply maxing out the spells that you have equipped that you can win big fights just using the basic attacks.And of course, the card game. The card game that exists inside of FF8 is worth $12 alone.			"

												My childhood returned to me in greater quality and on a better machine. The only way to make this game better is to add voices. However, it's still the best Final Fantasy game in a long running series. It goes, FF8, FF4, FF10. I'm sure this is only the start of many hours gladly lost to this world. 10 out of 10 would recommend to anyone looking for a rich story line, quality and diverse characters, and weapons that add to an already smooth turn based fighting style.

PC Port ReviewThis is a re-release of the original PC port from 2000.GameplayIn terms of gameplay, original glitches and exploits are still here. The game itself however is not fully representative compared to it's PlayStation version, read below for more info.Controls- Xbox 360 controller is supported.- Cannot use dpad or triggers (bumpers work, but not triggers.) - Due to lack of triggers, clicking the thumbsticks is used to escape from battles.- Original game has rumble support, this does not.- Very playable, but does not perfectly emulate the PlayStation version.- Keyboard support only.- No mouse. - Not all keys are bindable.- Binding other keys like Enter, Tab, CTRL, Spacebar, etc. is possible but requires trial and error.- Playable to a certain extent.Controls note: In-game control prompts are also buggy with misplaced buttons or displaying the keys NONE if you manage to bind certain keys like tab, enter, shift, ctrl, spacebar, etc. This will lead to certain sequences like entering passwords for the train napping sequence being harder than usual and possibly lead to a game over screen.GraphicsPros:- Can be played in a higher res compared to PlayStation version.- Models do not look as jagged compared to PlayStation.- Character models are much more sharp in this version and look decent for a PlayStation title.- FMVs (while compressed) have aged pretty well.Cons:- Game battles are locked in at 16FPS, world map at 30FPS.- World map framerate is good, but looks HORRIBLE with blurry textures.- Pre-rendered backgrounds while upscaled are very pixelated.- Would recommend playing on a TV or a Window for those that do not like pixels.Graphics note: While the game has a ""widescreen option"" I would highly recommend playing the game in its original 4:3 aspect ratio with your regular screen resolution, playing this game in widescreen will only stretch the image and make it look worse. Edit: The world map looking horrible is due to a glitch that reduces the textures to it's lowest quality when bringing up the menu, going into a battle or a town fixes this. I have also noticed a major FPS drop when summoning the GF Eden and going up against the final boss. My PC itself meets the requirements and should not be an issue.SoundThis game DOES NOT have the original PlayStation soundtrack and uses the original PC Midi mix which does not compare to the original PlayStation soundtrack, would HIGHLY recommend using third party mods to fix this as it is very easy to find and implement. Some original sounds are changed or missing but not a major distraction.Would I recommend this?Yes but with CAUTION! Soon after downloading the game I had to:- Install third party mods to make it closer to the PlayStation version.- Rebind controls in notepad which took time due to using number codes for each key and actions not being labeled correctly.- The game also minimizes when first launching, very annoying when playing on TV with Big Picture mode.I am enjoying playing Final Fantasy VIII on PC, but first time setup is a pain and should not be necessary.Edit: also Triple Triad is a good game.

												I bought FFVIII on PS1 when I was a kid, and I was very disappointed that it wasn't FFVII. Since 7 was my first FF, it was hard to let go. That said, I thought I would try it again, as an adult and see how I feel.It was still a little hard for me to get into, but once I did, I really liked it.Again the port feels a little sloppy, as per usual, but there are no deal breakers here for me, and I am a fan.

												I don't normally leave reviews, but I feel that I need to try and readress the balance slightly with FFVIII as it seems to be getting quite negative feedback. Most of the bad reviews seem to focus on one issue, that being the MIDI sountrack. Having being a huge fan of the game since it was released in 1999, in fact it's one of my favourite all-time games, I can honestly say that the soundtrack issue really isn't an issue at all. It takes a little getting used to, but after an hour or so of play I hardly noticed the difference at all and it takes nothing whatsoever away from the gameplay. I really don't see what the fuss is about. It's a good port of a great game.			"

												A poor port but the game still is worth it.Reasons to buy:1) Achievements. Especially ""contrived finish"" which just makes you play the game in a totally different way. Such cool! WOW! But I guess some people can't be bothered with trophies.2) The Hi Speed (F1) option. Makes traveling back and forth a lot less tedious. I love it.3) Nostalgia. Yes, the game is as good as you remember.Reasons not to:1) The port is TERRIBLE. Espcially for music. Don't despair! Mods make up for it. I only grabbed the Music Replacement mod (Roses&Wine) and the mood was set, but if you want, there's a lot of graphics enhancers/texture replacement and whatnot. They make it equal or better than PS1 version. And Achievements still work!2) Buttons are very hard to set and remember on a controller (""enter code: B4 B2 B3 B4"" yaaaay). Still, it only bothered me on the Train mission and in the battle of the two Gardens, so not too bad.			"

												Okay, first off, I'm a fan of this game.If you read the other negative reviews, you'll see there are tons of bugs SE didn't fix. They are releasing FF9 this year, and FF8 is still trash. I feel like they just made an awful port and they made us pay for quality when my PS1 could do better. Unless SE fixes the issues, I'm heavily discouraging you and my friends to avoid this version of the game. It's frustrating in so many ways!- You can't use Zell's LB, even with an XBOX 360 controller, it shows B1, B2, B3...- Music is awful and requires mods- Graphics are worse than the ones on the PS1- Only cross directions, forget about the joystick- You can use Chocobo World, which is something you didn't have on the PS1 (most of us)			"

												Nice story and character moments, and the visuals hold up surprisingly well. Aside from modding potential, this release has 2 specific advantages to simply emulating the original, getting in on PSN, etc.1) Hi-speed mode. This is like unlocking the FPS limit on an emulator, but the music doesn't get warped. Since you will spend a lot of time either in the field or an unskippable cutscene, this could save you multiple hours in a single playthrough. Also, during certain timed segments the timer will not be sped up - this is kinda cheating, but arguably justified since you're dealing with some annoyingly long battle animations. I think you can use this hotkey (F1), avoid the rest (F2-F5, which are unquestionably cheating) and still feel like you are playing legitimately.2) Magic Booster. This is a built-in hack that gives you 100 copies of every spell in your inventory, for each character. But it does not give you spells you don't have. This is definitely cheating, but if you've played the game before, you might see this cheat as acceptable compared to max Gil/damage/etc... you can easily farm 100 copies of most spells, but it is very time-consuming.That said, this game has some design issues regardless of what platform you're on. The Junction system is kinda broken, and the game ends up becoming very easy once you've obtained enough spells (which takes time and/or effort, but not skill). For me, one particular character could completely demolish every boss with little to no strategy involved. It's not awful, but it's not great either, which is why I think stuff like the magic booster isn't a big deal. Overall, this is one you'll enjoy for the story over the gameplay.			"

												In my opinion this is one of the best Final Fantasy not even because of the graphics. It tired so many new things and some weren't great but others were killer. I hate having to worry about MP and the DRAW system was so much better and you couldn't just learn no spells you have to find and farm. The GF's them self's some were new some were Classic ones but now they were like party members with there own sets of skills and abilities and HP plus now you could use magic thought GF's(summons) to bust your stats. The story was fantasy/Sci-fi and a good blend the romance never shadowed the action and vise versa  all the Characters have there own personalities and you never feel like there reused. Each Character had there own weapon and no one weapon is reused by playable characters. The gun blade is the only exception but a foe is the one who has one. Its the first one I can remember that has Mini-game built it and its fun,simple and addicting to play. The only down side to this Final Fantasy is that its Chocobo mini-game/catching system was hard to understand and use.			"

												A lot of people complain about the midi files of this game. While that is true, roses and wine can fix all the music problems within 5 minutes. Personally, this is my favorite FF of the series, and I've probably logged in over 400 hours on the playstaion verison alone (and yes, I own a pocketstation as well). A lot of people have also complained about the FMVs but they never really bothered me either. Actually, I think it's exciting being able to do mods in this game, which is why I say that if you're interested in modding a game which was one of your most favorite childhood memories, then I'd definitely recommend you to buy it. I'm having a lot of fun with the pc version honestly.			"

I loved all of VII, VIII, IX, X, XII and XIII coming soon XV. I just related to the world, which was more futuristic than fantasy, more than the others. The Draw system had it’s issues and although it doesn’t hold a candle to the Materia system in 7, the way you could bind spells to your stats was genius. Triple Triad was also very cool card game. And my order of liking those differs from most, though I hold VII most dear like most others too "

												Final Fantasy VIII is one of my favorite entries in the series. And it holds up incredibly well for a game released in 1999. Visuals don't look that great on modern HD screens, but everything else is as good as it was in the original release.Characters are involving and exciting, and they all take part in a mature and complex storyline to stop a sorceress from the future from compressing time. But they are not base archetypes or generic ""heroes"" found in many games.The main protagonist is Squall Leonheart, a recently graduated member of SeeD, an elite mercenary force. He starts as an introverted, grumpy and cold teenager who pushes away those who would otherwise be considered his friends and doesn't seem to really care about anything or anyone else but himself. You'll probably hate his guts until halfway through the game when you find out why he is the way he is. Squall begins to change when he falls in love with Rinoa Heartilly, a cheerful member of a resistance group from Timber, and also Squall's employer on his first mission as a graduated SeeD. As you progress through the game, you see Squall rethink his choices in life and accept the support and friendship of his comrades which in turn makes him step up into his role as a leader - something he never asked for.You travel all around the world in your journey, and the locations you visit range from the the peaceful harbour city of Balamb to the busy capital of the Galbadian empire. You ride trains and drive a Garden, you take part in an elaborate assassination plot during a parade. Hell, you even go to space! Sadly you don't have access to a submarine this time around, but the Ragnarok makes up for it pretty well - it's probably the coolest airship of the series!Character customization is done through Junctions - you basically join a Guardian Force (summons in previous games) with one of your characters to have access to specific abilities and in-battle commands. Junctioning different GFs allow you to build your characters with the right skills to face each battle, and it becomes something crucial to master if you're gonna kill the Weapons.Wrapping it all up, these are the pros of this Steam re-release:- Lots of challenging achievements- Chocobo World minigame included!And the cons:- Lower quality music compared to the original PlayStation release- Bad controller support - buttons are displayed as B1-B12 and you can't map anything to D-Pad or triggers (X360 controller)			"

												Let me just get this out of the way, this game is fantastic. In fact I rate it higher than that other Final Fantasy that seems to get more attention. Maybe you agree with me or maybe you disagree but let me at least give you a couple of reasons that you shouldn't shy away from this gem. This game is unique and it is that same uniqueness that makes this game shine. Forget all the bad stuff people say about this game. Lets instead focus on the good that this game does.	Final Fantasy 8 did some wonderful things that no other FF title did. One of the most basic of JRPG principles, grinding battles. Well in short you don't need to really fight anything. I mean you can level up your charactors but there really isn't any real incentive to do it. For starters you are a student and you take a test early in the game. This test determines you pay or salary. Plus if you don't do so hot on the test you don't get a high salary. You can retake the test to do better and get paid more as well. So no need to really grind mobs for money as you get paid at regular intervals just like a job. I believe this is a plus as it allows for me to explore the world and without the need to stop and fight over and over. Also note, that bosses do not give out EXP at all. So theoretically, you could go thru the game at the starting level if you really wanted to.	So lets talk about the leveling system in the game, another plus to FF8's formula. The game uses a scaling system, which means the higher level you are the mobs scale to always give a challange of sorts. Which in every other game is a bad. I truely despise level scaling. It defeats the purpose of leveling to get stronger but this game bring a happy medium to play. FF8 intruduces the ""Junction System"". This entails a few things. One you ""draw"" magic from a couple of places. You can also ""draw"" from special points that refresh every so often to aquire more. You can ""draw"" from mobs as well. Now you can use these spells in battle which is fine, but let me say this game isn't really about magic as the other Final Fantasys. If there was a ""grind"" in the game its from drawing magic to aquire enough of it. So what is the point of magic if you don't really want to use them against mobs? Well as I was saying earlier, FF8 uses a ""Junction System"". This allows you to ""Junction"" magic to your main attributes. Your Hp, Mp, Att, etc. Doing this augments your abilites and makes you pretty damn strong. This is also how you overcome the level scaling to make your character stronger. You can level up but remember, mobs scale with you so this allows you to overcome this ""handicap"". If there is a ""grind"" in FF8, this is it. Which if you ask me, its far better ""drawing"" for magic than spending more time to grind for EXP for hours on end. I also told you that you could beat the game at the starting level. Which sounds bad but honestly beating the game at a lower level is way easier than a high level. Using the Final Battle as a reference, without spoiling, beating it at a low level was hard but certianly not difficult. But i will say beating it at max level was one of the most challenging battles I have ever done in a game before. It took me close to 2 hours to beat that battle. With the active battle and max level I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. Note that it took me many of times to even succeed in doing this. It was simply a rewarding feat to acomplish. I can also atest to this being the hardest boss I have fought from any of the other Final Fantasy titles.	Some tweaks have been done to the actual battle system. The main charactor uses a weapon called a gunblade. In battle you can attack like you normally would with no problems. But it has another feature that allows for it to do more damage. If you press a certain button at the precise time, you will pull the trigger and shoot as you attack. This effectively adds more damage to your normal attack. It uses a turn base battle system that is active, which means you have to think fast on your feet. No planning your attack like chess for the best move, you have to be quick and do something or just keep getting attacked over and over. Some might see that as a turn off which I can understand just be aware its there. Summons are back in this game as well. They will be mighty helpful. They also learn abilites as well. Most noteworthy is the ""boost"" ablity. This allows you to push a button repeatedly to amplifiy the damage done. Its a nice to be able to do that but after the bazillionth time it will get old. Still to this day I would have like to have a final ablitiy to just do max damage without that button mashing marathon. Also the animations for the summons are top notch for its time. Truely amazing but some are really long and overdone, would have been nice to be able to skip them. Annoying yes, dealbreaker no.	  	Probaly the most agreeable positive about FF8 is its included ""card game"". Triple Traid is its name and it is crazy fun that I am suprised was never given its own game. It sorta starts out slow but as you collect more cards you really start being sucked into it grasp. I personally have logged into FF8 just to play the card game and nothing else. So simple, but yet so much depth and strategy. Traveling to new areas brings about new rules to the game. Some of these rules are good and some downright brutal. Also there are ""rare"" cards to win from certain people. Some you might only have one chance to aquire so maybe using a guide isn't a bad idea in this area.	To talk about the story would ruin alot of it. I won't mention it but I'll hit on a few high points. I kinda throws you right into the middle of everything and you'll feel like you understand what's going on. Then you'll go from knowing what going on to not having the slighest clue. That formula happens multiple times in this game. But each time it happens the story gets deeper and more seems to be happening. It gets dangerously close to being to long. When I first played this on the Playstation 1, I was  wondering what was on disk 4 for the longest time. Even when I was at the end of disk 3 I felt like I had done so much I couldn't believe there was still a whole other disk to run though. Although in hindsight, disk 4 felt almost out of place and to this day I still believe it was only that way because the amount of data on a cd-rom wasn't enough to do it the way it should have been. I works but only like hitting a foul ball 1 foot away from being a home run. 	Other worthy mentions are the locations. The cities are big and give a feeling of being alive. The music sets a nice tone to the atmosphere. Still some of my favorite music in the series, not that any really stand out but they fit the games vibe. They are rendered backgrounds but still beautiful to look at. Throughout the world you can use roads to navigate around. You also gain access to cars to drive around the overworld. These greatly help speed up travel times. There are a few other ways of travel but I don't want to spoil any crazy details. Although I will say the ""airship"" in this game is the freaking best of all the FF games. 	What else is there in FF8? Quite a bit more if you ask me. For one it feels more like a world than past Final Fantasy titles. Or maybe I should say a little more grown up. This game as a whole seems more mature. But its overall experiance that makes it shine. The story goes up and down. There are high points and low points. But you are doing yourself a disservice if you pass on this up. Final Fantasy 8 knows its not like the rest of the series and its proud of that fact. If you give it a chance, you might be pleastantly surprised that you wished played it sooner.			"

I bought this game knowing well about all of the petty and -completely stupid- warnings about ""Oh no the music quality is garbage"" and ""Oh no there's nothing different or special"" and the most infamous ""Oh no this game is so terrible because the magic system is different.""I bought this game as is with full understanding that it was going to at least be a smoother looking game with a couple of nice extras. I bought this game to play the game I remember as it stood. So please, shut the f*** up. Stop complaining about having to mod it to make it ""better."" Don't mod it, or don't play it. sit down, spend a few bucks and enjoy a game that obviously meant a lot to an entire generation of gamers. If I want high quality sound and non-pre-rendered backgrounds I'll go buy a brand new game that has a much worse story line, no replay value, is way over priced, horribly buggy and is barely worth the price that humblebundle -LETS- you choose to pay for it! This isn't some big time piece of corn lined golden sh**. This is nostalgia. This is a classic Playstation game. Deal with it or go have raging sex with a lion you ♥♥♥♥♥.			"

A lot of people have also complained about the FMVs but they never really bothered me either. Actually, I think it's exciting being able to do mods in this game, which is why I say that if you're interested in modding a game which was one of your most favorite childhood memories, then I'd definitely recommend you to buy it. I'm having a lot of fun with the pc version honestly.			"

												My favorite Final Fantasy, this one is gorgeous to play, in fights as during the story.Characters are awesome to play and builds can make you go crazy on it.In this game, if you know how to farm and how to bind magics, you rolling on pretty much everything exept Minautor, but even so, fights are not boring at all, you juste like to play it !!I recommend this game to every rpg fan or FF fan of course.

												The gameplay is pretty good. To make your characters stronger you use a junction system where you will equip magic to your stats. Drawing magic from monsters can take quite a bit of time, but you can use your GF (Guardian Force) to create spells out of items from your inventory. And then there is the awful card game that I never play.... Disc 3 is my favorite part of the game because that is when you can travel through the entire world, finding all the GF's and by far the best time to level up your characters.The story is horrible. After disc 1 the whole thing falls apart. Luckily there are some fanmade theories that make more meaning into the story, such as the ""Squall is dead theory"" but as my brother says: ""I dont believe in that theory because I doubt they were capable of telling a decent story.""

												I always loved the way this game scaled to your level and rewarded you for understanding the draw and junction systems (you can truly be overpowered early on if you understand how to best use them) But beyond that I rather enjoyed the story itself and the way they framed more than one narrative via ""dreams"" through which the party experienced the history of other characters. Some dislike how easily the draw and junction system can be broken, but personally my view has always been if you do not want it broken... don't break it... and if you do then have at it. I found the game enjoyable doing runs of both those styles. Also of all the ""minigames"" Final Fantasy has given us over the years, Triple Triad is still my favorite... I honestly would have payed the price of this game just to play Triple Triad on my PC. So all in all I would definitely recomend this game to fans of the series, and doubly so to those who might have been on the fence because of angry opinions they may have heard... try it, if nothing else you will enjoy the card game.

												The only other game I enjoyed nearly as much as this as a kid was Xenogears. This game is the reason why i like video games. Getting lost in a world, getting to know interesting characters. hours upon hours of leveling up, exploring, fighting scary monsters and looking like a badass while doing it all. I could go on for hours about why i personally love this game, but i wont. If your up for spending time with a classic RPG worth it, then by all means do i reccomend this game to you. I could not be happier to dive back into the world of Final Fantasy 8. Though i am happy to be able to support the release of the game a fifth time. This version is not without it's flaws. This is not a port of the PSX version, but of the PC version, the visuals are a bit different and the Music is not nearly as good as the original Playstation version. If you have a Psp,Vita,Ps3, or even a Playstation you're better off getting the real Final Fantasy 8 experience there. Either way, I hope you enjoy the game.			"

												Fantastic game on par with Final Fantasy VII. The Final Fantasy series has been around since the dawn of the gamer age and many RPGs have been modeled after the success of this series. Final Fantasy VIII is no exception. It is to this day a masterpiece that  captures the imagination and brings one into an epic and unique universe.Pros: Great gameplay - The junction system allows for magic and summons to effect the stats your characters have depending on how strong and what type of magic is placed into which stat slot. There is an open world to explore, which can allow access to towns and secret locations. This feature was removed from Final Fantasy X onwards.Unique Story - When this game was on the Playstation 1 it was 4 discs long. The game starts off with a cut scene followed by putting you straight into the action where you must complete a trial to obtain your third (you gain the first 2 from the computer room) Guardian Force. The game does an excellent job at character development and allows you to literally read what the protagonist, Squall is thinking.Cons: Dated graphics: While its true this is an old game, the graphics are still respectable and wont burn your eye lids off looking at.No voice acting: You have to be ready to read a lot of text because theres no voice acting.Conclusion:Overall this game is a GEM and must have for anyone who enjoys Final Fantasy or classic RPG's.

												This game is a classic from the Final Fantasy franchise. It doesn't always get the attention it should, while being overshadowed by the FF7 and FFX, and so on. However it is one of the vastest FF games of its generation. Being a PS1 game, on 2 discs, it had some of the best (and sometimes laggy) cut scene vids, and it has enough side missions to keep you busy for many days on end. To have it on PC in a version that will hopefully not have the old bugs, and so far (in my early stages of playing the game) has the same great game play as the original release.I would fully recommend this game to anyone that enjoys RPGs, and especially to those old FF fans. And if you have steered away from this game because of the lack of public attention, I encourage you to check it out! It’s a classic.			"

												This game defined my childhood, it was also one of the only reasons i ever turned on my PS1. The soundtrack is probably the best of any game i've ever played, the gameplay was exactly what you'd expect of an FF game with a battle and junction system that is one of the best in the series but above all that the story is what makes this such a standout in the series, i haven't found many RPG's outside this era where i actually gave more than half a♥♥♥♥♥♥about the story or the plethora of poorly developed one dimensional characters that came with them. This version is kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ with the MIDI music. The DRM is not an issue as you just need register once for a SQE account and you can play offline, mod, cheat and generally do whatever you want afterwards. It also looks a hell of a lot better than the original PC (and PSX) release, the backgrounds obviously aren't improved but the character models, attack, GF and spell animations are all greatly improved by the increased resolution support.I played this when it was first relased on steam and at the time there weren't alot of mods available besides Roses&Wine which is a must for improving the audio but some of the mods that are available now make the game look a hell of a lot better and i'll definately be using them next time.

Also the undercurrent of perpetual civil unrest and war makes for a pretty unique atmosphere. Only a handful of issues with this version - The MIDI audio really grates on your ears. Also the controls (also the same with FFVII) are baffling, and may need some altering. Play with a controller if possible.			"

												Nostalgic... Recomended, but... Square was very lazy on this steam version: the keyboard comands, when customized, may cause some trouble to the player, since at many situations and moments, the game still considers the original config; example: the command to escape combat, the moment to insert the codes on the trains at Timber's first mission, and some others. The game clock is glitched: when playing card games, time runs faster and played time is inflated. And... like many people already said, the awful midi music... I am a master of old school games and I recomend this one... It's on my top 10 list.			"

												Great classic with a decent port for PC. Playing this on controller was fairly difficult though as all of the buttons are labeled as B1, B2, B3, etc. This is not my favorite Final Fantasy game, but it is still a great game worth playing if your a fan of the franchise.

Luckily this can be quickly fixed with a quick google search.With the inclusion of the Chocobo World feature, the game can be fully complete much to the satisfaction of Non-Japanese gamers.Remember to name your dog after female genitals for laughs.Also name Squall's necklace 'Buttseckz'			"

												If you love and have patience for classic games than buy this! I'd say it's worth a little less money though. When you run on the map it's pretty slow, as well as the field view movements are slow to respond to you're running path. If you know the Final Fantasy series you already know what to expect in respects to the repetitive, jarring music. I also think they should have made every graphic HD, but just the characters make do.			"

												A great game, although the final disc just falls apart and leaves a lot of questions. Drawing spells can be tedious, although rewarding. The card game is fun and rewarding, and arguably the most powerful part of the game - until some stupid rules get thrown in, but you can fix that easily. this comes with the Pocketstation addon, so most people who havent been able to experience it will be able to enjoy it. Aside from that, It's got music that took me time to love, but once I started listening to it I found its merit and maybe like it more than FF9's music. not quite up to FF7's but oh well.			"

												This game defined my childhood, it was also one of the only reasons i ever turned on my PS1. The soundtrack is probably the best of any game i've ever played, the gameplay was exactly what you'd expect of an FF game with a battle and junction system that is one of the best in the series but above all that the story is what makes this such a standout in the series, i haven't found many RPG's outside this era where i actually gave more than half a♥♥♥♥♥♥about the story or the plethora of poorly developed one dimensional characters that came with them. This version is kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ with the MIDI music. The DRM is not an issue as you just need register once for a SQE account and you can play offline, mod, cheat and generally do whatever you want afterwards. It also looks a hell of a lot better than the original PC (and PSX) release, the backgrounds obviously aren't improved but the character models, attack, GF and spell animations are all greatly improved by the increased resolution support.I played this when it was first relased on steam and at the time there weren't alot of mods available besides Roses&Wine which is a must for improving the audio but some of the mods that are available now make the game look a hell of a lot better and i'll definately be using them next time.

												This game is a classic from the Final Fantasy franchise. It doesn't always get the attention it should, while being overshadowed by the FF7 and FFX, and so on. However it is one of the vastest FF games of its generation. Being a PS1 game, on 2 discs, it had some of the best (and sometimes laggy) cut scene vids, and it has enough side missions to keep you busy for many days on end. To have it on PC in a version that will hopefully not have the old bugs, and so far (in my early stages of playing the game) has the same great game play as the original release.I would fully recommend this game to anyone that enjoys RPGs, and especially to those old FF fans. And if you have steered away from this game because of the lack of public attention, I encourage you to check it out! It’s a classic.			"

												Currently one of my favourite games since I played this game on Playstation 1. From the story to its battle system I like all of it. It this game, the most thing that you may notice that the battle system is completely different from the other final fantasy series which is fun for me. And just like the previous series the soundtrack is amazing and playing with such a good soundtrack always comfortable. The other element that keeps me playing this game is Triple Triad. Triple Triad is a card game in that makes you to collect monster and character card. You can acquire the card through battle with monsters or challenging other NPC and win a card game to get certain cards. Overall this game is VERY RECOMMENDED			"

It's stunningly beautiful, both in terms of visuals and the soundtrack. Yeah so maybe it shows its age a bit, but it is a classic and should be a major keystone to ANY RPG fans library.			"

												Nostalgic... Recomended, but... Square was very lazy on this steam version: the keyboard comands, when customized, may cause some trouble to the player, since at many situations and moments, the game still considers the original config; example: the command to escape combat, the moment to insert the codes on the trains at Timber's first mission, and some others. The game clock is glitched: when playing card games, time runs faster and played time is inflated. And... like many people already said, the awful midi music... I am a master of old school games and I recomend this one... It's on my top 10 list.			"

												Great classic with a decent port for PC. Playing this on controller was fairly difficult though as all of the buttons are labeled as B1, B2, B3, etc. This is not my favorite Final Fantasy game, but it is still a great game worth playing if your a fan of the franchise. It has great characters who develop over the course of the game and an excellent storyline. Personally I wasn't a fan of the magic drawing system for increasing character stats, but to each their own. It felt too grindy to me.TL;DR.

												Amazing game, full of original ideas for its time, epic story line with loads of side quests and hidden bosses. Between the story, the beautiful graphics, music score, and the insanely enthralling card game mini-game, Final Fantasy VIII does the series proud. This is the RPG that proves if you got a great story and solid characters it can still be a damn good game despite some glaring flaws. This is the best and most memorable game i have ever played, and everybody who loves RPG games will without doubt love this game. First laid eyes on this game on my 11th birthday, my dad got me a ps1 and this game. Grew up playing it. This was the game that would spark my love of gaming and the rpg genre. You probably think that you can't trust my review since I'll be blinded by nostalgia but I played this game again recently and loved it. Played, loved and obssessed on it as a child. Played, loved and obssessed on it as a manchild.It has a good mix of humor and seriousness, the combat system works well. This game is LONG, taking over 50 hours just to get to the middle of the game, if you haven't played the game before. Must buy.			"

Other than that im happy there is finaly a PC port. I reccomend playing it in a small window otherwise it looks stretched and poorly emulated.			"

												This game just brings back so many memories. I definitely appreciate it more now since I can understand the junction system a lot better as 23 year old than a 9 year old.The music is midi like, but it didn't bother me much as I have the official soundtrack just playing in the background. The story is actually more complex and developed than most Final Fantasies. (For example, I find the character of Squall enormously complex, and not...""emo"" as some people think. The guy is abandoned in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ orphanage by one of the only people he really cares about for Christ's sake. Half the time he's the only sane person in the game, he has to deal with so much stupidity). I thoroughly recommend this game, and am hoping for a HD release with fixed music or a sequel. It's that epic of a game.			"

												Final Fantasy VIII is a tale of sorceress wars, romance, and the ties of friendship that bring people together in the timeless tale of heroes vs villians. The characters are fun, different and the story is immersive, allowing you freedom to choose how you boost your stats and what abilities you can use with the unique Junction system. Recommended to all who love the Final Fantasy series, or for those who enjoy the JRPG genre :3. While the PC version's music leaves a lot to be desired, there is an easy fix found in the FFVIII Steam forums called Roses and Wine. A simple way to retrieve the beautiful Playstation version music fans remember and newbies will appreciate.			"

												The PC port of Final Fantasy VIII is rock solid. Though it's been weathered a bit by time, but almost eighteen years since it's release can more than forgive the fairly rough graphics which have been improved in the PC port. It may not seem like much, but for the sake of it I booted up my PS1 and did a side by side comparison, the port is polished. Nothing amazing, but enough to take the edge off. Otherwise though the art design of FF8 is still quite lovely and has that certain feel to it back when games had more of a showcase feel to them, showing off the developers ability to push the limits of the machines available. The battle system by todays standards feels slow and the draw system, depending on how you play the game, still leads to those rather odd ten minute battles when farming spells. Though the PC port, like some of the other Final Fantasy titles have had on PC are built in trainers for things like max magic, leveling and other options. Not my bag, but it seems to be for people who don't have an immense amount of time to put into gaming. But ifyou're familiar with the typical J-RPG game, this won't be anything new, if anything possibly nostalgic.Like other Final Fantasy games, there is plenty of late game secrets littered throughout, some of which are extremely difficult to accomplish and others can be missed entirely depending on some of the most inane decisions you would've made twenty hours beforehand. I suppose that is one of the charms of FF8, some of it's nuanced action and consequence bits. Nothing that effects story at all, but unique dialogue, ultimate items and challenges that would otherwise be hidden. I will note however (spoilers free) the end game area of FF8 is an absolute nightmare for the uninitiated. But I won't say much more about that.As for the junction system, the unique gimmick of FF8, allows you to equip guardian forces, AKA GF's or summons and ""junction"" different types of magic to your abilities to improve everything from health, attack, elemental attack/defence and status effects. I will note that this system can cause you to become vastly overpowered early on in the game, making much of the game something of a cake walk. I will note, all enemies in the game scale to your level. There's even an achievement to finish the game with one of the main characters as his starting level if you can believe that.And the story. It's confusing to say the least and ignores just about any and all ideas of how time travel and dimensions work and runs blissfully through a field spewing a story of love, rebellion, loyalty and an evil beings overly complicated plan to rule everything. I will note, most of the characters never feel fleshed out and come across as bland, serving only a few key plot purposes and become nothing more than an extra character who fits in because whomever wrote the story was struck in the head with an encyclopedia containing nothing but deus ex machinas. It's not a terrible story, but it's full of enough plot holes you may mistake it for moldy swiss cheese from a distance.All in all, Final Fantasy VIII is a fun game with a confusing story with a few memorable characters but plenty of memorable events. If you like a decent J/RPG you'll have fun with this classic, though it may take either numerous plays or the Final Fanasy Wiki to fully understand the rather odd story and plot. But as said, I'll bet you'll have some fun.			"

This game, although not perfect or even near-perfect, is definitely great.It is definitely a solid 8 out of 10.Also, it has one of the best mini-games I have ever seen; Triple Triad. Sure it may be a lengthy sidequest with multiple changing rules and some other major problems, but Final Fantasy VIII is the oldest game I can think of that has its own internal trading card game. Furthermore, Triple Triad, despite its flaws, is not only fun, but also can be used to gain benefits for when playing the main game such as usable items. Some of the items you can gain this way are quite rare, so it can be rewarding.			"

												Final Fantasy VIII in my opinion is one of the most overlooked in the series. It had a intriguing story and cast of characters that was unlike others before it. It also has the distinction of having one of the most interesting and perhaps outlandish weapons ever created, the gunblade. Final Fantasy VIII on steam shows its age but the gameplay mechanics still remain compelling. As with other traditional FF games, the game features a turn based battle system. A few notable differences however is the junction and draw systems. By junctioning a GF (Guardian Force) You can summon a powerful entity like Ifrit, or Shiva or cast magic. The draw system allows you to 'draw' magic from enemies, etc. to store on a character. You play as Squall a cadet of the Balamb Garden military academy. During the course of the story you will meet a varied cast of characters as you experience the growing conflict between Balamb and Galbadia. The PC version of FFVIII is largely the same as the PS1 classic. However it does have a few little bells and whistles. FFVIII on Steam has some graphical updates which cleaned some things up. The downside is that the touchup makes some flaws more apparent. In the skyboxes, and the world map you can see noticeable seams or grid lines. Its not a game breaking issue but serves as a perfect example that making a older game look pretty is not as straightforward as one might think. If you haven't played this game or are looking to revisit it; the Steam version is a great way of doing just that.			"

												FFVIII was the first Final Fantasy game I ever played when it originally came out on the Playstation v1.  I loved the plot and the game as a whole.  The concept of SeeD (essentially mercenaries) and the Gardens (their Command Centers) was very interesting to me, as was their hidden/seemingly-lost origins.Gameplay/Combat: The world is fairly free-roaming and open, which is really nice and a particular favorite of mine. I loathe games where you can't have the freedom to move about as you wish.  This makes it very nice to grind and earn your money/EXP.I really liked the combat system being a sort of real-time and turn-based system. Random load/ready times to take action for each participant, but you can change attackers (as most RPG's allow) or do nothing while the enemy team still takes action. It's also interesting that you have to draw all potential magic from a source other than one's self - Either Monsters or Draw Points, making magic a fairly limited item since you can't be sure of what you get except in battle where you can seemingly just keep drawing it from enemies as long as you're willing to take damage to do so.Using magic to enhance the attributes they're assigned to is also a really interesting idea and can help make/break some combat situations.Individual limit breaks, or each character's special skill/ability, was almost completely useless to me, personally.  I got Squall's to work any time I wanted, but the rest were hit and miss, usually miss. Dunno if it was my timing or what.Interface/Graphics:The interface wasn't bad, but bland and static.  For the time the game came out, the graphics weren't horrible, but they weren't great, either, and could have been enhanced.  The budget just didn't seem to be there for it.  When I compare this to games that came out about the same time (""Legend of Legaia"", ""Star Ocean: The Second Story"",) I'm disappointed, though Star Ocean was very similar.Plot:The protagonist of the story, Squall Lionheart, irked me as a character.  I didn't really like him.  He's a cynical, emo brat and we're given no indication as to why that is or his history at all.  He just assumes everyone looks at for themselves and is a non-responsive♥♥♥♥♥the majority of the time.  Music: Pretty good.  There's a fair amount of music and it's pretty nice most of the time and fits the situations.There is no voice acting at all and, other than one song, no voice work of any sort.Pretty good if you wanna go old school for a bit, but more for the RPG element than true enjoyment of the story.

												At first, I didn't like it very much, since the steam version has a midi soundtrack that is far worse compared to the psx original. It was kind of tedious at the beginning, and it took me a while to understand how junctions worked. However, when I got past that, and reached Disc 2, oh boy I couldn't stop playing. This game may not be the best Final Fantasy, but it is pretty good, and one of my favourites from the Final Fantasy series. I just wish Square made the leveling system easier to understand, and polished the story before releasing it, since I believe it could be improved in many aspects.If you want to play this game, though, I recommend you to look for the original psx one, and try avoiding the steam version. You won't miss much, but the music makes a lot of difference.			"

												Um jogo clássico que, como vários outros jogos clássicos, demorei pra jogar. Apesar de ainda não ter completado duvido muito que algo me faça mudar de opinião quanto a esse jogo que pra mim é um dos mais bem feitos e que tem uma jogabilidade viciante. Um ponto fortíssimo pra mim é o desenvolvimento dos personagens e a história magnifíca e encantadora.			"

												Final Fantasy VIII was my first ps1 final fantasy game I played on my PS3 version. I swear I put dozens of hours into this game because it is amazing. I even bought it again on Steam to show how much I appreciate this game.However, this version has some problems. The overworld looks like garbage, the remastered soundtrack is terrible, and the player is required to sign up for a Square Enix account to play the game, which means, if you don't have internet access, you can't play the game.I strongly recommend playing this version with mods, especially the ones made by Tonberry.Overall, I give it an 8/10.

												ff8 is one of the best love storys to ever exist i've been playing final fantasy sense i was about 5 or 6 years old and i still love the game till this day ff7 and ff8 are my favorites one the psx console and then iqould go x or 12 for the ps2 then its 13 i have yet to touch the rest of the 13 series or the 14 relms reborn and i am currentaly waiting for the newest enstallment which would be final fantasy 15 which becomes and open world and fre for all combat gameplay and you cant beat that its kingdom hearts meets final fantasy meets great graphics and for the soild fans that are not young and still trying to understand by playing(kingdom heats) which was and excellent game in my honest opinion i cant wait for the new one to be realeasd on the ps4 but that is beside the point if you are looking for a soild romantic rpg ff8 is the way to go in my honest opinion i would recommend this to anyone who has played any installment in the final fantasy series or is intrested in begging into the world of final fantasy 8 is a good way to get you're self familar and learn to love the game the combat system is one of the most unique compared to 12-13 it is one of the only draw based magic systems in any of the games and some people find that as a turn off but i feel that it makes the game better it requires les grind if you are willing to just draw magic instead of grinding levels if you were to draw the best magic you possibly could you would never have to level at all in the game and you could just beat it at the inital level that you start at (7) with squall for a steam achivement this combat system its honestly one of the best i have seen in the entire final fantasu serious it make you actually work to finish the game unlike ff7 ot sooner ffx was great as well because of the leveling and skilling progression that you had to make sure you worked for and they took it from ff8 and advanced it to a point that they thought it would be better and they actually made it more tidious then it needs to be but i still enjoy the game as i would 7-8-x-x-2 on my psx or ps2 memory card you cannot beat a retro game no matter how hard it is put down			"

If you are a Final Fantasy fan (or any rpg in general), this is an absolute must. The PC port runs great, and has a few extra features like the magic booster for those who aren't worried about the challenge. I highly recommend playing it without the extras on your first playthrough. Seriously, go get this game.9/10			"

												My favorite Final Fantasy within IX. The port is pretty decent, better than the PC version we have more than a decade ago. I've played this game since the Japanese release and beating it several times a while I was a kid that's why I like it a lot. Nowadays I started this Steam version 16 years after and of course is way simpler even than other entries of its days. But I love the art style the story, the music, characters and in general the atmosphere of this game. This is great version.The only bad thing about the port is the lack of normal button prompts. Xbox ones or  something else. For instance in the train mission you'll have a few little issues acknowledging which button you need to press but nothing terrible. Long story short...buy this game <3 ;) "

												What is there to say about Final Fantasy VIII? It is a ""port"" of the PC version that has been updated models, repackaged and released for €15. Not a HD Re-Release...Just a bog standard Re-Release.If you played it on the Playstation 1 or the original PC version, it's the same game.It's a good game, it is better than VII in my opinion and if you want to sink a good few hours into a JRPG, then you are going to have a good time with FFVIII.

All the nostalgia of a love-story based FFVIII made me excited to be able to play this game once again. The enhanced graphics makes the experience on PC much better than the original PS2 version. The only downside of this is the music, which sounds like MIDI files, but still, in my mind, all the music sounds like scores from a live orchestra. It doesn't matter the flaws, since my imagination is still like a child - much like using your imagination while playing old Atari 2600 games when pixelated games didn't mean the game sucked.			"

If you did indeed buy it for the music, you're as well buying the album or just listening to it on YouTube.

Short version: 90%Final Fantasy VIII was the point where the series reached a whole new level, thanks to small changes like the focus on the romantic story elements and the more realistic character design. The Steam edition includes a few additional features over the old PC release, making it one of the best ports of the game so far, recommended for old fans or newcomers who would like to experience one of the gems of the golden age of Final Fantasy.Long version:Final Fantasy VIII was sort of a trailblazer when it came out. This was the first Final Fantasy game where we said goodbye to the traditional NES/SNES era cartoonish characters in favour of a more realistic design, and where the romance plot-- which is normally a secondary or tertiary storyline in similar games-- is promoted to be in the focus.This won’t turn FFVIII into a romance/dating game, far from it: your main task is still to save the world/universe from the ridiculous-haired main villain. To do so you’ll have to gather friends and allies, explore much of the planet, and of course slowly discover a rich backstory told in two separate timelines, which will eventually (with a little guess work) uncover one of the most confusing, yet best-written stories of the genre.Gameplay-wise FFVIII is a bit of an odd one out in the series with the large amount of gameplay changes it features. Although a lot could be said about these, the length of a Steam review simply cannot hold this much information, so let’s just say that some of them, like the expanded Limit Breaks, are favourably looked upon and work well; while others, like the junction system, were met with great opposition and never returned in later games. The Steam version can be considered a well enough port of the original PlayStation release, with a bunch of really nice technical features, including better display compatibility and more user-friendly controlling. Sadly, like the Steam version of Final Fantasy VII, it features a subpar version of the original PSX music tracks, the same ones that were used in the original PC version.Overall, the Steam Edition is Final Fantasy VIII may not be the HD remake lot of people still want, but it is a good port of an excellent game, well worth of owning and playing, even if you have the original PSX disc somewhere.

												I Really like the FF series and this is one of my favorite titles, i already have the older pc version on 5 disks but i wanted to have the game easely accassable in my steam library so i just bought it again. However, i can not reccomend buying this version since it has double DRM. i.e. you need to make a special Sqare Enix account in order to play this despite the game not having any online content what so ever, also doesn't work in offline mode.Why you some game developers punish their costumers who actually buy their games?i have half a mind to go through the trouble of cracking a game i have bought legally. how ****ed is that?

												Fantastic game. Have been waiting for this for a while, and it really does not let you downfeatures - high resolution modes - origional or new graphics - native controller support - a ""Magic Booster"" mode for new players.The game launches fine and handles well on Windows 7 x64, no crashes yet. And not having to download an OpenGl hotfix to run 1920x1080x32 is a nice feature. I haven't tried the new graphics mode yet (because I'm a purist!) but I'm sure they inclide higher-res textures and some neat particle effects. There are a couple rather small things I'm sure will be fixed in the new futureStrangely enough, and even with controller support, the game will not recognize the D-pad on my controller, so I still have to use a pinnical profile to use the D-pad (which feels natural for this game). Even weirder (and kind of annoyingly) there is NO controller support for out-of-game menus, like the startup menu, or the pre-game start menu so you're forced to use the keyboard. I've looked around myself and can't find a hotfix.other than that, the game runs well and is fantastic. Definitely recommend!			"

												People who have been rating this down because of the music don't care about the game. As a matter of fact, if they're letting some sub-standard music get in the way of the game, they probably don't even like the game to begin with and should be disregarded entirely.First of all: the music isn't that bad. It's not bad at all, in fact, and certainly not enough to make people NOT reccomend the game. It has a retro feel to it, which, for any other game, people would be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ing over because #RETROISAWESOMELOL.Second of all: yes, there is a second layer of DRM. Squeenix's login thing. I haven't had issues with my internet in long enough to accurately remember whether or not you actually NEED a constant stable connection, but I seem to recall that with FF7, you could play offline just fine as long as you had an account, which isn't difficult to create (and fake, if you so desire).The game itself remains one of Final Fantasy's most underrated titles. People ♥♥♥♥♥ed about the need to ""grind"" magic for the ""unintuitive"" junction system, but how is it any worse than grinding hundreds of millions of XP in any other title? I find the Junction system is laid out very simply and is easy-to-use. But then, I have at least two functioning brain cells to fire neural impulses between, so it wouldn't have taken me much effort to figure out even if I didn't understand it at first.The characters are deep and relatable, to an extent (I mean, how well can you actually relate to a bunch of teenagers who were riased to be elite mercenaries during their childhood). The story is engaging, if somewhat generic, but they genuinely tried to mix it up. The love interest plot developes naturally, though it gets somewhat rushed at one point late in the game when Female Love Interest (tm) goes into a coma and Male Love Interest (tm) who had previously been pushing her away constantly suddenly and abruptly realizes how much he needs her. Overall, it's a very good game. I look forward to when Squeenix releases FF9 for the PC *coughcough*hinthint*cough*getonityoulosers*cough*.			"

												My personal favorite of all  Final Fantasy  franchises. Played this in 1999 with my brother when I was around 7! If you never played this game, you wouldn't believe how rich the story was, and how wide the range of the conflicts really are. Game is set in the future, but somehow post-apocalyptic after what happened in Centra around 4000 years ago, a Lunar Cry, where in current time people rebuild Centra into what is called a Garden. Relationships in this game are two of the most contributing factors, while others include politics, war, sorcery, and just massive destructions.The game's background arts look ethereally.. poetic. It is just simply stunning. They're all 3D environment, just rendered into 2D and made it into a background where the 3D low-poly (characters) move accross the 3D space that have been motion-tracked to the background. The designs are mostly steampunk (architectural elements of Greek and French) combined with futuristic elements (try to observe the 3D models, colors, sounds, and advanced technology in the game).  Best battle system of all time. Indescribably cool. Junctioning GFs and Magic, draw, limit breaks, elements, statuses, real-time turnbased, weapon forging, student exams, and tons of other stuff. Just get the game and play it. And play its card-game, it's fun as hell.			"

												I love this FF, I probably got over 9000 hours played across dozens of playthroughs... but this is such a low effort port cash-in I really can't recommend it.Every single time you launch the game it pops up a keyboard controls box despite the fact that you're playing with a controller, so you have to press X on the keyboard to close it just to be able to use the controller to play. Then the resolution, despite having it set to 1920x1080 @ 144hz in the launcher, it runs in 4:3 aspect ratio with black side bars @ 30fps while roaming around the world and only 15.5fps during battles. How can it possibly get any worse you ask? With HIDEOUSLY pixelated 2D backgrounds and choppy♥♥♥♥♥looking 3D environment where you actually see the polygons sticking out, that's how.Whatever.../10			"

												This is the game I know and love. This was one of the first games I bought with my newlywed wife, and the kids and I would spend hours on it. The PS1 along with the Nintendo 64, we have fond memories. The graphics at the time were amazing - and I was dumbfounded by the ""high-res"" cutscenes that are commonplace in games today in actual gameplay - and in fact would be considered low-quality. Putting that aside, the nostalgia alone was something for me not to pass up. If you want a cutting edge game, this is not for you. If you played this before, this is a fantastic port, and be forewarned, this is not using the widescreen 10,000,000p goodness.			"

By the time I was done messing about to get it to a playable state, it still looked and sounded worse than my original disks emulated and modded.

												Truly the best Final Fantasy. 7 was great, but my opinion changed after horrible additions to the story, prequels and movies and such: Cloud never changes and stays mopey. 9 was just horrible, the protagonist being a cross between David Bowie, Meg Ryan and a monkey. With FF8, you have a somewhat unlikeable punk kid protagonist that, through the 4 discs of the game, developes and starts becoming a man.FF8 had the least amount of plot twists I feel. You have the main goal through most of the game: Kill the Sorceress! 8 has an awesome love story, a very likeable cast of characters, and amazing graphics for its time. I still get goosebumps watching the intro scene.There's some definite flaws with this port, but this will probably always be my favorite of the series and my favorite childhood game as well. I read a review earlier recommending this to younger audiences, couldn't agree more. Let this game be etched in your memory from an early age, this is a true classic			"

The character models are mildly betterCons: The backgrounds are very pixelated, they definitely need reworked so they don't look terrible at 1080p. You have to have an account with sqeenix to run it. The music is the original music that came with the first pc version, what that means is that it sounds terrible. I could put up with the sqeenix account and the backgrounds just so I didn't have to use an emualtor but the muic quality is unforgivable, if it gets patched then this review would actually be positive.

												The music is garbage. I immediately exited the game at the menu. No excuse for the attrocious music which is in midi form. The PS1 original game sounds far better. For $12 the least they could have done is what some intrepid modders have done in their spare time and release the game with proper music. I would rather play with un-improved graphics and the same music than play with these horrendous midis. Luckily there's a mod that fixes it, but I don't know if it works and it's beside the point:I made a mistake and gave them my money. Don't make my mistake. This is a rush job cash-in port.

												The game is good but unfortunately not that great, at least for this PC version. Back when I first played Final Fantasy VIII at PSX,  the quality of detail in graphic and sound was higher than this version. I think Square Enix needs to work out a patch to polished it in terms of quality, like the sound patch they released for Final Fantasy VII Steam. Only thing that keeps me playing Final Fantasy VIII is the gameplay, and it's addictive. But until Square Enix release at least sound patch, I won't recomment this game.			"

												Final Fantasy VIII is a great game for first time FF players. It has a great plot line and many puzzles. As it is quite old, it uses low quality textures and models that look horrible on today's hardware, and unfortunately they decided to use a smaller soundfont for the music in this Steam release (although this can be replaced by better ones that can mimic the PSOne soundtrack pretty easily).It would be great to see a full 3D remake of this game that works accross Windows, Linux and OS X in the future, but for now, running this in Wine seems to work ok :)			"

I don't recommend this half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥port.UPDATE:  2014/06/11Square still hasn't changed the music.  While I understand that porting the PC version was the most effective method of putting the game on Steam, the midi is horrifyingly bad for anybody who's had the pleasure of hearing Uematsu's original PS1 music.  This isn't my favorite Final Fantasy game, but the music is better than most games with original compositions.  Overall, this is a very hardcore JRPG:  there's a lot to micro-manage, there are important items and buffs that you can permanently miss, the characters are very derivative of an Anime style, and the story is all over the place confusing.  If you're a fan of RPGs in general, you need to play this and if you're a fan of JRPGs specifically, then you may have already played this.  I recommend waiting until they have the original music since the midi is plain awful. Original Post:  2014/03/25:Music is absolutely atrocious.The PSX game music isn't here, it could EASILY be fixed.  Not worth it until this midi garbage is gone.			"

												I don't recommend this because of the game itself. You are better off with the original since the controller works perfectly or an emulator (epsxe) since you can smooth the textures. All they did was upgrade the videos. That's it. It tries to sync with Enix servers and fails for no reason. It was advertised that I could speedup the game. I'm not seeing that. I used a USB to PS1/2 adapter and after setting the keys, it isn't responding to the buttons. You cannot map all keys on your keyboard either. Only characters and numbers, not punctuation (comma, semicolon, slash) or space, tab, alt, enter. If you enter the game and switch to default, you will not know how to exit the game unless you know the default keys. I've bought most FF games on the original console and I recommend playing them on an emulator or the original console, not this, not here. Don't buy this.			"

												Not a remake but a simple port... but it is the one FF that should be remade. Not because it was great... just because it's so crappy that it's in deep need and hidden somewhere under the battles that take forever and game play that's complicated(not in a good way) there's probably a salvagable game. The pre-rendered background graphics really show their age in this port. they seriously couldn't have 2xSaI'ed them, really? . The junctioning system was crap when it came out on the PSX.. it's why they bothered to add a save-game mod to max out your spells. Almost everything about this game needs as big of an overhaul as FFXIV needed when it first came out. If you want to see outdated graphics with game play mechanics that you can play the whole game and never feel like you properly mastered them.. then give this game a try. The most immediate things that they could do to enhance this game is to replace the godaweful sound and prerendered back grounds and other simple things like turning the globe on the overworld... into an actual sphere rather than the bunch of polygons that passed for a sphere on the PSX.

												Prepare for Square to pee on your childhood memories and shamelessly take your money, with minimum effort.I really hate NOT to recommend one of my favourite all time games. I admit I thought £10 was a little steep, but I love the game enough that it would be worth it... had they not been so lazy with this release! Many reviewers have complained about this, but the sound files are truly horendous. It's like playing a PS1 game with a snes soundtrack- absolutely appalling to release it like this when the price is already high for a full quality game, let alone one of LOWER quality than I played over a decade ago. If I could get a refund, I would! May as well put your money in a shredder as buy this in it's current state.			"

												Was excited to play 8 again so I bought it, made it through one random fight and then stopped playing because the music sounded terrible. Square, you need to realize that the music in your games pre-voice acting was what helped convey emotions of the characters. As such players are emotionally attatched to the songs as well, and when the music doesn't sound right, you're butchering the game.Fix the music. Now.*Editing this review to say that I've since managed to play through almost the entire game, but still cringe every time I hear one of my favorite songs in such poor quality. I'll gladly change my review completely if the music is ever fixed, but until then...			"

												I played this game on the Playstation back when it came out and decided to buy the Steam version for old times' sake. Sorry to say that the PC port of this game is absolutely horrendous. It's not worth the purchase even on a deep discount.The foremost problem is the controls: the button/key labels in-game are indicated using B1, B2, ... B10. Sure, you get shown the button meanings when the game boots, but it's not very useful when you can't remember the key combination for 'escape from battle' (required for the plot in the first game mission) and the in-game comments are useless. Also, don't bother with the controller support for this game. I attempted to use my wired 360 controller and found that the left and right triggers and the directional pad aren't detected -- you can't specify them in the custom configuration screen. (Also, there goes Zell's limit break.) On an aesthetic note, you should probably just mute the game instead of trying to tolerate the lo-fi, MIDI quality music. It's a shame, because the Dollet music mission is one of my favorites. Also, 'Magic Boost'? Seriously? Drawing magic was a HORRENDOUS idea to begin with, but Magic Boost is pretty much game breaking if you use it early on (it gives you 100 of the fire/thunder/blizzard, fira/blizzara/thundara, firaga/blizzaga/thundaga, all the status effect spells, and a few others... but fortunately it doesn't give you 100 of the top-tier spells like ultima, aura, etc) The game wasn't hard, there's no need for this kind of cheat.

												Final Fantasy VIII is a classic, but this is a lacklsuter version of the game.You need to sign into a Square Enix account to play this 15 year old single player game.Even if you are using a gampad there are instances where you will need to use the keyboard.If you own a Playstation system I would recommend getting the PSOne classics port instead of this, there's no DRM and it fully supports controllers.

												Everybody knows how good this game is, great to see it coming to steam!Only the music... same bad MIDI files... the music on the PS-One is a million times better. This should be adressed ASAP, so for the time being, I am not recommending this to anyone. The music of FFVIII was one of the things that captivated the players, and make a sweet taste of nostalgia for many. I surely recommend the game, but not in this form.Also what is strange... the characters, Squall, Quistis etc. all seem more... sharper. Their graphic quality has actually improved, while the surroundings... are of a lesser graphic quality. All in all, just a strange release! Some graphic elements improved, others lessened. Very bad quality music, which takes away the whole atmosphere and heart of the game. Adress it quickly is my advice.			"

												Great game and my favorite Final Fantasy on PS1. However, I think this ""HD Remix"" is real ripoff... Only Character models and SOME bosses has gotten their sprites upgraded to ""HD"". Everything else is still the same quality as it was in the PS1 and first PC version. Also I think the MIDI Files theu are using on this ""HD"" Remake are even worse what we got in the PSP version of the game, though I might be wrong on that one. But still, if you want to play Final Fantasy 8 you should buy this or the PSN version since they will be much cheaper compared to what you would have to pay for the PS/PC(If you can even find the PC version anymore) versions.

												Final Fantasy VIII is a somewhat controversal entry in the Final Fantasy series. It is also my introduction to the franchise and the first Final Fantasy game I ever played.And to be honest, it's easily one of my favorite FF games.FFVIII was the first game in the series to mix reality and fantasy as well as science fiction elements. It featured a new (somewhat confusing) junctioning system, Guardian force summoning, and a new cast of human characters. For all extents and purposes, it is a divisive title in the FF franchise. Yet it was the game that introduced me to what would become my favorite gaming franchise of all time.Personally, I found the story to be a little weaker then some entries in the series. But it has a human element that was lacking in many of the previous games in the series. Based on the theme of love, FFVIII has a very human cast of characters and I found each one of them quite likeable in some regard. Main protagainst Squall is often portrayed as cold and shallow, but learns trust and respect throughout the course of the game. The supporting characters are all interesting in their own right. You will learn to care about them and relate to them over the course of the game as you help them in their struggles to defeat the Galbadian army and the Sorceress Edea. This PC remaster includes the full game “Chocobo World” featured in the original PC port. It also includes 45 unlockable achievements and a magic booster feature.Final Fantasy VIII has it's critics, but it is a welcome entry into the FF franchise. Featuring a beautiful and moving story, a cast of uniqe and human characters, and a exciting battle system. It is easily among my favorite Final Fantasy games.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!			"

												Final Fantasy 8 is one of the first games that I remember playing, and I got hooked and it currently sits as my second favorite game I've ever played (behind Baldur's Gate 2). I've played it many times, read all of the criticism, and just recently completed all of the quests, so I'll attempt to address the main points on every side, bad stuff first. Overall, TL;DR What this leaves us with is a fantastic junction system that is built on the power and versatility of GFs, but is crippled by the forced grinding that is inherent in the broken Magic stock system. A small handful of characters shine, while the side characters prop them up and then fall to the wayside.Final Fantasy is a deeply flawed game, and is not very forgiving to newcomers, but has some deep complexity with several rewarding points, both in combat and side quests. Negatives  Progression System The biggest complaint I've seen for FF8 is how your power level progresses, specifically the Draw + Junction systems as well as level scaling. The Draw system is the magic system in the game; each character has 32 total slots for magic and can ""draw"" magic from enemies or draw points, or have magic refined through a variety of abilities, with a maximum cap of 100 total stock of each spell. The Junction system works in conjunction with GFs (Guardian Forces, equipable summons that give you a bunch of skills and such) and is reliant on the Draw system in that you junction magic to your stats (HP, strength, magic, vitality, spirit for health, physical attack power, magical attack power, physical defense, magic defense), as well as more rare junctions like hit %, speed (how quick your turn comes up), evasion, status and elemental attack and defense junctions. Sounds all great and dandy with tons of customization right? And it is!  The problem  is that the effect of junctioned magic is directly related to how much of said magic you have stocked. 100 fires will give a lot more health than 10 fires, and the system very much encourages sitting in a super boring battle for 10 minutes to fully stock up on magic.  Even worse  is that using magic will deplete your stock, therefore reducing their effectiveness as junctions, and thus meaning that there is never a good reason to use good spells, which is sad considering all of the crazy interesting spells, from Maelstrom (reduces physical defense to 0), to Double or Triple (allows you to cast 2 or 3 spells in a turn, respectively) to more traditional stuff like haste, regen, meteor, etc etc.The other problem that arises where power levels are concerned is level scaling. Every enemy in the game (with a handful of exceptions) has a scaling set of stats, skills, and draws that corresponds to what level your characters are, and they scale much faster than your characters do respective to their levels. That's right, you're better off never leveling up anybody, as using the roundabout ways to acquire junctioning magic will make you much stronger relatively speaking than gaining EXP. Story Character Progression As far as the story goes, the problem here is that the side characters have little to no character progression. Outside of the main ~3 characters in the story, the side characters just don't have much going story wise to flesh out their personalities, introduce conflict, or provide any meaningful way for them to grow as characters. Personally, I like Squall (the main character), but the fact that there are so few developed characters means that 1) seemingly interesting characters are mostly wasted and 2) there is less of a chance for the player to bond with any of the characters (see: FF9 with its varied cast of characters), so unless you like Squall, Rinoa, or Laguna you probably won’t like the game from a story perspective.*Note* I’m not touching the plot, as I feel like it is good not great, with several somewhat questionable choices throughout, but it neither makes nor breaks the game in and of itself. Positives Woohoo, stuff that makes the game worth playing! First up, Guardian Forces! Guardian Forces (or GFs) are summons that give you command abilities, let you junction magic, and refine stuff from stuff to give you more stuff! And you can summon them in battles to fight if you want, but that’s far from their most useful function (with the possible exception of the coolest of them all, Doomtrain). Why are GFs so cool? Because they tie everything together! They can help you in battle in a pinch, can be mixed and matched to get the right junctions, command skills, and support buffs you need, and can learn refining skills that will turn the useless junk you find into stupidly awesome magic and weapons! On top of that, many of them are new. Quezacotl takes Ramuh’s place as the lightning summon, while mainstays Shiva, Leviathan, Ifrit, Carbuncle, and Bahamut, in his best form of the entire series, all make appearances. New characters like Diablos, Pandemona, and Eden, and recurring characters that get their first appearance as summons in Cactuar, Tonberry, and Gilgamesh, all provide unique skill sets, as well as interesting ways to hunt them down (good luck with Ultima Weapon, Bahamut, Eden, and Tonberry without guides).Next up, Triple Triad! Yes, it’s a mini game. Yes, it’s the easiest (and frankly, only realistic) way to become a God, but it’s much more than that. It’s a simple game with a 3x3 grid where each player has 5 cards with 4 numbers on them, one for each cardinal direction, and you flip cards but having a higher number than the one you place a card next to. Simple, right? But that doesn’t include a rule like Plus, where you have to calculate what they can do with their cards so you don’t get your super cards flipped. But then there’s the Elemental rule which turns your only safe play into a losing play. Triple Triad is fantastic fun, working on the winning formula of easy to learn, hard to master (until you hit the Queen of Cards quest or random rule, screw that garbage). "

												This is the same thing as the PC version much like FF7 on steam, but the main difference is this time around the PC version of FF8 is better than the PS1 version. The tecture quality is better for in battle effects like drawing magic, and areas are no longer fuzzy. Also the PC version came with Chocobo World! Which the steam version also has. Chocobo World is this cute little 8 bit game that uses mostly FF7 music and your chocobo auto battles enemies, when winning a fight a 3x3 grid shows up and a random spot in that grid fills in. Keep killing enemies until you fill out a row and you level up. Find your Cactaur friend in game and he gives you items you obtain in FF8 at the chocobo forest. Id recommend this even if the price seems a couple bucks too much.			"

												The Port: The Steam port is a mixed bag. It has some pretty glaring flaws. First of all, you can't change the controls in-game (only in the pre-game menu). Secondly, the pre-game menu has a very big CHEAT HERE!!!! sign that allows you to bypass all kinds of things you'd normally have to earn yourself (money, spell inventory, etc.). Thirdly, the music they included are the awful MIDI files that are terribly low quality. You can fix this (one of the top-rated posts includes the link), but it's a needless hassle. On the plus side, the graphics look pretty good and the game includes ChocoWorld, which we PSX users never got. So like I said, it's a mixed bag. If you still have this on the PC with ChocoWorld, there's absolutely no reason to get the Steam release. If, however, you had it on PSX and would like to play ChocoWorld and use the items/characters from that side game in the main game, you might be interested in picking this up when it goes on sale.

(Side Note) All users who buy this game I advise to make sure your graphics card are up to date since MANY users are't able to play due to that very reason.(For those who owned game on pc when it first came out) Works with Nvidia and Ati graphics cards now.

												While this game is one of my favourites of the series Square has so far kept incredibly low quality MIDI files for the soundtrack which can be modded and replaced with the much cleaner sounding orginal PS1 soundtrack, but is still unacceptable to charge $10 for a game from the 90s thats worse than the orginal release. Also DRM requiring a log in every time you want to play this game is more of a move befit to companies like EA. Cannot recommend this version of the game if you have PS3/PSP/Vita save yourself the trouble and get it from PSN.			"

												""Hey Square, I see you got FF7 and FF8 re-released on Steam, so how about FF9, a pinnacle for its time? No? Why not?Because it require more effort than making custom launcher app for 15 year old port? Aww, that sucks. """"Don't be upset"" - says Square - ""You can go for other half-baked ports and games we made for handheld consoles. And don't miss Lightning Returns! You think it's dull piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Why, we too, but look at the charts, at the reviews! Oh, you can feed PC players with anythng these days!""Really, if you have this 5CD port somewhere in the closet, you know what the game is. After 15 years we got f***ing achievements. Even the same botched MIDI music.But there is a bright spot. It has nothing to do with Square, of course. It is the community mods. Apart from mods that fix things (like music), there are some that actually make game look better. Better textures, upscaled backgrounds, updated models and so on.So, in conclusion: if you already have 5CD version - go for it, install some mods and enjoy your nostalgia. And if you never played this game before, just go on with something else. It does not worth not money, not the time today, there is only sentimental value who played it in their youth.P.S. Maybe there is God and  he\she\it just send me ""Shut the f*ck up"" message. FF9 was anounced on PC and smartphones two days after I published this review. In case you missed it:

FF9 was a PS1 exclusive for 15 years, no solid proof of PC port existed, so there is a huge chance that all that techical mistakes like MIDI music that previous ports had won't be made this time. I am not waiting for miracle, just make music sound like it was originally this time, Square.			"

												A good game but a bad port, there is no excuse to make me log in to a third party to play a offline game. Screw you Square enix. Make good games, if FF15 isn't good I am done. And quit calling the mmos 'Final Fantasy' Just call them final fantasy online, don't destroy the canon like that. Too late though considering you already did that. The last good final fantasy was final fantasy 10, alright, final fantasy 12 was okay but it seemed like it was changed from how it was originally meant to be, too bad you lost all the talent and they left to make other games, final fantasy 13 was horrible.

												For anyone actually happy with this, you should be ashamed. Not only this is one of the worst in the Final Fantasy franchise,  This is yet another poor re-release be SquareEnix (as you can see from other reviews).The graphics are NOT updated, and if you say that they are updated then you should seriously consider sticking a knife into your eyes, since they are pretty much useless if you think that extures WORSE than the original are actually ""updated"".Only the character models are in high-definition. The scenario looks like crap, because Square did not bother filtering the game. So, the game looks like♥♥♥♥♥♥ with tiny models walking around with much better textures than everything else. EVERYTHING is blurry as ♥♥♥♥Not to mention (as you can attest from other comments) the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ music. They chose to replace the music with crap MIDI sound. Yup, nevermind the fact that they should re-relase with REMASTERED music for today's standards, they released it with worse sound that the PSOne version.Do not buy this crap. Emulate the game (that way you'll get high-quality sound, and graphics) and do not buy anything from Square. They are♥♥♥♥♥♥and don't care about the fans not one bit.			"

												Final Fantasy VIII is a wonderful game. At least that what I assume. I played it a long time ago on the playstation, and I WOULD play it on the PC if I could. But like so many other things, Enix screwed the pooch with their account system. After making an account with them I still have not been able to log in and play the game that I bought, and I don't believe that I will get to since I can't get any technical support from Square-Enix either. So, here I sit -$12 and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off. Hopefully this will keep anyone else from wasting their money as well.			"

Posted: June 2, 2016
												I am basing this review on both port & game quality.First, the port is very poorly made, there is no real attention to detail. Some examples include:* The game minimizes itself when it starts and you have to re-focus the window.* The game blocks you from using a gamepad right away and requires you to press a key in the beginning to proceed, bad UX.* The battle transitions look terrible compared to the PS1 version.* The game uses midi files for music when it is easily modded to play high quality OGG music. They were just lazy with this and it really takes a toll on the game's atmosphere if you don't use a mod for it.* There is a constant distracting message ""achievements synchronized with server"" every time you draw magic from enemies, just because there's an achievement for it, but you can't turn this message off.* When you have to do button prompts (there's a few quicktime events), the gamepad buttons appear as B1/B2/B3/B4 rather than icons, which can get confusing visually, if the event requires swift response. * After you finish the game, you get a black screen, the devs made no effort to reset the game data and return you back to title screen, you have to manually exit the game via Alt+F4. It shows that they were not willing to do changes for better UX on the target platform.Now for the game itself,The environments look great for its time, but the game suffers from a ""short area"" syndrome. There are many times that you'll enter a specific area that an interesting background/area caters only for plot and gives you no chance to explore. It is first apparent when you enter shops, you are greeted with the shop menu rather than an extra screen, so you can admire the aesthetics, which older games did, and this seems rather lazy.There's also the opposite happening sometimes, like with the few sidequests, the game will start describing the area/scene with plain text instead of providing some more interesting visuals.The dungeons are very few, with very little screens in them, often repeated and the game justifies it that it's a ""maze"" (Tomb of the Unknown King / Sewers) but feel rather linear. In one of them, you battle enemies every single step you make, and the dungeon screens repeat, making it extremely tedious & feeling like padding. There's no real sense of progress or reward. The World Map looks interesting at first glance, but you'd have explored the 1st half by Disc 1, on Disc 2 you'd be running around past locations and a few new small ones. And by Disc 3 you'd finally reach the other Continent only to be disappointed that the place is nothing but a seemingly huge city with nothing interesting to do in it, and a few tiny dungeons that serve just for plot and an item.One huge downside is that once you enter Disc 4, the game blocks you from going back to any city. It tries to justify it with plot (and probably PS1 CD limitations back in the day to fit those large cutscenes), but that really takes out of the close-endgame aspect. In previous Final Fantasy titles, you are free to revisit past locations, find new secrets in them, do sidequests and other interesting things (battle challenges, play minigames, chocobo breeding etc.).As such, there is not much exploration to be done. Forget field treasure chests with valuable items like in the previous games. There is only around 5-6 Items to be found, instead there are some Draw Points here and there that you can mine magic in set intervals, but nothing that feels truly rewarding.Side quests are very few, you have your extra GF sidequest, a treasure hunt, a ""find the UFO"" quest, and a cute but tedious tamagochi-like Chocobo minigame. Most of them are really not interesting and feel forced so that ""the game could have sidequests"".The game has gameplay pacing issues. Enemies now level up along with you which is an interesting concept, but not executed very well and often nullifies any grinding done to improve your characters' stats as the enemy level will always stay higher. On the flip side it is very easy to break the game by stocking up magic and junctioning them to your characters for big stat boosts.Another issue is that the game does not guide you well through gameplay, a hint of this is that the very first shops in the game already offer you items that you won't need for a good while, like the item ""Soft"" that cures petrification status, which doesn't happen until much later in the game. A worse, more apparent problem is that the game relies on lengthy tutorials to try and explain its mechanics rather than putting the player under tests.A major battle system change, which I am personally not a big fan of, was that now Magic are expendable and act like one-use Items (they do not require MP to use). As such, there is a lot of grinding to steal Magic from enemies that you end up junctioning to your characters and don't really want to expend. However it is now entirely possible to just spam GF (The game's Summons) and win every battle as there's no need for MP for them either. This change was unnecessary and breaks the balance/strategy with resource (MP/Item Stock) management as the player feels like he has infinite amount of resources for a battle, as long as they just grind for Magic.Money is not earned through battles. You can sell item drops/steals from monsters, but they don't sell for much til you reach Disc 3 portion of the game. The game relies on a Salary system which is based on your party's rank (how many battles you do, story choices, written tests), which leads the player not caring about buying any items from shops much having to wait all this time to get paid.There is also a nice distraction minigame in the form of a Card game, named Triple Triad, which I have nothing bad to say about the game itself, but it is very easy to accidentally spread the ""Random"" rule around regions, which makes your cards in your hand random & kinda omits the fun factor, making the minigame frustrating.As for the story, it's a pretty basic one, even for Final Fantasy standards it appears to look rather bland, and really a shame as the previous 2 titles had rather complex & interesting ones.The game's story starts off really slow, then picks up a little, then by Disc 2, it nosedives into boredom. Then it tries to do a twist which is really predictable and doesn't really do much to keep your interest. The villain's motive for being evil is also generic and without real purpose/context other than ""I am evil by nature, so I must kill you all"". By Disc 4, the game stops trying and it is just ""lets just kill the bad guy and go home"". The protagonist is totally non-relatable and one-dimensional. The romance, which the main story revolves around, between him and his interest also seems rather forced at times. The other characters often do some dumb stuff/decisions throughout the story, which you wish the game gave you the option of choice being an RPG and all.The protagonist's adversary also has no real-or-just closure, which seems lazy and all that time in the beginning spent to establish his character feels like a total waste of time.When the game first came out, it was hailed as an eyecandy & tech miracle. And for its time, it was. Great detailed graphics, great soundtrack. But the game really suffers from too much experimentation. There were some gameplay/storytelling formulas the previous game, FFVII, established that should not have been changed.Fortunately, the next iteration of the Final Fantasy series, FFIX, reverted all these poor design choices for the better.I sadly, cannot recommend this port to anyone looking to either start with Final Fantasy or looking to play the next classic Final Fantasy.Get this game only if you want it on your collection or for nostalgia reasons, otherwise there are much better JRPGs/FFs on Steam.

												Quite possibly one of the greatest stories of all time. The artwork and CGI of the Final Fantasy games during the late 90's was some of the best displayed in a video game during that time. This game was confusing, surprising, and captivating from beginning to end. There are secrets around every corner, not quite as much as Final Fantasy VII, but even more so when you consider the content provided with the card system and spell system. Some complain that the spell system is confusing, but a simple google search for a guide or video explination will solve confusion issues these days. The graphics upgrade provided with the PC version is really only an upgrade of the 3d modeling in the game. Fight scenes look a bit cleaner but it is clearly apparent that no improvement was made in regards to textures or higher texture sampling for the higher resolution options. This actually creates a very ugly full screen appearance when traveling through areas in towns. I am completely confused at Japan's approach to PC remakes of their console games. The lack of video options and the requirement for a launcher brings me back to 1998 when I was playing 'Redneck Rampage' on my Pentium III. If you really MUST have this game for PC like me, or if you insist on experiencing this game for the story, get it. Otherwise skip it.			"

												Crashes a lot. Also summon animations take 30 seconds and are NOT skippable. Rough math here, butevery 2 summons = 1 minute120 summons = 1 hour1200 summons = 10 hoursI barely got to the first boss and it took 12 summons to kill him. That's 6 minutes of the same animations over and over and over.  BLAM turn around and have another boss fight, that takes 3 summons before it will let you leave, it chases you, 3 more summons, rince repeat about 5 times and you've summoned 15 times. That's 7 minutes of the same animation, over, and over, and over, and over. That's 13 minutes spent watching the same 3 summon animations. That time builds up, gets old, and gets the game uninstalled. If you like watching the same thing over and over again, maybe you'll enjoy the game.Waste of money.			"

												The game is an absolute classic, and is still very enjoyable to play after all of these years. All features seemed to work well, but there were some issues with the game stalling during the second disc story arc. All things considered, a decent re-release.			"

												Warning: Review is not proofread, as I am a lazy human being. Final Fantasy VIII is a somewhat underdog classic in the Final Fantasy franchise. It was controversial in it's release for being vastly different then any Final Fantasy, or for that matter, RPG on the Playstation platform. Though critically acclaimed, alot of fans felt that the game derived too far from it's traditional JRPG roots. This is somewhat of a comical criticism in comparision to modern Final Fantasys, but at the time, the game had a shocking effect primarily for it's less cartoonish appearance, it's different take on equipment and item systems, and of course, who can forget the controversial junction system. The story as well, recieved much criticism for being overly melodramatic and at times feeling complete. The characters can come across as quite hokey at times as well. All this to say, that this is probably my favorite Final Fantasy game. I played it shortly after finishing FFVII, and while I do echo the esteem afforded to FFVII, FFVIII reached me in a way that game failed to. I found at the time, I could relate very much to the game's main protagonist Squall and his journey to venture outside of himself and into this bigger world of responsiblity. In a sense, it was a story for me as an adolescent, trying to make sense of love and the world. Sure, it does have a bit of a hokey love story element, but the thing that gripped me the most about this game was Squall's inner mental dialogue, and of course the unforgettable world in which the game takes place. I have to say it, I love the world of FF8. It is very much less steampunk and more sci fi, but its full of beautiful villages and vistas, and the people who inhabit this world are interesting. The story may feel uneven, but there was definite intention here to bring a lively world that spoke more then what the actual plot could, and I love the plot. The music is written by FF veteren Nobuo Uematsu, and it is as expectedly incredible. Every song fits so well with the environment; Nobuo has a rare talent of telling a story within a story. More could be said about Nubuo, and much has, but for the sake of room and time, just take my word for it. Concerning this version: this version of FF8 is wihin the same sort of rerelease as the FFVII rerelease. Keyword here is rerelease, NOT REMAKE. I can't emphasize that well enough. This is a RERELEASE. If you buy this game expecting a fully fledge HD remake, you will be disappointed, and you should be, because this is what SQUARE has made clear since the beginning. That said, for a rerelease this ain't bad considering that unlike FF7, the PC version of FF8 was considered somewhat inferior to the PS port. This was because at the time, the release was buggy and there were certain elements that made the game feel more like a port and less like a pc game. Much of that is retained in this version, but now we have the added benefit of actually being able to customize the game's graphics to your native resolution without the burden of modding. That is essentially what you are paying for here. The cinematics are fine, and cleaned up. The actual ing game graphics look nice, and you can see now clearly just how smooth this game was designed to run. The animations are much smoother this time around. Because of the clearer graphics however, you will notice some inconsistent fragments (pixelated people and backgrounds) that were not intended to be seen with a modern screen resolution. But I find this to be not a deal breaker. Also the music is sadly, the original chopped up midi from the pc release. Hopefully Square will patch in the glorious PS original score at some point. So in summary, FF8 is a flawed but still great game and one of my personal favorites. If you are expecting something more then a release of a game that is more then 10 years old, you will be disappointed. If you are like me though, and have fond memories of the game from your childhood, then you may find yourself surprised just how well things translate.			"

												Outside of your scope of the Final Fantasy series as a whole, this game is awesome. People constantly complain about the music and.. It could be better. It is the original music, but it gets the job done all the same. Most games i play, i tend to try not to take a guide to play it with me.. This game and FF7 are the exceptions. The game itself is huge and fun to play, although it does get repetitive after some time. There are secrets in the game which you cannot find until the very end of it, so its important to know where those are and how to access them, although they are not needed.The leveling system in this game is unique. The creatures level with you. You can get to level 100, like the traditional Final Fantasy games allow, however you could also defeat the end boss @ level 20. It's like that. There is no need for grinding and will allow you to experience the story without need for the grind. The story is great. Many say it doesn't make much sense, but thats because there are elements of it that you need to explore for yourself. Those elements will not reveal themselves to you, you need to search for them! Or use your guide.Overall, i would recommend this game, if for nothing else, the nostalgia value it brings. Great game.			"

												At first glance: a moody unlikeable protagonist. A strained love story. Weak charicatured party members. And yet it's the Final Fantasy I've put the most time into (so far). The junction system is just too good; it deserves the hours you spend hunting monsters, making and collecting cards, refining items and magic, so at the end you are a literal dimension shifting kiling machine. The Triple Triad card game is just icing on the cake and so addictive, and Chocobo World is even a nice addition for picking up rare items. The ending does make everything worthwhile, and though at times I was left frustrated, ultimately this game was an excellent experience.			"

												Since buying this game I have requested and been given a full refund by Steam. One of the reasons I love Final Fantasy VIII so much is because of the music. In this port, the original music has been replaced with very grating MIDI tunes that just sound wrong. Also, parts of the game have been ""polished"" to look cleaner (such as characters and backgrounds) but it's still mixed with old graphics, so it looks a mess. As you walk around, the new clean characters disappear for no reason, or are standing next to an untouched character. It's just so odd. Why not release the game with original music and cut scenes? If this was your only way to play the game, I'd still advise you get it on sale. I loved the PS1 version, and have played ports on other consoles that are enjoyable. Sadly, this release wasn't for me.			"

												Final Fantasy VIII is my favourite game not only in its own series, but jRPGs as a whole. The characters, more modern/realistic tone, romance centric plot, Nobuo Uematsu's music (man with the machine gun? force your way? the extreme?) and a heavy dose of nostalgia earn it that. So you would think I was excited when I heard that it was coming to Steam - and I was - until I heard it was just a port of the original PC release. The MIDI music in this game is a DOWNGRADE of the music on the Playstation 1. The menus are... ugly and look really weird. I don't mean to be that person, but the graphics aren't doing so well either. Gamepad support isn't all there. You need a Square Enix account to play the game. And before I find something else to complain about, if you have a similar experience as me, you might have incompatibility issues with more recent Windows releases, or the Steam overlay/achievements.But hey, it has Chocobo World. That's nifty. Just buy the original game, whether that's on the PS1, PS3, or PSP. If you absolutely have to have it on PC, look into mods to fix the music and menus, at the very least.			"

I had originally planned on running this on an emulator, but I thought I'd skip the hassle by buying it on Steam. Bad idea. One thing which really got me into FF8 was the music, and they have messed the music up on this PC version! Could they not have just used the original MIDIs, or was that too much work? The substitutes used in this version were poor, and have done little to uphold the high standards of the original. I cry as I reach for my CDs to load into my PC for use with the emulator.Please, SE, never again.			"

It's not even a bad thing.I'm still a big fan of Final Fantasy IX despite the fact that they changed the UI of the battle system, i'm still okay with it.It's still a Final Fantasy Game i played back in the PS1, theres nothing different.For those wondering, i run the game super fast & no frame drops whatsoever, as what other reviews says about 15-30 fps lock or some bs, those are all false, they just did things wrongly, and probably messed with files of the game before even playing the actual game, everything ran for me smoothly as if i was running in 60 fps, these guys are just pathetic with all these false lies.Quit your Whining.

												I stream in a daily basis on this game.I don't see any problems whatsoever since i first started streaming it,Aside from it being a little tat bit slow while streaming its still playable as hell, and i love it.If you want to watch me stream this game visit Twitch.Tv/PandaHeroTVDon't believe in all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t Negative reviews,they're just cry babies who gets off on the simplest things..like a launcher being implemented into the game,I've been playing with a square enix account and had cloud saves for a long time, i had never encountered an issue with the saves, and yes, i played OFFLINE too, so quit your whining and don't complain and make false negative reviews,This goes the same with Final Fantasy VII & Final Fantasy IX.Despite the new UI & Launcher existing in both of the games, i could care less.So long as the story hasn't changed and the gameplay hasn't change i give less sht about it.You people need to just stop crying & play the game for what it is, who the hell cares about launchers? It's not even a bad thing.I'm still a big fan of Final Fantasy IX despite the fact that they changed the UI of the battle system, i'm still okay with it.It's still a Final Fantasy Game i played back in the PS1, theres nothing different.For those wondering, i run the game super fast & no frame drops whatsoever, as what other reviews says about 15-30 fps lock or some bs, those are all false, they just did things wrongly, and probably messed with files of the game before even playing the actual game, everything ran for me smoothly as if i was running in 60 fps, these guys are just pathetic with all these false lies.Quit your Whining.

												You probably heard about this game before, so I'll go into the details about this version first.This is basically the PC port from 1999. That means it has poor quality midi music. I recommend installing the playstation music pack, which is provided in the guide section. You can turn on graphical enhancements, which I find awful. They mess up the textures so you see the geometry clipping or floating, which are seamless in the original version. You'll have achievements, too. They are a little uninspired and seem just mandatory for the most part.You can't just start the game and lay back on your couch with your gamepad - like with big picture. You absolutly need to put in some keyboard commands first. I find this annoying at the beginning of every session. Also, the in-game button prompts don't use the Xbox (or psx) names and that's confusing. If you're told to quickly press the B3 button, you'll know why.You have theoretically unlimited save files, which is nice. And you can play the built-in pocketstation game Chocobo World. That feature was useless in Europe back in the day, because the pocketstation was only released in Japan. But that minigame is not that good. For the most part it plays itself and you just have to hit enter every couple of minutes, so it continues. Now think about how long it takes to reach LV 99 there. That's just preposterous.The game itself is highly unconventional, which can be curse or blessing. You can't deny it has top-notch production value and incredible presentation, thanks to the pre-rendered backgrounds. That's always Squeenix' strong point. The thing with ""changing the formular"" is, that it feels like done for its own sake. Elements of typical jrpgs like character levels, money, magic, equipment and so forth don't have that much of a pay-off as if they were changed just for the hell of it. It is extremly complex and begs you to first familiarize with it. There is a lot of depth to the micro-management but it is overwhelming for a beginner. Plus, the menu interface is unappealing to look at, though you spend a lot of time arranging your stuff. It is best you don't even start to wrap your head around the meaning of all of this or you'll go crazy how ""gamey"" and nonsensical the entire system is.One thing I can't just easily criticize is the music. I know tastes are different and you can't just call it good or bad. But from a quality point of view I think the music is a little uninspired and underwritten. I get the role of these jazzy tunes in this more realistic universe. The composition uses much more natural sounding instruments and percussion, but it sounds way more flat and shallow than other works of Uematsu.I don't mind the card game. Not at all. Sometimes it's unpredictable and frustrating and it takes long to complete but for the most part I find it intriguing. If you don't, ignore it. You can just transform the cards you get without playing into items and will be fine.Then there's the drawing. You can finish the game with no problems without ever drawing magic. But I agree that it's initially counter-intuitive. Here's why. When you are introduced to this feature, you have nothing stocked yet the urge to be as good as possible. You can already see the ceiling. The more you have, the better you are. The only thing standing in the way is your investment. You will have to have the dicipline to say ""I may not be maxed out right now, but eventually I will be. Let's move on for now!"" Don't let it bug you. The game is balanced well enough.You can be forgiving with the mechanics but I think we'll all agree that the story is the weakest part. It is just contrived and incoherent and it doesn't know where it's going with all its set pieces. Plus there are plot holes and deus ex machina which are a sign of poor and lazy writing. It is pretty cheesy and schmaltzy, too.Bottom line, this is a real Frankenstein's monster. It is impressive, elaborate and stuffy but still an abomination you're puzzled about it even lives. It has much love to give but will always be a manifestation of ambition gone wild.			"

Posted: September 9, 2015
												I wanna make one thing clear: I love Final Fantasy (and RPGs in general). I have played the heck out of FFs 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, and 14, and loved every one. I really, REALLY want to like 8. Square decided they wanted to do something different. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it came crashing down in this instance.Side note: Credit where it's due, this game has a great soundtrack. The boss theme and Man With the Machine Gun are just two tracks I enjoy having stuck in my head. Nobuo Uematsu has never disappointed.Anyway. Lets go down the list of reasons this game doesn't want me to like it.-The Draw system: Lets be fair; I was prepared to tolerate the draw system. Magic is a limited resource in all RPGs, and frankly, this seemed considerably less limiting. In itself, I don't mind the system of ""draw magic, cast it later"". It's everything attached to the system I don't like.-The leveling system: FF8 is the only FF game to implement enemies with levels themselves. Your characters can level up as you adventure -- that's just standard for an RPG -- but unique to FF8, the enemies you encounter have their levels set to roughly match yours. Long story short, this means that leveling up is actually detrimental, because the enemies level up too. Oblivion is another game that does this (and it's one of the few flaws with an otherwise dang-near-perfect game), which causes players to just never level up because doing so would be stupid. Leveling up is a key component of any FF game, but it's butchered in FF8.-The junction system: Good God, talk about complex character customization. I won't go into all the details, but this is one of the main reasons I just can't enjoy this game. You can boost a character's stats by ""junctioning"" magic to that stat. This boosts it by a value that's unique per spell, per stat, multiplied by the number of casts you have of that magic. You can stock up to 100 of each spell. Here's where my big problem comes in; you stock this magic up by ""drawing"" it from enemies. It's a combat action on its own that does nothing to the enemy, and gives you an average of 5.5 casts of the spell you drew. That means when you find a new spell to draw, you need to draw about 18 times to get a full stock of 100. PER CHARACTER. Of which there are six. I probably spent over an hour just drawing up a full stock of about six different spells for about four different characters. Just...no. That's just ridiculous. To the PC version's credit, it comes with a ""magic booster"" that lets you get a full stock of a whole bunch of spells for all characters any time you want, but that feels like cheating. It's giving you a bunch of spells much earlier than you could otherwise access them. I just can't feel right by cheating in such a way.There are several different ways they could have made this system suck less. Capping at 10 instead of 100, for example. That still doesn't change the fact that the junction system as a whole is easily the most convoluted RPG system that exists.-Lack of character identity: FF7 had this issue too; your characters' combat abilities are defined primarily by the way you've set up their junction system (or materia in 7). You can set up Squall as a bruiser and Rinoa as a mage, then swap their junction setups and have them both perform the other role just fine. This limits the personality that the characters show -- and the issue is only compounded by the immense amount of time you'll spend in combat just spamming draw. This sounds nitpicky, but other FFs reinforce their characters through their combat options. In FF6, Edgar felt like the machinist because he was the only one that could use an autocrossbow. Sabin felt like the brawler because he was the only one that could suplex a freaking train. Shadow felt like the ninja because he was the only one that could hurl a shuriken. All those varying combat options reinforced their character.-Renzokuken: My last little nitpick that makes the game an absolute joke. Squall's limit break lets him smack an enemy upwards of five times, each for standard attack damage, and the only requirement to use it is to be low on HP. Theoretically, you could make mincemeat out of the entire game just by keeping Squall's HP low and spamming his limit break on anything that moves. Honestly, Square, what was wrong with FF7's limit break system? That worked just fine, and would have easily suited Squall's insane limit break.So yeah. I really, really wanted to like this game. I gave it several chances. I just...can't. On the other hand, FF7 is available on Steam, go grab that! And/Or the remake coming soon!			"

												after 10 minutes I don't know if I'm going to bother finishing this version of the game.  At first I set up controlls for my gamepad.  I started the game and was given a dislplay showing the keyboard controlls for the game.  I had to use the keyboard to get past it and into the actual game dispite setting up the gamepad for the game. (something thats required every time you start the game). it is just annoying.The music is quite bad. very obviously Midi audio for everything.The music is so loud, that it washes out all other sound or the other sound doesn't work.  I cant hear combat sounds or menu selections.   only one sound level adjustment in the menu and it does nothing at all. at 100% and 0% it sounds the same.Pictures can show how bad the map looks compared to the PS version of the game but in motion it looks worst.  like a SNES attempt at 3D.  i sware it looked better on PS.my controllers analog directionals are basicly on or off.  so no walking allowed it seems. the controller supporsts it but the game doesnt seem to.

												The greatest game ever made, now available on your personal computer, once again, through Steam. Though the music is subpar to the Playstation original, the Roses and Wine mod fixes that and even gives you orchestral optons, and The Black Mages' version of Don't Be Afraid. Final Fantasy vIII is a game i fell in love with when i was young, and will always come back to, no matter what. Also, features the greatest FF minigame around: Triple Triad. The amount of time i spent playing Triple Triad on the original version was worthy of the price of the game. I hope we get see more Final Fantasy games from the original I-X run, including X-2, on PC. Come on, Square Enix, make me hate you a little less.EDITL Well, i guess i was spot on with X/X-2			"

												FF VIII is a title I missed out on as a kid, so I bought it now to finally experience this story.It will definitely offer much content for the player to go through. As with all FF titles there are plentyof mini-games and side-quests, which all grants valuable and powerful items, so there will be many hours invested in this game. One of the new elements, is that FF VIII do not follow the casual road of the series and is very different in some areas.There are no level system as we are used to, instead every character always need 1000 exp in order to level up, where in previous titles, the required exp would gradually increase per level. The level system in this title is used to determine which level the monsters are, and what SeeD missions you can undertake (one of the side-quests).Players will instead rely on a new system called Junctioning. A system where character equips and buffs themselves with magic, summons and moves.Magic is not learned, but 'Drawn' from monsters, which makes it possible to stock up on 100 Triple + 100 Curaga. Stocked magic is then used as usual, with the character using the chosen magic move.Summons plays a big role in this title and has it's own system, where you have to spam X to increase it's % damage output.Also there is only about 2-3 chests in the game...PROS:FF VIII offers almost infinite amount of gameplay. You will be busy getting the best gear, solve all mysteries while you adventure together with a friendly crew. The graphics are alright and I had no issues what so ever with how it looked. I liked it. Battles are always a challenge, unless you prepare yourself properly. So you will never get bored of killing bosses too fast. I ran into trouble with both Bahamut and Griever, even though I thought I was well equipped.You will experience a new, more modern take on the Knight & Sorcerer tale, which is interesting and kept me asking questions throughout the game. The characters had GREAT dialogue and the bonds that happens between them is a joy to watch and follow. I was really fond of Zell and Selphie, who is two great characters that really adds to the game.You of course not be cheated of the chance to capture a chocobo, which has is its own little (big) mini-game. Get busy and train that chocobo, so you can get some delicious items. I really enjoyed the chocobo part, even though it got tedious sometimes, but I can't have a game with no chocobo training.At a point, when you have more time and the tools to explore, you will have a lot of things to do and stuff to get.Again endless amounts of things to keep you busy.This is purely my opinion and you should only read this when you have finished the game yourself. It is worthy buying, despite these cons.CONS:I personally did not find the cast of characters too interesting. They had great personalities and dialogue, so this is based purely on how they look. Boring. I hated Zell's stupid tattoo, but I really enjoyed his personality and he got to be one of my favourite characters. Yet when I play a FF title, I really look forward to their appearances. Sadly few characters stood out, and most had little fantasy elements and more a stale citizen look.I absolutely got to hate the GF system. Every single time I had chosen and equipped my fav team, I had to change characters out and re-arrange everything. In all FF titles you will most likely loose a teammember for a certain amount of time, but in FF VIII it just happens ALL the time. Some will certainly love this system, as it grants them much control of how exactly to buff their characters, yet I did not enjoy this.I really missed the chests in the game.SPOILER ALERT!For the FF Nerds only:I really liked the story and found it very interesting, yet I really found it rushed and some points in the game made zero sense to me at all. For example when the Sorcerer kills the president in front of all those people and they just cheer at her. I know it is her mindcontrol and such, but I really think the plot was rushed and had holes in it. FF VII or FF IX had just as good stories, but they were told and experinced much better, and I felt I knew exactly what was going on and it all made sense. Like the bond between Squall and Rinoa happens extremely fast. Like in the beginning she is not that visible, and suddenly she is extremely important and so on.All in all: Buy the game!			"

												Just finished my first Steam-FF8 Playthrough.The first time I played this game I was 12 Years old. The setting enchanted me - I wished I could be Squall and have a girl like Rinoa on my Side. He is strong, independend, a Leader - And, in the beginning, a jerk.His development and the characters where what impressed me the most. For the first time, I felt like having to deal with real human beings - Not just fantasy characters with fantasy problems. They felt ... real. I loved it. Since then , I played the game dozens of times. Everytime I started it again, I couldnt stop until I finished it. It put me under a spell, everytime I touched it. for a reason.The game itself has some major flaws, like the fact that monsters are equal to your own level and the battle system includes hours of spell drawing, which can be really annoying. that you lose Seed Rankings for using G.F. is another thing that bothers me, I never used them after my 1. playthrough. it just doesnt pay to do so. using magic is bad either - Your junctioned stats decrease. what a bummer. So, for me, all that was left was Attack and Item - Not a very enjoyable Battle System. But well, you don't have to play that way and can use Magic and G.F. I just didnt.But what got me was the story. The Game has BIG parts that feel really epic - even today. Sure, the graphic didnt age very well but hey, the cutscenes are still really enjoyable. If you are ready to dive into the story and respect the love behind all the details, you will just fall in love with the characters. Probably even with the Villains. Its a more grown up story, its about love, loss and taking responsibility. its about friendship and obedience. well, its probably just about life - and the fact that everyone has problems.I enjoyed the game now for 16 Years and I will probably do so for the next 16 Years. If you have ever played an FF Game, you should grab it - Even if you just played the abominations FF13 and sequels. 10/10 !			"

												It's a good game, one of the earlier well known uses of a scaling levels. The PS version is definitely better if you have no interest in modding or using the steam exclusive boosts .There are select people that will tell you you're wrong for using them and to that I say whatever. The tools can be used in positive ways that make the experience more enjoyable by removing the artificial time lengthener of draw grinding. Simply turning on speed boost and activated god mode, until you max 100 draws will cut the length down to a reasonable 50 or so hours to complete. Of course you'd want to shut both off and complete fights as normal after you do so. I'd argue this + mods trumps the PS version. People are often polarized on this for several reasons so without getting into too much here are some pros and cons.pros:unique leveling system for its timemusictime travelingvideos still look goodfeelsRagnarok flight themeLaguna (You'll meet him.)cons:unique leveling systemgraphics might push some new gamers away (this CAN be fixed with modding)Squall (main char), he's a melodramatic drama queen, I love FF8, hate him. draw system, I urge you to use the speed boost+god mode for farming, but shut them off for normal fights if you're new.I like the game, maybe watch a video of the gameplay first?

												Ah FF VIII, for many of us that hadn't played a Final Fantasy game before. This was probably our second introduction to JRPG's as a genre.As writing a review about a game 10+ years old is mostly pointless. I'll say only one thing about the game. It's still the game it was then, naturally, the graphics and some core gameplay designs don't hold up.But if you really want to play FF VIII again, with added achievement support, then this is probably the best way to do that. If you love FF VIII, you won't be disappointed. If you never played it and don't have a tolerance for old games, you may find it a bit tough to get through.			"

												The greatest game ever made, now available on your personal computer, once again, through Steam. Though the music is subpar to the Playstation original, the Roses and Wine mod fixes that and even gives you orchestral optons, and The Black Mages' version of Don't Be Afraid. Final Fantasy vIII is a game i fell in love with when i was young, and will always come back to, no matter what. Also, features the greatest FF minigame around: Triple Triad. The amount of time i spent playing Triple Triad on the original version was worthy of the price of the game. I hope we get see more Final Fantasy games from the original I-X run, including X-2, on PC. Come on, Square Enix, make me hate you a little less.EDITL Well, i guess i was spot on with X/X-2			"

												I'm a hardcore fan with FF8, so many times I would even try to escape reality with lucid dreaming, I would be in Balamb Garden where I would often train with Zell in the training center and help Selphie with the Garden Festival, but one day as I was talking to Selphie, we went to my dormitory for a private talk. She immediately said, ""You know you could live with us forever.."" I gave her a confused look and she continued, ""We understand that you live on earth and you REALLY wish to live here"". I then said ""How..How did you know?"" She then giggled and said ""Because we've been watching you, silly!""This was a dream come true and I almost cried right there. She then said, ""I talked with Headmaster Cid and he agreed that you would be PERFECT for SeeD, you just have to do...one thing"". She then held my hand and looked deep into my eyes and said ""...You have to kill yourself for the transfer to work correctly."" I then gave her some questions, ""How long do I have before the deal expires?"" She then said ""Cid said 3 months.."" I added by saying ""What's the most painless way?..."" She giggled again, ""Suicide will require pain buuut...if you want it quick...Get a gun and a nice shot to the head works.I then agreed and she gave me a kiss on the forehead, ""I know this will be tough but once it's over and done, you'll get to live here!"" I then woke up and this was last week and i purchased a gun. I might actually kill myself because that dream just felt too real to be fake and my life isn't doing so grand. "

												Straight to the point: FF8 is bizarre.  The story is an train wreck of bad anime cliches, its characters are annoying, the customization system is unique but cumbersome, and the battles are overlong due to the inability to skip overlong attack animations.  And yet, at the same time, I can't bring myself to say its the black sheep of the series (that honor goes to FF13), but more of the red headed step child.  Its got just enough good in it to warrant giving a shot.  Far from an essential entry but for fans of the franchise its a must.  For what its worth, though, FF8 has my favorite Final Boss fight of any entry in the series, I guess thats something?			"

												There were always a few issues with this game, foremost being the magic system. In this current version for the PC the problem is mostly the controls put in place. Not only can't you customize your controls, as you can in most PC games, but the buttons you're forced to use are awkward at best. Add that to the fact that they only refurbished the graphics on select parts of the world and animations, the volume controls don't work, and the fact that you have to sign into a squareenix account on top of being logged into steam and you have a craptastic experience that is sure to annoy. Thanks Square, I'll make sure to ignore future titles in the steam store and go with a group that thinks about what the player expects and/or wants in their gaming experience. 1 out of 5 folks.			"

												To be Honest I love all the Final Fantasy Games.  X was my favorite, I spent a lot of time giving Tidus all the skills possible.  But for this Final Fantasy VIII I am very disappointed in Square Enix.  Cause I have 6 hours and 26 minutes in the game.  An There's a T Rex west of the city.  I have been fighting non stop to level up cause the game gives me errors ""An Unknown exception was occurred.""  every time I get Ifrit and try to meet Seifer.  Plus now I am finding more an more an more errors.  Example I am atm Quistis lv 36 1601 hp.  Squall lv 35 1671 hp.  Quezacotl lv 59 4340 hp.  Shiva lv 62 4392 hp.  I go and fight T Rex and after using GF to summon my two pets.  No matter what I am insta killed by T Rex, given a game over and the same error as always.  I think this game was poorly designed, created, produced and should really be redone correctly cause it ruins the image of other wise great Final Fantasy Games.  I think anyone who purchased this game from Steam should get a refund and a apology.   So if you intend to buy this, I advice you even with all the errors don't waste your money.			"

												I bought the Game about an hour ago.The Download went fine, but when a Launcher came up requesting me to sign up a Squeenix Account the Horror started. I admit i didnt check a third party launcher was required to launch the Game.The Launcher gave the Option to create an Account. Unfortunatly the Confirmation Email which was supposed to be sent to the Mail I chose didnt show up for about 15 Minutes. That started to worry me and therefore i tried it with another EMail.If you're interested in what EMail I used, the first attempt had been a Google-Mail (Both Versions @gmail and @googlemail) and the second one was a @hotmail . Both end up in no response so i started up Google and looked for that issue.It was already a known issue that Confirmation Mails arent sent. I then tried some advises by fellow People and in the end it took me longer to create an account than actual downloading the Game... thats really sad. The 1 Hour Gametime until now is nothing more than the Launcher being open in the Background while waiting for the Confirmation Email.I will consider changing my review based on what issues might arise before the Game even launched.If someone might stumble along the same Issue, this Link helped me: https://secure.square-enix.com/account/app/svc/Login?cont=account&request=mogstationJust follow the instruction up to the Point the Account is created and activated, everything else seems not necessary.Grammar and spelling mistakes are possible and are allowed to be kept.

Posted: September 9, 2015
												I wanna make one thing clear: I love Final Fantasy (and RPGs in general). I have played the heck out of FFs 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, and 14, and loved every one. I really, REALLY want to like 8. Square decided they wanted to do something different. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it came crashing down in this instance.Side note: Credit where it's due, this game has a great soundtrack. The boss theme and Man With the Machine Gun are just two tracks I enjoy having stuck in my head. Nobuo Uematsu has never disappointed.Anyway. Lets go down the list of reasons this game doesn't want me to like it.-The Draw system: Lets be fair; I was prepared to tolerate the draw system. Magic is a limited resource in all RPGs, and frankly, this seemed considerably less limiting. In itself, I don't mind the system of ""draw magic, cast it later"". It's everything attached to the system I don't like.-The leveling system: FF8 is the only FF game to implement enemies with levels themselves. Your characters can level up as you adventure -- that's just standard for an RPG -- but unique to FF8, the enemies you encounter have their levels set to roughly match yours. Long story short, this means that leveling up is actually detrimental, because the enemies level up too. Oblivion is another game that does this (and it's one of the few flaws with an otherwise dang-near-perfect game), which causes players to just never level up because doing so would be stupid. Leveling up is a key component of any FF game, but it's butchered in FF8.-The junction system: Good God, talk about complex character customization. I won't go into all the details, but this is one of the main reasons I just can't enjoy this game. You can boost a character's stats by ""junctioning"" magic to that stat. This boosts it by a value that's unique per spell, per stat, multiplied by the number of casts you have of that magic. You can stock up to 100 of each spell. Here's where my big problem comes in; you stock this magic up by ""drawing"" it from enemies. It's a combat action on its own that does nothing to the enemy, and gives you an average of 5.5 casts of the spell you drew. That means when you find a new spell to draw, you need to draw about 18 times to get a full stock of 100. PER CHARACTER. Of which there are six. I probably spent over an hour just drawing up a full stock of about six different spells for about four different characters. Just...no. That's just ridiculous. To the PC version's credit, it comes with a ""magic booster"" that lets you get a full stock of a whole bunch of spells for all characters any time you want, but that feels like cheating. It's giving you a bunch of spells much earlier than you could otherwise access them. I just can't feel right by cheating in such a way.There are several different ways they could have made this system suck less. Capping at 10 instead of 100, for example. That still doesn't change the fact that the junction system as a whole is easily the most convoluted RPG system that exists.-Lack of character identity: FF7 had this issue too; your characters' combat abilities are defined primarily by the way you've set up their junction system (or materia in 7). You can set up Squall as a bruiser and Rinoa as a mage, then swap their junction setups and have them both perform the other role just fine. This limits the personality that the characters show -- and the issue is only compounded by the immense amount of time you'll spend in combat just spamming draw. This sounds nitpicky, but other FFs reinforce their characters through their combat options. In FF6, Edgar felt like the machinist because he was the only one that could use an autocrossbow. Sabin felt like the brawler because he was the only one that could suplex a freaking train. Shadow felt like the ninja because he was the only one that could hurl a shuriken. All those varying combat options reinforced their character.-Renzokuken: My last little nitpick that makes the game an absolute joke. Squall's limit break lets him smack an enemy upwards of five times, each for standard attack damage, and the only requirement to use it is to be low on HP. Theoretically, you could make mincemeat out of the entire game just by keeping Squall's HP low and spamming his limit break on anything that moves. Honestly, Square, what was wrong with FF7's limit break system? That worked just fine, and would have easily suited Squall's insane limit break.So yeah. I really, really wanted to like this game. I gave it several chances. I just...can't. On the other hand, FF7 is available on Steam, go grab that! And/Or the remake coming soon!			"

												after 10 minutes I don't know if I'm going to bother finishing this version of the game.  At first I set up controlls for my gamepad.  I started the game and was given a dislplay showing the keyboard controlls for the game.  I had to use the keyboard to get past it and into the actual game dispite setting up the gamepad for the game. (something thats required every time you start the game). it is just annoying.The music is quite bad. very obviously Midi audio for everything.The music is so loud, that it washes out all other sound or the other sound doesn't work.  I cant hear combat sounds or menu selections.   only one sound level adjustment in the menu and it does nothing at all. at 100% and 0% it sounds the same.Pictures can show how bad the map looks compared to the PS version of the game but in motion it looks worst.  like a SNES attempt at 3D.  i sware it looked better on PS.my controllers analog directionals are basicly on or off.  so no walking allowed it seems. the controller supporsts it but the game doesnt seem to.

												Here is another review on a Final Fantasy game. I love this game. The junction system was confusing when I first encountered this game. I admit I gave up on the game the first time I tried it. My first impressions back on the PS1 for this game were nonexistent. I eventually got around to playing it, and I was very surprised. I played this game when I was younger and thought it was fantastic, though it was confusing in terms of storyline. *Spoiler Alert* Years later I stumbled upon a theory about Squall being dead. This peeked my interest and so during the summer of 2014 I purchased this game again and played it once more. Without a doubt the theory only made me like Final Fantasy 8 even more. The thought of our hero falling into a dreamlike state and seeing his life flash before his eyes as the premise for the game was amazing. This is how I choose the story of Final Fantasy 8 to be for me.*End Spoiler*Of course if this isn't true, I still love the game for what it is in terms of music, characters, adventure, and exploration.I guess you can say that over the years I have grown to appreciate the masterpiece of some of the older titles, this being Grade A vintage quality. The game is fantastic.			"

												One of my top 3 games of all time. Brings me back to when the Ps1 first came out and I played all 4 discs mutliple times.. But as much as I love this game, It's so hard to play without the graphics being updated. I understand that it came out years ago. I wish they would update the graphics and not use the stupid MIDI format for the music.			"

												It's a good game, one of the earlier well known uses of a scaling levels. The PS version is definitely better if you have no interest in modding or using the steam exclusive boosts .There are select people that will tell you you're wrong for using them and to that I say whatever. The tools can be used in positive ways that make the experience more enjoyable by removing the artificial time lengthener of draw grinding. Simply turning on speed boost and activated god mode, until you max 100 draws will cut the length down to a reasonable 50 or so hours to complete. Of course you'd want to shut both off and complete fights as normal after you do so. I'd argue this + mods trumps the PS version. People are often polarized on this for several reasons so without getting into too much here are some pros and cons.pros:unique leveling system for its timemusictime travelingvideos still look goodfeelsRagnarok flight themeLaguna (You'll meet him.)cons:unique leveling systemgraphics might push some new gamers away (this CAN be fixed with modding)Squall (main char), he's a melodramatic drama queen, I love FF8, hate him. draw system, I urge you to use the speed boost+god mode for farming, but shut them off for normal fights if you're new.I like the game, maybe watch a video of the gameplay first?

Game is really long and addictive. Actually I was playing FF VIII for 32 hous in 2 WEEKS and I don't finished it.Combat system is well made, If this the first game from SquareEnix you've ever played then u can use Magic Boost in main menu: It's really big help for beginners. Game bosses are hard sometimes - every boss have other counter and weaknesses. I recommend this game for every player, this game is really beautiful thing.			"

												Finished this game about 9 times many years ago, I guess for the 10th I wanted to play the Steam version with ALL the mods (plus maybe with all our money, someday they'll do the remake...). The ""no level"" part really annoy me so I'll play like I want then use a SAVE EDITOR on the ""CD3"" to level down all my characters and level up again with GF Bonuses. (I hope the enemies will be low level too XD)This time I'll try making some ""Jobs"" for the characters like : ""Squall will use no magic, Rinoa Healer, Zell/Selphie/Quistis as a Tank or something else.""and of course, at Galbadia, for the 10th time I'll try to murder Irvine.

I have no idea what button that's assigned to, if any, and if finding the start button is that hard Ican imagine what a pain it'll be to figure out the rest. i would have thought they made this game both mouse and controller compatible when they released it on steam. So unless I'm just braindead today and missed something obvius I think steam should require more of game companies to make games work without any hassle.			"

												I bought the Game about an hour ago.The Download went fine, but when a Launcher came up requesting me to sign up a Squeenix Account the Horror started. I admit i didnt check a third party launcher was required to launch the Game.The Launcher gave the Option to create an Account. Unfortunatly the Confirmation Email which was supposed to be sent to the Mail I chose didnt show up for about 15 Minutes. That started to worry me and therefore i tried it with another EMail.If you're interested in what EMail I used, the first attempt had been a Google-Mail (Both Versions @gmail and @googlemail) and the second one was a @hotmail . Both end up in no response so i started up Google and looked for that issue.It was already a known issue that Confirmation Mails arent sent. I then tried some advises by fellow People and in the end it took me longer to create an account than actual downloading the Game... thats really sad. The 1 Hour Gametime until now is nothing more than the Launcher being open in the Background while waiting for the Confirmation Email.I will consider changing my review based on what issues might arise before the Game even launched.If someone might stumble along the same Issue, this Link helped me: https://secure.square-enix.com/account/app/svc/Login?cont=account&request=mogstationJust follow the instruction up to the Point the Account is created and activated, everything else seems not necessary.Grammar and spelling mistakes are possible and are allowed to be kept.

												Final Fantasy 8 tells the story of teenagers who are taught to be a special forces for hire called SeeD, based out of their respected regions schools called Gardens. Using the best in weapon training, Magic and Guardian Forces (Summoned beasts that devastate opposition), they are hired as security, front line combatants, support and all around imposing presence. The story follows several of these students as they stumble away from being mercenaries, to being in the middle of a plot of a powerful Sorceress bent on ending reality. With all the talk about how good Final Fantasy 7 is, its easy to overlook the next in the series. Final Fantasy 8 was the third Final Fantasy game I played. Final Fantasy 3 was the first one I played off a second hand copy that Blockbuster got their hands on some 20+ years ago. By the time I got to Final Fantasy 8, I had played though FF 7 and enjoyed it. I was hoping to find another fun RPG to play, and I was not disappointed.FF 8 was the first one to make me feel for the characters. I transitioned from a story, that was for the most part ok, but very little else, to a story that had me feel. For that, this game ranks above FF 7.The game gives you tough boss battles that are very risk vs reward heavy. With the way you gain your Limit Breaks, you can go down several options with each boss; Full health, Full health and use Aura, or keep your characters at critical hp levels and burn down the boss fast. It may seem like these are fairly simple, but that's what makes it so solid. Its not complex, its not jumbled up, but it still requires you to think for a few seconds about healing your character, or hoping they survive to let lose their Limit Break.As far as the Final Fantasy games go, I give this a solid 9/10.Its not perfect, no game is, but its a damn good one.

												Final Fantasy 8 in my opinion is one of the best ff games of all time! From the beggining cutscene you know you are in for a wild ride. The gameplay may be kind of difficult to get used to after the materia system of ff7, but once you get used to it, you will find pleasure in the junctioning system. Also the story is complicated and a little ""messy"" but then...which ff game story isn't. The character are memorable and the cutscenes give me goosebumps to this day. The music is solid. The steam version i find is an amazing way for everyone to expoerience the game since it is the exact same as the original, except with updated graphics. I definetly recommend this game to any one looking for a fun, challengin and emotional RPG game.4.5/5   -Mohamed			"

												All the old Final Fantasy games are good this is one of the top if not the topThis game will keep you playing it till the end and will make you want to replay. The pc port has got a bit of stick over the audio it is not bad just not as good as the game was on ps1.There are mod's for the audio moving the game audio passed the ps1 version with remastered music and sounds.The story is very well told for a JRPG and the game has aged well. The world the game is set in is a good size with lots to see in and out of the story line.Leveling up is not a gring and fun and the game play is well paced and fighting is in a mmo in stile ""I hate mmo's but like this game"" there is some QTE but not much and i am hard pushed to find any earlier QTE in gameing history 1st ???Over all it is a must play for a gamer and i give it a 7/10 would of been a 9/10 but the lack of remastered audio and resolution   left me feeling that this could of been more than just a port			"

												Not the best port, but not unplayable. Pros: + HD Character Models. No HD backgrounds, but I understand how difficult it is to add them so I won't blame them.+ Very solid list of achievements.+ You can use mods. I recommend MCINDUS's mods from forums.qhimm.com.+ Runs good on every computer. From notebooks to laptops to gaming PC's. You can play it in 1080p without a doubt.+ A magic booster if you don't feel like dealing with the tedium of this game's draw/junction system.Cons: - The soundtrack is MIDI, which sounds pretty bad. Should've just left the soundtrack alone.- Keyboard controls suck. I recommend you get a controller and just use that instead. Very forgettable button layout.Overall, not too shabby, but they screwed up the original music. Luckily mods can fix this problem, but you shouldn't have to be modding these things in. If you have a PSP, PS3, or Vita, just get this game on there. If you want it for the achievements like I did, then this will suffice.6/10, pretty lazy port, but it's good enough.			"

												No idea why i am reviewing this maybe it is because FF9 is close to being released here soon but if people have not yet noticed i am pretty sure it's common sense to buy a final fantasy game rather than actually thinking about it because growing it with it through out all my life when they have released a final fantasy even today for the time period the GFX is far superior than any one else can do, The story's are way more involved and emotional than any one else is doing and they all offer unique fighting methods if any one knows of a more productive RPG genre please mail me ASAP cause i would love to see it. My Rating here is based off playing this when i was 7 and playing it now when im 25 10/10 with an RKSlither smack bang must buy. Oh and im not doing a 100% run although i could easily do it, It does not make for fun viewing if any one wants to see the game before buying it watch my playlist. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVvb08l5lUzYYIdbUp6Tu4igoBYGv6vE6 "

												I love this game, I played it for PS1 and always wanted the computer port of it. Steam had it up for sale and I snagged this for something like 5-10 dollars, not only is it still playable; it's still playable with a controller! The story wasn't the best Squarsoft every came up with but the battle system will, and always has been my favorite of all time.			"

												My childhood has been soiled and flushed away. The demise of my soul is shrouded in shameful .MIDI melodies... .MIDI...I was excited to buy this game on steam and finally play it without an emulator. (I own the origional game and PS1) Sure I could play it on the console but that is not the point of this review. I am reviewing the steam version and the validity of others to purchase this version.The game is the Final Fantasy VIII that we all love... sort of. It has been completely ruined by MIDI music. Balamb garden no longer has the warm melody that made me enjoy returning as much as possible. Now it is flat and fills my skull with shrill tones. Go to Balamb Town expecting to hear the acoustic guitar strumming away to the song Breazy; YANK! sounds more like Bach snoozing on an out of tune organ. The music composed by Nobuo Uematso was a pinacle peice to the world of Final Fantasy VIII and with the musical score that really drove the story ruined, I can't recommend the game... :( If you are a FFVIII fan whose hummed along with the music during your childhood, you will be sorely disappointed with this version. Right now you would only be buying half of the game.			"

												One of my Favorite FF games, not as good as FF9 but I still enjoy it.FF8 took a big risk with it's jump to computers back in the days and new graphical looks, how ever, the game remained true to the FF-series in terms of combat, story, music and so on.There are a few sadly less well made parts of this game but for me, it's all acceptable and the game is still very much a genuine Final Fantasy aswell as RPG game.8/10			"

												FF VIII is a title I missed out on as a kid, so I bought it now to finally experience this story.It will definitely offer much content for the player to go through. As with all FF titles there are plentyof mini-games and side-quests, which all grants valuable and powerful items, so there will be many hours invested in this game. One of the new elements, is that FF VIII do not follow the casual road of the series and is very different in some areas.There are no level system as we are used to, instead every character always need 1000 exp in order to level up, where in previous titles, the required exp would gradually increase per level. The level system in this title is used to determine which level the monsters are, and what SeeD missions you can undertake (one of the side-quests).Players will instead rely on a new system called Junctioning. A system where character equips and buffs themselves with magic, summons and moves.Magic is not learned, but 'Drawn' from monsters, which makes it possible to stock up on 100 Triple + 100 Curaga. Stocked magic is then used as usual, with the character using the chosen magic move.Summons plays a big role in this title and has it's own system, where you have to spam X to increase it's % damage output.Also there is only about 2-3 chests in the game...PROS:FF VIII offers almost infinite amount of gameplay. You will be busy getting the best gear, solve all mysteries while you adventure together with a friendly crew. The graphics are alright and I had no issues what so ever with how it looked. I liked it. Battles are always a challenge, unless you prepare yourself properly. So you will never get bored of killing bosses too fast. I ran into trouble with both Bahamut and Griever, even though I thought I was well equipped.You will experience a new, more modern take on the Knight & Sorcerer tale, which is interesting and kept me asking questions throughout the game. The characters had GREAT dialogue and the bonds that happens between them is a joy to watch and follow. I was really fond of Zell and Selphie, who is two great characters that really adds to the game.You of course not be cheated of the chance to capture a chocobo, which has is its own little (big) mini-game. Get busy and train that chocobo, so you can get some delicious items. I really enjoyed the chocobo part, even though it got tedious sometimes, but I can't have a game with no chocobo training.At a point, when you have more time and the tools to explore, you will have a lot of things to do and stuff to get.Again endless amounts of things to keep you busy.This is purely my opinion and you should only read this when you have finished the game yourself. It is worthy buying, despite these cons.CONS:I personally did not find the cast of characters too interesting. They had great personalities and dialogue, so this is based purely on how they look. Boring. I hated Zell's stupid tattoo, but I really enjoyed his personality and he got to be one of my favourite characters. Yet when I play a FF title, I really look forward to their appearances. Sadly few characters stood out, and most had little fantasy elements and more a stale citizen look.I absolutely got to hate the GF system. Every single time I had chosen and equipped my fav team, I had to change characters out and re-arrange everything. In all FF titles you will most likely loose a teammember for a certain amount of time, but in FF VIII it just happens ALL the time. Some will certainly love this system, as it grants them much control of how exactly to buff their characters, yet I did not enjoy this.I really missed the chests in the game.SPOILER ALERT!For the FF Nerds only:I really liked the story and found it very interesting, yet I really found it rushed and some points in the game made zero sense to me at all. For example when the Sorcerer kills the president in front of all those people and they just cheer at her. I know it is her mindcontrol and such, but I really think the plot was rushed and had holes in it. FF VII or FF IX had just as good stories, but they were told and experinced much better, and I felt I knew exactly what was going on and it all made sense. Like the bond between Squall and Rinoa happens extremely fast. Like in the beginning she is not that visible, and suddenly she is extremely important and so on.All in all: Buy the game!			"

												Just finished my first Steam-FF8 Playthrough.The first time I played this game I was 12 Years old. The setting enchanted me - I wished I could be Squall and have a girl like Rinoa on my Side. He is strong, independend, a Leader - And, in the beginning, a jerk.His development and the characters where what impressed me the most. For the first time, I felt like having to deal with real human beings - Not just fantasy characters with fantasy problems. They felt ... real. I loved it. Since then , I played the game dozens of times. Everytime I started it again, I couldnt stop until I finished it. It put me under a spell, everytime I touched it. for a reason.The game itself has some major flaws, like the fact that monsters are equal to your own level and the battle system includes hours of spell drawing, which can be really annoying. that you lose Seed Rankings for using G.F. is another thing that bothers me, I never used them after my 1. playthrough. it just doesnt pay to do so. using magic is bad either - Your junctioned stats decrease. what a bummer. So, for me, all that was left was Attack and Item - Not a very enjoyable Battle System. But well, you don't have to play that way and can use Magic and G.F. I just didnt.But what got me was the story. The Game has BIG parts that feel really epic - even today. Sure, the graphic didnt age very well but hey, the cutscenes are still really enjoyable. If you are ready to dive into the story and respect the love behind all the details, you will just fall in love with the characters. Probably even with the Villains. Its a more grown up story, its about love, loss and taking responsibility. its about friendship and obedience. well, its probably just about life - and the fact that everyone has problems.I enjoyed the game now for 16 Years and I will probably do so for the next 16 Years. If you have ever played an FF Game, you should grab it - Even if you just played the abominations FF13 and sequels. 10/10 !			"

MCINDUS Mods Guide!  FF8 Enhanced 
A Guide for FINAL FANTASY VIII
By: echoing.silently

			Hello! This is MCINDUS, and after making a bunch of tasty mods for you, I've decided to take some time out and make a guide. These are the mods that will give you the  most  out of your Final Fantasy VIII...		


 but it doesn't change the fact that this is one of my favorite FFs of all time. This was persoanlly enhanced by Rose and Wine mod which let me replace some of the OST in the game with the orchestral versions. It makes fights that much more intense.It has its issues but the story has managed to stay compelling with good character development after all these years. Also remember to close the bloody FFVIII launcher or else Steam will still think the game is still being played, hence why I have 23 hours instead of 5h and some change.			"

												I honestly love and hate Final Fantasy VIII at the same time.  I love the Draw ability but I hate that you’re punished with lower stats for using magic you’ve Drawn and Junctioned.  (Maybe percentages would have been better?)  I love upgrading weapons instead of buying/finding new ones but hate the lack of armor and the fact that monsters level with you.  I love refining magic and items from other items and making lower magics combine into bigger items, but turning monsters into cards to turn into items was somewhat tedious.  I love the music and the character designs, but by GOD I want to slap each and every one of them.The plot runs all over the place and reminds me of those assignments in writing class where you write a paragraph and pass it to your left.  You’re mercenaries, you’re assassinating a political figure, you’re a soldier in the past, you’re dealing with the moon and time travel...  perhaps a better translation would help.  It just feels disjointed and thrown together.As an older teen/young adult I felt Squall was a whiney, unsympathetic character.  Quistis was manipulative, Selphie cute and cliche yet harmless, Zell had SOME character development, and Irvine?  Screw him.  If you KNOW you’re going to freeze on a mission to save your home you better ask someone else to go!  And sharp shooters do NOT work alone, I hate that trope.  I didn’t like Rinoa but I didn’t hate her.  As an adult I thought I’d play the game again, and I understand Squall better, but I pity him now; poor kid’s got PTSD.  Would I recommend this game?  Sadly, no.  It’s just too tedious for me to play though so much I can’t stand to get to the parts I do like.  I’m not going to tell anyone not to play it, though.  Lots of people love this game for legitimate reasons, and more power to them.  It’s not a horrible game, just one I didn’t like.			"

												I'm really upset that I spent money on this game.  It crashes at random times thanks to some reason unknown.  Finally found in the forums that it might be the fact that I have an Nvidia GPU, and that the workaround is to restart your computer, and run FFVIII in windowed mode, with the smallest resolution, original graphics mode, and all graphic effects turned off.  Even then it doesn't always work.  I guess I can try playing it on my girlfriend's laptop, since it doesn't have an Nvidia GPU, but really, I should be able to play this on my own computer as long as my hardware is good enough, which by specs it is more than enough.

As an added bonus, the Steam release comes with Chocobo World, which is a separate application -- amazing!I've always had a soft spot for Final Fantasy VIII. I loved the captivating universe, I got used to the stock system rather quickly, I really enjoyed the over-the-top ability to break the conventions of 9,999 damage, and the crazy summons made my smile. The addition of Chocobo World is the icing on the cake.I LOVE IT :D			"

												Today's Review: Final Fantasy VIII Let me start by telling that i don't actually review old games but this is an exception because this is my favorite game of all times, so i'll start with story of the game itself and then i'll review the game.The name Final Fantasy actually comes from the last idea when the company was still Square, the whole company was about to be broken and they only have money for 1 more game, after that it would be the end, so they use the remmain of the money to make this ""Final Fantasy"". Was a big surprise for Square that they sold so many copies, revitalizing the whole enterprise, the only trouble was that they didin't think the game was gonna be a success so the first game didin't have an end to make a sequel, thenfore they came up with an idea of telling a complete different history for the second one, other characters, another world, enemies, etc. That's the reason why all FF games have different characters, enemies, a different world (with the exception of final fantasy X and X-2).Final Fantasy VIII (8) tells the story of Squall, the ""lone wolf"" an student commited to become a SeeD, the elite group of mercenaries that work for the 3 Gardens arround the world (Balan, Galbadia and Travia), having forgotten about his past, he believes to sort his problems alone, keeping people away from him as he revalizes with his nemesis Seifer. The game is set in a world with 4 continents (Balamb, Esthar, Travia, Centra and Galbadia), as the story developes Squall creates a bound with his friends and understand the meaning of life, trought this a story of War and Love it's the background for this game. The release of Final Fantasy 8 was in 1999 and even for that era the graphic quality it's overall exellent, soundtrack it's made for battles, cinematics and some other moments that determinates the tense situation by the music. Gameplay it's rol based (like most RPG characters lvl up, they can store and use magic and of course like any FF they have summons or eidolons here called GF or ""Guardian Force"")Metascore: 100/100 ""Best RPG game ever made, a solid buy and a beautiful work of Square""			"

												Well, this will be more of a rant, then informational so i do ahead of time apologise. I would not recomend this port at all!But, that is just me talking here!The music is horrible in midi, it really is one of the worst attempts i have ever heard and not even a single song in the entire game sounds decent or at all like its ment too. Its all extremely simplified in a bad way to make your brain explode! Well that part is a joke. The blame, what blame?Well, the answer for the music is due to Eidos.Well, you can't blame Eidos, it is infact illegal to use the same game music in the original format as it is used in the playstation format, they had to engineer their own. Which at the time they only had midi format, and that would be used for the pc port of Final Fantasy 8. So, at the end it isn't anyones fault, and is illegal to port the original ,music to the pc port due to the music and other aspects of Final Fanatasy were owned by sony and other parties at the time so they didn't have the right to use the matierials. And also needed to use a program that generated music that the computer was able to use.The score itself was legal. Odd...And downloading, or patching the original music to this port can be what some say illigal. Keep that in thought friends!The game is pretty much broken, the enemies change with your level, or better said,  the game makes a lame attempt to ballence your parties level with whatever your fighting... But the bosses don't really ballence at all. Either they are weak, or over powered ...The battle system is really badly put together in this game and you can be really cheap.. But that is just me and my anger to the drawing sytem and spending more time with my magic then the game itself, making up the hours lost in the game.. without drawign magic, this game would only be a good two disks long... but that is all filler my friends...If you are looking for a challange, look ellswere!Now when it comes up to the textures of the game, you have the option of switching between the ""new and improved"" smudge fest. ORThe original pc rendered enviroments, due to the playstation and the pc being different beasts. The well known wounderfull pre-rendered enviroments are so fuzzy it hurts your eyes to look at it.  Everything is horibly meshed together.Godly awful.... it makes you cryWell, ill tell you this, the graphic setting for my game, anyways it is a bit on the crazy side and really only matters to the party and some enviroments are on the original setting.To me.. imperfections in any game is what made it one of a kind...With the grapics, and the way i enjoyed it on the playstation is what made this game a lot more easier to enjoy and a lot more fun to play since what makes the game is the problems they have...They made squall and all the others look so .. smooth that it has no ballence to the backgrounds and the textures are so screwed up it was even hard to make out what was orginaly their and unatual.It is different then the playstation settings and ill tell you why. Well, when making a port you have to change a few things due to legal dues... and some tech issues... You have to, yes it is a have in many games in the past. They have to re-render the game so it can at least run of whatever system you maybe playing it on. For example, have you played recent games?Notice that some games do not play well of certain consoles, anyways they are released on them?That is due to the team not re-writing the code for the other system, yes it is very important!!!!!I am pleased to say, they did a good job on this port at least knowing they had to do exactly that. But in short...their isn't anything new, it is old and worn down to the bone..Their isn't anything really added, and nothing has been enhanced...Its just the pc port..... And that is really it......Now, when it comes up to the key mapping in this game....The controlls for the keyboard  are really bad.....with some of the envirements and what key to press, you have too and i mean, HAVE too study the screen with the keyboad outlay for a good two min.Be carefull you don't go crazy! Another lame joke of mine.Did you know, back in the day, people sat down and played games for hours just to find something at least wrong with it, like a cheat, crack, glitch and such just forth the shear enjoyment...What happaned to those days?!To those people?!To... oh whatever!Now, with the new and improved games of this centrary i don't see why people complain about games.... *besides companies being lazy and releasing an old pc port and calling it new to bang out a few bucks from their fans...* Yeah.. thats it.. But now, its all smoothed out and made for idiots that want what i call this the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child of all iedos butt babies... ewwPlease, if this is the first time you are playing this game and you see this on steam, save your money and time.Go on a great adventure and find it on the playstation 1, the  gameplay is smoother, the music is godly a lot better, and the graphics are classic and the enviroments make sence with the layouts and  your polygon and boxy body!If you do buy this game, read this..Buy a controller, it will make this game and some others you may have purchaced that have the compadibillity to use a gamepad controller..Any ways i call this game the ultimate quest for sloppy seconds.Hot and sloppy out of the oven!!!!The story makes not an ouce of sence...But at the end of it all it all boils down to this.. This game is a top of the line must play! Their are plenty of redeamable and wounderfull parts in the game, and the graphics still awe me till this day.Everything about this game is timeless and i do recomend this game, just go buy it on the playstation. Stop your achivements on steam and feel more rewarded.You know, the playstation is a realy wonderful system, and so is the playstation 2.... honor the systems by playing the games that were made of the systems on the systems!I think ports like this one are more usefull if it is for a game that the system is no longer found, sold, and made.... its not helpful to those who don't know...The playstation, ps2 is the mother, the father.. and cradle of some of the best jrpg, rpg games known to man... Go and get one and not only will you able to play the great ff8, but games like the Lunar games, Growlanser, Legend of Legia. Suikodien, Parasite Eve... you get the drift..Do it the right way and you will feel more rewarded!  But keep an open mind! Every game is always worth playing.Just so you all know, i clocked in the hours to make sure i made the right statements.. and wanted to be hounest and not just bash a game... i have played this game plenty of times over.. and all i can say... is this..Its okay... not amazing, not great!But okay.

												Squall is a badass.  That being said, there are some tonal issues in this one.  It seems like they thought maybe with the once again widespread popularity of Final Fantasy (after the greatness of FF7) they should cater more to kids...so we have a band of mainly high school aged nutcases and very little real drama (and where's the blood?).We watched Sephiroth slaughter an entire building of people in Final Fantasy 7 and stick a sword through Cloud's true love...here the most controversial element is that the main villain is married to the good guys' high school principal (which also just doesn't make sense).  And oh yeah, dumb spoiler alert...our heroes have all known each other since they were toddlers--but they all forgot!They were on to something with Laguna hitting on the chick at the beginning but they totally dropped the ball with story after that.  And what is with Squall's shunning of Rinoa, my God.  She was dangling from that ledge for like an hour...  If Shinji from Evangelion got together with Squall you'd have two of the most emotionally confused individuals in Japanese popculture.  The forever wimp and the mother of all angsty yet shy dark horses.The good?  Character design, some challenging battles, when Squall gets bulled by the jetpack-riding Galbadian soldier and they both fly out the emergency exit, Triple Triad, when Rinoa and Squall book it past a schoolyard full of soldiers and students throwing down, a few examples of gnarly music, once they reveal that Ultimecia jazz the story starts to pick up again...

												If you liked this game in the 90s and just want to play it again, or just want to buy it because you pirated it and you want to pay your moral debt, just do it, you will not regret it.For the ones who never played this game, my advice is to stay away.I think that this game wanted to be FFVII on steroids, sadly we got an unfriendly emo protagonist and a generic cast of characters (the only character that I liked was Laguna, and it appears very few times).I didn't like the story either, but something that I learned with FFX is that I can love a game with stupid story if the characters and the setting are compelling, but it's not the case in this game.

If you have not purchased FF7 yet then i would strongly recommend buying that as they have patched and improved it , has its original sound and even the graphics are a lil more crisp than when it was on PS1.

												Regrettably I can't reccomend this.Many people will play FF7 because they heard of it's justified legendary status and then think ""Wow, that was awesome, I'm going to buy the next game!""Well, stop. Square likes to experiment will final fantasy, sometimes for the better, sometimes for worse and this is one of the worse.In this case, they decided to drop MP in favor of ammo, drained from monsters and they decided to put in a lot of quick time events.The result is boring combat.Admittedly, the environments are nice and I honestly think the charactars have more charactar to them, but the combat commits the cardinal sin of being boring and clunky. Avoid this, emulate FF1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,10 or 10-2 instead.			"

No graphical reworks, which is ok; terrible audio, 100% garbage, it's not even close to being on par with the PS1 soundtrack. Online presence yada yada yada. Then there are the cheats. Sure, whatever, but at least keep them ""secret"" or at least not on the front page like an old game would be. Add it as a file in the game directory or something, it's extremely upsetting to see on the main launcher screen.Currently hooking my ps1 up just to cleanse my body and soul of this literal hunk of digital dog♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Note: My recommendation (or lack thereof) is based on the game itself. If you liked FFVIII and just wanted a port of it, then I can say I haven't had any issues with how it runs...although there was some stuttering in the ending cutscene.I really couldn't get into this game. I couldn't stand the characters from the get go, and on top of that the battle system is tedious as hell. Not only is there level grinding, but you have to actually manage your magic/stats inbetween characters on a very frequent basis. Repeatedly drawing magic from enemies over and over to make your units more powerful and if you actually use the magic you have pooled your characters become weaker again. It actively discourages the usage of magic which is so obnoxious. Everyone is also incredibly varied in terms of what stats you can assign magic to, so that's another thing that adds to the frustration. Overall I just felt like the battle system was too restrictive and unnecessarily complex. I don't mind if things are complicated if they can lead to battles where you really had to think, but honestly you just had to junction magic correctly and then just spam normal attacks, limit breaks, or summons. There's little to no variety required when fighting. To give you an example of how unvaried it is, I fought through every boss and enemy in the game solely by using summons over and over again until I got to the final boss...then I just spammed Zell's limit break to kill it. It was incredibly boring.On the note of the game being boring, my 160 or so hours of playtime for this game is a gross exaggeration. The reason it's there is because of how many times I'd fallen asleep trying to force myself to finish it.			"

												It's Final Fantasy VIII. It's dumb and mechanically broken, but, like me, you love it and want to buy it anyway. You probably shouldn't. Regrettably the emulation of a decade plus old game that is not sold commercially is packaged with incredibly intrusive DRM which prevents one from playing without a stable internet connections, and prevents one from even attempting to play whenever Square is experiencing server issues, such as, for example, right now. The game was purchased but cannot be played until Square sort out their end. A brief foray into the community hub makes it clear that this is not an isolated incident, and is rather something that keeps. on. happening.Unlike most of the internet, I don't have a problem with DRM. I'm not convinced it works, but it's not my money being lost to piracy, so if a company feels differently and wants to attack pirates this way then more power to them. However, when your DRM renders legitimate, paying customers physically unable to play your game then you've crossed the line into immoral practice. I have bought, and will now return, a game which cannot be played. It is not because of my computer or errors on my end, and it is not a problem unique to me. This is a widespread, known and recurring issue that Square have actively imposed upon their game.			"

												One of the most underrated part of the saga, especially from VII to IX on PSX. The port is horrible, music is in low MIDI quality, and the world map textures are in low resolution. They fixed the problems with FFVII on steam, and i hope that Steam will fix FFVIII too. If you want to buy this game, which is really really good i suggest you to wait a bit until it become fully enjoyable original PSX port.			"

												This is a bad game.  It is by far the worst Final Fantasy game and has almost no redeeming qualities.  The story is nonsensical and requires huge leaps of faith to follow.  The battle system of drawing magic from enemies sounds interesting on paper but in practice it is annoying and repetitive.  Junctions are confusing and require you to constantly be in the menus changing your junctions around.  GFs are mostly useless and I hardly ever summoned them in my playthrough.  Perhaps since I played this game for the first time just recently it was hard to appreciate the nuances of this game and when it came out but it certainly does not hold up like the previous Final Fantasy games. Overall, I am fairly dissapointed with this game and I hope that Final Fantasy 9 will be a better experience.			"

												inb4 fanboys mark this review as unhelpful because I didn't give it a 10/10.Bear in mind that I am reviewing this game from the 2015 point of view, having not played it back in its day, and I have zero nostalgia for it.Giving a review for this game is extremely difficult. It has a lot of interesting systems that make it one of the most interesting Final Fantasy games in the series. On the other hand, everything that is good and interesting about the game is opposed by a nearly equal ammount of convoluted or just plain terrible design decisions that will frustrate a modern player to no end. Some of this stuff may have been able to fly on the PS1 back in 1999, but in 2015, this stuff can grate your nerves. So let me try to point out the good and bad.DRAW SYSTEM - THE GOOD: The draw system refers to the fact that characters don't have personal magic on them at all times. Instead, magic is reduced to consummable items (e.g. to cast Blizzaga, you will need to use 1 blizzaga item). To get more spell items, you have to ""draw"" them (i.e. steal them) from enemies. The number you get is random. Sometimes you get zero or one, but a lot of times you'll get 5 or 6 at once. Each enemy has a menu of spells you can steal from. More useful and powerful spells can only be stolen from mini-bosses, bosses, and rare enemies. Once you've stolen the spell items, you can use them in combat or you can fuse them to specific stats to boost a character's parameters, like boosting fire def, or adding fire to their attack, or increasing HP or vitality, etc. You have the option to either steal the enemy's spell (add it to your inventory) which just gives you the item and ends your turn, or you can cast the enemy's own spell at the enemy party immediately.DRAW SYSTEM - THE BAD: As much as all of the above is interesting, you may find it frustrating that spells are essentially just items. You may also find it frustrating that, in order to stock up on specific spells (especially more rare ones), you just waste a lot of turns usings your characters to steal, steal, steal, etc etc 100 times. Stealing the spells is primarily useful for boosting parameters. The guardians (who we'll discuss in a moment) are so powerful that actually using the spells in combat is only sometimes---but rarely---useful.GUARDIAN SYSTEM - THE GOOD: The game calls them ""guardian forces"" for some reason, but let's call them what they really are: summons. So this game decides to make summons front and center. You collect new summons as you go through the game, which can be assigned to any character. Every summon has its one powerful spell it can cast, but if you grow each summon (like a pokemon!) it can become more powerful, boost the parameters of the ally using it, give the user more skills/abilities, or allow the user to summon it into battle more quickly. The summons are powerful, and you will want to use them a lot.GUARDIAN SYSTEM - THE BAD: The summons are so powerful that you will want to use them almost exclusively. Physical attacks and magic attacks are, on average, so pathetic compared to summoning that you will only end up using physical/magic attacks ""just for fun"", or in the rare circumstances when you need to beat some enemy's gimmick. (basic attacks get better over time, but do you really want to wait 60 hours for them to get better?) What about elemental weaknesses? Yeah, enemies have them, but if its a choice between casting firaga or summoning Ifrit on them, what are you going to do? You'll spam Ifrit. Managing the guardian forces is also laborious. It's about as exciting as meticulously shifting all of your materia gems around in FF7, only it involves an even more convoluted system of sub-screens, and sub-sub-screens, and even sub-sub-sub-screens. If I were new to RPGs, I would have quit this game out of frustration just on account of its dogpiled menus. Also, even though the game has TONS of summons to find, you will absolutely miss the vast majority of them unless someone tells you in advance that most of them can only be stolen from bosses (via the ""draw"" command) or under special circumstances. You essentially need a strategy guide opened up as you play, if you don't wanna miss a ton of them. Also, the summon animations are sooo long. They are painfully long. And since they are the focus of the game, you have to sit dumbly and watch them a lot. This is slightly improved when they level up enough to learn ""boost"", which allows you to play a button tapping mini-game to pass the time during the animation and raise the attack power of the summon, but 1) you'll have to check a strategy guide to learn how boost works, because the game can't be arsed to explain it; 2) they are sooo long though.CHARACTERS - GOOD: In-game character models look much better than the dopey FF7 ones, although their faces do look kinda pinched and weird. Squall always looks cross-eyed, but I accept that because it amuses me. The characters and story get more attention and are overall more appealing than FF7 in my opinion.CHARACTERS - BAD: A lot of cliche (but that's typical of JRPGs). Squall is a stereotypical angsty and brooding I-hate-everything-and-have-a-bad-attitude-leave-me-alone-and-get-out-of-my-room emo teenage boy type. At least at first. As a teenage boy I would have thought he was the coolest. As a grown man, I find him immature and irritating. He gets better. Oh, and as much as other FF8 fans have told me they like the segments, you also will have your game and story progress continually interrupted by a ""Biggs and Wedge"" sequence, where you have to play through a complete dungeon and story sequence as some characters you don't know. After you play a lot of them, they will start to tie into the main story more and make more sense, but for a long time they are complete non-sequiturs. Who are these people? Why do I care? Can this just be over so I can go back to Squall and friends? What is the point of this? Maybe you'll dig it, but these felt like disruptions (or interruptions) to me, so I didn't care for them.OTHER - BAD: Convoluted menus. Fails to explain some game features completely or gives very poor explanations of other features (there is a tutorial/guide available, but its helpfulness varies). While the draw/guardian (aka steal/summon) systems are interesting in a lot of out-of-combat ways, they also make the inside-combat part of the game feel lopsided and weird. Plus they require an inordinate amount of fiddling in menus---as bad as fiddling with materia gems or worse (but, hey, some people love all of that fiddling, so if that's you, have fun). The game also some very bad dungeons in it, such as one dungeon consisting of 15 copy-pasted floors of the exact same doughnut-shaped room you have to run completely around (i.e. poor design trick used to make you trip more random encounters while not caring enough to make the dungeon any more interesting). The game is also a completely clutz when it comes to save points. Don't be surprised if you are made to sit through 30-minutes of unskippable story sequences and then ambushed with a boss fight you had no way of knowing was coming. No saves. If you die or forget to steal the guardian force, prepare to do that entire 30-minute boring story sequence again. This doesn't just happen once. It is a repeat problem. The game tends to suck at save point placement in general.Steam only allows thumbs up or thumbs down, when what I'd like is a pair of shrugging shoulders that says ""mixed feelings"". You might like it! But for me personally, in 2015, the number of tiny annoyances, deliberate inconveniences, and questionable or convoluted design choices just adds up to me banging my head against the wall a little bit too often. Like the world's cutest dog that also won't stop sh***ing on the floor, it is a thing I feel compelled to love with all my heart but equally as often feel compelled to drop off on the side of the road.

												Most of the people here seem to give their thumbs up because of nostalgia. I never played this game before, i never owned a console,so I am rather unprejudiced. I played FF 7 some time ago and actually liked it.FINAL FANTASY VIII plays very much like an interactive novel. While it is technically an open world game, this world is pretty much empty aside from the storyline. If you know that something like that will bother you, there is no reason to read on.You will only like this game, if you like its story:At the beginning of the game you are a young elite mercenary, who is just about to finish his final tests to become a full fledged member. This guy is antisozial, lacks understanding of his own emotions and has trust issues. The story is pretty much a coming of age story, with topics like taking on responsibility, friendship, first love, etc.. I would say the story is mostly aimed at 12 - 15 year olds. While it is certainly not an award-winning story it is not too bad either and it is always hard to treat those topics without getting too cheesy.I actually like the graphics and have the impression that the game aged pretty well. Sadly the port is not well made. If you decide to pick it up, i would advice you to get the roses and wine mod. This mod introduces better music and volume control for the music. And you will absolutley want this volume control after a few hours X).Now we come to the gameplay (running around and fighting) which is simple no fun. I will not go into detail. I am sure that this has already been discussed ""in great detail aka with much swearing"" somewhere else. I felt pretty OP from the start. The battle system is laborious, while not being complex. This is the biggest game design sin for me. It's a little bit like the game gives you a hundred buttons you can use and a big red one that says press me. Why press all the other buttons if the big one does the trick. The draw system makes this game extremly grindheavy and slow paced. What actually really infuriated me during gamplay was the way the game spams you with absolutly powerless and meaningless enemies. I would say 90% of all battles fall under this categorie. In the most extreme cases the enemies are so weak, that you could let the battle go one for 20 mins without doing anything and still win. If you played pokemon just imagine a game that constantly nags you with fighting safcons. This, combined with the fact that you often run around aimlessly, can aggravate even the most patient person. (I think the only reason why these enemies do exist is as refueling stations. Yes you actually heal yourself up by fighting them.)The last thing I have to say about this game is, that it does a pretty bad job at communicating what you can interact with. While I expect that some people will call this exploration, I think people should not have to go around clicking at and bumping into things in their spare time. This behavior is normally reserved to insects (flys and windows).I played this game only till the end of disc 2, so everything i wrote here does not inlclude the following chapters. All the issues i described here were present from minute one. I only played so far because i thought the game might get better at later stages. It did not up to that point. I can understand everyone that likes the game. The presentation is pretty much spot on, the gf animations are pretty cool and the story is not bad either. But the actuall gameplay isn't even mediocre. For me gameplay trumps everything else, so i give this game a thumbs down. "

												After hearing about the unneccesarily complicated Junction system. The HORRIBLY annoying Draw system that has you STEALING magic from enemies because learning spells and using MP to cast them was too easy. I came to the conclusion that this is the second worst Final Fantasy game after Final Fantasy 13. After 20 hours into the game I can honestly say, that I will probably never finish this game.The characters are AWFUL. Squall starts off as an emo kid, he warms up later but he still whines the entire way there.Zell is a mental deficient, he has a tribal facial tattoo and he punches things. That's his character.Selphie is a brain dead stereotypical blonde.Quistis is best girl, she has a whip and I'm into that.Rinoa is the forced romance that is also your mortal enemy Seifer's sloppy seconds. (Spoony was here)And Irvine is the womanizer that no one cares about, he's also a sniper that doesn't have the guts to actually snipe someone he was HIRED to snipe.The characters, the progression/magic system and completely insane time traveling plot make this one of the worst Final Fantasy games out there. The only way you can defend this game is out of shear nostalgia. It's not fun to steal magic from monsters for hours just to have 100 magic spells for each party member that you need to not only CAST in battle. But to also JUNCTION them to your stats to make your characters stronger. Some people say ""oh just play Triple Triad"" Triple Triad being the game's obligatory card game that allows you to collect cards that you can later use to gamble for better cards or straight up salvage the cards into items and spells) If your answer to fixing an annoying and detracting aspect of a game, is to play a minigame that detracts further from the actual game JUST SO YOU CAN PLAY THE REAL GAME WITH SPELLS. You are part of the problem with game design.			"

												Awash in nostalgia, I waiting many hours for the download to complete, then launched the game, ready to play.  But, upon launching the game, I was prompted to log in with my Square Enix account.  Why, you ask, would I have to log into my Square Enix account when I'm already logged into Steam?  I can only guess that SE doesn't trust Valve to handle networking and antipiracy.  Regardless, I already had an SE account from FFXIV, so I just entered my credentials.  Instead of getting to play the game, it prompted me to go to membership.square-enix.com to ""migrate"" my account.  I opened my browser, typed in the URL (because it wouldn't let me highlight and copy the text), and clicked an option to sign in with steam.  I waited... and got ""No data received"" as the result.  I tried refreshing, to no avail.  I tried reentering the original URL, again to no avail.  I've been trying to play this game for hours now, but I can't because, unlike the rest of the internet, SE's website won't load, and there doesn't seem to be any ""offline play"" mode.  If you haven't already dropped money on this download, my advice is to find a used copy of the Playstation version.			"

												Let me start off by saying, I love the Final Fantasy series, my favourite game series of all time actually and I'm proud to have them all. But VIII? Man... So much lost potential. Though there are a handful of people that will say otherwise saying its their favourite installment. But still.Lets start with the positives. The music, as with all FF's, is fantastic, honestly one of my favourite soundtracks in the series. The graphics, for the time at least, are beautiful, the FMV's are flawless and in this updated texture version makes it all the better. This game also has some of the most relateable characters in the series.However thats all the positives I have honestly. The negatives? Its such a slow game, like I've only just been playing 32 minutes and haven't had a single battle yet. Thats not to say later on there isn't a lot of battling, because there is. But still, on the subject of battling, this also has one fo the worst battle systems in FF (though not as bad as XIII). Unlike with, lets say, EVERY OTHER RPG, MP has been replaced with simple uses. So you have 6 uses of fire, then you need to get more. How does one get more? By taking (drawing as its called in game) it from monsters. This is one fo the most tedious processes I have ever had to sit through as believe me, you will be doing it, A LOT. There is far too much junctioning (adding magic to your stats to improve them etc) that makes it seem mor elike a math test than a RPG. The story is mediocre and... just my god. Then there is the fact that in this version of FFVIII the sound files are aweful as they currently use the Midi files from the original 90's release in the 90's. I also noticed some audio glitches in the opening cutscene. However FFVII had this issue and Square eventually replaced those, so I presume they will do it with this too. There are also A few minor, but noticible graphical glitches.So unless your a hardcore FF fan or your one of the odd balls that liked this game, avoid it, otherwise, wait for a 50% off or something.

												Looking back, it's not the masterpiece that I thought it was, back when I played it on PS1. After replaying it thrice, I realized that the whole thing ends up being an intentionally addictive and time wasting game with many flaws. -The characters are mostly 2 dimentional and forgetable (the main character has the charisma of a soggy french fry and is very, very unlikable).-Some pauses in the scripted scenes are tedious to endure (Lucky for many, there is a fast forward button that comes in handy every time)-The fact that you need to draw magic (up to 9 units every turn, if you're lucky) by grinding it from enemies, until you've maxed them at 100 each, or until you get around it by using GF abilities, adds HOURS to the game!-The game kinda makes you junction depletable magic to your stats, therefore penalising the use of most magic spells.-Even Chocobo World ends up being a tedious minigame that will have you wasting hours on the premise of gaining just a few items usable in FF VIII (Not that I was expecting much from a pocketstation game).-This isn't a dealbreaker for me, but the music quality has suffered a noticeable downgrade, and there have been many complaints about it. (SPOILERS... kinda)-The love story between Squall and Rinoa seems forced and contrived, and yet, the whole game revolves around it.-Don't want to play triple triad? go on... you'll just miss on a bunch of swell items, items that are necessary to beat late game monsters like Ultima and Omega weapon, that otherwise are a pain, if not downright impossible to beat without.-You gotta wait your sweet time to finally be able to drive the garden arround and explore the world, and you gotta wait even longer to get your hands on that shiny ruby red Ragnarok (and therefore being finally able to scout the entirety of the globe).I won't recomend this game, since there are better games in the FF franchise, buy it only if it is on sale or if you're a diehard FF fan. None the less, this old rascal still holds dear to me. and maybe that's saying something.			"

												Playing Final Fantasy VIII a decade and a half later reminded me how to cringe again.The story starts out with a pointedly anime premise--teenagers at school falling in and out of drama. Squall, who I promptly renamed, has the emotional capacity of a rock for the entire first disc. However, he actually develops as a character later in the game; including a funny moment when Rinoa (renamed Rhino) carefully explains that he needs to convey his thoughts aloud or the others won't understand him. That said, many of the side characters are forgettable, including Zell, who enjoys hot dogs and punching things. The game's love story almost works, but Squall spends most of his time oblivious to Rhino's desperate attempts to be noticed. Very cringeworthy. Around disc 4, the game takes a hit of acid and drops us into time compression, which kind of looks like a Salvadore Dali painting. Entertaining, but batshit crazy.I go back and forth on the gameplay. Triple Triad is excellent (nominated for a Steam award--best game within a game), but its distribution of rules around the world is crippling. Junctioning scratches my itch of watching numbers get higher, but the way information is visually presented is rough at best, and I found myself wishing for a more modern UI. The world map is huge, but largely void of content--especially compared to FFIX, which is full of glorious treasures. Guardian Forces are fun to hunt down for their unlockable abiliies, but the summons themselves don't do nearly as much damage as a normal attack, and they're unskippable. Yep. Maybe there's a mod for that.The music is excellent as always (thanks Uematsu), however the game defaults to ear-splitting midi unless you make a point of downloading the original tracks like I did. The 1999 graphics obviously aren't great, although many of the full motion videos are still quite entertaining, especially when you're able to control a 3-D character in many of the ridiculous battle scenes, such as when the enormous floating ""garden"" schools collide.Do I recommend this game? No, but that didn't stop me from playing it through. I expected a♥♥♥♥♥♥show, and that is what I got. Two thumbs up!			"

												Final Fantasy VIII was such a terrible game. I feel bad buying it on the Steam Marketplace (during the summer sale). It is just a nostalgia game, like how Dragon Ball Z is just a nostalgia anime; it sucks terribly, but we have fond childhood memories of it. Final Fantasy VIII had a combat system that made every single character the exact same, without any differences. None of them had any real differences, except limit breaks. The graphics were terrible, even for its time. Final Fantasy VII, its predecessor, had better gameplay graphics (less pixelated individuals and backgrounds; even though the models were much more simple). The game is more based on waiting than anything. It has no strategy, as the closest thing it has to complexity is ""use the summon that does its weakness against the enemies"". Your basic attacks do nearly no damage, and your summons will almost never die (unless you are really stupid), so there is never any point in doing anything (other than buffing your party with haste/debuffing the enemies); which each summon takes about 30 seconds to do its animation. The animation is so ♥♥♥♥ing repetitive that it is not even funny. You can't even customize your weapons or armor; past the tiny amount where you can find blueprints (maybe) to create slightly better weapons (barely a noticeable difference). The dialogue, transitions, story, and character connections are so badly written that I honestly have no idea what I am doing or what my motivation to do said action is half of the time. Literally, there is no reason, past working in the same organization, that most of these characters should be working together. They are all forced to gravitate around this annoying emo character, Squall. Literally he does nothing to show he is leadership material and only continues to push people away like an♥♥♥♥♥hole, and for some reason everyone seems to go ""HEY LEADER! WE LOVE YOU. TELL US WHAT TO DO"". The only seemingly proper relationship between characters that would make sense (friendship or anything more) would be between Zell and Selfie, but I am 14 hours into the game and I can not remember them speaking to each other even once (if they did speak to each other, then it was such small chat that it is not even registered in my memory bank), instead they just continue to go ""Hey guy that is a complete♥♥♥♥♥hole to us and does nothing but mope around all day, you are our leader and we think you are just the coolest bean"". There is not character relationship building, past Quistis and Squall, which seemed interesting in the beginning, because they seemed to have some sort of love interest type thing going for them, but it is suddenly dropped for no reason and never brought up again; it was mostly Quistis going ""Squall, I was your instructor and I know you so well over the amount of time I have been teaching you. You act like a less talkative version of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I can't stand what so ever, but I think I will show romantic interests in you anyways"", while Squall goes ""Get the ♥♥♥♥ away from me, you don't understand my pain. CRAWLING IN MY SKIN!"". By the way, I am so far into the game and I still have no idea why Squall is such an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who seems to be depressed all the time, he just is... It is his character, he is just an unlikable ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that people are FORCED into loving (for no explained reason).But seriously, this game is so ridiculously cringeworthy. I have not played a game worse than this in a while, but seriously. This is why you don't play games from your childhood; you will find out the game you used to love is actually a steaming pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ There are so many discrepancies I have with this game that I have not even voiced. I really do not recommend this game; it is easily a 3/10 game. I may try and finish it, but only when I get extremely bored; it is not worth the ridiculous amount of time it takes to complete it.

If you're not summing a Guardian Force over  and over and over and over and over and over, you're attacking for EXTREMELY LOW damage.

												The Goods-Fantastic Story line-Scaleable-Just like the original gameAh, my childhood.I don't understand why the early final fantasy games keep making me want to play them over and over D:.Either way. This port, sucks, just like the original. It seems only final fantasy 7 had a GOOD release port that seemed to not be virtually emulated through a cheap tactic of building a runtime for the game.Its not as bad of a port as final fantasy 13. Though, there is a lot of things they could have changed to make it feel, like an actual PC version.Over all, its a good game. but still, the game could be reworked to fit a PC custom more.The Bads-Completely original graphics: SURE, we have resolutions! but..I mean, this is awful. Some characters inworld are so blocky and hard to look at due to the significant upscaling thats taking place, and it gets much, much worse past 1080P (Deling city..LOL)-Controls: This game screams controller. No ifs, no ands, no butts. The keyboard layout doesn't even work right unless you have a controller. Its a game thats really bad as a port.-Need a Square Enix Account: This one is pretty self explanitory. Took a while to get that setup due to SE's slow network or, my email just is slow. either way, its another form of DRM really.-Cloud saves: This game has cloud saves, however it is not as bad as FF13-2 or FF7's cloud saving. Saves are instant and straight forward, however I have had a few moments where the saves did not update on the cloud, and the previous cloud saves were used, resulting in a backtrack of storyline, which annoyed me greatly.-Midi Music, Low quality video: Everything is upscaled or compressed in this game. Videos are not that great looking, and to be honest. I feel if i had the PSX version it would look, and play better-Locked framerates: given, because of how the game was built. Both FF7 and 8 are like this.			"

												It's higher definition, but it's not High Definition - like an upscaled half-arsed attempt. I always considered this game my favourite and I've been itching to play a remade polished version but...The textures are blown up, but not refined to HD standards, seeing as this is what covers a majority of the gametime, one would presume some attempt at bringing them to todays standards would have been made.The videos are absolutely gorgeous however.I don't recommend this if your looking for a refined polished off, 2014 standard of gaming visuals, slightly laggy playback of cutscene's and the occasional code retardation causing crash to desktop and on good days, crash everything *hits restart button manically*. As you'll play it for a handful of min's, reminisce about the god old' times when it was on the early consoles and then never pick it up again.I do recommend it for the story and if you have never played it before.Edit: Still waiting for the glitchy graphics to be fixed...

I dont like the way you get money, you dont earn it through battles, you get a check so relly theres no point in fighting all the battles you get into since you barely level up or get money.

												Edited after someone pointed this out. My gametime on this review is wrong. I made it much further than turning the dang game on. Sorry about that confusion.Ok. First off. Final Fantasy 8 is a fun game. I played it when it first came out and I go back to it every so often. Go out and get it. It has some problems, but it's still worth playing.THAT BEING SAID, DO NOT BUY THE STEAM PORT!It's not even a POOR port. This is a money grab. Exploitative and lazy. The music and sound quality is trash. The textures are janky. The controls are agrivating (8 directional movment with a joypad). These things added on to the inherent problems with the game it'self (draw system, weapon progression, earning Gil) make this game so much worse.Honestly. With the level of neglect and greed in releaseing this game in this state, the only grade I can give this game is Steam Shovleware. and good god does that hurt me.			"

												In this reporter's opinion, not nearly as good as FF10, FF7, or FF9 (I blame this game for the general disregard of FF9) it's still a well made JRPG.  There aren't enough of these on steam, so I'd advocate for this until better ones pop up.  If you haven't played it before, it's a decent quality game.  It would have been a good game on it's own without the expectations of quality that come from a Final Fantasy title (older one anyway.)There are a few gripes with this game that are pretty massive, this version does a decent job at addressing them hence the recommendation.A) The Draw system is probably the most stupid thing to ever exist, you need to draw spells from the ground (benches and other dumb things) and from monsters to use spells.  The spells themselves are pretty limited, there aren't a whole lot of spells which is what I look for in any RPG.  That said, in this version you can actually cheat and give yourself the spells so you can disregard this terrible system.B) The length of time to use a summon.  You apparently are still unable to skip the graphics and they take an asinine amount of time to go off.Those are the two main gripes with the game.  Those two gripes aren't enough to not play the game, they are just nuisances.  I'd recommend picking it up for the fact that it's still a quality RPG all the downsides considered.			"

												Don't buy this. Buying this encourages more of these hack ports by Square Enix.This is one of the worst ports on steam. Worse than stock Deadly Premonitions or Dark Souls. Hideous without mods, and the existing mods don't help much because there are apparently no high-res background renders in existence. Whatever you do, don't contribute to its sales. If you buy the game used and want so support Square Enix, write them a check, in no convince them that this is acceptable.Parts of the game have been upscaled, such as the character models.Other parts are left the same, such as backgrounds of areas. The world map is also hideous, despite being rendered exactly like the character models.Even with the worse overall graphics, you should play this on an actual PS1 or use certain non-steam-discussible methods to ""emulate"" that experience. The difference in quality between character models and backgrounds causes lots of shocking realizations, like the fact that any NPC that doesn't move is PART OF THE BACKGROUND and not an actual model.The core gameplay is here, no doubt. But this is the ugliest way to play the game. There are mods that attempt to fix it, but they aren't that great. Other games with similar technology from this gen like resident evil had PC ports with higher resolution backgrounds that can be patched into any version of the game. For whatever reason, this isn't the case here, and the only mod you'll find of ""hi res backgrounds"" is a photoshop gaussian upscaling.Oh yeah, and despite the game having 0 online elements, it includes a sub-GFWL quality always-online DRM system that won't let you play it or access your saves without a cloud account and internet connection. If you lose internet, it actually forces you to stop playing the game right then.Squall wept.			"

												I looked at this game with the vision of the game being almost the same as the playstation version. Instead I get a confusing log in screen, confusing buttons, problems with using an xbox controller, horrible music, bad boost mechanics, etc... I am so disappointed in this release that I would rather play a broken ROM version then the one I bought. Just because they sell it for 12 dollars does not mean the game should be shoved out before it is anywhere finished. First let's start with the music. IT IS TERRIBLE! What was used to remake this music? I don't mind that they tried to update the music for the game, however why make it so bad that I need to turn off the volume and listen to other music just to suffer through the already bad mechanics too. The fantastic music from before is what I want to hear. Why didn't they put in an option to play the original music from the PS1 port? I could then take whatever else is wrong and play the game with a semi smile on my face. Please fix this!I really don't want to draw this out too long but PLEASE fix the problem of using an xbox controller or any controller on your games! I should not have to download a secondary program just to play your game with a controller! Also make your option screen where you change keybinds a little more understandable too. Half of the buttons you need to keybind are confusing. Those who don't know that (Rotate Right) is the (Trigger Button) let alone it doesn' t even show in game what the button is except saying use B3 or something. FIX YOUR GAME			"

Once you have waited for that you get the menu picture wait there for 5 minuets and it starts the 100s of black and white photos again this game is broke ---DO NOT BUY---			"

												I always enjoyed the idea of the final fantasy series. The Japanese design and story telling, the intricate combat systems. The last in the series that I played was FFX, probably the last in the I enjoyed. However, before everything went full 3D and went turbo serious, FF7 existed; and changed the gaming world completely. Clearly FF8 had a tough job to follow, and from what I have seen playing this game (again), it failed in my eyes.You see, the flaws are not apparent because of the differences in combat, or these intricate systems. It is the execution of nearly all aspects of this game that a sub-par.In FF7, you were gently lead into the complex systems (such as the Materia system). In FF8, they try to smack you on the head almost as soon as you take control of your character. People claim that the complexity of the combat 'Junction' system is why the game is hated so. But I don't think it is that simple. What I have noticed is that the UI system is clunky to use. Too many sub menus, so many things all happening on the screen; a 'downgrade' to the UI in FF7 which was very tight and compact. The Junction system itself doesn't really fit into the fantasy canon, nor does it blend well into the game world they created. It's just clunky like the control system it is built from.This design creeps into other areas, such as the characters and their visuals. They are simply too annoying. Ugly to look at (Zell's skinny legs?). Selphie is seemingly useless. Questis is the only decent character, combat wise, but you can't take control of her again until much later in the game.The only thing that makes sense in the whole story is... well.. none of it. There is a fan theory [1] that Squall actually dies at the end of act 1, and the remainder of the game is a fantasy where he gets to kill the superior fighter, Seifer; win the girl, and saves the world all in the last dying minutes of his life, in a kind of dilated dream state.If you don't apply this theory then the game can only be looked at as the worst story telling and plot in the FF series. However with the fan theory in mind, it may be a master stroke of story design; but this is totally lost on its own fans because it is far too subtle.The story wouldn't be so bad if the characters and their animations weren't so tedious. It is strange because FF7 had less definition, yet more personality. This time round, I made it half way in act 1, and had enough. For me this is a game that rested on high fidelity graphics and CGI. Sadly, it doesn't live up to an enjoyable experience because of the audio, story, characters, game-play, mechanics, and even the controls.[1] http://squallsdead.com/ "

												Look, I played and beat FF the seventh and so I thought 'hey this one must be bretty good, oi m8?' and then a giant robot spider comes after you for 3 to 6 lifetimes and it becomes very annoying very quickly. I tried to outrun it but it jumped over-head on this tight one person bridge and prevented me from getting past it at all. If you are a giant robot crab spider and you can just jump the entire length of a bridge to stop my forward progress, then why not just jump on top of me and kill my face in? I cannot recommend this game, just go play the 7th one and pretend that cloud has black hair really hard and its the same thing but slightly less frustrating and with mako energy juice			"

												As a long-time fan of the older Final Fantasy games (up to the tenth), I adamantly say that this one completely blows. It is not good. This game is the Phantom Menace of the Final Fantasy series. The story and writing are nauseatingly awful, the characters, every one of them, are obnoxious and unlikable, and many plot elements, including the major twist, come out of nowhere and are simply stupid. ***SPOILER*** It turns out that most of the playable characters were children at an orphanarium together, and the fake main bad guy was their caretaker. None of them realize this until the end because of hamfisted amnesia, the lamest trope of all. Whaaaaat? ***END SPOILER***For completion's sake and out of loyalty to the series, I made myself buy this game and play it through to the end. I hate it, and I want it fully recognized as the atrocity it is. Eat me, Final Fantasy VIII. Eat me with a side of Gysahl greens, you miserable hot mess.			"

												*****beware spoilers below*****  this is the worst game in the series in my opinion.... the story is okay but what really kills the game is the 2 stupid plot twists regarding an orphanage and GF memory loss, and the stupid junction system. the junction system could have been fixed, but square decided to rush it's development. if the 2 stupid plot twists were completely removed then the story would be much better. and as far as the junction system goes it shouln't matter how many of one spell is on a stat, it should just matter if the spell is equiped.if your tempted to buy this game, only get it to complete your final fantasy collection and only when it's on sale otherwise give this game a pass. FF7 is a much better game			"

												Ehhhhhh.I could probably just leave this review at that, but I should probably give you a little more. There is a reason I have no playtime thus far on this version. It's a struggle to convince myself to play it again.This game, for me, is one of the weakest in the series. People say that graphically it greatly improved on its predecessor but in all honesty, I PREFER looking at VII to looking at this. I understand they were going for a more ""realistic"" look, but this is a fantasy series after all. I just...don't feel like it worked. A lot of the environments are without a doubt beautiful, but I really don't like the character models.And speaking of the characters...oh boy. Flatter than cardboard cutouts, for the most part. There is virtually no development here (which is a crying shame in a series KNOWN for its well-written characters) and when there IS development, it is minimalistic and poorly-explained, solely for plot convenience (THAT scene that links the characters, anyone? Ugh.) Also, the majority of the characters aren't even that likeable to begin with - many are simply outright obnoxious. It made a lot of sense to identify with them when I was of school age, but I look back on it now and it has NOT aged well.The plot. Well, it's a headache. This is an example of time-travel done badly (if you want time travel done WELL, watch Dr Who or, better yet, play Chrono Trigger.) Nothing is explained clearly, or even in an attempt to clarify itself. It's hard to link any event or motivation for anyone in this game doing anything at all. And those flashbacks. I am all for flashbacks if they work, but these just seemed rather jarring. I have played ths several times on the Playstation with an attempt to make sense of it and I just...can't. I'm sorry.Since I've totally slated the game so far, I may as well tell you what I DO like. The music is a definite highlight, particularly the ominous villain themes involving piano and Latin chorus. The theme of the final dungeon gives me chills whenever I hear it. The environment themes do fit nicely, and they represent the mood of each area and event really well.The Draw/Junction system, whilst often a point of contention, is something that I actually enjoyed. It's very unique and lends an enormous degree of customisation to how the game is played through managing stats and abilities. Combat itself is fluid and pretty, and the summoning system is excellent.I struggled for a while over which thumb to click here. In my opinion, the fundamental flaws of poor characters and poor storytelling just overshadow everything else, so I'm having to click ""not recommended."" With that said, different people like different things, and I would still advise you to try it for yourself. FFVIII is not a terrible game, but it is also very far from being a great one.			"

												TL;DR:Cast Fire on Ifrit : Ifrit loses HP.2/10 bad game is bad.On the longer version, the quality of a Final Fantasy can be measured around 2 major things:1°) Quality of story2°) Quality of gameplayI won't be talking a lot about the story, it is what it is, as far as I am in the game, i'm still not really impressed, but I wasn't that much impressed with the VII, so...On the gameplay part though, the game is just plain bad. The whole system revolves around Geforces and associations. Which in parts is not bad, the general idea is good but in practice, it doesn't make for a good system.First, there are no real limits on the casting of Geforces, so you could just spam invoke them to win fights (you can!), and they will take damages for you, so it's a win/win.Second, the association system implies having specific spells in quantity in your inventory, so in theory, you shouldn't use them at all, otherwise you're just weakening your characters. If you do, you just have to draw the spells over and over again, which is a little tiresome.The limit system also is kind of a letdown, the system to acquire them is ok, but to cast them you need to be low on HP, which... Well, why would you want to? Worst part is, the system is not even very clear on what is ""low HP"", sometimes, the health bar is yellow but you can't actually cast the limit.There are a lot of those ideas that could make the game good in theory but just fail to achieve anything in the game.You would better consider practically any other FF game, VII, IX and X...

I'm not sure if this was a wide spred issue but after a while of playing i noticed the hearing in my right ear had gotten pretty messed up and was like that for a couple days. This could have been because of the mod i installed to replace the midi music. I also could not use the d-pad on my controller making navigating menus a pain and even screwing up some of the battles. Honestly if you play it anywhere i'd recemmond the ps3 version or maybe a ps1 emulator.			"

												Worst Final Fantasy of them all. Horrible gameplay (who thought junctions where a good idea?), unlikeable characters, dumb story (it's just one stupid thing after another, with no logic to support it at all) and to top it all, it doesn't even represent a challenge in any way, it's one of the easiest RPG that I've ever played. The only good thing in this game is Triple Triad, but that alone doesn't make it worth the many hours you must spent playing the rest of the game.Don't buy this game, it's not fun and it's not interesting in any way. If you want to play some FF buy FFVII or even FFXIII (but that one is not that great either).			"

												I can't fathom how this game is someone's favorite. It absolutely overhwhelms me with information from the beginning, which doesn't help because of how weird the gameplay mechanics are. I don't understand the point of GFs, having to watch the ridiculous animation every single time, and I don't get why I can't just spam them mindlessly and ruin the purpose of the battle. I also learned that the game timer runs while the game is paused. I'm not sure how you're supposed to take a break from the game when it forces you into a timed escape sequence with an in-escapable boss which chases you through the whole area.The pacing with bosses is ridiculous. In the first actual area in the game following the tutorials (don't get me started on the Fire Cavern dungeon where I was supposed to know the timer ends when the boss is defeated and not when you leave the Cavern), the game keeps throwing party members at me and I have no idea who will stick, and who I should be levelling up. I have to fight a boss to pass just about every screen, some of which I can't defeat and can't escape. I already used all my potions on a huge boss fight just a minute ago, and I have deal with another one right away. That is way too much. Learn to pace the game better. I don't understand how this game is bearable. I don't want to know. I'm done with this game.			"

												The only things I really enjoy in this game is how rewarding grinding feels, and the design of summons and monsters. everything else is mediocre at best.This is probably the first Final Fantasy where i realized how important good characters and story is for a fantasy game, because this game has neither. Squall a moody ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, Zell is annoying, Selphie is a bumbly fluffball, Quistis is mostly there to fail as a leader, Rinoa is a moody japanese teenager and Irvine gets old the same second you realize what his shtick is. The story itself is about as strong as a warm slice of cheese, and the ending pretty much melts it all away in how lame it is. I have other issues, but nobody likes ranty reviews.For the record, i played this on PS1 originally, and rebought it on steam to see if it was as disappointing now as when i was a kid.It was.			"

But the game is really hard to get into. You basically have to start every battle sucking out magic from enemies, just so you can use your magic.

												If you ask someone which final fantasy is there favorite, it's easy to see why 8 is almost never the choice. tl;dr: FF8 falls flat on its face in so many ways that it's very difficult to justify paying for it. If you're looking at trying out one of the earlier final fantasies as a first time player, do not pick this one. Start with 7 or my preference, 9. Spoilers below:First off, mechanically, the game is a complete joke. You have to first understand the junctioning system which is so unnecessarily convoluted, and once you do understand it your characters are insanely overpowered and there is no challenge to the game. Typically I like the idea of ""The better player you are, the more powerful you are."" but this game does it poorly. Then the story relies so heavily on deus ex machina plotlines that it's hard to take seriously(The hero being able to randomly pilot a giant boat/ship out of no where? The hero being able to pilot an alien ship that also just happened to be close enough to prevent them from dying of oxygen deprivation in space?), that coupled with uninteresting or bland characters just makes this an absolute shame when it comes to being labeled a final fantasy game. The graphics and story scenes would be great at the time, but simply doesn't hold up. I can't honestly recommend this game to anyone who hasn't played it and isn't looking for nostalgia. You're making a much better purchase with final fantasy 7 or 9, both of which offer a much greater story and much more interesting gameplay.			"

												Absolutely terrible game. I recently played FF7 and really liked it, so moved onto FF8 expecting it to be even better. They took every good aspect of FF7 and ripped it out, then to replace the loss they took every bad aspect of FF7 and increased it to fill the gap.The script and dialogue of FF7, while not the greatest was pretty damn good. FF8 script and especially dialogue is atrocious. Battle system is dysfunctional.But there are prettier cutscenes.			"

												It is a time of war. Galbadia, a Global Superpower, has declared war on Dollet, a country whose training academy is home to two personalities: the hot-headed Seifer and the 'lone wolf', Squall Leonhart. Both are equally at conflict with each other as their country is with Galbadia; to others, Squall appears lacking in team spirit, while Seifer lacks the discipline of his rival. However, a chance encounter with the free-spirited Rinoa Heartilly turns Squall's universe upside down; having thrived on discipline, Squall find the carefree Rinoa fascinating. He also begins to dream that he is Laguna Loire, a Galbadian army soldier… Meanwhile, a sorceress manipulates the most powerful men in Galbadia. Will Squall and his party succeed in defeating this maniacal sorceress and saving their world? What part does the mysterious Laguna play? Only you can decide what happens next, as the greatest Role Playing Adventure of all time returns...			"

												Here is your game if you ever wanted a more random final fantasy game with hardey any enemy variety.  Do you like it when playstation games have stories that say to go to places with no clue to where they are and force you to use a guide to figure out where to go repeatedly throughout the story?  Then this the game for you.  An added special feature is you have to equip junk to all your stats and attack and defence instead of wearing gear, but the game repeatedly unequips all this stuff during story transitions and has you keep swapping characters after short levels and random nonsense flashbacks.  I guess it was good that I didn't play this long on the playstation because they did add speed up to the PC version which was a good time saver.  Still gets my award for worse single player FF game ever.  At least the story was bizarre.  Sure, we all expect some crazy stuff at the end of a FF game where every one of them falls apart, but this one was pretty much messed up right from the start and just stayed all messed up till the end.  Don't forget to throw in a motorcycle and a trip to space since that stuff was popular on FF7.  It should work to just throw it in with no context.			"

												I had thought it might be the time or the memory that caused me to think so low of this thing.  But the magic system, the horrible style, that fits a bad Fantasy Star version, terrible weapon system.  The gun blade is a nice idea, Tripple Triad too, but damn if I don't just hate this thing.  I might fight myself through it, but I may end up refunding the mistake.  I think this inspired FF15 too, which is a major freak out.  At least the map is a little more free moving than FFX.  But the structures are so large and time consuming to move around.			"

												Square has joined the class of rentiers. It knows idiots like me will fork out money for these rereleases without it having to do a thing to earn it. Forget touchscreen capability, or even using a mouse to select from what is at heart an animated set of menus. Square wouldn't even let me bind the spacebar key to a function: letter keys only. Things like that make me suspect they are not in fact lazy, but actively vindictive. I stopped playing after an couple of hours of mangling my fingers, and my ears listening to the music, which sounds like it was recording using a metal guitar string stapled across an empty cat-food can. I used to love this game, but the pain of replaying it is not worth it.			"

												I do not recommend this game for new Final Fantasy players or players who have played the other main series games. In short, I will list the pros and cons of Final Fantasy VIII PC with a short explanationPros:-Great cutscenes-Better resolution-Junction system-Battle System-GFs (They can give you abilities to help you progress through the game)Cons:-Junction (The reason I put this as a pro and a con is that if you understand the junction system you can breeze through the game with no challenge at all)-GFs (Another one that is on both pros and cons and for the same reason as the junction system too, it takes the strategy and challenge out of the game)-Music (To be honest I love the FInal Fantasy VIII...in the original PS1 version. The PC music sounds like it was made from the MIDI progrm and sounds very, very bad. You need to use mods to make it sound better)-Drawing (You're spending 20-30 minutes drawing powerful magic from a enemy/boss when it can only take 5-10 minutes to defeat enemy/boss only to find out the powerful magic makes your stats worse...yeah no thanks.)-Enemies/Bosses get stronger each time you level up (Remember whenever you get stuck on a boss you get out of the area and start killing a bunch enemies so you can level up so you can finally beat that boss. What if everytime you level up that boss gets stronger. Well, this game does that and it's not good.Well that's my review on Final Fantasy VIIII'll give this game a 4.5/10			"

												Always considered one of the worse games in the saga, and as a matter of fact, it is.The battle mechanics was original, yet that doesn't mean it's nice to play. Having to draw all the spells from enemies it's time consuming and BORING. Furthermore you need to save them if you are going to Junction the spells to your stats (which you totally are) so it makes the magic system useless, you practically can finish the game by abusing of the ATTACK command.The plot is plain and simple, you wont know what the hell is happening or what's gonna happen next because it seems totally random and pointless. Squall struggles to know what a SeeD is for half of the game when he was studying to become one. They sold us that Squall was gonna be a new kind of main character for the game when he is a cheap copy of Cloud Strife's personality (with a lamer past). It would be great if you could just spend half of the time just fighting and getting entertained with amusing battles, which you cannot. The game is very centered in it's story, pointless missions and absurd plot twists.What is worse, it's been more than 15 years since the game was released and the 'new' PC versions seems to be even worse. Lame music and no graphic improvement at all, they only added the possibility to cheat and add some magic spells that might come in handy. Buy it if you're gonna spend less than 5€, otherwise you're wasting your money.			"

												I was told some pretty nasty things about this game, and while I don't think it's as bad as it's made out to be, and that it's not even a bad game, this is far from my favorite in the series. Granted that, as of writing this review I've only played about 2-3 hours of this game, but I think just from that I have enough context to appraise it appropriately.To start off, I do actaully like the stocking of magic spells as opposed to MP usage. It complements the game's militaristic themes well, just think of the magic as ammunition.What I don't like is the amount of time needed to gather said magic; obtaining a decent amount of spells can take hours, and along with the usual concerns of leveling up and upgrading equipment, this easily makes it one of the grindiest titles in the series. I would have to say not recommended, but that's just me.  "

												I was originally skeptical about this game. I had played 4, 6, and 7 before this, and watched gameplay footage from 10. The junction system was at first unattractive to me and I didn't like the idea of not having actual equippable armor. However, I got used to this system, albeit slower than I got used to materia in 7. After getting the hang of junctions and realizing the importance of drawing magic from enemies (or using the Magic Booster :p), the game was much more enjoyable for me, and I blazed through it. The love story between Squall and Rinoa was nothing short of heartwarming, as was the comraderie between all of the party members. The music was amazing, just like in every other Final Fantasy game (although the Roses and Wine Mod was useful). Also, Triple Triad was an extremely fun card game. Didn't use Chocobo World much, since I didn't really see a need to. All in all, this game, after initially seeming very lackluster and unneccesarily confusing, in time, revealed its true colors as an exceptional Final Fantasy game, just like its predecessors.			"

I have played every Final Fantasy except for VII, IX, XI and XIV. And so far VIII falls in around the upper-middle of my favorites. I've seen negative reviews only concerning the sound files. While sound helps enchance the game, it certainly doesn't make the game. I recommend anyone who loves Final Fantasy to get this.			"

												One of my favorite games on the PSX when I was growing up, so much fun and so epic in its story, though it did not get as big as a fan base of Final Fantasy VII nor Final Fantasy VI it is still my favorite among the final fantasy games since it is the first one I have played and the story is really touching and the conflict between Squall (The lead character) and Seifer (The Sorceress's Knight) though that may be a little bit of a spoiler to those who have not played the game I give the game a solid 9/10.

												Brings back all the memories from my first playthrough during 1998-1999, my first real RPG experience and I believe it is the best Final Fantasy in the series (Shock horror not FF7). The storyline foremost is the best part, with the different relationships with each character developing seamlessly over the time frame. I like the junctioning system, giving freedom over different character builds for different situations. Would recommend to anyone.			"

												One of the best of its series. This classic Square game uses a unique junction system for magic and summoning (guardian force) and features a wonderfully crafted story in a beautifully designed world for its time. A great game for casual play.			"

												Not as good as VII or IX and in my opinion the weakest of the PSX Final Fantasy games. The story is fairly good and I have always particularly enjoyed the scenes featuring Laguna. I won't say any more on the story to avoid spoilers.I have always thought that the battle system is flawed, so much so that I describe it as “broken.” I hate how monsters and bosses level up with the characters; the draw system and how the larger the stocked number of a junctioned spell the more the stat increases. I find this constantly makes me think about how and when I'm using magic; so much so that I tend to under use magic and rarely spend the time to stock-up on spells. I find that this method of only using physical attacks and Guardian Forces tend to make battles a slow and boring task.Another battle mechanic I absolutely hate is how only the current HP is displayed and there is no display of each characters total. I could list a few more examples on how the battle mechanics are worse here than in other FF games too, but it may become quite a list...I now remember why I used to use an Xploder cheat disc to hack 99 “The End” magics, just to escape battles and bosses on the PlayStation, I just wish you could do it here. The Steam version's “Magic Booster” helps, but only adds in a few of the lower end spells. I have however found that these are very good spells to junction to characters stats.I greatly enjoy the games story and this is the main reason I would recommend, buy and play the game.			"

												Final Fantasy 8 on Steam is almost everything you would want the PC version to have; it has the graphics of the original PC version, and the control bindings are updated to support the keyboard a bit better than Final Fantasy 7's PC port. With the addition of hi-speed, and other small gimmicks, it is much easier to both play and replay the game, for both new and returning players. The only downside is - much like the Final Fantasy 7 version on Steam - the music is still producing bleeps and bloops, being in MIDI format rather than the original tracks.Other than that, it is still a solid release. The only improvement that can be made is to port the original tracks in place of the MIDI tracks.			"

												I won't compare this to FF7 because that arguments been beaten to death.There's a lot of good in this game; * Character models & locals are pretty (considering this is a PSOne game).* There a natural - no need to grind - level system that keeps enemies relative to your level.* It has an awesome in built card game called Triple Triad' which is quite fun and challenging..* Without the MP stat, money being barely used and no purchasable armor, micro management is minimised.* Lovely music.But there's some bad to counter such things.* I dislike the main characters; let me quantify that with the Heroes cover the entire spectrum of being annoying at times and I want to hit them all with Nunchuks at such times.* There's an awful romance in the not even worthy of the Twilight Saga - seriously the character in question  goes  from a ""Whatever..."" attitude to and I quote ""I can't go on like this..."" at the sight of his love interests unconscious state in like half an hours worth of gameplay.* Terrible in scene mini games. (Press X to slash Dragon...)* Flashbacks as a plot device to another annoying character.* No way points in areas.In summary if you can look past the bad main characters, and bad romance - and the fact this isn't FF7 then there's a lot to like. I'm still playing it. Maybe you'll find something about you'll like too :)			"

												While it may not be like sitting infront of your PS1 drooling for hours at the amazeballs that was the original release when you were a kid, this version is just as fun completing as it was 15 years ago. There is also plenty fixes and mods coming/already out for the amazing game to make it look and sound better.Currently 66% off? $4.07? Grab it while it's hot - $11.99 is a little steep for a 15 year old game so unless it's on sale only get it if you want to spend mindless hours enjoying one of the most epic Final Fantasy games in the franchise.

Chocobo World is a wonderful addition for those who missed out with no NA release, and I love that you can run both simultaneously in windowed mode. It's worth multiple playthroughs to uncover things you may not have found/seen/understood the previous times. Replay value at 11/10, well worth 12 dollars; a steal on sale.			"

												Years ago, I waited impatiently for the sequal to FF7.  What came out, FF8, was seen as a huge disappointment to many people.  However, years later, I now see what a gem FF8 truly is.  Sure, it doesn't have the memorable characters of FF7, but a part of me much prefers the junctioning system to materia.Hear me out!  I didn't think it could be possible to love a game more than FF7!  But the secret to FF8 is the CARDS.  You not only have the card game, but the cards give you your magic!  And your tools!  And your limit breaks!  In the first 3 hours of the game, you can get to over 3,000 HP through junctioning Aero or Blizaga (refined from cards) to your HP!This wasn't explained at all in the game and its tutorial system SUCKS.  But.  Replaying the game with an indepth walkthrough shows just how facinating the FF8 junctioning system is.  Replay this game again, letting go of FF7 and allowing FF8 be a game in its own right.  You won't be disappointed!			"

												Story: The story is pretty classic. You are Squall, an elite mercenary and member of Seed. The game starts out with you completing your final test to be a full fledge Seed. Shortly after you get your first assignment and you move out. From helping a small resistance, to fighting of a witch, to saving the world this game has it all.Appearance: FF7 may have been a revolution in going from 2D to 3D but this game improved upon that. With a more “realistic” 3D models this game is amazing. The world is huge and beautiful. Following the story you will see maybe half of what there is to see in the world. There is a few items/events that you can permanently miss which is sad but the amount of content and re-playability is amazing. Game play: This is a classic retake on the final fantasy game play. You have a four party system typically consisting of Squall and three others. You can choose from up to six permanent characters and five temporary characters. Its still maintains the turn based battle system with a few added bonus's. Over world and in world exploration is easy and reminiscent of most final fantasy games. You have an overworld that you traverse to go from town to town. Over time you gain different vehicles each having its own pros and cons. You are able to use a controller with this game. I was able to use both a corded xbox 360 controller and a PS3 controller. It was more difficult to use the PS3 controller but it was well worth the effort. Of course you can use a keyboard but its not really advised.Achievements: The achievements for this show an improvement over the FF7 achievements. Its nearly impossible to complete the game with all achievements in one go. Most of the achievements are simple and self explanatory but there is one or two that will make for a challenge.Bottom Line: The game averages for about $12. On sale it has been as low as $5. Even for full price its worth picking up for some nostalgia but at the same time I would wait for the next sale to pick it up. The game is a lot of fun even though nothing has changed in 15 years but its worth picking up.			"

												This was the first Final Fantasy game I ever played because it was on a demo disc that I received from Pizza Hut that also had Medievil and the original Tony Hawk game. In my opinion, the leveling system used in FF8 is probably my least favorite, but this is mainly because I feel that it is overly complicated. Although, this does allow a depth of customization that is only achievable in FF10, but even more so than the sphere grid. The music in this port isn't perfect, but those that are saying that it is unplayable because of the music must be some serious audiophiles because it isn't THAT bad. The game looks decent enough, but it is clear that it hasn't aged terribly well, albeit better than FF7 has due to the physical representation of the characters on and off the battlefield, but that doesn't change the factt that the foreground is. . . well. . . abysmal. That being said, the first time I summoned Shiva and watched her perform Diamond Dust, chills of nostalgia washed over me. (No pun intended) Having to sign up through Square-Enix's website is definitely a downside but mainly because it's just an added inconvience that shouldn't be necessary. Gameplay wise the only problem I have encountered is the ability to run away. The button combination didn't seem to work on my 360 pad and I couldn't remember for the life of me what the keyboard controls to run were, so I ended up fighting a dinosaur with 15k hp within the first hour of the game. The added magic booster feature makes the game absolutely trivial and you may as well be using gameshark codes, but if that's your thing then by all means, cheat away.If you have never played this entry into the Final Fantasy franchise and have no other means of doing so other than this port, then I would definitely recommend giving it a shot; however, if you can get your hands on the original, own a PS3, or something similar, then I would say to pass on this title. It's not the games fault that the port is poorly done.			"

												What more can I say it's a Final Fantasy game. You either love them or hate them, Even after 10+ years this gem seems to satisfy my need for not only nostalgia but lust for a decent RPG, Yes the story might not be the greatest, that's for you to decide, And the Dialogue might be a bit dated considering it's age. After all this is about personal preference.If you likeEpic FMV's (even after 10+ years and with SquareEnix updating the FMV's to 720p they look as amazing as they did the first time i saw the opening cinematic)A simplified Battle system, (Final Fantasy 7 had materia, In FF8 you draw the magical essence from the enemy or from draw points, The game get's more difficult or easier depending on your level)SIdequests, (Triple Triad, PuPu, Odin, Tonberry, Cactuar to name but a few)Music. (Ok so this is a sore point due to the fact the game doesn't have the PS Music files it has the ones from the previous incarnation of this game that was ported over. They're midi files. Still a remarkable score like most final fantasy games. Eyes on me might not be as breath taking as One winged Angel was on FF7, But nonetheless an Amazing Score for anyone who appreciates JPRG Soundtracks)Final Note. If you like RPG's and have already played this game I don't really need to convince you to buy this. But if you haven't and have never picked up this or any other final fantasy rpg's and would like to try them, They're dirt cheap in regards to what they were when they came out, I remember my PS copy being around £35 and original pc copies of this game used to retail on Ebay up to £120.Just get the game play through it, if you dislike it you have wasted £7, This alongside FF7 will give you thousands of hours of fun and gameplay. And once you have completed the game you can choose to do a low level playthrough, No magic. Inital Equipment. The possibilites are near infinite.			"

												Talk about a blast from the past, old school turn based RPG. Dumped hours into this 10+ years ago and can still do the same. Really fun throwback, with a cutesy love story (that will probably make any grown man want to throw up). ♥ Fun to play once more for nostalgia's sake.			"

												This game is for FF fans ONLY. If you want to play FF for the first time, play VII. Firstly, the combat is heavily skewed towards abusing Guardian Force summons, who can be summoned infinitely as long as you are not hurt too much during the process, whose animations are unskippable and take FOREVER. Making things worse is a weapon system that prevents your physical attacks from being nothing but a light breeze, and unclear criteria for Limit Breaks. Secondly, unlike VII, the plot takes it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ time getting started. In VII, you are treated to a sword fight intercut with glimpses of future cutscenes, with random words all over the place. Then, it's time to go to school. The boring goes on for hours. After that is out of the way, the game gets interesting. The best aspect of the game is the magic and upgrade system, wherin you pull charges of magic spells from enemies and either use them or Junction them to your stats. All this is worth playing, but not as an entry into the series.			"

												Awesome game, bit diffrent to other Final fantasy (magic system, junctioning, etc) but I believe it makes the game more fun and rewarding (farming magics for junctions, using GF's ablities).Also with the steam version you gte to play chocobo World, A fantastic mini game with heaps of rewards that was JP only!In short if your a fan of turn based combat with alot more to it than your average this game is for you! 10/10.

The updated graphics look great but the midi music is a let down.  I was impressed with the release of FF7 on steam but I was blown away by this re-release.  Don't miss out on this classic.			"

												I know a lot of people will say they got into gaming from early age with titles like Mario Brothers and so on. I was playing those games too. Sure. I was playing the early Mortal Kombats and so on. I loved going to the arcade. But if someone had to ask me to really pinpoint the one game that got me absolutaly fascinated with gaming as art form as well, I would say FFVIII. I know there were many other games of note before this - FFVII for example and other non Square titles, but I didn't get to play those. We didn't have a console growing up because my parents got addicted (HA!) and decided to get rid of it, and we were always just alittle behind with the technology to play the newest stuff on PC; I would hang out with friends and watch them play or play on their systems. This game we got when we finally had a PC then that could play it, and it was first time I played an RPG like this (although Zork Grand Inquisitor is my ultimate fave, there are differences here). This game is not something you can really bust your way through. It takes time to properly level your characters; you have to collect magic by either drawing it out from enemies or going around buying it, and I loved the concept that you could run out of the number of spells you had as opposed to mana; you have to really play through the environment to get the full experience. Okay, well, you can get through it faster by just sticking to the main story, but there are a lot of fun side stories and puzzles and bosses to deal with.Story wise, it's another romance tale, but I think Square Enix does them pretty well. You gave a broody, emo, angry male lead, Squall, but you learn why he's like that as you go on in the story. You're not really supposed to like him all that much until his character is further revealed, in my opinion. You have a bubbly, romantic, but motivated young female lead, who has other sides to her revealed as well. There's time traveling involved, and just don't focus on thinking about it too much because the storyline as a whole that involves a few twists and turns when a powerful sorceress makes a move on the world these characters inhabit is pretty interesting. It's character based too, and you tend to fall in love with a lot of them. The dynamics of gameplay is that you can design a your core group with up to 3 play playable characters. If you're not into custamizing characters often, might not be your thing, but they have a neat auto option that you can select and it does all the hard work for you. Combat is turn based, and it's not timed. I kind of like that, and it's almost more like chess (umm, just not the timed kind, I suppose). You can also collect guardian forces (GFs), which are powerful magical monsters that you can call upon and level up to create devastating attacks. Magic is, as previously stated, a collection game, and the most annoying thing can be spending hours fighting enemies to collect magic because stores sometimes only carry a certain amount of some magics. However, if you're into that kind of long haul game, it shouldn't bother you. If you're picking up this game as someone part of the new generation or just having gotten into gaming in today's age, you might think the graphics a bit backwards, but they were pretty spectacular from that time, and I still find them rather breathtaking. Cut scenes are pretty awesome and cinematic, as Square does. Also, I've heard the music for the game when bought and played through Steam is the midi stuff, and not the actual musical score originally played with. It's not that big of a turn off in my opinion, but might be for you, but for the price that FFVIII usually goes for, I'd say it's worth it to try and see. You can easily purchase the phenominal orchestra score on any web sites like amazon for example - and I highly recommend that (there is also a full piano album!). All in all, I highly recommend giving this game a try, especially if you are a fan of the RPG genre and haven't been able to play some of these older titles.			"

												This game is what introduced me into the Final Fantasy games. If you've never experienced any of the games I highly recommend you play Final Fantasy VIII then Final Fantasy X. I honestly didn't care much for Final Fantasy IX. This game is a great foundation though. I haven't experienced any bugs, or errors. The graphics are not as great as Dark Souls 2 (also an amazing game) but please bear in mind it was made more than a decade ago. With that said I highly encourage you get this game. Oh and good luck beating Ultimecia... you'll need it.			"

Out of all the games i own this is the only one that i have for the ps1, downloaded it through the playstation store for my ps3 and vita, as well as having it here on the pc.Graphics are still the same as back then, the music has changed a little but that might just be me, combat still the same though controls are again different since its on pc.Overall i would rate this a solid 8.5 to 8.9 which is probably high for some people but once again i am biased since i love this game to bits			"

												Although the music quality is a bit ""iffy"", the game is a true replication of the original, with the added bonus of the magic booster system, which you can use to jump start your campaign, by maxing out certain magics after you have aquired your first couple of them, by drawing etc. This speeds the game up a bit, and makes it playable in this crazy busy world we live in. I have been playing for 3 days, and have just beaten Seifer / Edea.			"

												From the 1999/2000 best seller on the PS1 which changed FF games in a lot of ways. this is apon one of the great classics.It may not be my ultimate favourate first to FF7 and second to FF9 it sure has a spot with them. The graphics have aged along the years but its nothing eye bleeding. the music is sadly that of the PC port from back then which was a horrible port by eidos if im not mistaken but its all fixable (see forum).Promise to bring you 60-80 hours fun time.. Great characters, great gameplay, superb story that makes you want to relive it again.			"

												I want to say that they just took the old PC port instead of making a new one, but I have nothing to back that up.What I will say is that on PC, this game looks bad.  I know it's PS1 era, but when you can see the game as clearly as you can on a PC it really looks bad when you see who has an in game model and who just have sprites.  But hey, you get access to the Chocobo minigame that I'm going to guess that most people didn't have when the game first came out[I know I didn't], and a magic booster for people who couldn't stand the draw system that much.  When taking that part out, the game actually feels a bit more fun.  Until you get to a part where there's a timed mission in which you have to press the right buttons, and you can't recall what buttons/keys you mapped to which specific buttons since instead of calling the button 'Square' or 'Circle' so you can some sort of sense of what to press.... you get generic 'Button 10' or 'Button 7'.....But I rediscovered my love/discovered new depths of my love for this game for one speicific reason.TRIPE TRIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD!!

												Final Fantasy 8 on Steam is almost everything you would want the PC version to have; it has the graphics of the original PC version, and the control bindings are updated to support the keyboard a bit better than Final Fantasy 7's PC port. With the addition of hi-speed, and other small gimmicks, it is much easier to both play and replay the game, for both new and returning players. The only downside is - much like the Final Fantasy 7 version on Steam - the music is still producing bleeps and bloops, being in MIDI format rather than the original tracks.Other than that, it is still a solid release. The only improvement that can be made is to port the original tracks in place of the MIDI tracks.			"

												I love this game mostly for the storyline. But, the combat is a little to easy and repetative and is held as the easiest FF in the series. Junctioning system is simple with a skipable tutorial system for just about everything. Has a minicard game system in game which is fun and more challenging than the actual game itself. As such you should really only consider playing this game only if your really into romance type of thing or a die hard final fantasy fan that doesnt like the XIII series.			"

												This was one of my first childhood games so I am a little biased, but I do love this game. The story is good. Sometimes you want to slap Squall around for being such a little♥♥♥♥♥♥but he has a personality, and a character arc. All the characters have these things. The owner of a pub in Dollet has a backstory and he is not even in the main story. The story works, and makes sense, while still leaving a little to be read within the lines. It understands subtlety. For instance, Ultimacias final line. It was cut short for a reason, to make a point words could not convey. That was poetry. Like darksouls it takes a little sleuthing to work out some finer details, but they are there.Now the gameplay, while at moments satisfying, falls into farming alot. The magic booster in the PC booster attempted to address this, but instead of giving 100 of a few choice spells I thought it would boost any spells found to 100, eliminating unnecessary farming while still leaving explration and progression. I am also glad chocobo world was included because it's nice to know what I was missing out on as a child. It allows the item farming to do itself, I just had to edit the hex file to make it go faster. Farming like this did eliminate alot of the challenge that I faced during my original playthrough, so I suggest not bothering with chocobo world; it's a terrible game anyway.I like the junction system, it makes you choose what stats to focus on, what to be immune to, and how to flavour your attacks. It also fits the aesthetic of the game, which is more industrial than other Final Fantasies. It still does have its own fantasy mythos, but grounded in a world of science. This is an old style of RPG that rewards busy work, but if you are willing to put up with it there is plenty of exploration to be had.			"

												Been trying to beat this game for 10 years, now armed with 10 years of hardcore video game knowledge i am going to break this game in half much like Bane to Batman. The only thing bad about this game is there is no discs for you to snap in half as you complete them. Burn all your bridges and never look back. I hate this game, I've tried multiple times to beat it, the worse attempt at was when I accidentely super murdered one of my gf's (never give anything to Seifer) and the most common road block is getting lost looking for a Garden and refusing to swallow my pride and using a guide to find it, I dont care if i will not get everything, a guide will only lessen my eventual victory.

												First RPG I've ever played as a child, also my first FF game. It brings back memories of not doing anything all day and just sitting down and playing for 8 hto 13 hours straight.The music in the game isn't as great as the pc, however, there are mods to fix that so its not that big of a deal. Also the added achievements steam has added give a greater sense of accomplishment to the game and gives you more insentive to play more.Highly recommend this for everyone!9.5/10			"

												I've read through reviews and alot of people seem to be ♥♥♥♥♥ing about the msic quality (easily fixed if you so desire, I haven't bothered fixing it). People are complaining about the controls.... they're changeable. (I was playing this on an emulator so I was ok with using my keyboard instead of a controller). Overall I'm happy about this game. It's a good $6 (got it on sale) spent.There really isn't too much that's worse than the console version, music being the main thing that seems off to this FF8 vet here. Chocobo World is a damn good addon here! I'm happy about that. Also liked the magic booster too since it saved me some time at the beginning without having to grind and draw magic from all those monsters. I like having actual achievements too. Gives me things to aim towards.			"

												Before i start, i have to say this was my first final fantasy game and its comon that the first one you play is your favority. The game mecanics in this game you may or not enjoy:you dont actually buy armor or weapons you use junction mecanic were you can use magic to boost attack, magic or defense atributes for me is really good but the draw magic isnt very  fun  the only down side of this game.As i said before you dont buy weapons you get parts to upgrade them but you need to get the magazine so  you know what you need.  The story is good and difficulty is actually based on your Characters level, wich means you dont have to grind levels to beat some bosses with the exception of the last boss, the bigger the level you have the harder it is ( but not much, enough to see the deference)  I recomend you give this game a change			"

												It may not seem like it, because I just recently got this game on steam. but i have played this game soo much it was basically my entire childhood. Well this one and Final Fantasy 10, made up 90% of the games i played as a child after school. Play this game with a PS4 controller, and let the memories flood back like a tsuname @_@ ( Ps4 is closest to ps1 i could get lol) In all honesty, you can get this on an emulator for free yes, but if your computer cant handle the emulator, it will handle this. Im litterally playing this on the equivilent of a laptop, only has 2 gigs of ram. It wont run an emulator, but this game works great. Infact almost all of my 7.9 hours (on steam) on this game, has been played non stop (And i plan to play much much more.) .I highly recomend this game to ANYONE who has not played it before. 10/10 would buy again if I had to, nuff said.

												A great game when it came out and it has stood the test of time.  The boost to HD is crisp on the character models but the backgrounds look a bit shoddy.  Compared to the PS version the music is awful.  I didn't think it would detract too much from the game but it is a real let down.  The midi music detracts from the experience but the gameplay is still worth the admission.  Hopefully they'll patch in a better quality soundtrack.			"

												Some people should keep in mind that this is not a remake of any sorts, but the same game that was already released alongside the Playstation version, where MIDIs were the standard for PCs. I know, this is no excuse by today's standards, but I won't let a review become biased because of Square Enix's laziness, I want to rate the game. On top of that, the ""Roses and Wine"" Mod fixes those issues perfectly.So, what is there to say about this game that hasn't been said before? I doubt there is much. The story, albeit slow at the beginning, picks up pace really fast and doesn't let you go once you get into it, character development and pacing is really well done. The junction system, while unconventional, gives opportunities for a lot of combinations and is hilariously abusive. The graphics are sub-par, unfortunately. That is because they haven't gotten a makeover with their release, just like it happened to FFVII earlier, but don't let this divert you from this interesting story that you should have experienced at least once.

												Great game. As good as I remember it on my old PSX. I still own the PSX version and am looking at it right now. Up until now, the PSX version was still my favorite but the newest steam version has made me switch my thinking. I now consider this the best version of the game.HOWEVER:As of writing I had to use 3rd part MODs available for the game to make the sound and FMV scenes enjoyable. For whatever reason the sounds and FMVs are just utterly crap but thankfully can be easily replaced with better community-sourced versions.All-in-all, dont let the small technical hiccups or yourself stop you from enjoying one of the most unique Final Fantasy and RPG titles available.

												Great game from the 90's with a decent touch up. The only problems i've seen so far are the environments are sort of pixelated on higher resolutions and the music is just hollow MIDI instead of the higher quality PS1 music. Other than those two gripes the game is still as great as i remember. I wont spoil anything here but the game is worth its pricetag as it was one of the greatest Final Fantasys in my opinion. As with its newer aged brethren FF8 uses the ATB system meaning the enemy can attack before your party and vice versa. Faster characters or ones with a higher SPD stat will see their bar fill up faster and thus get to attack more often. This iteration also introduced the Junction system which honestly is a love or hate change. With the junction system you link or ""junction"" magic to your stats to increase them further. The more magic you have linked to a stat the better the boost. However, some magic boosts other stats better than others and what stats are junctionable is solely determined by what GF's are equipped.Thats the next topic though. Your summons in this game are called GF's or Guardian Force. Most of the FF staples are here including Ifrit, Shiva, Alexander, Odin and so on. They level up seperately from the characters as well as seperate health bars and also gain AP or Ability Points. AP is used to learn new moves for them like SumMag+10% which increases their damage by 10%. Through this system they can also learn other abilities aside from health and damage boosting abilities for instance Quazecolt (unsure of spelling at this time) can learn the ability Card which will in battle turn a monster into a Triple Triad card. The separate health bar comes into play during summoning. For a set amount of time based off affinity with a GF (increased by use of said GF) your health is taken over by their health bars as an ATB bar ticks down. Once it emptys the GF is summoned to do its attack or whatever ability it may have (Support GFs are here) and then the players health bar is restored to its place. Any attacks suffered before the GF attacks during that time period though causes damage to the GF until it is KO'd and needs to be revived before summoning again. Its something i enjoy but newer audiences may not is that GF's can have summon animations lasting only a couple seconds to minutes (i believe the final summon has a length 4 minute animation but does insane damage).There's a lot more to this game as well but the last topic i'll touch up on here is the Triple Triad mini-game. Triple Triad is a card game played in-game completely optionally (it has its own line of sidequests as well) but is very well put together and is probably the funnest mini-game in any FF. The game updates itself as you explore new areas of the world by adding new rules and winning options (like getting to choose one card they used for yourself or taking their entire hand of cards) all of which can be changed by visiting the Queen of Cards who will with a small fee strike down rules you picked up and/or win rewards. The game is a load of fun and can make the main game even easier for you when mixed with Quezacolts ""Card Mod"" ability. Which is were his Card ability comes into play. You can earn all the cards by winning Triple Triad or you can turn real monsters into a card for use or even refine the card with Card Mod to turn the monster into a set item(s). Through this it's actually possible to get the Main Character Squall's ultimate weapon on the very first disc provided you have the patience or card battlling prowress.Well this reviews gone on long enough. I sincerely hope you consider picking this game up if you haven't played it before or if you're a returning veteran to FF8. Happy gaming everyone!			"

Chocobo World is a wonderful addition for those who missed out with no NA release, and I love that you can run both simultaneously in windowed mode.

												I have always loved this Final Fantasy game. I still own the original Playstation version and when I saw that Steam had it for the PC I was really excited and purchased it before reading the reviews. When I read them I was worried that I had made a mistake, but after playing for an hour I decided that I hadn't. The music is different, the controls take a little getting used to and the graphics aren't perfect, but that doesn't take away from the story which is the same and is what I fell in love with when I first played the game on the Playstation. So I recommend buying this game. It isn't that expensive and when installed on a laptop you can bring it everywhere with you.			"

But hey it's FF8 and i always liked the game, and now it got achievements :) so yeah that is the only reason why i bought it, if it wasn't for those i would have sticked with the origninal pc release.Overall i'm gonna recomend it to anyone who likes a good story in a game, and if someone is into anime and likes tsundere characters as protagonist, i'm gonna reccomend it for those people to.

												This is one of the Games that made final fantasy a legend in the RPG gaming world. In fact the series from 1-10 at least to me were some of the greatest games ever made. Whether your an FF newcomer or a Vet such as I, it is a game you will regret not playing.I still have my PS1 copy, I bought it when it was released on PSN [PS3] and I bought it here on steam upon its re-release. Would I buy it a 4th time, yes I would withut hesitation.Now I played this with a wireless Xbox360 controller and also have a HDMI lead running from my graphics card to my tv so I really had comfort playing this game again.Now the textures have been upgraded and comparing them to the original, its utterly amazing, now you have the option to use the original graphics too.The only thing that didn't impress me a whole lot was certain parts of the game ,the sound wasn't really up to scratch.What also pisses me off, is that FF7 gets a cloud saving feature and we don't. Steam must be FF7 Fanboys. ;)Again 100/10, must play at least once in your life time.If you do, I recommend looking up how to get the 'lionheart' on disk 1. Makes the entire gaming experience much betetr and also a good walkthrough is extremely helpful.			"

												Part of why I think this game gets so much hate, even from me, is that it came on the heels of one of Final Fantasy 7, of of the best selling and most well loved RPGs of all time. Final Fantasy 7 had a brilliant and customizable battle system, an engaging story with interesting characters and an awesome soundtrack. Final Fantasy 8 has... an awesome soundtrack, at least. To be fair, the story is pretty interesting all the way through the end of disc 1, but then things get so weird and hard to follow and major plot points are added and removed on a whim, as though the game has ADD and can't decide on what kind of story it wants to tell you. But the battle system is...oh god it's a total trainwreck.So one of the many flaws of this game's battle system is its ""junction"" system. In FF8, magic spells are treated as a consumable item. Kind of a weird choice, but I don't have a problem with that necessarily. What I DO have a problem with is that spells are a consumable item AND the game allows you to ""junction"" them to your character to improve their stats. The better the spell, the more the stat increase. If you follow this chain of logic, you'll realize that if you have a high level spell junctioned to your character and you cast that spell, your character's stats will actually decrease. So then what's the point of casting magic? There is none in a normal playthrough, especially when you consider that your summon monsters, called GFs in this game, can be called upon to essentially cast any magic spells you'd want anyway, provided you don't mind watching a 45 second cutscene of the GF appearing EVERY FREAKIN' TIME. There's lots of odd decisions like this that slow the battles down in FF8 and make them tedious. Even the way you get magic is a chore. You can ""draw"" spells from an enemy, but depending on a few factors the game doesn't really explain, you'll only typically get around 3-6 spells per draw. Which means you have to sit in a battle and farm draw for quite a long time if you want to get up to the maximum of 100. But really the most broken thing about this game is when you discover you can manipulate limit breaks. Your character's chance of limit breaks are actually random in this game, another odd choice. The less health you have, the higher the chance of the limit break. But if you cycle your turn order, you can keep re-rolling the calculation that determines your limit break, essentially letting you limit break whenever you want. Totally. Broken.Now that I'm done ranting about the battle system, on to the story (mild spoilers in this paragraph). It really does seem like it's gonna go somewhere for the first, maybe quarter or third of the game. But then we hit a point after disc 1 where the narrative has an identity crisis and starts grasping at different ideas and concepts and inserts them randomly into the story which results in a totally insane mish-mash of disconnected themes and gaping plot holes. I know Final Fantasy is a universe where characters get shot, sliced and burned in every battle, but the first huge narrative red flag is when one of the main characters is freakin' impaled through the heart with a giant icicle during a cutscene... and then is totally okay in the next scene. Like the game barely even acknowledges that it took place. Come on Final Fantasy 8! If you're not gonna take your story seriously then I can't either. The artwork and music are the huge redeeming factors of this game. FF8 features some of the most gorgeous hand-drawn backdrops in any RPG I've seen. And this might be controversial, but I think FF8 is Uematsu's best work. At the very least it's my favorite of his work. The relaxing ""Breezy"", the entrancing ""Find Your Way"", the mysterious ""Under Her Control"" and the nostalgic ""Fisherman's Horizon"" highlight the soundtrack. And of course ""Man With the Machine Gun"" does its best to keep the mindlessly tedious and broken battles from being too much of a nuisance.SummaryThis is far from the best Final Fantasy, and misses the mark on battle system design and storytelling. At best it's an average-ish RPG with a trippy story, some awesome music and inspiring artwork. Still there is something sort of intangibly alluring about playing this game. I must admit I've replayed this trainwreck at least 3 times now.For more game reviews, check out http://whatisjamesplaying.blogspot.com/ "

												This is one of my alltime favorite games. Great story that goes beyond what it starts out to be and it does it so smoothly and with reason that you don't realize that you are right there with the game on why things are happening. The junction system is what the game mechanics are ruled by and if you master it you can become more poewerful than anything else in the game. there is a status junction called death that when at level 10 charecter can kill a level 99 monster in one hit. Serously. There's all kinds of stuff in this game that you never have to be aware of and can finish this game missing so much extra items, people, guardian Forces. Guardian Forces or GF, gives you the ability to junction spells to your stats. Also helps improve stats. With the correct Junctions you can absorb every elemental magic that you are hit with and heal yourself by 100 percent. The usual people and what not make their appearences, Biggs and wedge, ifrit, bahamut. Mini games, chocobos. Im over fifty hours into and have so much more to do.			"

												Amazing game that I have great memories of playing as a kid. I had this game on PC and Playstation as a kid growing up. I could never play it on PC, because at the time my computer couldn't handle it. But, I remember playing through it on playstation and thinking the amount of discs were amazing and this had to be the greatest game ever. The story was great and the graphics and gameplay were so great for the time. The best part of this steam version is the cheats you can enable with just the press of keys in real time. I just wanted to relive the story and get some nostalgia going and this game allowed that with the high speed and max hit keys. You can run around the game and kill everything instantly so you can enjoy the dialogue, the feel of the world, and the storyline. Definitely recommend.			"

												It is odd how different this game is to the last one. Eveything the last game got right, this one got wrong. and everything the last game got wrong, this game got right. Funny. For me, FF 8 is one of my favorites. It has a strong story, beautiful graphics (for the time,) interesting and deep characters, and also a large colorful world to explore. Weapons and Magic on the other hand is rather poorly done in my opinion. Characters only have a small number to choose from and the magic system is almost pointless to use since your strongest spells are what you usually use to bolster your stats. ie you use magic, you get weaker. Not to mention the Draw system: I hated it! It felt SOOOOOO tedious and needless. But combat mechanics aside I still enjoyed it immensely. Battles are fun and engaging and the card game is incredibly fun and addictive to play (gotta-get-em-all.) FF8 is by far more flawed than the last game, but I felt it had more charm and characters that felt more real and down to earth (mostly.) Squall may be a jerk for the most part of the game, but hay! He's a teenager, it isn't really that far of stretch. Overall: Regardless of its flaws. I thought it was charming and a blast to play (even with the draw system.)			"

												Final Fantasy VIII like VII is one of the best FF games in my book. I know a lot of people would disagree but its Final Fantasy for crying out loud. One of the original RPG series that has made millions upon millions of fans happy and thrilled worldwide. If you haven't play ANY Final Fantasy Games, then you're just not living. Action, Drama, Romance, Turn-Based RPG, Unique Battle System and beloved Characters. Nuff said. :D "

												At the begining I thought that this game is easy, just like FF VII. But I was wrong! Oh my... I was so wrong.... Near the ending when you want to just finish this game, you can't. You ask why? Because of bosses, obviously!EDIT 1: Sorry for earlier. I was raging becouse I wasn't able to defeat Adel. But now I finished this game. I must say it was though. The saddest thing in this FF game is that you don't receive exp from bosses :(			"

												Wonderful game even if a bit old. Haven't played more than a couple hours but the nostalgia hits me right in the heart. Love it love it love it forever. Best rpg I have ever played, so great to be able to customise my team properly. And Triple Triad is an awesome game within the game too. Really fun card game. Argh you even get Chocobo World included which I was never able to get when I got the original PSOne version. Yay yay yay! Now I can get extra items at last! Music not the same but it's not just about the music. Man I forgot how great the GFs are. So happy.  Once you get into it and get used to playing it on PC instead of with a controller, it's fab. Easy to play, very addictive, great characters. Best FF ever. I've played most of the others and this one is still my fave. It may not be as pretty as X, for example, but IMHO it's better. Oh man I forgot to mention how great Laguna is. Hahaha! Ok I will stop ranting about how great this game is now. But seriously. BUY IT.			"

												FF8 is  sorta the black sheep on the FF series and I feel doesn't get its proper respect. Yes it is different than the  rest with making you draw magic instead of just having it  and feels like more real world than  the others did, but that doesn't make it  a bad game.  Maybe if it wasn't  a Final Fantasy game  it would just fade into   the gaming library, but it is still FF8. they tried new things and alot of things didn't work or  stick, but for the money and the experience  of  seeing how the story plays out it is worth it. It doesn't Match up to a FF7 or  hell  even the  Legend of Dragoon for that  matter, but it is still an inventive Rpg. 7/10			"

												Compared to FF7 which is the fan (and also my...) favorite, I personally find this game a little under rated.Though, I admit that the (spoiler:) initial high school story can't keep up with FF7's plot.However... I do prefer the junction system to the more traditional mechanics of FF7.Collecting spells, experimenting with junction combinations, then adding all the insanely cool GF abilities. Collecting items, chasing rares, transforming them into something else... Looking for the perfect combination to junction all party members as effectively as possible... You are more free and can be more creative in this game as in FF7.The endgame bosses are so much more fun to fight and after 18 minutes all out warfare against Omega Weapon you will jump and cheer when he finally goes down. Sure I was proud when I beat the Weapons in FF7... but casting a few kights of the round in a row VS. the intense battles against Ultima and Omega in this game... no further comment needed.If you don't know it but like JRPGs: play it! If you like experimenting and combining things you can't make a mistake with this decision.If you played it when it first came out... buy it again! It's always worth wasting a few days on a classic game like this!Last but not least: If it had Sephiroth/Cloud it would be the better Final Fantasy 7			"

												Well, hearing it from a person obsessed with the FF series, it may not be as convincing to get this game. Let me just start with this: This game just so happened to be the first game I ever played. Back when it was on the PSone, I literally started with this, then moved to Mario, and so on. Crazy right? You'd figure that Mario would have been the first. Either way, when I first played this game, I don't even remeber what my innital take on the game was. I thought 'Why did I play this? What made me want to play it? How did it even play?"" Well, I found the answer to that after finding it a second time on the PSone.The game is set up pretty well. You start off with just a base idea of the game, and don't even really grasp how it works in the beginning. However, as you progress through the game, things become much more understandable. You become so over powered that you feel like you're invincible. Still even with the game being a little confusing, it has both its up and downs.First, the good stuff. The main attraction; GF (if i remember correctly, that's for Guardian Force). These are the main mechanic in the game. Without them, all you can do is attack....... literally(more on this in the cons). Even so, they can become insanely powerful if you level them up, and they can learn new abilities that you can then use both inside and out of combat. Some are for making battles easier, some for making battles non-existant, some for making items like potions and elixirs; the list goes on and on. The GF's become the driving force behind this game, and it's really a neat mechanic to get behind.Next comes magic. Now this is both a negative and a positive, as the magic isn't really special. What magic can do, depending on your GF's, is be used like and equipment to increase your player's stats. Meaning, if you have the right magic for your character, their stats become so powerful that even boss fights feel like a walk in the park. All in all, it isn't really that bad.Now, the cons. First off, those GF's. As I mentioned before, without them, all you can do is attack. I mean it. You can't use items. You can use magics. You can't use anything accept for the weapon in your hands. It can really hurt in a lot of battles you aren't prepared for, especially a boss fight. And if you forget to equip the GF's to your character; it just makes the feeling even worse compared to when you do it on purpose. Yes, you have to remember to take care and equip all of your GF's before you go into battle, otherwise, suffer defeat. And speaking of care.... you remember those GF abilities i mentioned earlier? In order to get them, you have to grind for a while to get enough ""AP"" just to unlock these abilities. Don't get me wrong, that's the concept behind a lot of games, and it's completely acceptable. However, the issue is how many abilities these GF's have and how many you are able to use. Great! You've unlocked the most powerful ability in this GF. In order to equip it, you have to unequip the only ability saving your life in combat right now..... Even when you unlock the special GF ability that allows for four abilities to be used, most of the time, the abilities are so similar, that it becomes a personal fight with yourself on how you want to optimize this one character. What's worse is that, say you don't have that character in your party. Well, you need the GF equiped to them, so you unequip it from them. Unfortunately(if i remember correctly), you have to go through the trouble of optimizing that same character all over again. It becomes a hastle, makes you not want to unequip GF's for the sake of making it easy, then you end up in a situation where you are fighting a boss and needed the abilities of one of the GF's you can't use right now because it's equiped to another character somewhere else. Major pain, and I still love this game. Makes you wonder how.Next on the list of cons is magic. Like I said before, it's both a pos and neg when it comes to this. Firstly, magic isn't infinite. You don't have a mana pool to draw from in order to cast these spells. Instead, you use a system known as ""draw"" to take the magic from your enemies in the middle of a fight. Personally, I like this system because of the randomness you get from each enemy, meaning you can base your fight off of just the magic you can draw from them. However, the issue is how many time you can use it as well as getting rid of useless stuff you don't need or can't use(by ""can't use"", I mean it's pointless to use it to begin with. Like using a level 1 spell on a level 100 monster..... pointless). Being as you draw magic from your enemies, there is a limit to how much you would be able to use it. Understandable, it's just frustrating to have to suck it out of your enemy for and hour just to get enough to be able to really use it for your characters stats. Thing is though, that you get much better magic down the road(obviously). You only have 8 pages of magic with 4 slots in each, meaning you can only have a total of 32 different spells at once. Say you've filled up your slots. Finally! You've found the one spell in the game that will max out your characters stats..... But you have no room for it. Well, unfortunately, you can't just delete your magic. That would be too easy. You can give it to other characters though...... oh right! You made all of the other characters max out the exact same spells so that their stats would be awesome too. Well, there you go. You have two options. Either fight and use nothing but the spell you want to ""delete"",which you most likely have 100 copies of(yeah. you can have a total of 100 of those 32 spells), or ignore it and move on with your life. It really does hurt when I run into this situation. It sucks, plain and simple.Really, these little issues are that big of a deal. Yes, it's a pain to respec your character every time you want to use it. Yes, it sucks when you can't draw the magic you want. However, these are such obvious obsticles the we, as gamers, can easily overcome them in a heart-beat.... no; even faster than a heart-beat. These obsticles are nothing. Really, they just add to the experience of a well made(yet not really well told) story. And that's always the selling point for me in games. I don't care for your phanshy grafiks or your smooth lighting.... I want a story that will grab me by the neck, shake really hard, and then ask me if I'm okay. All in all, a rating for me on this game; it well deserves an 8/10 for me, though it would be 9/10 if I could, you know, use my items without the help of and almighty being.			"

												This was the 2nd of the Final Fantasy series that I had played and it certainly was addicting to play. I can't remember if I ever completed this but I was close! There are many summon creatures you can choose from and they offer many abilities to enhance your character. Also if you like card games then there is cards in this. Fight against another play with monster cards. It's a simple yet addictive game using numbers that signify the attack points of that monster card but the points differ on each side of said card. got a monster that is a attack 7 on top but a attack 5 at the bottom? Well then you better not let the enemy lay down an attack 6 or greater or he will take over that card! The characters are awesome in this. To the way they look and the way their personality comes to life as they story unfolds the further to go into the game. However much like FF7 the music is in Midi and this is certainly a downside to the game as the music made the game as well as the story.			"

												FF8 has had a rough time being compared to the overwhelming success of FF7, however when you take the game in its own right then it is amazing. I first played this back in 1999 and here I am in 2014 replaying it again the 'n'th time. The only drawback that I can think of is the slow pace of the 2nd disk, this has been the reason why many of my friends did not complete it, which to me is a shame as disc 3 makes up for it. If you have never played it then I would really recommend this title!			"

												Final fantasy 8 takes you on an enchanting journey through a world that is on the brink of civil war.the storyline in Final fantasy 8 will keep you engaged and on the edge of your seat as the initial small plot lines develop into an all incomposing plot which you play through and watch come to full circle. the battle system in this final fantasy is simple and not very intrusive the draw system is easy to use and the junction systemalthough it takes same getting used to is easy to use. the graphics are solid and although they look outdated in this day and age final fantasy 8 will always be up there asan amazing story telling experience. my only advice is don't skip any of the tutorial dialog unless you have played the game before as you will be chucking yourself in the deep end fast.

												Great game from the 90's with a decent touch up. The only problems i've seen so far are the environments are sort of pixelated on higher resolutions and the music is just hollow MIDI instead of the higher quality PS1 music. Other than those two gripes the game is still as great as i remember. I wont spoil anything here but the game is worth its pricetag as it was one of the greatest Final Fantasys in my opinion. As with its newer aged brethren FF8 uses the ATB system meaning the enemy can attack before your party and vice versa. Faster characters or ones with a higher SPD stat will see their bar fill up faster and thus get to attack more often. This iteration also introduced the Junction system which honestly is a love or hate change. With the junction system you link or ""junction"" magic to your stats to increase them further. The more magic you have linked to a stat the better the boost. However, some magic boosts other stats better than others and what stats are junctionable is solely determined by what GF's are equipped.Thats the next topic though. Your summons in this game are called GF's or Guardian Force. Most of the FF staples are here including Ifrit, Shiva, Alexander, Odin and so on. They level up seperately from the characters as well as seperate health bars and also gain AP or Ability Points. AP is used to learn new moves for them like SumMag+10% which increases their damage by 10%. Through this system they can also learn other abilities aside from health and damage boosting abilities for instance Quazecolt (unsure of spelling at this time) can learn the ability Card which will in battle turn a monster into a Triple Triad card. The separate health bar comes into play during summoning. For a set amount of time based off affinity with a GF (increased by use of said GF) your health is taken over by their health bars as an ATB bar ticks down. Once it emptys the GF is summoned to do its attack or whatever ability it may have (Support GFs are here) and then the players health bar is restored to its place. Any attacks suffered before the GF attacks during that time period though causes damage to the GF until it is KO'd and needs to be revived before summoning again. Its something i enjoy but newer audiences may not is that GF's can have summon animations lasting only a couple seconds to minutes (i believe the final summon has a length 4 minute animation but does insane damage).There's a lot more to this game as well but the last topic i'll touch up on here is the Triple Triad mini-game. Triple Triad is a card game played in-game completely optionally (it has its own line of sidequests as well) but is very well put together and is probably the funnest mini-game in any FF. The game updates itself as you explore new areas of the world by adding new rules and winning options (like getting to choose one card they used for yourself or taking their entire hand of cards) all of which can be changed by visiting the Queen of Cards who will with a small fee strike down rules you picked up and/or win rewards. The game is a load of fun and can make the main game even easier for you when mixed with Quezacolts ""Card Mod"" ability. Which is were his Card ability comes into play. You can earn all the cards by winning Triple Triad or you can turn real monsters into a card for use or even refine the card with Card Mod to turn the monster into a set item(s). Through this it's actually possible to get the Main Character Squall's ultimate weapon on the very first disc provided you have the patience or card battlling prowress.Well this reviews gone on long enough. I sincerely hope you consider picking this game up if you haven't played it before or if you're a returning veteran to FF8. Happy gaming everyone!			"

												While by no means a perfect game, FF8 is a worthy bearer of the Final Fantasy brand-name (unlike some of the later installments in the series).  A singular, quite bizarre story of love and rivalry, told in a world where magic and technology are not at war but exist side-by-side.  Definitely worth playing, even with dated graphics!			"

												A blast from the past now on steam, but defenitly has some issues. As I spent a great deal of time playing this game when I was younger I've certainly noticed some differences with the steam release, and the major one was also present in Final Fantasy 7. The music is once again poor quality like FF7, the difference being is the lack of outrage toward the FF8 release may not persuade those working on it to change said poor music quality as FF7 has the more rabid and certainly larger fan base. On a lesser note(and certainly more opinion based)is the lack of a vibration function for those using controllers. As I mentioned I spent a lot of time on this game, and a small problem in combat is Squall's gunblade mechanic not having the difinitive confirmation of critical strikes. Again this is a small issue, but having the visual queue flash on the screen I feel is not enough for some players, especially those who have never played the game before. I could go on about the games highly angst driven plot based on a love story. I could go on about the silly draw mechanic and the metric tonne of time it will waste but you could easily watch Spoony's review for that. The drive for buyers here is content with a capital C. There's months worth of gameplay for newer players here and I can recommend it for that alone really, even if the price is a little steep. Regardless it's still a decent port that I'm going to play to completion for sure.			"

												My favorite Final Fantasy is on steam!!! Any who this game has a great, well written, deep, and twisty sotry line that takes more then one play through to catch on to. The draw mechanic is a love it or hate it system. I like it because it brings a new face to the magic system in the game. The GFs (the summons) are some of the most memorable second to Fianl Fantasy X's aeons. This game offer a great challenge, and can offer hours apon hours of play. The upgrade system as opposed to buing new weapons gives upgrading your party members a new challenge. IMO this is as good as Final Fantasy gets.			"

												Played through this game for the first time recently. One of the few FF games I have yet to play. Overall I enjoyed it. Great Final Fantasy game, great battle mechanics, pretty good story. My only complaint would be that during certain 'intense' animations towards the latter half of the game. The framerate would drop tremendously, become unsynched with audio, and just chug along at half speed or worse. I have a decent computer that should have had no trouble with this, so I don't know if it is just bad optimization or what. Regardless, still a great game, just wish a few of the final boss animations would've worked out better.			"

												This game is full of nostalgia for me, it was the first Final Fantasy game I played and still my favourite. The mechanics are good, though the junction system is open to wild abuse to over power your team. The story is epic and if it ocassionaly feels a little on the nose it still manages suprisingly profound undertones about the effect live combat would have on young adults. The set piece movies still hold up in my opinion and it has one of the most addictive computer card games (Triple Triad) which gives gwent a run for it's money.If your fond of JRPGs this is a must have and is one of the least grindy I've played.

												This was the first Final Fantasy game I ever played because it was on a demo disc that I received from Pizza Hut that also had Medievil and the original Tony Hawk game. In my opinion, the leveling system used in FF8 is probably my least favorite, but this is mainly because I feel that it is overly complicated. Although, this does allow a depth of customization that is only achievable in FF10, but even more so than the sphere grid. The music in this port isn't perfect, but those that are saying that it is unplayable because of the music must be some serious audiophiles because it isn't THAT bad. The game looks decent enough, but it is clear that it hasn't aged terribly well, albeit better than FF7 has due to the physical representation of the characters on and off the battlefield, but that doesn't change the factt that the foreground is. . . well. . . abysmal. That being said, the first time I summoned Shiva and watched her perform Diamond Dust, chills of nostalgia washed over me. (No pun intended) Having to sign up through Square-Enix's website is definitely a downside but mainly because it's just an added inconvience that shouldn't be necessary. Gameplay wise the only problem I have encountered is the ability to run away. The button combination didn't seem to work on my 360 pad and I couldn't remember for the life of me what the keyboard controls to run were, so I ended up fighting a dinosaur with 15k hp within the first hour of the game. The added magic booster feature makes the game absolutely trivial and you may as well be using gameshark codes, but if that's your thing then by all means, cheat away.If you have never played this entry into the Final Fantasy franchise and have no other means of doing so other than this port, then I would definitely recommend giving it a shot; however, if you can get your hands on the original, own a PS3, or something similar, then I would say to pass on this title. It's not the games fault that the port is poorly done.			"

												Coming from Final Fantasy 7 its a little bit of a disappointment but FF7 is one of the greatest games of all time so of course it is hard to live up to. But that dosen't mean that FF8 is bad by any means in fact Its better than a lot of the Final Fantasy games out today especially the FF13 games. But that does not mean that its a must buy for everyone. In order for your character to do almost anything they need a GF which is a summon, a character equip multiple summons but make sure everyone has at least one or they can do nothing but attack. Only attacking takes a big chunk of the strategy out so make sure evryone has one. Also some of the characters are unlikable at some times so you never really want to get to know them that much. Now on to the good, the cutscenes look masterful and the gamplay (when you have a GF) is great. the battle animations for your summons are fluid and great to look at but the sound effects are not that great. Those who love FF7 will find plenty to love in FF8. despite a few flaws its still one of the best final fantasy games and a must buy for fans. For fans this is easily a 9.2/10 notice how I say for fans because I cant see any newcomers to the series enjoying this as much so for them 8/10			"

												This is a great game. I bought it for sentimental reasons as I've beaten it already many times on the original PSX. It still plays great and all but the port for Steam is just sooooo lazy. The xbox gamepad I have is half supported (couldn't get the triggers to work, left stick suddendly became 4-directional instead of being 360, and there is absolutely no button images: I've spent few nice minutes trying to solve the mystery what is a magical B9 button to use the Squall's sword trigger), the save system is funny (trying to recreate the memory cards on PC...), and the graphical quality could have been better (I'm not asking for a HD rerealease but the backgrounds didn't pass the test of time). To sum up I'll probably beat the game once again as I love the Junction system, the way the magic is done in here and the best story Square has ever written but I'm happy I didn't pay the full price for this because the quality of the port is mediocre.

												Like other reviewers say, the music has been removed and replaced with low quality MIDIs.  HOWEVER, you can mod the original soundtrack back in.  Should be a tutorial near the top of the Community Hub.  Other than that problem, everything seems pretty good.  The old PS1 graphic quality may be jarring at first, but the cutscene quality is still pretty awesome.  You don't play this sort of thing for the graphics though, no.  You play it for the story and the soundtrack, and maybe the battles.If you're willing to take a few minutes to fix the soundtrack, go ahead and grab it.			"

												I actually enjoy FF8. I'm not enjoying this edition of the PC port.Why is that? You should never lose a game because the controls are awkward. And yet, FF8's re-release seems to succeed in this regard.If you use a gamepad, the game still displays the keyboard controls in-game. So if you're trying to input codes in the stupid train mini-game (which is a fine example of how Square tried to innovate by sucking the fun out of the game, but I digress), you're struggling to remember what the default X, C, S, and V (Seriously, Square Enix? No WASD? No space bar? No Enter key? Did you just pick a bunch of keys at random?) map to on the gamepad, and this is fatal when you're trying to enter 4-digit codes. At least the original PC port allowed you to use a gamepad seriously, displaying the buttons instead of the keys-- by contrast, this revisit is a joke. FF7 didn't have this problem, of course, because they used keywords for each button regardless of how you mapped the buttons. Awkward at first, but then, you weren't confused by the time you were doing squats in Wall Market or rifle drills in Junon. That they didn't put forth the same effort for FF8 is unacceptable, as they decided to always show a disclaimer about seizure risk before the game is launched, and always show the keyboard map every single damned time the game starts like FF7. Who designed this port, anyway? A barrel of monkeys?So, gamepad users, here's a workaround for this annoying feature: Map the keyboard keys to numbers representing the buttons on your gamepad. Hopefully the game will now display those numbers instead of the default keys. You'll still need the keyboard to get past the insanely annoying key map reminder.To add insult to injury, the keyboard and gamepad button maps don't line up in the config screen, which makes one wonder if they really hired monkeys to develop it.I'd much rather find my old FF8 discs and play that instead...

												Story: The story is pretty classic. You are Squall, an elite mercenary and member of Seed. The game starts out with you completing your final test to be a full fledge Seed. Shortly after you get your first assignment and you move out. From helping a small resistance, to fighting of a witch, to saving the world this game has it all.Appearance: FF7 may have been a revolution in going from 2D to 3D but this game improved upon that. With a more “realistic” 3D models this game is amazing. The world is huge and beautiful. Following the story you will see maybe half of what there is to see in the world. There is a few items/events that you can permanently miss which is sad but the amount of content and re-playability is amazing. Game play: This is a classic retake on the final fantasy game play. You have a four party system typically consisting of Squall and three others. You can choose from up to six permanent characters and five temporary characters. Its still maintains the turn based battle system with a few added bonus's. Over world and in world exploration is easy and reminiscent of most final fantasy games. You have an overworld that you traverse to go from town to town. Over time you gain different vehicles each having its own pros and cons. You are able to use a controller with this game. I was able to use both a corded xbox 360 controller and a PS3 controller. It was more difficult to use the PS3 controller but it was well worth the effort. Of course you can use a keyboard but its not really advised.Achievements: The achievements for this show an improvement over the FF7 achievements. Its nearly impossible to complete the game with all achievements in one go. Most of the achievements are simple and self explanatory but there is one or two that will make for a challenge.Bottom Line: The game averages for about $12. On sale it has been as low as $5. Even for full price its worth picking up for some nostalgia but at the same time I would wait for the next sale to pick it up. The game is a lot of fun even though nothing has changed in 15 years but its worth picking up.			"

												Still a better love story then Twilight.................... but not by much. Honestly the weakest point of this game is the writting. The mechanics are ok, if not a bit grindy and easy to manipulate. Overall not the best of the Final Fantasys.  The side quests are very guide-dang-it. Most of the achievements are easy to get, 10,000 kills and The max gil ones are stupid since they don't add challenge just grind. Good for a couple days play. Even if there is a few plot holes left unfilled. I recommend it becuase its a fun game overall despite its flaws.			"

												Great old game!  If you like JRPG's and are too young to remember this classic, definitely check it out!  That being said, if you already own the game on the original console, you mightn't bother.  While the game looks much better than it did on the original console, it doesn't really add much to the experience.  But, regardless, this is a great game!  I would definitely suggest it!BTW The background graphics aren't really represented very well in the above screen shots.  While they're more clear than the original, they're still not crystal clear.  'Bout my only real complaint.EDIT:  Ok.  Seriously, people?  Even in they didn't add a bunch of new content, it's still a great game.  And I know there's a ton of Steam users who are too young to remember it and that I honestly doubt would play it if they didn't get it off here.  Just let them give it a chance before you ward them off.			"

												This was a bit of a watershed moment for the series; hot off the success of its most realistic entry in the series to date, Square moved further toward fantasy - but unlike more recent entries, it kept a healthy dose of fantasy. This game scares many off with its potential for long grinding and its polarizing protagonist (who I love), but I name it one of my favourite RPGs, Final Fantasies, and games in general. The Steam version is as good an opportunity to check it out as any - with subtly refined graphics and no need to swap discs.			"

												CAUTION: The Square Enix DRM has makes this game completely unplayable when their server is busy.  Apparently this happens every time they have a large rush of orders (like when their products are on sale).Once I was able to access the game it was much as I remembered it when I first played it ~15 years ago.  An XBox controller can be used for much of the game, but some keyboard commands are necessary.   I don't think the controls in this game were ever very good, but they don't seem to be any worse, so I guess that's something...The Hi Speed update is definitely a plus over the original.  The cut scenes are pretty cool the first couple times, but they get very tedious after the 20th.			"

												I seem to be the only person I know who actually likes this game. I have no idea why - it's by far my favorite Final Fantasy game, and the only one I've bothered to play through all the way to the end. I found the story captivating, the characters were memorable, and the gameplay was great. My favorite thing to do was just walk around and play Triple Triad with random NPCs, collecting more and more cards as I progressed through the game. Although the technology of the day caused this game to have somewhat limited graphics, Square did a great job in trying to create a more realistic looking gameworld, including properly proportioned human characters rather than deformed little sprites. If you never played this game back in the day on the Playstation because of its bad reputation, it's worth giving it another shot now and considering how revolutionary some of the ideas used in this game were in retrospect. I can only hope that this game gets a reboot in the future with some updated graphics, so that a new generation of gamers can be turned on to the great storytelling this game has to offer.			"

I can't put into words how much I love this game. Playing through it brought back intense childhood memories, memories I never knew where there. Disc one is an absolute masterpiece, followed up by a whole bunch of fantastic craziness. 10/10As for the time Steam says I have logged, that's wrong. Supposedly there is a bug when you play the card game, Triple Triad, it adds more hours onto your playtime. Odd.			"

												Final Fantasy VIII is one of my favorite games of all time. I ignored the criticism that VIII got in comparison to VII and in the end fully enjoyed the game. I felt that its Junction system was much more fulfilling than the Materia system ever was, allowing you to really customize characters for battle. Yes drawing magic from enemies can be tedious, but its not required to always have 100 casts per spell so the tedium was brought about because of people being stubborn. The story, though sometimes cheesy, is overall very enjoyable. Character development is failry weak as a whole, but really strong for certain characters. The music is beautiful but beware PC buyers, you won't be hearing it like I had 14 years ago as the PC version has horrible low-quality midi music. Download the Roses and Wine mod to add the original PS1 score, or even add in the orchestrated stuff that sounds absolutely beautiful. Graphically, the game hasn't aged well. Of course, it was originally a ps1 game. The pc version has SOME enhancements, if you can call it that. running it at a higher resolution is pointless as the pre-rendered backgrounds are very low quality, and the new in game models are nice but for some reason the world map looks very bad. I turned on the original graphics to get the original feel back. Yes its pixelated, but its beautiful pixelation. Overall, I feel that FFVIII is one of the best in the series. Yes the junction system can seem convoluted, but if you pay attention to the tutorials and just tinker with it, you can see just how much power comes out of it. NOTE: THE MAGIC BOOSTER IS GAME-BREAKING. You can use it from the launcher. it requires a save file, and it breaks the game. It gives you 100 casts Cure, Cura, Curaga, Fire, Fira, Blizzard, Blizzara, Thunder, Thundara, Sleep, Blind, Silence, Berserk, Bio, Esuna, Aero, Confuse, Break, and Zombie which are all very powerful and mid/high level spells, meaning that you can junction high magic for extremely high stats early in the game. I thought it'd just fill up spells i already owned from the list above, but it actually GAVE me the spells I didn't have. Keep that in mind, as once its used you can't undo it on your save file.  "

It's without a doubt my favorite final fantasy and I'm enjoying the playthrough of it again. =DThe only thing that's detracting is the (in my opinion) horrendous job they did porting the music over and ""remastering"" it. The original's music was far superior and I'm hoping we'll get a fix for it because it's the biggest thing that would take away from it.Other than that, it's a hell of a lot of fun.			"

												FF8 has had a rough time being compared to the overwhelming success of FF7, however when you take the game in its own right then it is amazing. I first played this back in 1999 and here I am in 2014 replaying it again the 'n'th time. The only drawback that I can think of is the slow pace of the 2nd disk, this has been the reason why many of my friends did not complete it, which to me is a shame as disc 3 makes up for it. If you have never played it then I would really recommend this title!			"

												TL;DR: Crappy port, don't buy.Back in 2000 they released a PC version of Final Fantasy VIII. Back then, it didn't compare very well to the original PSX version of FFVIII. The music sounded a lot worse than the PSX, and the visual quality when compared left a lot to be desired. This steam edition that has been released has changed..... nothing. It's almost like they re-released the exact same game from 2000 with the same crappy MIDI music and worse graphics. In fact, I'm pretty sure that is exactly what they did, which is a pretty low blow to fans everywhere.In addition to that, the game doesn't support thumbsticks on your controller, so you're stuck with the very choppy 8 direction movement without much fluidity to it.Now originally my review was a bad review, however in light of the previous aspects, you can however modify the game to have better FMV sequences, and better (or even custom) music. I have done so and the game is much more tolerable. This is the kind of stuff the developer should be doing anyway, but maybe they'll fix something in the future. If you know how to mod this game, the port isn't that bad after all.			"

												If you're into old style RPG's, I can honestly say that you will love this game.  There's a good story, wonderful character depth, a creative battle system, and next to no need to grind.  In short, this game was made to be beaten at any level and still maintain enough difficulty to be fun.  In addition, a plethora of sidequests make exploration worthwhile.That being said, there is some slightly justified complaint about the audio.  While I agree that it could be better, I have never been bothered by the quality in this game.  To the contrary, I've rather enjoyed it.  Any score written by Nobuo Uematsu is worth listening to, even the 'primitive' MIDI's.			"

												I was a bit leerily at first because of the comments regarding the music and it being the old MIDI files from the original PC release. However I did a bit of research and found an amazing music mod right from the steam community.


Better Music Mod (Updated) 
A Guide for FINAL FANTASY VIII
By: Osaka

			A simple way to replace the default music with better, PS1 quality music.		


Osaka's ""Better Music Mod"" works wonders and comes with a very easy to use installer. I used it immediately upon purchase and had no issue with installation. While at time the music might hiccup when I start the game (and by this I mean it's not there) all I need to do is restart the game fully and it works again like a charm. It makes the game play the original PS1 musical score to bring you right back into the wonderful world of nostalgia.Square redid most of the models for the characters and the cutscenes so they're of better quality and all in all it's been amazing to relive this game again. After my PS1 game bit the dust midway through Disc 2 and then I lost my memory card, I've wanted to replay this game. This rerelease is everything a fan of FF8 could want and I highly recommend it.

												Alright I have seen both positive and negative reviews on the version released on Steam.Here is my take Limitied SpoilersYes they messed up the bio about the game.  Final Fantasy 8 follows the lone wolf Squall on his journey to become a SeeD member. SeeD is the elite mercenary force of Balamb Garden. Seifer is pretty much Squalls rival in all regards. The game begins with Squall having to pass a GF exam to participate in the offical SeeD mission for cadets. After he passes that he along with 12 Seed and 12 Cadets must save Dollet from a Galbadian takeover. That is all I want to reveal as the storyNow most reviews talk about how the MIDI music adversly affects the gameplay. Now while I agree the music isnt that extremely different from the PS1 Version.  SE could have taken the time to add the original ST in but it wasnt needed. I am sure there will be a mod for the game that fixes it, however I personally like the music. It is uniue to the PC version.Now another aspect that reviews hate on: MAGIC BOOSTERThis is a neat little feature to the game but it isnt needed at all. Just click PLAY and never touch the BOOSTER icon if you want the original play style, having to draw and junction magic, as well as refining it from items. I started playing and my old PS1 instincts kicked in, never having to think about MB. I had Card, Card Mod, HP-J and 1000 affection with Quezacotl before even leaving for the Dollet Mission. You dont have to use MB but its there if you want it.Finally the GF summoning sequences and soundsTHe only GF that is horrible is Quezacotl but it is endurable because his sequence isnt long, every other GF has been accurate to the PS1 Version.  If you dont like Quezacotl then dont use him but that again doesnt diminish the gameplay experience. Everything you had to do on the PS1 version you need to do hereAnyway I recommend people who have never played FF8 to play it on Steam. It is worth it considering everything from the storyline to mechanics are the same.			"

												There are some perfectly valid complatints about this game, but I prefer the Steam PC port to the original Playstation version because a) it's a lot smoother with much faster loading times, and b) because my Playstation stopped working several years ago.FFVIII was my favorite game and the first console game that I owned and playing through the Steam version has made me realize that it is still my favorite. If you're new to FFVIII then the junctioning system will take a little while to get used to, but once you've mastered it you just might find it to be one of the cooler systems of character improvement out there.The amount of spells, Guardian Forces (GFs),  weapon upgrades, and Triple Triad (an in-game card game that I didn't understand as a kid but absolutely love now) give players a plenty of stuff to do outside of the main story, and while there definitely isn't enough content for Skyrim quantities of game time, you will still find plenty to do in the game (at least, once you've gotten your first airship-equivalent).

												My favorite Final Fantasy is on steam!!! Any who this game has a great, well written, deep, and twisty sotry line that takes more then one play through to catch on to. The draw mechanic is a love it or hate it system. I like it because it brings a new face to the magic system in the game. The GFs (the summons) are some of the most memorable second to Fianl Fantasy X's aeons. This game offer a great challenge, and can offer hours apon hours of play. The upgrade system as opposed to buing new weapons gives upgrading your party members a new challenge. IMO this is as good as Final Fantasy gets.			"

												Without a doubt one my favorite Final Fantasy games; FF8 sports an interesting leveling system unique to the series where the enemies level in power and skill based on your level.  This makes it so every location you visit, regardless of its original level, a challenge every time.  But this does not mean that you need to be on even ground with the monsters you are fighting due the interesting, and very strategic, Junction system.  This system allows you to use magic, and your summoned creatures to not only tip the field of battle but to completely throw it off and allow you to dish out massive damage, while at the same time turning you into a damage sponge.Off the top of my head, I believe, the game has about 16 summon creatures called Guardian Forces.  These GFs work as an augmentation device, as noted above, but also serve a number of other useful positions.  With a GF attached you will be able to equip your normal system, items, summoning, and the most important being draw.  I’ll talk about that in a moment though.And although the GF can equip these basic skills, at first, there is a medley of other things that it can equip as well, which would include stat buffs outside of the magic junctions, special attacks, enemy avoidance, the ability to turn enemies into trading cards, and many others.  Most of these skills are learned through fighting battles while other, more powerful ones, can be purchased at pet shops or can be found later in the game.  Now we move onto the magic system.  Again, it is interesting, different, and happily strategic.  There seems to be a little more strategy in this normal FF title than there seems to be in your average tactics game, but I digress.  Players do not have the ability to outright use magic, instead, they Draw magic from specific draw points or from any enemy in combat (tedious but preferred) and storing it for your junctions or using it.  I normally just kept them for the junctions since most bosses have something that will dump the scale in your favor (You can use and take whatever they can use).A little added piece would be to always draw everything you can from every boss you find.  This will often give you powerful magic and hidden GFs.Now above I mentioned that you could turn enemies into trading cards and this doubtlessly raised an eyebrow or two.  This is for the card game Triple Triad, a game found in this particular world.  Now normally I avoid these mini-games like the plague but this one actually has a useful purpose.  Aside from a few achievement unlocks, a good number of the many cards in the game will give you items if you use one of the GFs special abilities to convert cards into items or powerful magic.  The game itself is also pretty fun as the matches are quick and the rules and play-style change as you go to different places.  Also the rules and play-style of other areas will dynamically switch with others.The story is interesting, it has evolving characters, aside from the obligatory emo lead character that Japanese games seem to love so much, and it will keep you invested and engaged along with some side missions and story tied secret bosses thrown in for a bit of fun on the side.The big reason to play this game is for the strategy involved in it and how it will hook you just from the into movie.  And although it is a little dated for today, and some of the characters and story elements are sort of stale and overused in the genre, it really doesn’t pull too much on the overall impact of the game.  Final Fantasy 8 is still an 8/10.  It’s a really good game and should be a part of any RPG fans library. "

												This is a good re-release of a classic game.  If you like the Final Fantasy series, or liked the original, you'll probably like this game.  If you really like the original, you'll probably enjoy this game less than last time you played it, just because of the music quality in this port or whatever.			"

												While by no means a perfect game, FF8 is a worthy bearer of the Final Fantasy brand-name (unlike some of the later installments in the series).  A singular, quite bizarre story of love and rivalry, told in a world where magic and technology are not at war but exist side-by-side.  Definitely worth playing, even with dated graphics!			"

												I have played the game on other platforms before this, so.. The leveling and magic system isn't broken, and hell, i'd go so far as to say it's neat and well implemented. The problem is that it is incredibly obtuse. I'd even argue that the whole game is pretty obtuse. The plot has a lot of cool little threads and ideas that are really never well explored, and some characters feel a bit hammed up, and I feel like there was a major missed opportunity for the Final Fantasy series to explore some dark and very interesting themes, but ultimately such a thing never really materializes. The music is great, the graphics are nice, I like playing cards with computerized strangers. I would reccomend it because maybe such things won't bother you and hooray music hooray graphics and oh my god girly scream ROMANCE			"

												A blast from the past now on steam, but defenitly has some issues. As I spent a great deal of time playing this game when I was younger I've certainly noticed some differences with the steam release, and the major one was also present in Final Fantasy 7. The music is once again poor quality like FF7, the difference being is the lack of outrage toward the FF8 release may not persuade those working on it to change said poor music quality as FF7 has the more rabid and certainly larger fan base. On a lesser note(and certainly more opinion based)is the lack of a vibration function for those using controllers. As I mentioned I spent a lot of time on this game, and a small problem in combat is Squall's gunblade mechanic not having the difinitive confirmation of critical strikes. Again this is a small issue, but having the visual queue flash on the screen I feel is not enough for some players, especially those who have never played the game before. I could go on about the games highly angst driven plot based on a love story. I could go on about the silly draw mechanic and the metric tonne of time it will waste but you could easily watch Spoony's review for that. The drive for buyers here is content with a capital C. There's months worth of gameplay for newer players here and I can recommend it for that alone really, even if the price is a little steep. Regardless it's still a decent port that I'm going to play to completion for sure.			"

												Fantastic, exploitable gameplay. Love the junction system because of its ""flaws"" and possibilities. The story is one of the weirdest in the series, love Biggs and Wedge and few other comical moments. Story is at it's best at the end of the disc 1 and in the beginning of the disc 2 and throughout disc 3. By Disc 3 most, previously on disc 2 introduced sudden plot elements blend out of the focus and the story reaches a definitive goal. Don't fancy too much the teenage high school drama, though the romance thing between the main character and the girl with the dog is at times deep enough. As a pre-owner of the psx version I do have to say that the pc version does not have the same audio. Lack of ogg. based audio balances out with enhancing mods and the ability to replace midi-audio with ogg.audioFirst timers: Go ahead. play it. Even better, buy it on sale. Veterans: do you feel nostalgic enough? There are the added cheat tools / 3rd party save editor that make it possible to do an all-nighter or even an all-dayer of the story + most of the optional things.How about a Laguna spin-off title? that'd be great.8/10			"

												Great and intriguing storyline, which is to be expected from pretty much every Final Fantasy game. I have been playing Final Fantasy for a while now and I have come to know and love it! The characters are great (and sometimes even funny) The graphics in FF8 are pretty good for it's time. The cutscenes and cinematics are AMAZING as they are more animated and have better graphics than the actual game. Save points are common enough and there isn't a huge emphasis on grinding. However I like the battle systems from the earlier Final Fantasy games better, the battle system for FF8 is good. You need to press G right when you land your attack to deal extra damage. It's a cool little feature, but personally I prefer the more simple battle systems found in the earlier Final Fantasy games. Namely: Final Fantasy 3. All in all it's a great game! 8/10			"

												Part of why I think this game gets so much hate, even from me, is that it came on the heels of one of Final Fantasy 7, of of the best selling and most well loved RPGs of all time. Final Fantasy 7 had a brilliant and customizable battle system, an engaging story with interesting characters and an awesome soundtrack. Final Fantasy 8 has... an awesome soundtrack, at least. To be fair, the story is pretty interesting all the way through the end of disc 1, but then things get so weird and hard to follow and major plot points are added and removed on a whim, as though the game has ADD and can't decide on what kind of story it wants to tell you. But the battle system is...oh god it's a total trainwreck.So one of the many flaws of this game's battle system is its ""junction"" system. In FF8, magic spells are treated as a consumable item. Kind of a weird choice, but I don't have a problem with that necessarily. What I DO have a problem with is that spells are a consumable item AND the game allows you to ""junction"" them to your character to improve their stats. The better the spell, the more the stat increase. If you follow this chain of logic, you'll realize that if you have a high level spell junctioned to your character and you cast that spell, your character's stats will actually decrease. So then what's the point of casting magic? There is none in a normal playthrough, especially when you consider that your summon monsters, called GFs in this game, can be called upon to essentially cast any magic spells you'd want anyway, provided you don't mind watching a 45 second cutscene of the GF appearing EVERY FREAKIN' TIME. There's lots of odd decisions like this that slow the battles down in FF8 and make them tedious. Even the way you get magic is a chore. You can ""draw"" spells from an enemy, but depending on a few factors the game doesn't really explain, you'll only typically get around 3-6 spells per draw. Which means you have to sit in a battle and farm draw for quite a long time if you want to get up to the maximum of 100. But really the most broken thing about this game is when you discover you can manipulate limit breaks. Your character's chance of limit breaks are actually random in this game, another odd choice. The less health you have, the higher the chance of the limit break. But if you cycle your turn order, you can keep re-rolling the calculation that determines your limit break, essentially letting you limit break whenever you want. Totally. Broken.Now that I'm done ranting about the battle system, on to the story (mild spoilers in this paragraph). It really does seem like it's gonna go somewhere for the first, maybe quarter or third of the game. But then we hit a point after disc 1 where the narrative has an identity crisis and starts grasping at different ideas and concepts and inserts them randomly into the story which results in a totally insane mish-mash of disconnected themes and gaping plot holes. I know Final Fantasy is a universe where characters get shot, sliced and burned in every battle, but the first huge narrative red flag is when one of the main characters is freakin' impaled through the heart with a giant icicle during a cutscene... and then is totally okay in the next scene. Like the game barely even acknowledges that it took place. Come on Final Fantasy 8! If you're not gonna take your story seriously then I can't either. The artwork and music are the huge redeeming factors of this game. FF8 features some of the most gorgeous hand-drawn backdrops in any RPG I've seen. And this might be controversial, but I think FF8 is Uematsu's best work. At the very least it's my favorite of his work. The relaxing ""Breezy"", the entrancing ""Find Your Way"", the mysterious ""Under Her Control"" and the nostalgic ""Fisherman's Horizon"" highlight the soundtrack. And of course ""Man With the Machine Gun"" does its best to keep the mindlessly tedious and broken battles from being too much of a nuisance.SummaryThis is far from the best Final Fantasy, and misses the mark on battle system design and storytelling. At best it's an average-ish RPG with a trippy story, some awesome music and inspiring artwork. Still there is something sort of intangibly alluring about playing this game. I must admit I've replayed this trainwreck at least 3 times now.For more game reviews, check out http://whatisjamesplaying.blogspot.com/ "

												This is one of my alltime favorite games. Great story that goes beyond what it starts out to be and it does it so smoothly and with reason that you don't realize that you are right there with the game on why things are happening. The junction system is what the game mechanics are ruled by and if you master it you can become more poewerful than anything else in the game. there is a status junction called death that when at level 10 charecter can kill a level 99 monster in one hit. Serously. There's all kinds of stuff in this game that you never have to be aware of and can finish this game missing so much extra items, people, guardian Forces. Guardian Forces or GF, gives you the ability to junction spells to your stats. Also helps improve stats. With the correct Junctions you can absorb every elemental magic that you are hit with and heal yourself by 100 percent. The usual people and what not make their appearences, Biggs and wedge, ifrit, bahamut. Mini games, chocobos. Im over fifty hours into and have so much more to do.			"

												What can I say about this game? I remember the day I bought this gem and if anything, this game has matured like a fine wine. It's not often I can say there are games which I have played for several years and can still find new things to do when I already thought that I had turned the game completely inside out. After a few years without playing this game it still felt brand new to me and it certainly didn't feel too heavy to play after several hours like I have found with some other classic games.For those of you who have never played this game - I really don't see what is stopping you! It has everything any RPG fan would want. Story rich, relatable characters, comedy, side quests. Triple Triad itself is such an enjoying time killer that I often found myself playing the card game more than the actual main quests. That's not taking anything away from the main story though. Although I wouldn't say this is the best Final Fantasy by a long shot, it still has 40+ hours of gameplay to whet your appetite, and an addictive enough story that you might just start a new game right after you finished it just in case you could have done things a little differently.The Junction system also deserves a little praise, I think. It's reasonably unique compared to other games in the Final Fantasy franchise, but it's also very simple to master, making this Final Fantasy a better choice for those who are new to these kinds of games. It also leaves a lot of room for experimentation, which unfortunately a lot of the other games seemed to lack. Basically you can tailor your teams abilities to how you want to play and not have skills restricted to one person. Though it should be noted that this comes at the cost of the usual various armours and robes you could buy in their place.The only major discrepancy I would have with this version of the game is the sound. There is no in game option to turn off or even lower the BGM to an acceptable level. It is just constantly blaring in your ears unless you turn off sound completely on your system. I can understand how it may not bother some people. but it just felt like it could have been put together in a more appealing way if the sound were better as a whole.In terms of gameplay my only real dislike is the way you get paid. Although admittedly getting paid for a job you do makes more sense than monsters having a coin purse on them, money doesn't really come into play in this game because of the item drops that enemies make. Perhaps you can buy a few potions or synthesize your weapons, but beyond that you will have an excess of money that is only there to look pretty.			"

												Final Fantasy VIII, you either hate it or, like me, you love it. Whether it is the twisted story, the junctioning system, or the addicting triple triad card game, something brings me back to play more and more of this game. There are so many Guardian Forces (your summons), some fun side quests, and even the poketstation game Chocobo World, that is availible on the Steam version. Everytime I play this I remember back to the first time I played and the mistakes that I made and to this day I am just as exicted to play this as I was the first time.			"

												I played this game on the PS back in the day and was excited to own it on PC.  It definitely runs smoother on PC (battle scene transitions, flying Ragnarok is faster).  The game's story is phenominal and has unique features like the junction system and GFs.  A major flaw with this version is the horrible MIDI soundtrack... which is easily fixed with the various mods out there, but still should have been addressed from the start!  Overall, the game is excellent and is worth buying.  Read up on the various MIDI fixes and play some FF8!			"

												I played this game ages ago on the console and it was never really one of my favorites - as much as I love the Final Fantasy games, this one was only slightly higher on my list than FFX. It's just the game overall that sort of drives me insane on this one, with the card game, obnoxious characters, and the incredibly stupid battle mechanics.That being said, it's more than playable still. It's a time killer for me, more than anything, but this is still faithful to the game, at least as far as I've seen so far. The graphics are decent enough, pretty much on par with what I remember from the Playstation and not on par with more recent games, but still good. I believe there's a skip feature on this for cutscenes, but it's convoluted to access, so I just kind of twiddle my thumbs through them if I have to watch one more than once. But the controls are easy enough to reconfigure and use quickly.Really the only faults here for me are ones that already had existed in the game to begin with.That card game that is nothing but a massive waste of time. It's pretty much impossible to win any games at the start anyway after you're given your first few cards, because they are useless and everyone around you has much better ones. So it's not even worth playing against anyone until a bit later in the game when you've had a chance to gather some new cards. And even then, it's really not worth it unless you just like to drag your game out for no real reason.Drawing magic is tedious and annoying, and while it's more convenient than an MP gauge that runs low constantly, draw points are often unpredictable and not always the best plan. Luckily, the game comes with a cheat you can access upon start-up of the game that rids you of this problem by maxing out your magic, but if you don't like to play with cheats on, it wears on you after a while. Waste battle moves to gather magic from enemies, or hope you find a few draw points for what you're looking for while you're out wandering around the map; it was a neat idea, but not terribly practical for the long haul.Then there's the GF system, which requires you to attach a summon to a character to have any battle options other than 'attack'. Again, it's an interesting idea, to an extent, but then simply giving you the option to assign summons to certain characters and leave it at that would have been fine. The way this is done, you literally HAVE TO assign one to a character or they can't even use items during battle, and that is just ridiculous. It forces you to constantly re-adjust your set-up any time a character joins or leaves the party, which while that tends to happen anyone in one of these games, this entire system makes it beyond ridiculous.Granted, there is an upside - every character has the potential to summon during battle, and for boss fights, or just higher level creatures you probably should have run away from but don't want to, this can make things go quickly when you have three characters just constantly summoning their GF for their turns. There's also the benefit of being able to swap magic around between characters for the optimal set-ups, which, while I do hate this system overall, they did at least do it effectively.And as for the story, well... It's Final Fantasy, what do you want? It's big, wartime-related, and that's about all there ever is to them. Obviously there's other little elements, but at the end of the day, it's what every Final Fantasy game boils down to in the storyline.So all of that being said, the game is still *good*, it just depends heavily on your taste in Final Fantasy games. VII, VIII, and IX were all relatively different in set-up as they gave some new things a try, and that's good. It's helped sort out what does and does not work for the current games. This one is never going to be my favorite, and I certainly wouldn't even really count it in the top 3 for the franchise, but it's worth playing if you enjoy the games as a whole. Just prepare for some frustration with some of the mechanics.			"

												Pros: - You can enjoy it for months. At this price, there's not much to complain.         - CG is not so bad. Compared the new games, of course, there's a lot to be desired, but really it isn't so bad.         - The story keeps you moving. It's not repetitive.         - GFs are cool and so fun to use.         - No MPs to limit your GF or magic use.         - Limit breaks of each characters vary greatly and are all interesting.           - Insanely beautiful characters. Every single-one of them. Cons:         - It can be so corny and cheesy at times. The romance between Squall and Rinoa takes up so much time and is just lame. I almost puked when Rinoa jumped to his lap and the sappy romantic song started to play. Seriously! I'm a woman and a fan of romantic comedies, but this is just too much and is not so tastefully done either.        - Rinoa can be really really annoying. She's so freakin nosey and always acts so self-important.         - GFs can be so powerful that it takes some fun out of the game.         - Limit breaks that can only be used when the character is about to die is quite pointless. You have to choose between saving that character or using the limit break. Can easily end up dead if you choose the latter. Some limit breaks can do so little damage that it's worthless. What's the point of a limit break if it does less damage than the simplest spell.         - Equipment cannot just be bought. You need to acquire certain items before you can buy it and god knows where you can obtain those items. All in all, you can't go wrong with Final Fantasy. Despite all the cons, it's still way better than most other RPGs out there. I turn the sound off and just hit the button randomly while reading a book or looking at my phone to get through all the cheesy love scenes.			"

If you understand audio files pretty well there is a couple of dudes who tried pretty damn hard to make it sound like the original so there is a fix. Besides the audio issues the game still manages to pull me in as it had done before.8/10 -- Audio was a really big thing for me but if you loved the gameplay or the story its all still there in its glory.

												tl;dr version: Do I recommend this game? Yes, but...Longer version: Full disclosure, I'm a Final Fantasy purist, and was a full-on fanboy going waaaay back in the day. So, I might be a little biased here. Be that as it may, I thought for a long time about whether or not I can recommend this game, and I settled on a yes. Overall, the positives outway the many, many negatives. Let's break it down bit by bit.Graphics: Well, they aren't good by modern standards. The FMV sequences have aged very well. The battle sequences look alright for their time - bear in mind that this game came out in the distant time of 1999. The overworld and otherwise walking-around parts have not aged well at all. Honestly, I always thought that Final Fantasy VII did a better job on these parts. Conclusion: Graphics aren't bad for a 16-year-old game.Sound: The PC port has really awful midi music. The fact of the matter is that if you want this game not to sound like♥♥♥♥♥ you're going to have to mod it. Fortunately, modding the sound is super-easy, and there's lots of stuff on the forums that can help you in this regard. Once you're up and running, bear in mind that you're playing a game loaded with classic FInal Fantasy jams. Uematsu is kind of a genius. Conclusion: Sound good after modding. Really, you shouldn't be the one fixing this; it should sound good out of the box.Gameplay: Well, it plays pretty much the same as any Final Fantasy-series game between about #5 and #9. That is, it's genre- and era-defining JRPG faire. You'll spend a lot of your time in this game in dialogue, so if you aren't into that sort of thing, you're not going to have a good time here. Battles are quasi-realtime/quasi-turn-based - the famed ATB system. Battles are actually a lot of fun - you'll control a party of three heroes and beat the snot out of colourful, fun monsters. I do have a few complaints on this front, though: Unlike other Final Fantasy games, there is no job/class system this time around. Your characters' abilities are based on their ""GFs"" (basically, the equipment and magic systems combined). Every character can use every GF, and every character can therefore use every ability. The only differences you'll see for the most part are in your characters' limit breaks. This makes the characters all kind of feel the same from a gameplay perspective. My other complaint is that this easily the easiest Final Fantasy game I have played (having played numbers 1 through 10) - seriously, difficulty is kind of a joke. Conclusion: If you're really sold on the mid- to late-1990s JRPG formula, you'll probably have fun, but the characters are very generic from a gameplay perspective.Story: Well, it's a JRPG, so story is almost the most important part. Personal opinion, the story of this game flat out sucks hard enough that I could use it to vaccuum my apartment. Your main character will spend most of the game muttering to himself. One of your main nemeses is a full-on angsty ""no one understands me!"" type. The secondary party members are virtually devoid of personality. Of the PSX-era Final Fantasy games, I can confidentally say that this game has the worst story. Hell, even when I WAS the angsty teenager this game is probably geared towards, I thought the story and characterization was a little too out there on this front. Conclusion: Easily the worst part of the game.Anyway, as to whether or not I recommend the game, given the price versus time you'll get out of Final Fantasy VIII, it's a darned good investment. Still, though, if you haven't played virtually every other Final Fantasy game between 1 and 10, you'll have more fun with basically any other in the series. #7 is even available on Steam. "

												My personal favourite out of the Entire Final Fantasy series.This game is such a Gem.I've played through it probably atleast 8 times in total. Of course, all on the playstation.Anyway, the graphics look SLIGHTLY more crisp than the original, the edges aren't as rough, it's def smoothed out a lot.It works Perfectly fine with a XBOX 360 controller, or with keyboard.The original game is 4 discs long, so you're guaranteed to have a ton to do in this game. There's even hidden side quests that you can do.THIS DOES COME WITH THE CHOCOBO WORLD. i remember not having the PSPOCKET to play it back in the day, so this is actually one of the very few features i havn't used. Maybe i'll be able to get my Guardian Force Chocobo this time ;)			"

												The only downside was Square Enix and their BS account verification. After buying this game, I attempted to play it and I could not, it said I needed a Square Enix account. I clicked register, it had me put in my email, and it said an activation email would be delivered. After approximately an hour of it not showing up, I went directly to the Square Enix website to attempt registration. I filled out the registration form, to the same result of another hour passing without an activation email. I attempted to contact their support but it had something about services ""not being available currently."" with no ETA on when they would be available, and so after trying multiple times to have the activation sent and to multiple different email accounts accross different email services, it still had not shown up after several hours and I want to play my game. And yes, I did check all spam folders, trash cans, and filter settings. I finally did get the email confirmation on my main email account nearly 14 hours later, so I am now changing my review to a positive one purely because this is a treasured game from my teenage years. But everyone be prepared for hours of frustration beforehand. I would recommend buying the game and getting it going a full day ahead of time before you plan to actually play it.			"

												Final Fantasy 8 on Steam is almost everything you would want the PC version to have; it has the graphics of the original PC version, and the control bindings are updated to support the keyboard a bit better than Final Fantasy 7's PC port. With the addition of hi-speed, and other small gimmicks, it is much easier to both play and replay the game, for both new and returning players. The only downside is - much like the Final Fantasy 7 version on Steam - the music is still producing bleeps and bloops, being in MIDI format rather than the original tracks.Other than that, it is still a solid release. The only improvement that can be made is to port the original tracks in place of the MIDI tracks.			"

												I won't compare this to FF7 because that arguments been beaten to death.There's a lot of good in this game; * Character models & locals are pretty (considering this is a PSOne game).* There a natural - no need to grind - level system that keeps enemies relative to your level.* It has an awesome in built card game called Triple Triad' which is quite fun and challenging..* Without the MP stat, money being barely used and no purchasable armor, micro management is minimised.* Lovely music.But there's some bad to counter such things.* I dislike the main characters; let me quantify that with the Heroes cover the entire spectrum of being annoying at times and I want to hit them all with Nunchuks at such times.* There's an awful romance in the not even worthy of the Twilight Saga - seriously the character in question  goes  from a ""Whatever..."" attitude to and I quote ""I can't go on like this..."" at the sight of his love interests unconscious state in like half an hours worth of gameplay.* Terrible in scene mini games. (Press X to slash Dragon...)* Flashbacks as a plot device to another annoying character.* No way points in areas.In summary if you can look past the bad main characters, and bad romance - and the fact this isn't FF7 then there's a lot to like. I'm still playing it. Maybe you'll find something about you'll like too :)			"

												This game is amazine! VIII has always been my favorite FF title.  The story, and all the characters are amazing, and durring those years as a somewhat solitary teenager, I spent many hours playing the FF titles.  This somewhat remastered version is fantastic, and gives the feel that I am opening up the world all over again.  I highly recomend this for anyone who is a fan of the FF series.  I think that this is one of the last of the pure old skool RPGs with a turn based battle system (you know, before they started messing with it and expirimenting with everything from real time battle systems to the god forsaken gambit system).  Although the tech is older, it is a visually stunning game with a compelling story.			"

												I love this game mostly for the storyline. But, the combat is a little to easy and repetative and is held as the easiest FF in the series. Junctioning system is simple with a skipable tutorial system for just about everything. Has a minicard game system in game which is fun and more challenging than the actual game itself. As such you should really only consider playing this game only if your really into romance type of thing or a die hard final fantasy fan that doesnt like the XIII series.			"

												One of my favorite RPG games. When it came out i were a bit dissapointed, because it were too different from FF7, but now i prefer it over FF7:D The main reasons i like this game, is the short stories and the music. I also like the battle-system, where you have GF that gain experience that you can use to unlock new abilities. The biggest drawback are summoning GF's takes too long time, and there's some GF's that i'd rather not use because they take too long time. I also found the last boss to difficult the few times i've tried it, and since then i usually end up getting tired of preparing for the last boss on CD4. Graphics looked pixelated. Have installed the Tonberry and Project Eden mods, and it looks much better now. If there's no more problem with the game, i got no problem recommending it. Except unless you got it on PS3 and don't care about achievements.Also had a little problem getting past the display of keyboard-mappins before starting the game, till i realised all i need were to press the x-button on the keyboard.

												The original game was one of the greatest classics! This game is exactly the same ...besides the addition of a few optional cheats, and a graphics change that's not really worth calling an upgrade.The graphics ""upgrade"" is completely unnoticable unless two screenshots are compared side by side. They're most definitely NOT worth the new system requirements. However if your system can handle it, the actual gameplay is equally as good as the original.There IS a seizure warning that you should take seriously. I don't have epilepsy but it's in my family. That said, playing with the new graphics in a dark room was very stressful on the eyes, however it was perfectly comfortable in a lit room. Whether the new graphics bother you or not, YOU CAN ALWAYS SWITCH TO THE ORIGINAL GRAPHICS IN THE LAUNCHER SETTINGS.Overall, it's worth paying to support and ultimately relive a classic!			"

												So....I just finished Dragon age Inquisition about ohhh...3 hours ago and decided I needed to calm down a bit. So I thought, "" Hmmm, my steam backlog needs some attention"" and I've been meaning to re-play a few older games ....just one last time. Trying to play through a Steam backlog is no quick or easy task as you may know! Looking through I saw FF8 and thought to myself "" You know, that's just what I need ""After I finished FF7 and then FF8 about 10 years ago, I decided that FF8 was definately my personal favorite out of the two. FF7 was fantastic, my very first introduction to JRPG's but 8 had something that catered to my personal tastes more. So, here I go again, my second playthrough, now on pc through steam. A few hours in I'm hit with the nostalgia and even though it's a little dated, I don't exactly remember the overall story but that's probably a good thing, at least it will keep me interested!  One thing I definately notice with this version of FF8 is that the graphics are a more crisp of course. Everything else is as it was, music is a little more clear but the general presentation and experience hasn't changed. Great addition to anyone interested in experiencing old school JRPG.			"

(give or take FF III or IV if you want to include those.) And of course you cant forget that awesome gunblade. Once I had bought FF VII and played it for countless countless hours I could not wait for this one to be released on steam and even better I found it on a Square Enix bundled mega-sale. For those who know and for those who don't you absolutely cannot go wrong with FF VIII on steam for your PC. 10/10.			"

												There are already thousands of reviews for this game that discuss the pros and cons of this game in great detail. I'd instead like to highlight some of the more glaring flaws of this re-release.Nothing has been changed. It looks, sounds and plays just like the original PC release. Considering the lack of work that has gone into this re-release, it's not worth the price if you already own a previous version. A character booster has been added, which I doubt very few people would bother with.Some achievements have also been added; they're shallow attempts at artificially lengthening the game. The most time-consuming of these achievements is ""10,000 kills"" - as the title suggests, one must kill at least 10,000 enemies. In a game where killing too many enemies can be detrimental, this is a silly achievement. I finished the game with only a couple of hundred kills, as do most players. Anyone who sets out to achieve 10,000 kills will likely use some king of key-pressing software. I would have preferred some achievements that require the player to use skill, perhaps more like the ""Contrived Finish"" achievement (wherein one must finish the game without the protagonist leveling up), as these kinds of achievements at least encourage the player to play the game differently.Anyway, it's Final Fantasy VIII. I recommend it so long as you pick it up when it's on sale.			"

												My favorite Final Fantasy is on steam!!! Any who this game has a great, well written, deep, and twisty sotry line that takes more then one play through to catch on to. The draw mechanic is a love it or hate it system. I like it because it brings a new face to the magic system in the game. The GFs (the summons) are some of the most memorable second to Fianl Fantasy X's aeons. This game offer a great challenge, and can offer hours apon hours of play. The upgrade system as opposed to buing new weapons gives upgrading your party members a new challenge. IMO this is as good as Final Fantasy gets.			"

												I don't recommend this to newcomers or players seeking a comparable experience to the PlayStation version. I do however, recommend this if you're up to modding the game. Roses and Wine is a perfect music replacement to get rid of the godawful MIDI in this particular release. I also suggest getting an FMV replacement pack, Square-Enix completely butchered them in this release. (Also, what on earth did they do to the musical timing in the overture, it's completely screwed up.) In the end, Final Fantasy VIII is a great game, but this port is not, at least not without modifications.			"

												This game speaks for itself. To deny yourself the pleasure of playing this game is simply blasphemy. Yeah ok, so steam made a big mistake and did not fix ths music for the second time to one of the FF games. Take what you will from my next comment. I bought and played through this game when it originally came out. Loved it. Great storyline, battle system, characters and character depth, so so on the graphics but not bad for its time. The MOD that was made by R&W is actually quite exquisite. If you compare the music with the original PS soundtrack, you will come to realize that as good as the music isl , you will still get a somewhat ""midi"" type feel for it. The re-done orchestral/rock version that R&W came out with is quite pleasing to the ear/ I am however bias due to my liking to orchestral music. It's new and different and adds a bit more depth into the various battle/story line sequences. Bottom line is this.If you are holding back on getting the game because you are waiting to see if they ever patch it with the PS soundtrack and you are too lazy or don't feel you should have to download the mod replacing the currently horendous midi music, get over yourself. It's a great game and a lot of fun. You're only missing out and its noone's fault but your own. Thats my 2 cents. If you really want the PS music that bad then just purchase the game on the playstation store. Dont have a PS? Why not buy one? Seems to make perfect sense to go out and spend a few hundred on a system just to get the game. Makes about as much sense as not buying the game because you ""shouldnt have to download and install a mod to replace the music"" I'm not bias or a fanboy of steam but eh, people choosing to deny themselves the pleasure of owning this game just sickens me ^.^			"

												This game was worth the purchase when I bought it on sale. NOTE: Midi music has been put in and it's not the music we grew up and love. Grab a music mod and this game looks amazing on the PC. I'll take this RPG anyday instead of Final Fantasy XIII. There are hours upon hours of gameplay to get sucked into. There is tons of magic and cards to collect. If you like JRPG's, don't miss out on this classic game. I wouldn't recommend buying it for regular retail price, wait until its cheaper. Square Enix won't fix the sound, so I would recommend looking up how you can change the sound. It's fairly simple.			"

												What I liked about the game:The game's soundtrack is amazing! The music really suits the atmosphere you're in, and is simply beautiful!There's no voice acting in this game, but in a way, that relaxes me when I play this game.It's like reading a book but also with action, music, scenery and sound!I recommand playing this game if you love reading books or if you like real-life simulators,because besides its magic, monsters and time-travel, it holds so much thought, development in charactersand philosophy in it's well out thought story-line!What I didn't like about the game:Overall nothing really bothered me in this game, although you could discus wether or not you enjoy playing withit's combat system. It's different from the 'mana-usage' in most Final Fantasies because it works with units of magicinstead of one general pool of magic.You could also be bothered by the fact that it isn't as obvious that the story has some form of time travel in it.But in my opinion, it suits Squall's (the main character) character. Since; At the beginning of the game you don't really know what is in Squall's past , thus leaving you to fill in it yourself. But later on the story you get to know pretty much what happened then. But before then, you kind of conclude that there's this one enemy you have to defeat but it turns out differentthen you'd expect. And after all your reached goals you get to know that there's an even bigger threat.Wich could be good or bad, depending on your expectations.Also one more thing that could be bothersome is the fact that sometimes when you don't know that there's something you can collect you can forget it. That's why playing it once will probably not be enough. For if you want to get everything, you'd have to search for guides or (not recommended) figure it out by yourself. Although you could, but I don't recomment it, get everything you can by noticing the suddle hints.But overall, I'd say; Play it!The experience I got from it was worth it! And it'll leave you certainly with a satisfied feeling!			"

												While it is not one of the most popular Final Fantasy games with most people, this is my favourite title so far. A lot of the things that many felt let Final Fantasy VIII down are, in my opinion, what makes it so great. The unique junction system, different to any other Final Fantasy, is brilliant. The concept of having stocks of magic is a little off (how.... exactly?), and grinding to get those magics can be a struggle but it makes you appreciate them a lot more, especially when to be the most powerful you can be you have to have stocks of the most powerful magic in the game. But then if you use that magic, your junctioned stats will get less powerful. So then you have to weigh up what matters more. Many couldn't get used to the junction system, but I found it just as easy as the materia system from FFVII.The music is brilliant, some of my favourite music in any of the games. Also some of my least favourite... But that's a hit and miss with all the games. But honestly, some of the music had it nailed down.The story is excellent. A lot simpler in concept than FF7, but a lot more character driven than other titles. This is where most people either decide on their love or hate for the game. I personally love the storyline, think it's much easier to relate to than other main characters through the series and the characters are more real. Although Squall, as a main character, has to be the most emotionally unavailable person in history.I would recommend this game to everyone if I could, but I understand you may not like it as much if you're as hooked on the styles of the other games.

												I know a lot of people will say they got into gaming from early age with titles like Mario Brothers and so on. I was playing those games too. Sure. I was playing the early Mortal Kombats and so on. I loved going to the arcade. But if someone had to ask me to really pinpoint the one game that got me absolutaly fascinated with gaming as art form as well, I would say FFVIII. I know there were many other games of note before this - FFVII for example and other non Square titles, but I didn't get to play those. We didn't have a console growing up because my parents got addicted (HA!) and decided to get rid of it, and we were always just alittle behind with the technology to play the newest stuff on PC; I would hang out with friends and watch them play or play on their systems. This game we got when we finally had a PC then that could play it, and it was first time I played an RPG like this (although Zork Grand Inquisitor is my ultimate fave, there are differences here). This game is not something you can really bust your way through. It takes time to properly level your characters; you have to collect magic by either drawing it out from enemies or going around buying it, and I loved the concept that you could run out of the number of spells you had as opposed to mana; you have to really play through the environment to get the full experience. Okay, well, you can get through it faster by just sticking to the main story, but there are a lot of fun side stories and puzzles and bosses to deal with.Story wise, it's another romance tale, but I think Square Enix does them pretty well. You gave a broody, emo, angry male lead, Squall, but you learn why he's like that as you go on in the story. You're not really supposed to like him all that much until his character is further revealed, in my opinion. You have a bubbly, romantic, but motivated young female lead, who has other sides to her revealed as well. There's time traveling involved, and just don't focus on thinking about it too much because the storyline as a whole that involves a few twists and turns when a powerful sorceress makes a move on the world these characters inhabit is pretty interesting. It's character based too, and you tend to fall in love with a lot of them. The dynamics of gameplay is that you can design a your core group with up to 3 play playable characters. If you're not into custamizing characters often, might not be your thing, but they have a neat auto option that you can select and it does all the hard work for you. Combat is turn based, and it's not timed. I kind of like that, and it's almost more like chess (umm, just not the timed kind, I suppose). You can also collect guardian forces (GFs), which are powerful magical monsters that you can call upon and level up to create devastating attacks. Magic is, as previously stated, a collection game, and the most annoying thing can be spending hours fighting enemies to collect magic because stores sometimes only carry a certain amount of some magics. However, if you're into that kind of long haul game, it shouldn't bother you. If you're picking up this game as someone part of the new generation or just having gotten into gaming in today's age, you might think the graphics a bit backwards, but they were pretty spectacular from that time, and I still find them rather breathtaking. Cut scenes are pretty awesome and cinematic, as Square does. Also, I've heard the music for the game when bought and played through Steam is the midi stuff, and not the actual musical score originally played with. It's not that big of a turn off in my opinion, but might be for you, but for the price that FFVIII usually goes for, I'd say it's worth it to try and see. You can easily purchase the phenominal orchestra score on any web sites like amazon for example - and I highly recommend that (there is also a full piano album!). All in all, I highly recommend giving this game a try, especially if you are a fan of the RPG genre and haven't been able to play some of these older titles.			"

												It's Final Fantasy 8! I remember rushing to the store on the original release date (9-9-99) to pick it up for Playstation. Of course by modern game standards, it's going to feel a little clunky. Great storyline and battle system. Absolutely recommended!			"

												One of my favorite games. The first FF game I played was a demo of 8 from play station magazine. I went out and bought the only game I could find being ff7. 7 became my all time favorite game. Next I played FF8 and it was a close second for many reasons. I had my issues with this game but could enjoy it even with the problems. (Google spoony's reviews for 8). Even with minor problems I spent many hours playing this game and replayed the whole game with a walk through to get all the stuff I missed on my first play through.  The hard core fans of Final Fantasy will already buy this game. It is a little graphically dated as it was a Play station one game. if you enjoy JRGPs this is a good old game. As for being a PC port. its not much of an upgrade. other than the side quest game that was added (something to do with the chocobo world...) and I heard there is a thing that gives you full stacks of magic so you dont have to spend so much time drawing magic. I also heard there was issues with the game music. but that might get fixed by modders like the final fantasy 7 PC port. I personally just grabbed this on steam because its on sale this week(march28-2014) and it will give me something to do when I dont want to play games online.			"

												Best Final Fantasy in the series, the only thing wrong you will ever find out about it is made up by the ff7 fan club so that they can get all the attention (even though obviously their game is not as good). The game itself is a very deep story that revolves around itself (play to find out) and involves the amazing love story of Rhinoah Heartily and Squall Lionheart. I kid you not, this is the best game of its time and continues to compete in graphical content even with some of today's games (I'm not even joking about this one, though it pertains only to the FFVs). Definite must buy and if you don't like it I you're either lying or are just not fan of FF series (or are an ff7 hipster hah)			"

I have always been a fan of the Final fantasy series, and although, as read in the other reviews there are some graphical and sound issues, it doesnt take away from the original game.

												Great and intriguing storyline, which is to be expected from pretty much every Final Fantasy game. I have been playing Final Fantasy for a while now and I have come to know and love it! The characters are great (and sometimes even funny) The graphics in FF8 are pretty good for it's time. The cutscenes and cinematics are AMAZING as they are more animated and have better graphics than the actual game. Save points are common enough and there isn't a huge emphasis on grinding. However I like the battle systems from the earlier Final Fantasy games better, the battle system for FF8 is good. You need to press G right when you land your attack to deal extra damage. It's a cool little feature, but personally I prefer the more simple battle systems found in the earlier Final Fantasy games. Namely: Final Fantasy 3. All in all it's a great game! 8/10			"

												Final Fantasy VIII marked the beginning of an aesthetic overhaul for the franchise, capped off with a timeless romanticism that has aged remarkably well over a decade since its release. With an inventive customisation system, characters that would ideally be soundtracked by The Cure and a beautiful graphic presentation, Final Fantasy VIII is one of the series' most memorable worlds to unfurl in. Whether you're a retro RPG veteran or inured to the modernisation of this genre, Final Fantasy VIII remains an essential experience for all story and character driven gamers.			"

												Overly I enjoyed the pc version of Final Fantasy 8. There are buggy issues at times which others have mentioned in some of the negative reviews, but I didn't encounter them (or notice them at least) until the very end of the game. The problems at the end being the death animations of the final boss.The magic booster, which was added to the game, I like. Others call it cheating because it gives you a number of basic magic spells (including such late level magic like curaga) for free, but I personally don't feel like it gives you any magic which wasn't easy to obtain anyway. In my opinion, one of the drawbacks of ff8 was the grind in drawing 100 of each spell (especially if you try to have 100 of each spell on all your characters for various reasons such as refining it later) and I think that adding the magic booster was a good thing. The FMV's of the game held up well enough to me against the test of time, and hardly seemed that outdated (especially considering the game was released in 1999). Others have reported problems with the music, but I never had a problem with it, though maybe I am old school enough not to care. Pretty much, the music stood up to how I remembered it when I played it when it was first released.As far as the controls for the game go, they were on ocassion problematic. An example being Zell's limit break which requires you to type in keyboard combinations or the Timber Train Hijacking which required you to do the same thing. Overly, it seemed to me that the keys chosen for these types of tasks were poorly chosen by Square Enix, but I am playing on a laptop and consequently my keyboard may be different than others. Still, in the end, it really wasn't that hard to adjust. As far as the story and writing go, that didn't hold up to how wonderful I thought they were when I first played it (C'est La Vie), but it was still good enough to finish and having now replayed it as an adult, I can safely say I caught things which I had missed or forgotten.I do recommend the game as a solid RPG and as a classic for any fans of RPG's. The issues I've talked about in this review really were pretty minor to me and overly I enjoyed replaying the game.			"

												While there are some complains here and there from me about the PC port of Final Fantasy VIII, I will admit that taking a trip back down memory lane was and still is a great feeling. Even though that trip brings me all the way back to when I was in about the third grade and stumbled across our family's copy of Final Fantasy VIII for the PlayStation.Personally, the updated sounds are annoying, though there is luckily a mod in existence that brings back the even more nostalgic PS1 soundtrack back into the fray for anyone that is willing to extract it in. I enjoy the partial controller support as well, especially since that partial controller support can be edited back into the original PS1 set up of how one was introduced to the Final Fantasy controls.There is actually much neutrality in this post about actually recommending this to someone that is interested. I would say that if you have a PS2, or even a PS1 (or if it's available off of the PSN), to start from there instead of jumping the gun and buying it off of Steam. For someone that has not played the game and is unsure that their computer will run into the same snags and bumps in the road everyone else has, it would ruin a really good game that has a storyline that makes you sit and wonder about the reality of what is actually happening.As for me, I've come to grin and bear the outcome of what is going on with my game (and even ended up finding a solution that worked for me!). After clearing some data off my computer and verifying the integrity of my game cache, I'm quite pleased to say that the game is running for me. Though, this is a solution that may not work for everyone; if it does, then kudos to you! I hope you enjoy Final Fantasy VIII!Overall, I am personally happy with the game at this current time, and I'm even more happy to have Final Fantasy VIII officially show up in a collection of mine somewhere since my original PS1 copy cannot be found, and hasn't been able to be found for quite some time now.

												There are several reasons why you should play Final Fantasy VIII. First, they have good story line and also have great character development. Squall and his friends really grow up through the course of the game. It's one of the best romantic stories that you'll never find another love like this. Second, the soundtracks are beyond compare, They have good singers and smart composer. For example, ""Eyes on me"" was composed by Nobuo Uematsu and performed by Hong Kong pop diva Faye Wong, the song went on to sell a record breaking over 400,000 copies. Third, the battle system feels far more advanced (in a good way). The Junction system is a bit complicated, but it is one of the best systems because the character customization options offered by the Junction system are huge. You use junction system to summons and get the abilities. In addition, Final Fantasy VIII in Steam will providing graphic upgrade version that character in game look far more better than original version. Likewise, they providing Magic booster system to supporting players who are not good in RPG, this system can help them fight the battles easier. Besides, there is mini game call ""Chocobo World"" it's able to synchronise data between those two games and earn some spacial items. It's clear that Final Fantasy VII is worth to play and I hope you enjoy the game!!			"

												Memories... So many memories of childhood remembered from playing this game... This game, when we look back from the present, is a masterpiece. It's not always these days that a game developer would decide to bring and remake an old game for the present to enjoy. And sometimes, it can truly be depressing. We don't respect the old games at times, and we go for the new ones. What do we get these days? What do people decide to improve? Graphics, graphics, and more graphics. But I say a huge NO to that. Sometimes, people get too carried away on the graphics of games that they lack the most essential parts of games. The gameplay. The story. These two have been carried on by Final Fantasy in an astonishing way. They truly have created a game worth celebrating for years to come. We should not care only for graphics, but also the gameplay. Anyway, this FInal Fantasy, compared to other Final Fantasies, is still a masterpiece but I think Square Enix is starting to lose some of their touch as they progress onto the new ones such as A Realm Reborn. But I think they should always remember that the gameplay is most important, not the graphics. Excellent graphics but bad gameplay is still a bad game. I suggest Square Enix to look back at their previous titles, and keep up their previous great work. FInal Fantasy VIII is great, however I think it is too focused on one character, which is the protagonist, who is Squall. Final Fantasy VII did a great job in not only focusing on one character, but gives every character in the party a role to play, side quests, secrets, and many other things that makes the game truly worth playing and exploring every corner for. But a positive point I would raise up is the character development in this game. Square Enix explains in detail how Squall changed, but in an indirect but very detailed way. Squall, from a very unexpressive, lonely person, becomes an expressive, social person from just spending time with Rinoa. And that development is throughout the whole game, with 40+ hours of playing. Square Enix truly did a great job with this game. I reccomend this to anyone who likes RPG games, especially old school gamers who miss their old school games. If you're not one with RPG, I suggest you try it too, as you will find yourself slowly drawn into the Final Fantasy world with the story slowly engulfing you.			"

												Final Fantasy 8 is one of the great games of the PS1 era. If you're comfortable enough in your masculinity to enjoy an intricately woven love-story rife with combat, military and political intrigue, sorcery, discrimnation, and high-fantasy mixed with cutting edge science, then play this game!I could go on about it forever, but I'd rather let the game do the talking. At this price, its a steal. Enjoy your time at the SeeD Academy.			"

												Grew up with this game. The PC version doesn't have many changes aside from having to sign up for a Square Enix account. All in all, still holds its value and playability. 9/10			"

												FFVIII is arguably the best game in the series. Aesthetically and narratively speaking it's easily the stongest title, and the music is an audible joy. The only downside is a few questionable changes to the series' core mechanics.			"

												Absolutely love this game.  The magic booster helps with not having to draw a ton of magic in the beginning of the game making it a hell of a lot less tedious than it normally would be.  The updated graphics look great but the midi music is a let down.  I was impressed with the release of FF7 on steam but I was blown away by this re-release.  Don't miss out on this classic.			"

												One of my all time favorite RPGs brought to steam so I may play it whenever. I could not ask for more. I personally like the extra chocobo game thrown in and the tweak to some of the graphics.  A most buy for any fan of the series or turn based RPGs in general.			"

												I bought this game because i played it many times when i was younger and though i should pay for it at least once in my life :DIt has an awesome soundtrack, same as most of the final fantasys and a nice plot, i prefer the final fantasy XIX plot but this is good tooThe battles can be really boring if u focus on the use of the GF, but if u learn to kill monsters with attacks it can be really fast and entertaining			"

												There have been many Mods that fix the music issue but even without them this is one of the greatest games of my youth. This  is a bit more serious of an RPG but it is a very good game with a captivating story, if you choose to download the fixes for the music (you should) it has some of the most beautiful music in a game I've ever heard. There is an interesting junction system in game with magic that can make the game a little too easy at times but the game is a well done game with a fair challenge if you just travel through it as intended (or you can level to level 100 and grind out a bunch of magic/weapon upgrade through cards before you even go to the first boss and one shot the whole game....but that's no fun).All in all some new player may fall in love with this game but most players are old time veterans who love Final Fantasy for what it is and in my opinion this is a game that came out in the height of Squaresoft's existence. It's exactly as you remember (unless you had PSX music which you can DL) and honestly that's exactly as I would want it.			"

												Ok this game has a audio issues and does not sound anything like the ps1 version. If you understand audio files pretty well there is a couple of dudes who tried pretty damn hard to make it sound like the original so there is a fix. Besides the audio issues the game still manages to pull me in as it had done before.8/10 -- Audio was a really big thing for me but if you loved the gameplay or the story its all still there in its glory.

												I seriously love this game, I love the graphics, (Aside from when a cutscene has the character sprites still in it, the look very, very out of place) I love the characters, I even love the story, (which at first I couldn't really understand, but I get it now) Let's just say, I love everything about this game, and I highly recommend giving this game a go if you love any of Square Soft/Enix's games, or if you want to ""Test the water"" so to speak, it's great fun, just don't get sucked in to the mini-game like I did...

												This is my absolute favorite game so I'm definitely a bit biased when it comes to this game.  I love love love this game.  The story is rich and unique, the characters have depth and you get pulled in emotionally with them, the game has hours and hours of side quests that added on with the main story gives you plenty to do,  the music and scenery is gorgeous, and the card game in itself is brilliant.  The one thing I don't really like with the PC port is the controls.  It is very difficult to program a controller to play with the game the same as if it were on console.  Nothing much about the game itself has been changed so it's pretty much the same game.  It gives out some achievements now, but that's about all that is different.  If you want to own a digital copy, I'd say this port is decent enough.			"

												My favorite out of the ones originally released for the PS1. There are so many possibilities for challenge runs from low level to no Junctions to no GFs, or if you're in the mood to breeze through just use the Magic Booster to Junction insane stat boosts early on. Understanding the story requires being a fairly well-rounded nerd (world religions, time travel theory, military duty and honor, literature, and more), but is well worth working your brain to enjoy. It's worth the price for the Triple Triad minigame alone. A very well-constructed JRPG with a fair bit of replay value for those into self-imposed challenges.			"
