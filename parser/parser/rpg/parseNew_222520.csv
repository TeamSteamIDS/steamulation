												After (too many) years playing this game, I could sum it up like this :Pros :- Free to Play.- Unique RvRvR gameplay.- Fun fort and open field wars.- Mostly open-world.- Freedom of being able to do whatever you want at any time.- Simple and straightforward.- Nice community.- Free of Asian-MMO nonsense.- Light on system resources.- Premium not directly influencing gameplay.- Linux support.Cons :- Rubbish controls. (eg: not able to rebind spell keys)- Grinding nightmare. (And you need to be fairly high-level (>45) in order to get fun from the RvR.)- Really stale, boring and partially broken combat mechanics.- Omnipresent luck and randomness. (Enjoy having your spells and hits randomly being resisted and evaded for no reason)- Game of numbers with no diminishing returns system of any sort. (Usually the realm with most numbers will always stomp while outnumbered ones will be completely helpless.)- Very dull quest system riddled with bad translations.- Extremely basic guard and mob AI.- No crafting or jobs.- Very limited and crappy character customisation.- Fundamental design flaws leading to perpetual class and map imbalance.- Premium indirectly and increasingly impacting gameplay.- Out of date graphics.- Dull and repetitive sounds/music.- Worriying direction the game is taking (such as ruining RvR by implementing instances).- Support system sucks.- Same map that will appear boring and small after a while.- Not many capturable buildings.- Many hours of boredom before a few minutes of action happen most of the days, at least in the International server.- Not much to do in this game outside of grinding and warring.- Developers track record not really good, and sometimes acting in very unprofessional manners.- Major ignored problems, imbalances and bugs still ruining this game after so many years.- Lacks a ton of polishing in many aspects.- Linux and OpenGL support partially broken, many extra bugs and missing graphical features.I would have recommended this game a few years ago when it still had an interesting and unique potential, however not much improvement, and instead a lot of regressions have happenned in the past few years, while the root issues haven't been cared about so far.So as a conclusion, if you're looking for a well-made polished and complete MMO then you should not even bother with this. If you don't mind most of the aforementioned cons (especially grinding) and look for something simple, you might get some fun and new friends from it.			"

												ALERT! Don't waste your money!CoR used tu be hard, but at least ""fun"". But yesterday with the new update to the version 1.12.3 this game have no sense anymore, especially for new comer.If you're brave enough to download this game, here's what is expecting you:You have to waste one week to reach the level 30-35. Far in the past was the level to ""enjoy"" the warzone, the main feature of this game. But you can't enjoy anything, because the max damage you can do is 10-20 if you're lucky. But that was ""nice"" because was a way to leech some exp in pvp and gain a large amount of Exp from Fort Wars. Was an alternative way to make level without doing boring quest or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ grinding.Now with the new update you can't get exp from pvp, even if you kill an enemy of your level, if you aren't at least lvl 45 you can't get exp from pvp. And Reward (exp, gold and wmc) from Fort Wars doesn't exist anymore.So what you should do? Absolute nothing, you have to put money to get a ""mount"" and believe me, it's a must. The 90% of the quest is ""Go to the bottom of the ♥♥♥♥ing realm and come back!"" and you come back ""Oh i forget something, go to the other ♥♥♥♥ing bottom of the realm and come back! BUT FIRST! Kill some ♥♥♥♥ there and then kill some ♥♥♥♥ in the other bottom of the ♥♥♥♥ing realm"". Really, yesterday it took me 3 hours to do some boring and repetitive quest where i travelled around the huge realm. But if you wont do quest you can grind! Yes, grinding here is the most boring and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing to do, it's not like in the other mmorpg where istanced dungeon, group grinding or challening mob are making the thing ""original"". The grinding here is ""Find the kind of mob that you can kill in 2 hit to maximize your time"".NGD is trying EVERYTHING to make you bored as ♥♥♥♥ and put money to buy exp booster and some ♥♥♥♥ to leveling faster, because you can go in the warzone (THE MAIN ♥♥♥♥ING FEATURE OF THIS GAME) only at level 45+.So you have spent 1-2 month of constant grinding in this game, now you are ready to go in the warzone! Congratz! But in the warzone you will find all oldies level 60 with the best gear of the game, and so again, you will do 10-15 damage if you're lucky.So if you believe the quest/grinding part is the boring part, YOU'RE ♥♥♥♥ING WRONG.In the past capturing and holding a fort for 15 minutes was giving you Warmaster coin(200 - 600 - 900 ) to buy the pvp gears and stuff. But with the NEW ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 1.12.3 VERSION you will only earn warmaster coin by pvp, want to know the amount? An avarage of 3 THREE warmaster coin per kill. Want to know how much is the endgame gear, like the new rings and amulet of uberpower? 250K of warmastercoins. It means that you have to kill at least 83333 players to get a ♥♥♥♥ing amulet, the full armor is 60k, the weapon 45k, the ring 150k. So you have to spend you're entire life grinding players to get the ultimate gear (that almost ALL the oldies already have).Congratz you're son is graduated to the college, and after 10 years you are now a level 60 Warmaster, and now? Now nothing, there's no sense anymore, no fort reward, just skirmish in the warzone without any fun, no skill, no strategy. The team that outnumber the other wins.Congratulation to NGD, this 1.12.3 Version ruined the game.			"

												I have been playing this game for several years, and I always hoped that NGD (the games running developers) would eventually fix what they started, but the game has progressively gotten worse. Now I make purchases for in-game currency, and I am charged for what I buy, but I never recieve what I purchased. I sent multiple tickets, called my bank, the whole nine yards. The tickets were responded with useless♥♥♥♥♥♥that I really didn't believe. Their responses were just trying to get me to go away, and I still never recieved my ximerin. They owe me about 400-500 US dollars of in-game currency. DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME! THE COMMUNITY IS TRASH, THEY TREAT NEW PLAYERS LIKE♥♥♥♥♥♥ AND THE DEVELOPERS ARE TOTAL♥♥♥♥♥♥ Uninstalling now.			"

												Reasons why you might like this game:- You've never played an RPGMMO- You don't want to spend money on a subscription- You want a game that you can jump into at any time, and either have a relaxing questing session, or an intense action packed war.I have been playing this game for over 5 years, partly because its so addictive, and partly because there is no end.Its has every thing you could want from an RPGMMO, different classes and races, 3 different starting zones/realm, Epic bosses to farm for valuable loot, mounts, costumes, pvp, realm vs realm vs realm, ALL FOR FREE.There's no way to pay to win, but booster scrolls and loots scrolls etc are avalible for real money.The game is constantly being updated to new versions, with different events for easter/christmas/halloween.I hold no responsiblity if anyone gets addicted to this game :3			"

												Don't bother with this game, especially on the ""Haven"" server. The developers are unable to find a fair and equitable way to balance realm power and one realm (Alsius) steam-rolls the other realms and are granted wishes 2-3 times a day.  The developers are more interested in releasing more money making schemes than balancing the gameplay.  While the game still has potential, it's the ineptitude of the developers in keeping this game relevent that is a huge problem. They have also not fixed bugs with their own installed game version and only the steam installed version works with any reliability in Linux (unstable in opensuse 13.2 in kde4 with the latest version of gtk installed; apparently they have issues with gtk3/4 support.) Alsius is also the only realm that has a GM available more often, which runs special events for the Alsian players, while I have not seen a GM in Syrtis in over 3 weeks from the time of writing this review. The bonus they give people to join the under-powered realms is a totally useless 20 mins of exp/gold boost... by the time you log in and kill a few mobs...times up. Don't bother with this game, unless you wish to waste a LOT of futile time.			"

Short version: Free. MMO. Linux. Surprising quality for beta. 'Nuff said! 8/10, with room for improvement!Long version:Let's get the ugly bits out of the way. This game did not work when I first downloaded it (Linux). I had to reboot a couple times, use the update tool, and then suddenly - success, I got the game to launch! I'm pretty sure the default video mode was unhappy with my dual-monitor setup. This is standard fare for Linux gaming, so I was not dissuaded.Once I had it running, I was very impressed. This game is clearly in beta; there are occasional graphical glitches and inline error codes that really don't impact gameplay at all. Looking beyond this, however, we see a highly immersive and surprisingly well-polished MMO. There are several interesting and unique features that make this game stand out, even when stacked against its more well-funded peers. The regular PvE game is nicely paced and the quests are for the most part easy to follow. From what I've seen, the classes are well-balanced and there are enough features to keep things interesting for a very long time. The postgame feature, 3-way RvR, is a really great idea and stands out in the crowd. I'm not much of a PvP guy, but this system really makes me want try it and stick with it. As it stands now, the game is great, and I love playing it - but the potential for greatness is immense.Graphics: Beautifully done, with a unique art style that stands out. Needs a touch of polish in spots.Sound: Solid all around. Beautiful soundtrack, appropriate effects.Gameplay: Genre standard, well implemented and well delivered. Combat variety abounds.Controls: Intuitive and well-designed. A couple small snags, but nothing frustrating.Replay value: This game is HUGE and just begs you to keep coming back!Final word: TRY IT. If you like MMO, and you can handle a few minor glitches, you'll probably love this game!			"

												avoid this game.my account got hacked. at the first ticket I wrote they told me they already answered to this problem in another ticket (ticket screenshot: http://imgur.com/J9r1JQ4 ). main problem is that the ticket they named wasn't in the list of tickets I wrote so it wasn't wrote by me (screenshot with the tickets list: http://imgur.com/kBXA6eB ). they also closed to ticket. I wrote a second ticket they pasted 1 line from the ticket they named in the first ticket and closed again the ticket without helping me (screeshots with the second ticket: http://imgur.com/k96xq8j , http://imgur.com/asjaL23 ). at this point it was obvious for me that either they are making fun of me or they talked with the hacker, both cases are extremely bad. wrote a 3rd ticket, 1 week later and it's still not answered. I decided to make publick the way they answer to customer tickets (screenshots with the 3rd ticket: http://imgur.com/axrfxES , http://imgur.com/AXS1paT ). I made it public on steam here: http://steamcommunity.com/app/222520/discussions/0/154642447918162131/ but NGD staff delete it from steam also in same way they do it on their official forum!Review has been updated with tickets screenshots as result of NGD staff deleting my post in steam discussion!

												A good MMO for steam with a few techincal issues. The combat is fun and is fair, not like some other MMO's. The characters look good and my elf has gone through a lot in the two villages and I must say that I enjoyed it. I love how my friend and I bought the wizard's tower and we live up there. It's a very good moment. I highly recommend this game to anyone and I mean anyone. I give this game a 9 out of 10. I just love the game.			"

												Intersting game. I have a Warlock with lvl 54 at Valhalla. It was fun, fighting in the WarZone and always getting stuff of knowledge you need, to win vs better players. If you dont wanna spend tonns of money in this game to get good equipment, you need to play Warlock or Summoner, because both classes are most spell intensive. They can be so powerfull in ""1vs1"" against almost everyone, if you playing correctly.There is no way not to win as a ""low budget player"" vs ""high budget players"". E.g. A combintion of two warlocks (lvl 52) vs a high budget player babarian (lvl 60) can be devestating.Enjoyable grafics + huge mapNegativ-leveling without boosters is pointless because of the speed-small bugs are not corrected over a long time-time intensiv, till you can fight vs others-bad contacts to developers - facts you want to know, which are not published, you need to determine emperically "

												Champions of Regnum or Regnum Online (as most of the games community know it as) is an Excellent MMO for people who are looking for a game to play with Realm vs. Realm vs. Realm where you can capture forts with your alliance and invade your enemies. The games community are a great bunch that are welcoming to new players and some will be more than happy to help you.The game has some bug problems when it comes to pvp, but they are mostly caused by the difference in ping.The music in this game is very good, if you want to listen to something relaxing Syrtis is good for that. Alsius is a more up beat celebration music. If you want to listen to something evil then Ignis is good for that.if you can look past the bugs and the graphics (the graphics are actually ok and besides you should never judge a game by it's graphics, it's the gameplay that matters) then you will enjoy the gameplay and the community			"

												If you know what you're getting into then you're more likely to enjoy this. I had to give this game THREE chances before it hooked me, the first in 2007 when it came out, the second last year, and then about a week ago i tried again. There will be grind, both in quests and killing and just trekking. But if you can deal with that (as a mmo player, you should) then the games RvRvR kind of makes up for it, with the odd tweaks to combat to make it more interesting. Good character customization makes up for standard slow hotbar combat too. I play it for the Dwarves, and to kill Elves, it carries me through the faults and i enjoy it, just find your own reason, and let that reason be Dwarves.			"

The game is not bad though and if you are a fan of fantasy mmos with a classic feel you should give it a try. It is not very popular though so dont expect to do much group content. There is not anything ""bad"" about Champions of Regnum, it just feels really generic. You should try this game if you are 1. looking for a ""time-killer"" 2.

												Best free to play out there imo, because back when I was without all my games, I successfully played this game a good 78 hours. Let alone got to play with my husband which made it even funnier than alone. We laughed at several things in the game such as the skeletons and several other things. But anyway, I would definetly say 10/10 because this game is really worth the free to play of it. Make an account and play whenever you like. Got to level 30 something and finally had to quit because the mounts ran out and it wasn't as fun with the mounts but whenever you get the money even the slightest I would recommend playing this and using the money to get mounts ONLY. Anyway , One of the fewest, funniest, and ridiculous MMO out there for free.			"

												When I started playing this game it had graphics on level of Quake 2. Now, after many years, it has graphics of Quake 3.Leveling up opens more quests, but problem is that after about level 15, quests do not provide enough XP to level up, and then comes the grinding. This game is one big grinding simulator. And there is basically no other quest type than ""kill x dudes"", ""get x stuff by killing dudes"", ""kill one hard-to-kill dude"", ""go to object and click on it"" and ""deliver something from dude A to dude B"".Game's focus is on massive scale PvP called RvR (Realm vs Realm), but problem is that quests basically end at level 45 and you have 15 slowly progressing levels to reach level cap. Guess with what. Nothing else but massive grindfest. Or you could try to get XP by killing opposing players in RvR battle. But that usually ends in you getting send back to repawn point instead of you getting XP.			"

												The realms are fun to explore and a good battle is amazing.  Dozens of players on both teams going at it, there is nothing quite like it.  But mostly I spent time grinding and searching for things.  The battles took forever to gather enough people.  I would rather pay $70 for a game with instant action and have tons of fun, than spend my life grinding in a fake world to one day hopefully have fun.  I ended up spending well over $100USD.  If I had spent that much money on a Play Station game I would have access to every single game item and instant action, but in this game $50 only pays for an animal to ride on.  I left the game with with a $USD balance and valuable inventory.  I just wasn’t having enough fun for all the time and money.  Working extra hours for actual money would be more fun than grinding in a virtual world. .:steamfacepalm:It's kind of a shame because I do miss it, the community and the good times.

												This game has a horrible playayer managing system per realm vs realm, one realm can have 50 players to each other realms 1-5 players online. Which gives them the ability to run the game and get every upper hand possible all the time.Secondly this game is EXTREMELY under staffed, the Staff that rarely does come on has no more power then to kick,ban or mute playes on the server and any problems,bugs or errors you get with the game, your account, or anything you bought and payed for is either ignored, un-resolved, or when the ADMINS feel like doing something about it.I do NOT recommend this game to anyone, and strongly advise them and their friends not to waste their time or money with it.Personal Experience: I purchased a 54$ guard pack for this game and they made me wait 2 weeks to even be able to use it when it should be instant activation upon purchase and entering code.(This was not the case)Also you CANNOT be REFUNDED.

												So my friend and I decided to pick up this game after being told of its many ""special features."" The moment you load in, there are like 25 things you have to download. It is just back to back to back downloading for the first at least 10 minutes. Before character creation, there is a download. After character creation, another download. After hitting play? You guessed it. Another download.The final download takes like 10 years because the servers are made out of silly string. We also crashed 3 times during this period. During this time, you, like most people, should just quit the game and uninstall. The game is literally giving you an opportunity; a final chance to back out. But, my friend and I pressed on.The camera is uncontrollable. Moving in this game is like controlling FDR's polio-ridden legs and QWOP combined. The ""combat"" is just people either hitting♥♥♥♥♥♥with squares or just punching♥♥♥♥♥♥ That's all there is. My friend soon discovered another special feature.

												Gave it a try. Being free and all. Hurts to play such a choppy, poorly constructed game in 2016. Smooth gameplay MUST be acheived for a game to be acceptable with  such poor graphics in order to compensate.  Without ease  of controls and intuitive movements with combat and gameplay you have a flop like this. For all those who enjoy this game. Good on ya. Not for this guy. I'd rather fire up my comodor 64 and play some barbarion than suffer this garbage.			"

												Game got progressively worst over last 5 years. Facts to mention: - realm specific items are now not unique to realm anymore so called ""lazy balancing""- fort wars are dead, as it is not needed anymore to plan how to take 3 forts at once- fort wars are dead, as you actually get points if you dont' defend forts- constant nerfs to match range units with strenght to mele units. Why would you want warrior now if range mag or archer is as power ful and now can compete with warrior in close combat ?- deathmatch is dead- boss items are crap and some are not droppable anymore- lots of nice people left this game- easier grinding, why not giving all max level from the start then ?You may not agree with me, but I played this game a lot, and spend a lot on premium content. Had to leave as it was getting worst and worst. I wouild come back if this game would be reverted to the state it was 5 years ago, or at least war mechanis from that period.Not to mention if you want to change country NGD asks for copy of passport or national ID. Is this even legal ? "

												I don't know why I had fun for a while on it. I guess it's because it was right after it came out on steam and there were other newer players than just myself so it felt like I had others to explore with. It might have also had to do with the fact that I had quit another terrible MMO and it was a nice distraction.However after having played other MMOs since my experience on here, I can confidently say that this is not even worthy of being in a pre-alpha stage for a game. It might have had potential once upon a time, but NGD Studios is absolute trash and this game has been stagnant for years, with little to no support offered.Everything about this game is primitive. The graphics, the animations, the music, the combat, the lore, the mechanics, and especially the game engine. It also has very terrible UIs and is buggy as hell with no hope in sight of any much-needed reworks coming for some of the broken content. I'd say 400ish hours was a good enough amount of time to get the gist of everything enough to make a sufficient review.Just don't bother with this game. There are far better options out there and it's not worth investing your time into a game that sadly has nothing to offer.			"

Warning: this game is on alpha stage, but they dont say it. It has been in alpha stage for 10 years give or take.Just to play your character, you WILL have to spend money on only-premium horses, otherwise anything will take you 2 hours to complete. After you bought your horse, you will encounter the most boring grinding of all games, and no info to help you on the (also boring) NPC quest's. Yep... a waste of time.			"

												rather cliche and average MMORPG with plenty of grinding and simple combat. Only real interesting thing that sets it apart (not saying that this is an original idea) is the realm vs realm combat.Pros:Free to play, so at least you aren't wasting money if you don't like it.Works for linux and macCons:Extremely cliche. The story and setting is absolutely boring and terrible, so don't get the game for that.The gameplay is just a grindfest. You right click on an enemy and it exchanges blows with your character until it dies. Then you pick up the money it dropped so that you can buy weapons to kill enemies faster.I am sad to say that the gameplay is just typical, cliche, generic fantasy mmorpg - that means stats, leveling, equipment that increases stats, quests, and a whole crapload of grinding.I personally cannot enjoy a game where the main premise is to right click on an enemy, and then wander around until you can find an IDENTICAL enemy to right click on so that you an right click on stronger enemies.Terrible gameplay aside, the other reason this game sucks is simply that it is BORING.Gameplay is almost identical to other fantasy MMORPGs, and it offers absolutely nothing original except for the (cliche and uninteresting) world and setting. The gameplay offers nothing new, and it has terrible graphics.Conclusion:Maybe this game had some potential.But like most games of it's type, it feels like it is simply designed to extract money from you with it's in game currency. The graphics are terrible, the sotryline is terrible, the world and setting are increibly redundant, cliche and boring and feels like it was ripped off the face of hundreds of other fantasty MMORPGs.The gameplay is absolutely abysmal and is incredibly boring and repetitive.Perhaps this game's saving grace could have been it's 'free to play' status.It may be free to play, but it is also pay to win.Maybe you could enjoy this game if you hada few friends, and i have the utmost respect if you wish to play this game. It's free to play, so even if this review didn't convince you to immediately exit the store page, at least you didn't waste any money.This game is your typical moneygrab buggy grindfest. It looks terrible, and it feels terrible. Frankly, it's terrible and you would be better off playing pac-man, which at least has decent gameplay.This is my honest opinion about this game. I know this seems like a huge long hate-rant, and it probably is, but I just can't help but feel this game is a poorly-crafted attempt to squeeze a few cents out of gamers, because I honestly can't see anything worthwhile.

												The grind is real in this game....one of my first MMORPGS to play. back in 2010 I think, before it came on steam. It was beautiful. Even though still an impossible grind. I loved this game, because of the community. There still is a strong base, but the people I used to know have all gone.Life and its responsibilities have overcome them. Its sad yet beautiful, that a game can make me feel this way, but then again, its not only the game, but those who play it.  ProsGrindyits free?its got mounts and stuff I guessIts pay for utilityyou can pvp or tag along after lvl 30 ( grind needed)ConsITS REAlLLY GRINDYThe grind quests are kill 10 of these...kill 10 of that...yaadaaa yaddayadda...Pay to look cool and pay for utility...Walking sucks and mounts cost money.You can insta lvl 40 for cash... highest lvl was 60 last time I playedYou will get wreked by the pros or those playing since foreverYou will need a ton of patience and good social skills to make it far...

												This is less of a review and more of a reccomendation.  And it's to stay well away.  Firstly, the game is rather unpolished.  The user interface is rough and my character floats an inch or so off the ground.  Combat and quests are very much sameish.  Hub-based ! quests and combat that requires you to stay completely still (even changing the angle of the camera or your character's facing stops your current action).  Menus are sometimes confusing to navigate and the game seems as though it was translated from another language entirely (and poorly at that).  Attention to detail is abysmally low (I read that a dummy dodged my blow and I'll reckon that structures as well might do that.)The game has a stat system, but that only attempts to pidgeonhole the player into a certain race/faction in order to play a class they're interested in to its potential.  There are hints of a crafting system but I couldn't get far enough in before the game disconnected me and I just don't have the heart to launch it again.The endgame PVP might be interesting, but it seems like it wouldn't be too interesting in fixed-camera combat from 10 years ago.

												This game could be great if they put any effort into it. The way it works now if you pay to level, they do this by boring the hack out of you. The basic game is grinding and grinding and more grinding. You run out of quest in the low 20 level. After that you can do realm quest of ether running letters or more grinding.  There is no battle grounds to speak off, well there is but you will never get in one of them. I have had 4 toons up to leve 40 and even got one to level 45, but let's face it, grinding is not much of a game, and you get very, very, very bored after doing it for months. By the time you reach level 45 even the level boosters that they sell dont do you very much good. It takes and extra-ordinary amount of xp to reach the next level and you get a very small amount of xp per kill.  There is really nothing to do until you reach lvl cap (lvl 60) and then I'm not sure there is much to do after that. There are a few groups of people in each realm. You will see the same few people and they have been playing so long that they know the groups of people in the other realms by sight and name. Don't expect to be included in any of there planes because they will not invite you or even act like they see you.  If you don't speak spanish about half the chat you won't even understand. Don't look for groups because there's never enuff people to form one, and don't try to kill the champions or the mob leaders with a group of at lest 3 or 4.   They do have some form of armour, but I have never been able to figure out what goes best with what or even if there is sets or armour. Dont read the help book because it wont help.  This game is for people who are so bored that they won't to pull out there finger nails for something to do. It's way better than pulling out you finger nails. So if your at that point in your day. Play this game and save your finger nails.			"

If there are, there is no guidance on where or how to get to them. Wandering around and hoping lasted for an hour or so. You go from creatures you can kill to OMGosh I'm Gonna DIE!! Things seem to start agro'ing about this time too. Making it all the more fun. Not sure if I'll poke around down the road. It has decent potential considering it's FTP.

												just an awful MMO, english server is totally hacked out, so many players use the available speed hacks, and well over 80% of the total game population use resist hacks which means they are totally immune to any debuffs you throw at them, they can't be frozen, immobilized or stunned, so casting any spell to try that approach only mean that you wasted time, and you die, it all very simple and straight-forward, and you can never compete in pvp at pretty much any level, even the max 60, because most players have dupes of the top armors and weapons, the server has so many ""rare"" items floating around that the duping is obvious... the only people left playing this english server are a sad bunch of pseudo-heroes who simply couldn't survive in a populated MMO (there's clearly less than 50 people playing, although they each log up to 50 characters per day to make it look like more, fact is that most ""battles"" involve less than 12 total players, and they think that's a HUGE battle, since some have as few as 5 total players fighting).... players are total ego-pumped creeps, admins seem to not care at all because, if the admins cared, then they would pretty much have to ban 90% of the population, yes, it's THAT bad... *ALERT* don't waste an hour downloading this game cuz, in less than 5 minutes in-game, you will be frantically searching for the DELETE button, yes, it's THAT bad, worst game world i ever saw, in almost every respect, rating MINUS-10 out of 10			"

												If you don't feel like paying a fortune for a monthly free MMO or just love MMOs and want another one to bide your time, this is most certainly the MMO for you. The world looks decently beautiful, the quests don't get boring that quickly and the combat is almost water-tight. If you're a MMO veteran or an MMO newbie, you can easily fall into CoR without feeling intimidated or lost. There are minor problems here and there and the game lacks depth in some areas, but these are hardly noticable once you've started playing.			"

												Pretty sweet gameChampions of regnum is a fun MMORPG. Although the character creation is very limited, each class has its own unique set of stats. Champions of regnum has a very fun pvp system. When you create your character you can pick a side to choose. Each side has its own story and placed on diffrent sections of the map. Blue team can invade red teams castle and steal gems to bring back home. If you run out of gems your race becomes devastated. Your race is protected by a great wall thats defended by a giant dragon. If your race kills the dragon your race and invade enemy territory and kill low level players. Overall the game is very well balanced and has some sweet detail.Pro tip: You should really buy a pet in that game because walking is not fun.Overall champions of regnum gets a solid 7/10			"

												Short Review: Free,fun,good community,factions 9/10In-Depth Review: I downloaded this game about 2-3 months ago and kept putting it off,then one day I bulked up and tried the game,I was NOT disapointed! When I saw factions I just knew it was gonna be good,and when you play the game make sure to join Alsius. The combat is fluid and nice,the graphics are decent and will do, for a free-to-play MMORPG. You just can't go wrong with this game I very much like the faction war between Syrtis,Ignis and Alsius.

												I'm sorry. I wish I could recommend this game, but I really can't.I knew going in that this would be no ESO. I knew it would not be as good as WoW. I did not know, however, that it would be as unfinished as it is. Firstly, the camera/movement/combat systems are super unintuitive. The fustercluck of clicking and dragging combined with the fact that Q and E also control the choppy camera rotation make it impossible to find a good rhythm for combat. Secondly, and probably most importantly, no one is wearing any clothes. The women are all fully naked, while the men wear a glitched-out pair of invisible boxer briefs. I step into the introductory valley (called Introduction Valley, or something similar) and walk into a scene that could easily have been the result of mixing multiple nudity mods on Skyrim. Without the benefit of 2011 graphics.I like that the game takes place in a high fantasy setting (with no excessive anime influences, which, to be honest tend to spoil the genre for me). Beyond that, the only thing I like about the game is that I didn't have to spend any money on it to realize how poorly executed it was.			"

												I gave Champions of Regnum a second chance after about a year had passed from my first play, but this game was still as terrible as the first time. I'm not sure if it's specific to the Mac version, but I experienced a ton of bugs in a very short period of time. The graphics look like they are outdated by 15 years or so. My computer is not very old at all but without putting the settings on low I was having quite a few issues, which is surprising considering how bad the graphics look on the highest setting. The UI is not intuitive at all. The combat was lame. It took quite a while for me to even figure out how to move properly due to the camera's automatic rotation. I just didn't have fun. Like others have said, I was intrigued by the 3 competing factions and it sounded like a neat concept. I wanted to like this game but unfortunately I cannot recommend it to anyone in its current state, especially Mac users.			"

I'd like to recommend this game for it's out the box thinking.. I'd like to do all that.. but I can't. The game is 10 years behind it's time, both in inovation and in graphics.

												OK so as someone who's played the game for 3 years + and on haven considered on of the ""richest"" players as a knight with most of the boss drops etc. i have a little understanding on who should play this game. What happens now is u will start and level 1 and work your way up, on heaven we are friendly and willing to help, getting to 60 can take a very long time. U will need to buy a mount which does cost real money. There is almost no player without it, its near to impossible to Be active without one.Real Review. The main issue with the game is it is very dull, i have been addicted to it slightly so i stay, but def would no stay if something happened to my char and it got deleted. Its not feasible to get good without a little money here and there. The fact is the entire game is very drawn out, lifeless. And at times completely dead. My best advice would be to go out and play something like TERA, Everquest, even WOW for ♥♥♥♥ sake. Defiantly avoid this game unless u really wanna find a all out war game with huge battles at times. p.s. the people who say this game is perfect and amazing are the ones who have a good standing, like me. They don't remember what it is like starting new, and its alot harder then it was for them, since the level cap was only to 50, which is bloody easy, in a matter of days or hours if u were real good. Now its 60, and thats the intense party, from level 59-60 is 1.1million exp, getting one kill is 750/1000 exp, killings monsters i.e. mob is 250 / 160. So yh, unless u buy the 500%exp boost scroll, u gonna have a hard time.Overall, Avoid, enjoy life, and just move on.			"

												Very well thaught out game, Alittle time consuming to download but once you get into it, It can be quite addicting. Graphics could be better, And the texts in game should be shortened. I really don't like reading 5 pages for one quest...... And you should make things easyer to find and read on the map and overall in the game, But I thaught it was a good game overall and would love to see this game go somewhere in the future.... Possibly to console?     Rate  4.5/5~Thanks, Sincerly   Game tester and developer. Skylar			"

												WARNING:  I used to be a beta tester years ago, when you actually could do it for a job from home and played professioinally for quite a few years afterwards (this means I actually get paid in some way, shape or fashion)  I also have a team of friends and colleagues that sit around and test out all aspects of games (gaming careers).  So I feel my team and I can give a valid review, but this is also based off of our higher than normal skill through too many hours of pracice drills (versitility) and tons of gaming experience.  So this review will not reflect based off of your skill level or experiences, but limited to ours, but in this case my own.  IN SIMPLE TERMS.....REVIEW:  In a nutshell not a bad game, but lacked that excited-to-replay value for me compared to RIFT, WOW, Runes of Magic and many other MMORPGs currently and in the past. I give it a POOR overall rating and below tells why4/10   ☼☼☼☼   :-(PROS:  A bit grey = not any one stands out as spectacularColorful visualsFamiliar ControlsFamiliar InterfaceFamiliar Questing FormatFort BattlesCONS:  A bit Black and white = small problems but very frequent or just straight badSMALL THINGS:Skill synergy hesitation (from one to another timer/inerupts by delays) is awfulAbility visuals a bit drab even at highest settingsCharacter Customization could've been a bit betterLeveling could be a bit faster to stay competitive even though I got a max level in about 20 hours, but most I have talked to outside of my colleagues all said the same thing, excussing the occasional other pro gamer and/or a speed leveler.Standard money trap to make the best gear which is an outdated and/or already dying ideaNo professionsBIG THINGS:Movement a bit clunky = jump and while using skillsA.I. in this game is one of the worst I have ever experiencedDEVs lack the ability to stay competitive with all other successful MMORPGs by effective updates.  I really think they think the way things are now is going to eventually work, but it will never turn around.  MAKES THIS FEEL LIKE A DEAD END GAMEPvP in idea is nice, but with above stated clunkiness and poor skill synergy makes it taxing and one-sided to certain class types  unbalanced on a HUGE scale.  When I played alot I was in top ranks all the time, but limited by class to take it more seriously.  Being forced to play classes you don't want just to succeed is ne of the worst experiences ever and kills MMOs fr me and my circles when this happens.Getting to max level very quickly and then wishing you didn't because end-game content is over in a blink of an eye.Many, many, many, did I say many houors of waiting around before you can get that 12 houors of fun gameplay.CONCLUSION:So if sticking with F2P and for some reason you don't like the many other better made and greater reply valued games, both F2P and P2P; then his might be for you.  Especially if you like low pop servers (lack of opportunity) so you can do your thing (Soloing), don't mind waiting for hours and hours to play an hour or so, Hate PvP, not into lore (game story base and lore is really not too interesting and very plain) or don't care about the lack of endgame content.  Don't get me wrong I am sure many guilds struggle with some end game, but once you find a god guild end game ends shortly afterwards.Me and my circles might still play occasionaly (PvP Limited  because PvE was mastered a long time ago) if...SKILLS were not so bad going from one to another (speed)INCREASED/BETTER MOVEMENT while using skillsMore of a Auction House centered communityClasses were balanced or at least a bit more so for PvP, squashing the one-sidedness factor for most teams and allowing a more overall variety in playstyles--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Not going to respond back to any comments and am uninstalling, just take what I said as fair based off of over 27 years in gaming experiences of which 20 are professional or find out for yourself and write your own review.btw keyboard is a bit off (DROPPED IT) so sorry if missing some T, I, O or some other letters. Also a bit tired and wanted to rush this before sleep.Started streaming    @      www.twitch.tv/sirspoony      check it out every Fridays (RIFT, WOW, DIII, NW) and Saturdays (STO, Firefall, Star Conflict) for now, but more days streaming will come in time.  I stream other sites, but advertising twitch for now.  If I am not streaming check out @SirspoonyTV on twitter.  Right now I am trying to raise a couple hundred more bucks towards a new gaming PSU so I can finally install some better graphic cards and start playing RSI Star Citizen...hope to see you there!			"

												Champions of Regnum is one of THE WORST games I have ever played. In all my life i have never experienced a game as unplayable as this. They might have mad patches since, but i can safely say this is terrible. The first mission (I was the guys that wear black BTW) you had to kill some roaches that were coming out of a hole and i would swing my sword and it would just miss the enemy. It literally took me 10 mins to kill five of them. I played this for a very short time before realizing this is horrendous. On top of all that the game has a HUGE amount of bugs.			"

												Ok, I'm just going to start by saying this is a good game. Well maybe back then when I used to play it. I used to play before they added it to steam, and when Horus servers were up. My cousins and I all joined Alsius, and we powerleveled like crazy. I bought horses with ximermin before they were permanent -_-. I stopped playing Regnum Online a long time ago because I was just busy with my middle school life. I played Regnum for Hours at nights, and the game in general is good. Now why am I saying not to play this game? Well, The company really doesn't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about its players, and there's a lot of bugs in both there website and there email system. I downloaded Regnum Online from steam to play it again. I finished downloading and tryed to log in and it told me it was sending verfication to my email to confirm the computer or something. I logged into the email sociated with the account from my childhood and there was no verification email. I tell myself it's a bug but when I try to go to the request help page I can't log in no matter how hard I try. So I submit a request help somehow and I can't even look at it I have to check my email to see what they say because there's no way for me to log in. They tell me even though I have my login information, my email sociated with the account, that I know the password that I still need some verified proof because there email verification email is messed up. I'm so old in that game one of my characters name is literally ""Alsius Legend"". It's to bad I will never care enough at this point to try and get my account because they're making it to hard for no reason. I just had to say this, and still a amazing game, I enjoy the wars and the whole concept with the gems.			"

												Champions of Rektum is a phenominal game, even for the next gen. In this tactical realm based goat simulating masssivly multiprayer online role praying game (TRBGSMMORPG) you play a role of a novice adventurer whose destiny is to find his strength somewhere in the realm and then come out as a champion of the realm's arena and later challange other realms in a vicious battle to defend the name of your realm. The real challange of this game is inscribed into finding that strenght whitlist fighting an epidemic of albino bears, wild house cats, and other gene abominations scattared across your respective realm. This game features an abondance of various lore-provoking quests whith rich backgrounds and exellent gameplay, varing from clicking on a moving box to slay a nasty midget inside, to slapping an orc in the middle of nowhere, but reciecing 10k gold. Besides enrichig storylard and enraging quests, this game features great depth of complex mechanics such as balancing turn-rate speed, triple-clicking mount activations, hardcore cliff dying, water physics and complex spells like arcane missle and stinkcloud. With this amount of knowledge, mechanics and skills that player must learn, this is easily the most mentally-challaning MMO of 2014. The game is so harcore and casual hostile, that the first thing you will see in the menu is a red button labeled ""DIE"", which implies a casual scum player who can't even kill an albino bear is not welcomed here.Overall Champions of Rektum is a superb game for most hardcore players who are looking for a challange, insane PvP action, goat men, amazing quests, creative cuntamization of the characters and just general fun. Definetly game of the year. 9.7 fire damage/18 Breds.			"

												Great MMORPG. Good lore and good graphics. The game is sometimes a little buggy for linux but is over all fine. It is probably the best truely free MMORPG out there. Especially fir linux. 4 stars.			"

												WHERE DO I BEGIN WITH THIS GAME. THIS GAME WAS UNINSTALLED IMMEDIATLY. first of all the game gives you NO DIRECTION, i hate games that do that. and the graphics wanted to make me regurgitate blood. But the main problem of this game is the dang combat. OH the combat the camera acually pans UP when you fight something, and that annoys me, and also the throw the hardest enemies in the game at you in THE FIRST 3 MINUETS OF THE GAME. Now i might be overegsagerating but it really felt that way. All in all i would not recommend thid game if you want to play somthing like this go play DnD online			"

												I cant say that this game is ""Superb"" or anything, but its decent. Combat is buggy and cant attack easily, like you cant attack if your not facing the enemy. Graphics are not a great sight, and quests make no sense with no audio for them. I have to say i dont approve of this game for recommended, so you can try path of exile. Mutch better!			"

												I play around 2 hours of this game just to spend half of it walking around the map and jumping on objects. I walked all the way to the PvP area at Lvl 3 and went to another factions castle only to get Murdered by 5 people. 1 good thing about this game is that i made friends in the first 3 minutes of playing by saying ""This game sucks im only playing it cuz my friend told me how bad it is"" Sad thing is they agreed and laughed. Went on for awhile playing the game to notice that the best part of the game was the chat. Texture pop ins were amazing felt like i was far sighted and the attack animations made me feel as if my character hated his very existence and wanted to die. In short i'd rather jump into a Over-Sized Blender then play this again. -13/10 Would not play again. #StillBetterThanWoW "

												In the 43 minutes I spent playing this game, it took 20 minutes to adjust my video settings just so I could play due to video problems.  I then tried to figure out how to attack and set up spells, but it became way too frustrating!  It's not set up to fight like Diablo, it's more like the old Neverwinter Nights game where you click on the monter to attack and then wait...  In this game, you have to click twice, but it didn't attack, well I couldn't figure it out anyway.  I died once from falling off of a cliff, but not 5 feet from where I fell, there were invisible barriers preventing me from falling off the same cliff.  You can try this game, but I don't recommend it in it's current state.  I experienced video bugs, multiple crashes and major frustation!!!  Plus I didn't see any real players in town, just NPC walking around and there were only about 4 of them!  I was hoping to find a cool free-2-play WoW clone, but not this game!  Dev's, please make it fun to play!  People want fast action, not click and wait battles...  Maybe I'll try playing again tomorrow...			"

												Downloaded and installed, made an accountProceeded to then make a character and it took over 1/2 an hour to download game files or something, similar to what guild wars 1 did when loading maps,i left it and finally got into game, changed the video settings to 1080p and bumped up all the aa and shadows etc, then it told me it had to restart. No worries.Restarted the game and selected my character and the up came the loading screen again, and also the downloading thing. speed would vary between 20 and 300 kb/s i left it for a few min thinking 30 seconds ago i was in game and able to run around and whatnot. but it seemed to want to download another huge ammount of data for some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t reason.So i uninstalled, its taken me about 3 hrs since downloading a small 1gig game to be able to change the vid settings. so ♥♥♥♥ it.

												<[ LINUX REVIEW ]>The game is a crash waiting to happen in Linux (Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 32bit)There seem to be database errors parsing stuff in quest windows, that looks like [err][parsing error bla bla][1342some_random_number]. Instead of the name of an NPC, also some sentences in quest go like ""please just go to [empty space]""When attempting to buy Ximirini or what ever they are called (I just wanted to see the pricing of the stuff) I get a ""Connecting to Steam"" for 10 minutes and nothing ever seem to happen.I was also confused what to do at the start of the game and only found my inventory after playing another time (a month later) and then noticed I had a staff that I needed to equip to be able to atack(do spells). I was first running around with 0 gold wondering where to get a weapon/staff but apperently I already had one :')Hard to recommend the game at this point in time.			"

												its ok could be better graphics... also the part that really bothers me is it could use voice when interacting with the computer characters instead of having to read every thing wich i wont do so i just click ok or accept and move on in the game. another  dislike is the fact it does not seam to have a way to get a mount without the cash puchase of the games currancy and that is only a problem because of how big the world is and makes it take forever to get anyware... as far as the battles and options for characters i do like it. lots of veriety almost to much some might say but the fact that i can do my own thing on my own time for the most part is kinda nice as well. all in all for this type of game i will give it a 6.5/10 the voice and mount thing bother me to much and after 12hrs of play time i am still undecided on weather i should purchase the games currancy??

												Oh, let me guess. The medieval kingdom is in upheaval because of a dragon, right? And there are humans, elves, and dwarves duking it out for their realm. And of course there are wizards. You know, if you want the World of Warcraft dollar so badly, you could at least take a few pointers from Blizzard and put in some ♥♥♥♥ing pandas.			"

												What a terrible peice of garbage this game is..... ok... where to start, there is just so much wrong with this game.Lets start with music... might as well.  Its midi files gone mad!  nothing says inspiring music like a manic drumbeat that incessiantly pounds in the background during a battle untill you want to smash your head into a wall to make it stop.How about Combat?  why would you want fancy ""auto-targeting"" or ""Targeting"" at all?  no this is all about ""skill"" as in the skill to manually click every single target one at a time then click your skills on the ""hotbar"" to kill them... FUN!!Perhaps the Beautiful 1995 graphics will get your blood stirring?  no?  running through walls and floor textures? 4 options for character customization?  non-existant PvE interest?  extremly weak PvP combat?This game tries so hard to take the best part of Dark Age of Camelot and bring it up to date and fails so spectacularly that its almost stunning, you almost HAVE to see how bad it is to belive it.   I dont know how people could possibly spend the 4-6 months to get to level 60  (thats right you read it correctly.... 4 - 6 MONTHS!)this game is a test for a masochist... and even they are bowing out.1 out of 10... id give it a 0... but the game actually loaded up with a title screen so... there you go.

												I have very little time in this game for one reason; the controls.The dated graphics I can live with, since I've got a long list of classic games I still love. The controls, however are just... *shudders*. Movement is odd, you need to click on EVERYTHING and combat is a bit of a mess.Also, I find it odd that you have to be activly playing a character in order to access the MENU. Yes, I tried, at the character screen and had to actually be in a character to change any options.I'm not gonna comment on the Pay-2-Win stuff here because I honestly don't know if this game is or not. The controls have caused me to abandon what could have been a fun game. Even with a massive amount of time spent tweaking them, I doubt I could get them to a managable state.			"

												Another free 2 play game with a pay 2 win kind of twist, but its not that bad if you have time to find in-game items given by the monsters you kill. The players are friendly if you compare them with players from other MMO games and amazing... there are some staff members online to keep an eye on things.Even if the pay 2 win mode makes it really easy to get around, i recommend this game for the fact that is multi platform and because one will eventually find help from players and staff, thus making friends.

												Its a good game containing plenty of content but after a while the game just gets repetitive with combat and the quests are boring and glitchy but all errors aside its an decent game if i were a critic this game would be a 6/10			"

												Although the video's, trailer's and characters look AMAZING and the animation look's pretty cool. The gameplay, controls and tutorial are some-what aweful... This game is the hard's game to control that I have EVER come across and has really aweful camera movements. It just doesn't cut the cake for me sadly. BUT I still see were this game could be heading and that in the end it could be an AMAZING game but just sadly not yet I guess...			"

												Cheap copy of morrowind and WoW. I'm honestly not a fan of WoW(World of warcraft), but it certainly is a cheap copy of these 2 games. So just play the real games themselves. Don't waste your space on this piece of crap.			"

												An awesome MMO RPG game that is full of adventures. Besides the Warzone that has all the needed fun of Co-op fighting other villages to gain their own source of powers. Not even going to mention the dragons  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Sorry, I was new to the game and realized how terrible it was after playing 4 years.			"
