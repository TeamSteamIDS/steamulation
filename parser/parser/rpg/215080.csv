												After having played this game for a fair share of hours (~300 by now) I feel like I am able to give an acceptable review.Updated: With the major update for Wakfu on the 9th September 2014 there was quite something added and I will try my best to include it as well.What's Wakfu?Wakfu is a turn based Strategy-MMO that, to me, feels like a love-child between Ragnarok Online and Fire Emblem. And I love it.The player is able to impact the actual economy of the world, meaning that animals, plants and trees have to be taken care of and replanted to keep the natural balance.If that is not the case a species will go endangered or even extinct. Each nation's political system is governed by players that were voted into their ranks by others. They set the law, breaking those will result in you becoming an outlaw. Players joining the guards of their nation can hunt down outlaws and put them in jail to atone for their sins. Justice!The graphics may seem not up to date on first glance, however when playing the game one will notice that there is actually a high level of detail in everything.To sum up what I like and dislike:Pros:+ Free2Play: There is a Cash shop, however it only sells cosmetic items or Sidekicks that can also be acquired with ingame gold (Kama) instead. You can get your hands on anything without paying a cent as there are many players that sell cash shop items or currency.+ 15 classes with three elemental specialisations to choose from.+ 17 professions and you can master them all in one character at the same time if you want to.+ Strategic gameplay as your composition and line-up can determine success or fail.+ Up to two mercenaries (sidekicks) that can help you in solo and even teamplay to substitute missing players/friends+ Economical System depending on players (Fun fact, the money that circulates through servers is player crafted too)+ Nations (4) and a political system governed by players (Nations can wage war against each other)Updated - There is now a fifth Bandit Nation players can join.+ Many secret places or recipes(!) one can discover in the world that will reward you handsomely.+ can be played casually+ It's damn cuteCons:- The starting area (lvl 1-10): Astrub is not a fun place. You can get out of it luckily in less than an half hour and join a nation. However it wants you to do a few quests that are not fun to do in my opinion and probably put-off a fair share of people before they even really ever started the game.Updated - The whole starting Area was revamped into something much better!- Steam and Wakfu: If you wish to play the game via steam, you do not necessarily need an Ankama account, HOWEVER I highly recommend one to you. As you will not be able to play Wakfu whenever steam has connections issues to your server.Updated - You are now able to login with your steam account on the Ankama website that allows you to have all conveniences Ankama Account users have. The server connection problems however may remain.- Region bound servers- Java: the game runs on java and everyone who played minecraft knows that java's RAM allocation is not great by default for games and you will need to allocate more by customising yours under your system settings. Else after hours of gameplay your wakfu client may slowly start to lag more and more until you relog.- Positioning and Terrain: in rare occasions certain big tiles of the map like pillars or similar make it hard to actually click ""behind"" them to position your character there.- Support: Even though I have had an okay experience with the support myself so far, everyone that I have met that had/has severe problems ingame has huge troubles with the support, to the point it feels about non-existent.- Grindy: Not a problem to me but I know there's a fair share of people that dislike grinding.I personally love it and have to admit I have not yet had a game like this and thus it is nice to enjoy something different.So I would give it an 8/10p.s. It has a great anime-like cartoon with two seasons that you should watch!			"

												As a particular lover of turn based games and role playing games in general, I decided to give a try to this MMO. Once he landed on Steam, I got into the beta and started to enjoy the universe of the World of the Twelve.Despite having few hours compared to many other players, I can say this game is actually enjoyable and well made. However, there are some factors that could lead some people to avoid this title for various reasons. Let's analize every detail of the game. If you want to skip the wall of text, just go to the end, where there's a short version.GRAPHICSThe graphic is 2,5D Cartoonish - Style, similar to animes. I like it, but somebody may not appreciate it. Colourful environments, characters and enemies (aka mobs).However, sometimes you'll encouter a bunch of graphical bugs like invisible enemies, sidekicks not appearing, your avatar being nude (yes, you heard it right!) or colors that make your eyes to cry blood (phosphorescent enemies).At last, talking about the active parts of the game, while the enemies are well made and be distinghuished between their gender, the characters (not including npcs) tend to be more feminine. If you give a try to the game, you'll notice that even the males look like females.SOUNDThere isn't so much to say about the sound. Each sector has its own, enjoyable track, including islands. The only bug you may encounter is an infinite loop after the dungeon of Zeppelantern.GAMEPLAYHere we come, in the longest part of the review. Let's start with the choice of your avatar. You can choose between 15 different races, each one with its peculiarities and abilities. You can even decide if you want to have a male or a female, with the exception of the foggernaut (it's a robot!).Regarding the gamestyle, it's a turn - based game during the fights against the mobs and the other players, while it's in real time during your journeys, explorations, harvests and crafts. Yes, because in this game you don't only get experience by killing tons of monsters or by completing dungeons you may access with specific keys and after you reach certain levels, but you can also produce your own items by collecting the resources in the environment and by crafting them in specific workshops.You can also decide to group with some other people (or recruit up to 2 sidekicks) to face evil forces or stronger enemies that you couldn't defeat if you were alone.Now the negative aspects of the gameplay. The tutorial itself is kinda crappy, made not properly because it teaches you only some parts of the game. It's useful just to know how's the interface, how to fight and how to collect and plant the enemies in the field in order to generate a wave of monsters to fight. Ah yeah, also to get the starting experience when you'll start with the real game itself.The second most negative aspect is the interface. It isn't intuitive at the beginning, you can't move nor rotate the camera while you're in real time (but you can zoom in and out), while in the turn-based combats you can move it in a way the game doesn't explain. In fact, it doesn't tell you that holding the right button of the mouse and moving the cursor on the borders of your screen will allow you to see the entire battlefield.And, at last, the quest system of the main missions is kinda...lame. You don't get involved in the main story and you do just some random quests in order to get experience and your first and only free sidekick. But, considering how's the game, you don't play it surely for the main quests.GAME SYSTEMThe game is totally f2p. You're granted access to every part of the game (with the exception of the last 2 islands introduced not long ago), you can choose a nation at level 18 and do every kind of job. The nation system will allow you to player versus player fights and each nation has its own peculiarities. You're granted a free sidekick you can keep forever with every single character you make (until 5 per account) plus a free additional sidekick with a weekly rotation system.The real money allows you to buy the sidekicks and keep them forever, cosmetics, costumes and booster packs that let you drop more loot and get more experience (in a small percentage however) plus the access to the last 2 optional islands. However, these zones are reserved for characters around level 140+.SHORT VERSIONPROS- 15 races to choose from, with possibility of gender changing, that can reach until level 200.- Different zones and islands to explore, with a huge variety of enemies- 4 Nations to choose from, each one with its dominant element and peculiarities.- PVP, Guilds and PVE system- Huge quantity of dungeons, with specific dungeons you may find only in a certain nation- Rewarding system well made- Great variety of jobs, in harvesting and crafting, letting you to get your own items and to collect kamas (the game currency) fastly- Colourful graphics- Good sound system- Mobs having ehm...sex?CONS- Shabby tutorial that teaches few things compared to the real potential.- Not-so intuitive interface- Main quests system not involving and realized superficially- Might be boring if you focus only on getting experience- Requires a lot of time and patience, 2 things that most people don't own...unfortunately.I recommend to try this game at least once to every kind of afficionado of rpgs/mmorpgs. However, if you are included in one of the following categories I'm enlisting, just don't play this game:a) You don't like turn based gamesb) The story and the drama in a game is everything for youc) The graphics is the most important thing for youd) Anime haterse) Average Call of Duty player			"

												I have put a lot of time into this game. I admit, it does speak to an extremely small crowd due to the nature of the genre of game + the amount of grind you must devote. I still have a long way to go before max level (Current level 144, max is 170) So you see it does take a LONGGGG time. If you are fans of disgaea/fire emblem/other turn-based strategy game it MAY or MAY NOT be for you. You must not enter the game with the wrong mindset, and you must find others to play with. The content of the game becomes very difficult and without other players to team up with you are going to have a bad time. The community driven aspect of this game is amazing and this game has one of the best communities I've been a part of. THE BAD:If you are starting this game you are going to become overwhelmed in which skills to level, and which specialties to level in which order. I admit that does suck, but there are plenty of guides out there for each class. Another thing you should do is actually read the skills instead of just blindly following a guide. I still learn new strategies/perks on my character everyday!I hope this gives a good representation of the game; My hours speak for me and I love it!			"

												A great game, ruined by non-existent support and a capricious developer team.  Everything about the game is completely fantastic and thoughtful and fills a niche that no other multiplayer game really captures.  I couldn't say enough nice things about it.All of that comes apart though when you encounter any problems.  Did a glitch eat your stuff?  Tough.  Sending a request to the support group will result in nothing.  Did your class get nerfed right out from under you with no explanation?  Too bad, buy a class change scroll from the cash store for $40, it's your own fault for having played the class.If the game's developers had any kind of meaningful dialogue with the players instead of acting like the invisible hand of an angry god, if the community staff actually fostered some kind of two-way communication instead of just passing on the sparse edicts from higher-ups, and if the support team had the people and resources to fix problems for players, Wakfu would be amazing.Instead I warn people against investing their time or money in this game, and it's a terrible shame because it has brilliant potential.

												The game is decent, but Ankama is probably the worst game company i've ever dealt with. Their support is horrible, and they blantantly rob you. If you are thinking of purchasing anything, don't! Their ''security'' system will ban you within 24 hours, and Ankama will say ""Your account was banned for an unauthorized payment. Please provide an arm, a leg, and sacificed 50 virgins and we will consider processing your request.""That's if you can even get a reply out of them. Good luck.If you don't believe me, check the forums. This has been happening to people for 2+ years, and ankama still doesn't g.a.f.Good game, ran by idiots.			"

												Wakfu is a brilliant game. Wakfu has its own taste, its own style. All characters are different, all builds are reliable, all groups are potent. It have some problems today, like economics breaches and balance issues, but all of them will be fixed sooner or later. Graphics, musics and so are just perfect. Wakfu is a game with soul. Yes, this soul is full of grind, but even coop grind is fun in Wakfu. This game has very good potential.			"

												Don't let the words, free to play MMO fool you. This game is pretty unique.I've been playing this game for about 4 years (closed beta) and have sunk in hundreds, if not thousands of hours.This game is like Final Fantasy Tactics, to a lesser extent Fire Emblem. If you're a fan of Tactics games or SRPGs read no further, Play the game!I guess a big deciding factor on whether this game is worth your time is the ""pay to play"" question.The sidekicks can be bought but are on a free rotation in game, a sidekick largely just makes the game more fun to play alone and you'll be using them to fill unfilled spaces in groups. They may save you if you get attacked by another player and you're alone but otherwise their purpose is largely convenience.XP boosts are pretty self explanatory, however premium members get a large boost on alt accounts.There used to be an armour/ weapon set but it seems to be gone now.Items are otherwise cosmetic.So, the game?Amazing.This is about as high standard as I could possibly ask for a 2D game.Combat is played out on a grid, players move their characters on the grid and use abilities to carry out attacks, your weapon is essentially 1 customizable ability. If you've played Final Fantasy Tactics. you're at home.The game gives you control over a single character, you will most likely be playing with other people. Seriously, go get yourself into a guild or get some friends together, this game is best played with others. It's all about teamwork, and few games do it so well. You'll quickly learn strategies for the different people you play with, and that moment when someone is just about dead but you pull them through by a thread, using some crazy tactic that only just worked. It's beautful.The game is still fun alone, but much less so. You'll want to use your alone time grinding professions, though as far as grinding goes Wakfu certainly isn't offensive. You've always got something to do.Levelling can be slow though, this is probably less of a problem now and should continue that way as they add new content. It can get a bit samey, but find a good bunch of people and you'll be right.I think this is Wakfu's biggest strength, it's great at creating a friendly atmosphere and having fun with others. You take turns in fights so you'll be spending the rest of the time co-ordinating the team in chat or just having a laugh. Wakfu is the only MMO i've found that really gets the social aspect right.The ecology can be a real pain. People don't care about killing off species so be sure to carry animal 'seed' with you, but doubly so if you want to get into logging or herbs. Despite the annoyance the fact the game takes ecology into account at all is fantastic, you can hunt animals to extiction and level forests.You get respecs every so often but be careful with the stats you level, they're permenant. Chances are this won't be a hassle, you'll be given a respec at lvl 30 which is about the time you'll have worked out what you're doing.The classes are really interesting, 15 classes but each has 3 elements. The elements act as sub-classes and they have drastically different roles. Water = support/ healer, Earth = Tank/ slow DPS, Fire = DPS/ Nuke, Air = Crowd control, fast DPS; but this varies a lot between classes. It's best to specilize in one element, sometimes two. You'll have about 9 spells you'll likely be working with, the classes do a good job of being simple yet deceptively complex.Pretty soon you'll be in a guild, it's really the only way to play. The PvP is pretty fun too. There are disputed territories players fight over and people can just attack others on the street. These situations are where you'll be really pushing for every tactical advantage, it's often less about min/maxing like in other MMO's and more just getting together and responding to a situation with whatever you've got.There's a political system but you'd have to have played the game a hell of a lot to get into that. There's weather systems and a very in depth crafting/ proffesions system, from handymen who make dungeon access keys and inventory upgrades to chefs who give buffs and weapon smiths.So cons,The game in steam launches a launcher which downloads updates. Would have been nice to remove this. Steam ID's work in game though so no signing up to third party garbage.There's a lack of quests, the game is meant to be player driven but that can mean less to do for people playing alone.you'll likely level your character faster than you'll level your proffesions which can mean it takes a while before crafting has a benefit.Level up points are permanant and if you're not careful you'll be caused some grief on your first character.No female foggernaut.Balance has been a bit shaky in the past, things are fairly good but some classes are definately more useful than others.Not quite a con but Ankama have been dragged kicking and screaming to the free to play model. They seem to have things fair currently but let's hope they don't screw it up again.I absolutely recomend this game			"

												I would love to give Wakfu an amazing review...I really would. And I would have a couple of months ago, when I was glued to the screen leveling up my Osamoda. Unfortnately, after over 1500 hours, I've come to the conclusion that Wakfu is a huge time-suck with no true, fulfilling end-game. I have created a huge assortment of characters, trying to figure out the spells and play-styles that suit me. And while I love the handful (five) I have ended up with (Osa, Sac, Masq, Sadida, Elio), they just aren't enough to hold me to the game. Starting a new character means reliving questlines over and again...some of which have not even been finished by the developers...but which sit in your quest log and stare at you...day-in and day-out (the developers are apparently working on these...but who knows how long the questlines have been waiting to be finished up. Instead, they release new holiday material and conveniently ignore gameplay that needs to be addressed). and the monotony of the quests becomes unbearable. Your char is sent across different maps to collect items and talk to various NPC's, and it's a never-ending pace of back-and-forth-back-and-forth. Nothing changes, even though your characters do. Still, quests are all a must-do if you want your char to have special items or open up new areas that are inaccessible otherwise. So, if you take on another character...and then another...expect that you'll be bored to tears speaking to Pappy Pal and chasing after books across Astrub to obtain your dragoturkey.Speaking of monotony...grinding is almost mandatory if you want to get anywhere. Professions can be ignored for only so long. Leveling each profession up takes a *lot* of time and patience. However, if you want to make kamas, you have to chop wood, pick herbs, trap animals, mine rocks, etc...as selling these items, or crafting with them, is the only way to really make kamas at the market. And the market is difficult to navigate, as searching for a particular item brings up only the cheapest for sale, instead of a list to choose from. This is frustrating for the simple fact that equipment is element based...and you're forced to spend kamas on equipment that you have to change to suit your particular elements...which also requires kamas. Dungeon runs gift you special coins with which to purchase new equipment, but the gear is often so expensive that it's not worth the time it takes to complete said dungeon the twenty or thirty times it takes to acquire said gear. And once acquired, that gear is linked to your character...so forget selling it at the market in hopes of upgrading to something else when the time arrives. Instead, you are forced into a grind of dun-runs. Quite often, the monotony becomes mind-numbing. Who honestly wants to pick 250 herbs or trap 250 animals just to level up a solitary profession one level---especially when each profession has 100 levels.Each new area opened quickly loses its appeal after battling its monsters and dungeons. I hit level 120 with two of my characters...and I am *still* awaiting something new to come along at level 132. Who knows when that will be. Probably never. My time with this game is quickly drawing to a close.PVP is, oftentimes, hugely unbalanced. Characters fifty levels over you can attack you (even if you have PVP deactivated), and there is absolutely no chance at making it out alive. And forget fairness. If you manage to combat a character around your level, and win the duel, you can be sure the player will log in with a much higher level char just to hunt you down and attack you---or call their higher level friends to do it for them. And you can be sure that some of the higher levels are strapped to the teeth with the best equipment/gear...courtesy of the cliques formed within guilds and groups. Also, fair warning: during PVP, you will be insulted, and often. If your enemy doesn't like your character or playstyle, expect to be called a plethora of rude names. And forget if you need help from Ankama. You pretty much have to sacrifice your unborn children to accomplish reporting a technical issue. They want detailed reports and multiple screenshots for each and every problem (no matter how small the problem is), and even after complying...very little is done to fix the problem(s).I loved this game at first. The graphics and music and spells and char classes are brilliant. But more thought needs to be put into the game and the gameplay. Because, as is, the hours spent in front of Wakfu are just not worth it when all is said and done.  "

												(3000+ hrs on their own game launcher)If you decide to play any of this company's (Ankama) games (Dofus, Dofus Touch, Wakfu, Krosmaga, Krosmaster, etc.), do NOT invest yourself in it.While the games are unique in their genre and quite fun, Ankama will not hesitate to f*** you over big time. I was simply addicted to their main MMO, Dofus, and I could just not take it anymore. They're the worst company I have ever seen.Support is non existent, for once. If you issue is more complicated than a password reset, support will NOT help you. You will often have to reopen your closed tickets several times for the support to actually read your message. Most of their answers are some copy pasted crap that does not fit your issue at all.Second, and it's not so bad in itself compared to the other stuff, their updates don't make any sense at all. Tomorrow they might decide they change the whole game without consulting the community and they'll just roll with it. One ''funny'' moment was when they lost half of their player base deciding to switch from version 1.29 to 2.0 on their main PC game, Dofus. There was no options to stay on the old game, they just switched everything over and RIP. Let's not talk about how they willingly ruined 1v1 PVP, or how they keep making the same mistakes over and over without ever improving (rollbacks, awful class changes, awful mechanic changes, etc.)Which leads me to my third point, which made me delete their games. They sometimes throw events out where you get 2 times the xp, drop, etc etc. Pretty cool, uh? Everyone makes sure they barely sleep at all to play as much as possible and farm like hell. But what they did recently was just too much. A player found a way to generate their in-game cash shop items for free (please note that the items in themselves were not generating any value outside cosmetics and that they were linked for 3 months to the account that bought them). This was on Tuesday, and was noticed by the staff on friday. The issue was leaked in the whole community, and Ankama was well aware of the issue. No communication on their end, however (like usual) and the double week end went on. Everyone played the game like mad monkeys, my friends and myself included. We didn't sleep. We did some incredible things, pushed several characters to the ultimate level and generated for $1500 worth of in-game currency (legitely).Well, when the week-end ended, they rollbacked everything up to friday morning. Not only did they wiped, without warning, all the player's efforts, they did not wipe everything that was generated because of the bug. No apologies, and they did not answer to alternative ways players bringed up (which were pleeeentiful and legitimate ways to fix the bug). They do that at least 2 times a year since they exist. If you ask for a compensation for a very specific item that dropped when you have 1% of getting it, and worth $400... The support will say too bad for you pal.They're just lazy, and don't care about you. They only care about what you're going to inject in their cash shop. There's so many games out there that are great and are worth your time. I don't recommend you give it or any money to Ankama. You can google their reviews yourself, starting with ''rollback'', and have a good laugh.Oh, that and Wakfu's dying with no plans on reviving it.RIP.			"

												Ok so when I saw this was free to play my first thought was 'Oh great... here we go again, another pay to win or donate your life savings into this game to be decent', but its turning out not to be the case at all.   This game is grindy and takes time, but if you want to just push buttons and feel good about yourself immediately, then this may not be your game and that's OK.  Sometimes however, effort required to do something makes it have more meaning, and if this is your thing you may just like this :DThe fact that I can do more in this Free to Play MMO -without restrictions- than I can when I buy a full version of a Total War Game which then gives me the 'chance' to buy a bunch of DLC, is a commentary in itself (on both games, despite different genre / game type and I am a HUGE Total War fan).*Items- lots of sense of humor with pets, armor, and misc items.  Sort of like the humor of Borderlands, but not quite.  (There's an NPC in a sewer named Donallangelo who essentially is a pun of Ninja Turtles, and pets like a Ghast have descriptions which read 'I ain't afraid of no ghast!' and so on)  Also, importantly, no restrictions on items that I can tell so far if you are free to play.*Great community - helpful and teamwork is essential.  Let's face it, many MMOs don't care to pretend about requiring teamwork - it's just login, get achievements, and feel good about pressing the level button.  This game is not that.  It's teamwork, has depth, and requires thought.  If that's not your thing - great!  Don't play.  Leave it for people who do because this makes for a great community that works together.*Graphics - pretty charming and actually really awesome artwork.*Class system - did I say there were what, 700 million classes?  Well maybe not THAT many, but at least 16. Yes 16, which if you can count as high as WoW classes, well then this is a LOT compared to many MMOs.  Beyond that, yea it's complicated ""Oh noes! Don't try! Too hard!"", wrong!  A game with some complexity is a great thing, its not going to hand you things, but its not going to stomp your face in either by giving you experience debt you need to clear by using item shop items (Runes of Magic).  Butt weight, there's more! (and yes those awful wrong use of word errors got your attention!):  You pick a class, then you have 5 tabs of stuff to put points into, so not only are there a ton of classes to pick from, but there's a very custom way you can build your char.  If you're not sure, look it up or ask someone.  Find a guild -*Guilds - did I say find a guild?  Find a guild!  Guilds matter in this game, and apparently there's even complicated politics with certain Nations owning certain regions etc.*Crafting - there's several paths to take, and you can do all professions.*It's free, and they give you a House, 5 character slots, you can wear all the gear, they let you use the AH, you can sell items remotely too apparently by dropping a bag and selling.*Gathering - there is this very cool anti-bot system, where if you are gathering it comes up like a 'fight' with this npc, but actually you and it just stand apart from one another and you have to select the same images around you as it has.  If you do this correctly, you get bonus resources and not just a few either.  Pretty sweet and easy!*Biomes - I don't even know what this is and I'm excited!  (:S  review pending here)  Also plenty of environments it seems and cool stuff in each.*Nations- player driven, can elect govenors of Nations, collect taxes, set foreign policy, control regions, etc.  Like Eve but without the crying about how broken capital ships are.*Pvp is a thing, more to come (tm).I'd say overall, having not spent any money on it, having joined a guild where folks are really helpful and kind, I would say check this game out.  It's free, all it costs you is bandwidth for a bit and you may find you like it. If not, you tried it and can move on to other games.Update:  still awesome :D			"

												Wakfu is...an experience. I am still going through my experience but from what I've played of it so far I can give a fair and detailed review of it. I will cover it in four sections; tutorial, gameplay, combat and community. I would also like to mention that I used to pay for and play this game when it was still in open beta about four to five years ago.Tutorial:The tutorial for Wakfu reminds me very much of the character actors at Didney Worl; they never break character. Your UI can give you all the information you need to break the fourth wall but when it comes time to learn from an NPC they will talk to you, the player, as if you are your character. The NPCs outside of the tutorial follow suit to this.Ankama has made one class exclusively for the tutorial which, in my mind seems rather pointless. Back in beta the reason I bothered going through the tutorial areas was so I could get a proper feel for my actual class before I committed to playing it. That said, you can opt to skip the tutorial. I wouldn't advise that if you are a brand spanking new player.Gameplay:Wakfu is what most people call a grindfest, but there is reason behind it I like to think. Monsters will drop items that are guaranteed to end up being used for something, no matter the level. Gear can either be combined into sets to be sold, worn or even ground into powder which can be refined into runes to improve the gear you use.Killing mobs and running quests aren't the only thing you can do in this game, you may also pick up professions. All of them in fact, conveniently located in the starter area known as Astrub. With this in mind a lot of players tend to lean towards one or the other based on their mood at the time. I personally rarely fight and would rather just go farm wheat fields.Combat:The combat in Wakfu is unique, something I've never seen in an MMORPG. Ever played Final Fantasy Tactics? This is it. You (and your teammates if you brought any) as well as monsters have a set initiative score, which is a stat you can increase. Those with higher initiative go first and you follow along a grid-based system to fight your enemies. Your character has access to a plethera of passive abilities (able to swap them out between battles on the fly as you unlock them), class-specific utility skills and three skill trees, each one has an element (meaning that you will have access to three of the four elements, I advise you to look through them when you make your character even if you haven't unlocked them).The player versus player content this game provides comes in some different ways, but ultimately ends up the exact same. There are four nations that you may pick from to be your home upon reaching level 15, with the option to join an outlaw nation at level 30... I wouldn't recommend this though and some people get confused. Let me break this down real quick, if you play this game and hit level 30 you'll recieve a quest called ""Riktus for a Day."" Do not complete this quest, you will automatically join the outlaw nation that only has one outpost in the ocean and are free game for anyone wherever you go. Aside from this, at level 30 you can opt to become a guard of your nation, sworn to protect the land from Riktus, eco-terrorists (will cover this in another section) and PKers.Another feature to note for combat are sidekicks. They are NPCs that can act as party members you control. They aren't as powerful or versatile as players but they get the job done when you need it. Part of the beginner quest is going through a dungeon, rewarding you at the end with an Astrub Knight. This is the only sidekick you get for free, with the addition of the free trial sidekick. Out of Ankama's list of sidekicks, one is chosen every so often as a free trial. Kind of a try before you buy sort of thing, this gives you the option of not only playing as yourself and the Astrub Knight, but a third teammate once every...I wanna say three weeks but I honestly never noticed. These guys don't offer what other players can provide and you can easily solo your way the entire game with a little patience, the sidekicks only offer you some help along the way.Overall the PvP in this game is pretty fun so long as you don't get stacked against someone much higher level than you.Community:As far as I've seen, pretty dead. I wish I could say this, but in the town hubs (Astrub and nation outposts) there are people everywhere. The further out you go you see less players though, most of them are hidden in small haven bags (which act as a portable home and player shop) either afk selling their wares or just plain afk. That said, if you're looking at only the game's point of view then you are sadly missing out, the wiki for this game is regularly updated and the forums always has people poking their heads in to say hello. That said, if you plan to play this game for a while then get into a guild ASAP, I suggest you head over to the forums to find one to your liking.Before I finish, I want to add that this game does have a cash shop. Is it pay to win? Not really, most of the things you can buy are either cosmetic or do really minor things. You can buy weapons but they don't compare to the gear you can find and make. You may also buy extra sidekicks which can help out, but aside from your Astrub Knight you have access to a different free trial sidekick every once in a while.Overall:Steam is asking me if I recommend this game and do I? I'm a little torn, but yes I do. This is a very fun game with combat mechanics that require you to actually think when things don't go as planned. The community is there and very friendly but only if you take the time to actually look for them. When you're feeling bored of grinding mobs, go grind resources! Its tedious but addicting after a while.TL;DRGame is fun, try it out. RTFR.			"

												I played this game for a couple years before it ported to steam.  The entire time I played, all I ever noticed was players leaving.   Every guild I was in, went defunct.  People stopped playing.  If you had followed the conversations on ankama's own forum, you would have seen alot of unhappy players complaining about things that never got changed or fixed for ther better over the years.  The games population bled out.  The it came to steam, and some new players showed up.  But not enough to replace the lost content.  The game was still empty.Many people who wanted to buy the games currency were unable.  Many peoples credit cards were being rejected for no apparent reason.   Popular content was being changed or nerfed or removed, and new, unpopular content was being added or built upon depite many complaints.   No explanations, no understanding of the ankama logic was to be had.Grouping for dungeons became obsolete with the return of the token system and people could just use their own store bought NPC groupies when they changed the loot requirments to allow NPC group members to count in the prospecting totals.  No longer needed a full group of actual players to get the best loot rolls.  They did that so everyone could compete with the multi boxers.Some people think it was a good thing, but it was actually bad.  They wouldnt just ban multiboxing....they should have.  Instead they embraced it.  Real players didnt like it, and quit the game.If you started playing the game now you would quickly discover how unpopulated the game is.   There once was a time when merhcant bags dotted the landscape and hordes of people hanging out at the temples.   The time has past and gone forever.Servers have been combined several times because their populations were so low.  Its only a matter of time before the game is finally put in the grave.  Its a tragedy.   This once great game is a mere shadow of its past glory.   The game is free to play of course...   waste your time on it if you choose.			"

												I am in now way a veteran or anything in Wakfu, but I did play enough during a reasonable ""quit & return"" period to have a say in the game's state.Wakfu is old, dying, and worse than all, run by what seems to be unqualified to do so individuals.Half the game's quests are missing, they simply stop, there isn't a progression, by what I understand, the game has been ""reworked"" a good bunch of times. It is buggy, grindy(excessively, you literally have to spend days clicking mobs outside of battle just to level necessary professions). The moderator team is... terrible, characters go missing, items get lost, people get banned for following mod's false instructions. The population is dwindling, most of them are vets who refuse to let go. The game is so barren you either need to find yourself 4+ friends to level together, or pay the subscription to unlock a system which allows you to control 6 characters yourself(such mmorpg like, woah). And I wont even go further into how unbalanced classes are.The game is a incomplete, unbalanced, bugged, money grabbing corpse of what it used to be.			"

												I love Wakfu! kinda reminds me of Final Fantasy Tactics, so if you liked it, try this.BUT remember this is a MMORPG, be aware of what comes from this kind of games: grind (for example the drop rate of some cool item requires killing the monster a lot, or doing a dungeon a lot blablabla), mean people(like, really mean people, they just don't give a fug about whatever and play to ruin others fun) and ""pay-to-win"" content (for example a dragoturkey faster than the common one you get).BUT don't let that stop you, compensate that lonely and boring grind by doing it with friends! as well as dungeons that don't feel repetitive; again, play with friends! lovely friends make this game beautiful, excellent teamwork you achieve with them has no comparison; as for the pay-to-win content, you are not forced by any means to pay for it and it is not necessary.So I truly recommend you this awesome strategy game.

												One of the most innovative and fun mmos I have played/seen EVER. I can't name a single other rpg where I even slighly cared about the economics or in-game politics, both of which were done so even the casual player easily understands the situation your country is in and even motivates you to get involved for rewards. The combat system, while generic, is fun enough with cool animations, decent enemy AI, and the large variety of skills you had at your disposal. However, the game is a buggy mess, the devs never listen, and somehow most updates make the game worse. The update that finally turned me away was sometime last year when the enire skill tree and progression system was gutted. Previously you earned skills in a certain tree by using skills in that tree, giving you freedom to build your character however you want and experiment. This update took that away and instead you stiffly and slowly go through all of the skills in all of your trees as you gain player level instead of the level of your skills. This basically doubled the level you need to be to get the skill loadout you want. Overall the game can be described as a mountain of wasted potential that continues to rot. But at least its free.

												I have been playing this game on and off since before it even came to steam, so my steam record is NOWHERE near what it should be if we count it all up. So, it is safe to say that I am a veteran player to this little tactical rpg.ProsCute, fun graphicsPlayer controlled marketPlayer controlled environmentDecent MusicLarge amount of contentDecent craftingIndividual housesConsANKAMA support has a reputation for being badNA servers are given no love everPlayer base only peaks on weekendsLeveling solo is a SEVERELY painful experienceConstant revamps of classes and HUDCash shopArguably, the market being player controlled and the environment being player controlled can be considered as both cons and pros, because there are just simply more people that will hack down trees/flowers/crops/mobs and not care to replant as opposed to those that attempt to regulate the environment. The market was fudged over by a duplication bug some time ago and well, you can add that to a list of bugs the developers haven't fixed since it happened.Most of the content updates over the last few YEARS has always been LATE GAME. So if you aren't at least level 140, don't bother looking it over, because you still have literal MONTHS of grind ahead of you if you just started. In fact, ANKAMA has made it to where the leveling system can cause even veterans of the game to simply quit because of how unfair it is. The game still has bugs in it from after they went from sub only to free to play, but you know, that content update is more important.With the recent changes to Astrub, it should be a lot friendlier to those just starting out, but it is more like it is preparing you for the other nations and the festival of non-stop grinding. Also, I have seen several times where the areas are completely erased of their resources and had my chat spammed by their ""helpful"" guide npcs screaming for someone to replant.I have watched this game revamp and revamp and revamp again, changing areas, leveling, classes, crafting, hell, they even changed out armor elemental stats to some form of praying to RNG Jesus that you get what you need and don't have to either grind out the resources to craft something to play the RNG on it again, or go look at the over priced market and hope someone is nice enough to list it reasonably.I could go into depth and detail of how FUN and EXCITING this game used to be, before it went free to play. Back when developers LISTENED and HELPED us actually get better at their game. When political wars MEANT something, and crafting was pretty damn USEFUL. When our classes weren't so CONFUSING and NERFED to the point of only three or four being actually viable to unkillable. PVP is so unbalanced that I would rather beat my head into a fence post than actually do it, as are most of the late game boss battles. They DESTROYED what used to be a new and exciting tactical rpg, and instead replaced it with whatever scraps they could patchwork together from their constant taking away and altering.This rant doesn't even begin to cover how broken you can become through the pay to win system. No, you can't buy armor sets or weapons from the shop, but you can get sidekicks or a hero system to bring in your other character's, so you wont have to bother with other people for leveling. You can buy special mounts and pets that will boost your stats to apoint where it might not matter what class you are playing. And if you don't like your class? Well, they have a solution for that to. Don't want to wait for that free reset after hitting a certain level, or grinding out the reset quest? Yep, they even have a fix for that. Want to level faster and get better loot while doing it? Also in the cash shop. Feel free to break your bank on the game, but oh don't forget, you can only do it through steam because the site's exchange GIVES OUT BETTER BUT IT HAS BEEN BROKEN FOR YEARS.TL;DRThis game could have been great. Instead it is a broken system split 90% grind, 5% accepting Ankama's bull*hit, 3% sitting in front of Pappy Pal's with the other veterans, 1.9% either fixing or breaking the ecosystem, 0.1% hoping it might one day get better because you haven't yet realized it never will.If you want to try it, go for it.I just can't recommend it in this state when I have played what could have been.

												Pros:-17 classes that feel 100% unique-Meaningful choices for leveling up-Fantastic lore that leaves much to investigate-Amazing combat system-Anime styleCons:-Devs don't speak English-Game has been stagnant for years-Things are constantly erased/replaced almost randomly-Continually dying playerbase-Highest populated servers (french) are locked from other countries-Can be buggyI've only clocked 131 hours on Steam, but I played for years on the normal client, and I've been on/off alpha/beta testing this game since 2006. I'll go into detail as to why I think this game is good and why I think the devs killed it years ago and are just milking what's left.Pro:The game is amazing. Period. If you like Fire Emblem or Tactics Ogre, this is the game for you. The characters are a bit cartoonish and anime-esque, but that just adds to the fun. The character designs are relatively unique and you feel a serious sense of accomplishment when you finally get the awesome-looking gear you want. You can choose out of 17 classes and, believe me, each one feels so dramatically different than the next that you'll be begging for the ability to just play them all at once.When you level up, you notice it. You'll constantly debate leveling up one stat or another to benefit you more. What's more, you have 15 elemental spells to choose from. You can be a single element, duo element, or tri elemental as you pick and choose your favorite spell tree(s). The game is less about grinding out levels to finally unlock a spell and more about slowly learning how to play the game, then unlocking all of your spells and choosing from there.The combat is spectacular. Unlike most turn-based strategy games, you have to constantly consider your position to the enemy's, even once you're engaged in melee. The myriad of movement and area damage can make your whole team wipe in two turns if you're not careful. Because it's a MMO, as well, you can simply out-level the enemies and go back to wreck their faces. The choice is yours. This isn't a ""plan to whittle them down with ranged fire then melee them"" like most other turn-based games, either. If you want to get into a boss' face, get into their face. They might have a wreck-all spell that turns you to mush, but most tank classes have something they can do to prevent it for a turn or two.The lore is spectacular. It leaves a lot to find and compile, but it's there (or was when I was last active). Each bit and piece you may find tells a small bit about the history of events going on. From there, imagination takes hold and you can create your perspective of the world. It's an anime-styled game. The women are busty and the hips are extremely wide. The graphics are a little cartoony, but the subtle vulgarity and brutality make up for it. It is really one of those games that you can let your kids play while still enjoying it yourself.Cons:The devs... Don't get me started on Ankama. They are, by far, the worst company I have ever dealt with. Their first priority is to appease the French playerbase, period. They do not care what the English-speaking players have to say. Your opinion will be moot if you do not speak French. I've played in several of the game's alphas/betas, and they ignored the English speakers like myself through and through. Things that were just added to the game last year I had been talking about since 2008, which is just sad and annoying to watch.The game was running off of promise of content to the level cap. The ideal level cap being 200, just like in the previous game, Dofus. The problem? The level cap has been hit. The content now will satisfy people to that level cap, and nothing more. The game is slowly churning out meaningless updates that give little/no substantial changes that were promised years ago. It's more or less stagnant, even though they are still adding bits of content.There were more systems in place when the game was released. There were even more before that. Things were added and removed because the developers didn't want to un-bug them. Governors, for instance, were elected and managed all things in the nation from the tax rates to the laws, given options in the dozens on what is legal/illegal, as well as challenges in each area, which were small tasks you could compete against other players to get unique gear. The government positions, now, however, are almost aesthetic. They can make some things illegal to do, but it's almost insulting and redundent on how they can manage it. The player base is constantly dying then picking up again once something new comes out. Honestly, the game would be very nice if more people would play it. But, sadly, it goes through ups and downs, with the downs being extremely, extremely down. Finding someone to do something with that's not end-game or very early on is difficult and hording friends so you can play with them is common-place.This goes back to the devs again. They locked the two French servers to anyone not in France. It didn't used to be, but there were a lot of issues with arabian players spamming the chat. It's understandable, but the population on either of those servers is almost always higher than every other server combined.There are bugs in the game. Some of them are game-breaking. Most of them are annoying at best. If you run a decent system and don't try to push the limits on what you can do in the game, you will run this game almost entirely bug-free. These bugs, however, have been present for years and will likely continue forevermore.All in all, I can't recommend this game to anyone. It might be worth a try if you like Fire Emblem or Tactics Ogre, but the developers killed it years ago. I want to like this game, I really do, but I can't. It's a grind fest once you hit level 100, for anything from gear to experience. The redundency is constant and unforgiving after a certain point. The most fun I've had is playing this game at the lower levels with people, but after a certain point it just becomes tedious and annoying. They will try to milk money from you. I will tell you now don't do it. It's not worth it. If this still appeals to you, then go ahead. Don't say I didn't warn you though.			"

												Hi there! I've been playing since closed beta and I promise that this game hasn't always been this terrible.The game overall is so very unique, I loved it. The character classes, the environment, the stupid politic shenaniganry. The fun stuff back when this game was fun. I don't think there are or will be any games similar to it, unless someone actually wants to put forth the effort.I have to say that steam release brought in droves of players, but the lack of Ankama caring enough was something that killed off the player base. They're so focused money, end game content, nerfing every class ten times over, and their other games,  that they don't really realize what's happening here (unless they just don't care?). I used to love this game, but now it's just super depressing. The once full streets and markets of the nations are now completely devoid of life. Nothing is geared towards new players or keeping them, everything is for high levels and end game content. The creativity has seemingly vanished over the years and I have watched this game go from an amazingly unique and thriving game with a great community to... whatever it is now. I have noticed with my return that most of the players above a certain level tend to treat low level players as though they are the scum of the Earth instead of welcoming them or answering questions. I don't know if this is just on Nox or if other servers have the same issue. The customer service from Ankama is absolutely terrible. It takes them ages to answer tickets, if they even get to them at all (they just recently closed a ticket that I've had open since 2013 that no longer even applies to the game or class I have, they didn't even answer the ticket to begin with). I do understand that they added heroes, but they also charge an arm and a leg for ogrines or any means necessary to actually buy booster packs. This is basically pay to win, the exp difference if pretty bad when playing with friends. The community is... fairly toxic now. A lot of people will randomly gank you, so having the heroes system is almost a necessity. I'm mostly upset because of how fast the game died and how little Ankama actually did to prevent that. No advertisements like Dofus had, nothing. I know some of you guys still love the game, but it's just... depressing.I still play every once in a while to check up on old friends that refuse to abandon the game, but I really wouldn't recommend it unless you have the time and patience. I know this whole review has been all over the place, but I will always have mixed feelings about this game until Ankama starts caring again.			"

												6/10I won't go into all the details or I'll be here all day.Wakfu is a beautiful turn-based strategy mmorpg with some sandbox elements. With 15 classes that can be built in many ways, you're bound to find one with a play style that you enjoy. Team up with up to 5 others to run dungeons and Ultimate Bosses! No friends? Ankama have that covered too! With a couple of sidekicks by your side nothing will stop you!There are 10 craft professions (not including Kama minting) and 6 gathering skills all of which, with some effort, can be leveled to maximum.  The enviroment and politic system are maintained by the players. Everything that happens within these will affect other players in some way. For example, Governers of each nation are players themselves and are voted in by you, the player. Planting too many mobs or plants in an area will disrupt the enviroment, as will killing too many of them. Distrupt the enviroment too much and you'll become an Outlaw! You'll be fair game for any passing Guard or regular Joe to aggro you...As the game is still in development. There are A LOT of things that are going to be added or changed fairly soon™. Guild verses guild, a revamp of its guard vs outlaw system, a couple of class revamps along with a lot of other brand new content. The game is extremely grindy at times but that's what you expect of an mmo, and there IS still a kind of subscription system in play, which has been recently renamed to ""Booster Packs"". Subscribers get access to the newest content, a shared chest, +10% drop rates, +30% kama drops (the currency) and +30% exp along with some other minor things. As to why I only gave it a 6/10. That is solely down to Customer Support themselves. The game, has had and still does have major bugs and issues which may make you reconsider playing. Things such as complete inventory/haven bag wipes and/or characters dissapearing combined with Customer Support ignoring tickets can be very disheartening. Saying that, these are rare cases and the charm of the game will likely outweigh this. The game is very playable as f2p and I highly recommend playing this game. Oh Snap xXx2 years Wakfuing			"

												Been playing for about 2 years.It's not bad, but three things bother me immensely:- Community is very cliquey, very hard to just play with others without them trying to recruit you or straight up use you as a loot wh**e. Which means, they bring you along, but you give them item drops in return to come along. This is probably the worst thing about the Nox (North American) community.- Ankama in general ignores the North American region in terms of feedback and communication. Which is always hard as foreign companies based in foreign countries have a harder time bonding with the community. The moderators and staff very rarely visit the NA forum. In fact, other than Sabi, we have little to no interaction with them at all.- Very grindy gameplay; this has been improved a lot very recently, but it is still unbelievably painful to get anywhere. This ties into the first point a lot as well. Progression screeches to a crawl after level 100 and without a dedicated group finder, you're basically solo (unless you have friends that also play) 90% of the time. People even go so far as to multibox 3-6 accounts just to not be alone. Which I suppose is an entirely different level of alone.All in all; it's not a bad game, it has its moments, but dear god after 2 years, they are only now starting to fix a few glaring issues that have been prevalent since day 1.My score as a standalone title: 6.5/10.Compared to most other MMOs: 7.5/10.Warning: They will try to milk you for as much money as they can get away with.My reply to their support after being denied for another thing I needed help with. My last request was years ago and they still didn't help me, so it's not like I constantly harrass them for assistance. You win again Ankama, hope that 20 dollars was worth it.			"

												As someone who has spent many hours with both MMO's and Tactical RPG's, this was a pleasant find. I spent many years playing WoW, Star Wars:TOR, and DCU, but I had come to find myself tired of the formula that MMO's had fallen into. I had basically given up on the genre, as there is very little variation beyond setting. When I saw Wakfu on Steam for the first time, I overlooked it. The artwork was not my favorite, and the name of the game itself didn't draw me in at all. It wasn't until a few days later that I was looking through the games again that I decided to look closer.What I saw reminded me of when I'd spend hours at a time playing one of my favorite games of all time, Final Fantasy Tactics. Most Tactical RPG's do that to me, as their style is so distinct in comparison to other genres. The grid on the floor is a dead give away to any one remotely familiar with the genre. Armed with some nostalgic goggles, I dove deeper in to the game Wakfu.Wakfu is a mix of Tactical RPG combat, with MMORPG sprinkles to top things off while you're not in battle. You'll find your usual culprits; Proffessions split into gathering and crafting, Taxi locations for fast travel, an Auction House in the form of a ""market"", and Mounts and Costumes to show off how cool you are, just to name a few of the things you'll recognize from the MMO genre. Most of the activities within the game are easily recognized standards that even people who have only played something like Minecraft should be able to pick up quickly. It also tries to do it's own things, like a completely player run government, and an eco system than can give bonuses if its in a good shape.The battle system is also pretty standard as far as Tactical RPG's go. Veterans will be able to pick up the battle system quickly, as soon as they understand the some times confusing tool tips for their spells. Combat takes place on a field created when you start the fight with monsters in the world. Each participant is put in order based off their ""Initiative"" stat. The batle then goes by in turns. Each combatant is restricted by how many tiles on the grid they can move, how far their spells can hit, and how much those spells cost. Of course this sounds simple, but like any great Tactical RPG, there is a lot of depth in this simplistic system, than can only be found out the longer you play. The classes range from simple to complex. RPG veterans will be able to pick up classes like Cra, Osamodas, and Sram, and easily identify them as your typical Archer, Summoner, Assassin. Then they will look at classes like Feca and Foggernaut, and scratch their head a bit. What you'll find seems to be missing is the quests. After storming through the opening area-Astrub-you'll be left to your own devices. Sure there are quests you can do, but they can be hard to find, since there is no mini map, and no indication of who gives you these quests. This can make leveling very unfocused until you learn how to recognize where these quests will be.Wakfu has a very light hearted atmosphere. Jokes are common in dialogue and most of them worth a chuckle, especially once you start to understand the games lore. Enemies have idle animations and will use in game emotes, that allow them to be their own characters rather than just another random creature for you to mow down. The artistic design fits well, its very animated and colorful, adding more life to the world they've created. For those really enjoying the Wakfu setting, theres even an Anime now, allowing you to see the world in a more cinematic presentation.Unfortunately, the Music and Sound is lacking here. The sounds can get downright repetitive and annoying. You'll know what I'm talking about when you experience being stuck loading up your character select screen and you hear those cogs for 10 minutes straight, or someone is spamming emotes near you. The music on the other hand, is just all together forgetable. I couldn't tell you what one song on this game sounds like, because none of them are memorable at all.The other strike against this game, is how much is locked behind a paywall. The game itself is free, but there is a lot that you have to pay for, that I don't think you should. For one, the mounts. You can get a mount in game for free, but its terrible. If you want a good one, you gotta pay. The other thing, is many costumes and emotes are up for purchase. Costumes I might understand, Vanity items are often sold in free games, but why emotes? Most games let you have all emotes from the start, but this one forces you to unlock them. Or in some cases, buying them is the only way to get them. Its not all bad, some of the things offered in the shop are very good, and I understand why you must pay for things like Nation Changes, or Class changes, even if they are over priced in my opinion.While I recognize this game wont be for everyone, it is for me. The blend of an MMO and Tactical RPG is right up my alley, but I'd say you probably have to enjoy Tactical RPG's more than MMORPG's. I could easily see fans of Ogre Tactics, Disgea and Final Fantasy Tactics enjoying this, but if you find yourself more of a WoW, Rift, or Old Republic fan, you might find this is an overly simplified version. If you're relatively new to either genre, this is a great place to start.			"

												Lots of great things in this game, but sadly I can not recommend it to others. This is from the perspective of a F2P player, I have not spent a penny on this game.Pros-17 unique classesGreat combat system (tactical but not overwhelming)Crafting and gathering professions feel rewardingEcosystem changes based on what you plant and what you cut down or killGuilds are great (have buyable bonuses, haven worlds which are like a base for the guild players)Art style is different from all other MMOs that I've seenMany special mechanics for different mobs and dungeonsBeginning of game is rather funCons-Due to cheaters market prices are ridiculously inflatedGrinding is very tedius. To get a guaranteed relic you have to run a 1-2 hour dungeon 200 times if you are F2P, 100 if you have purchased a booster pack.With the ""Heros Update"" people can now play as 3 characters at once. This means less people getting together for a dungeon group (dungeon groups are 6 people). In my opinion this is what killed the game. Before you would gather at  temple and shout out ""Looking for group _____ dungeon"", or ""Looking for 2 more ______ dungeon"". People dont want others running dungeons with them because it is much easier to just duo it with your friend who also has 3 characters. Oh, and you need a booster pack to use more then one character at a timeVery few new people are joining, 95% of people are levels 175-200. You want to run lower level dungeons, good luck finding a group.PVP is very unbalanced and you can be attacked even when you turn your ""wings"" down. (if you have wings up, this means you want to fight. Wings down means you dont, but some greifers will attack you anyway)You will not see 90% of the low level areas because you are trying to rush to max level, where everyone else isMany people are leaving the game. Guilds are being abandoned, and even some of the most popular ones are made up of 3-4 people with alternate accounts (many have 6 different accounts to play as a full team)Extra: Back when the game was released on steam there was a huge flood of new players. The only reason I was able to stick around this game for so long is because of this. I found some buddies, we made a guild and played together. Early levels were great, but after level 120ish things became very grindy. My buddies left, but I kept playing. Now, I have also quit playing. I stopped at lvl 172, and the current level cap was 175 (has now been raised to 200). I saw end game content, and it was just do this 2 hour dungeon 100-200 times, maybe less if you got a lucky drop (.01%)TL;DR: Has some great features I wish other MMOs would use, but due to immense repetetive grinding, a dying player base, and nothing to due once you reach end game, I can't recommend this game.

Overall Review/TL;DR (7.5)Overall I give this game (as of 8/5/2014) a 7.5/10. I'm primarily more in to the FPS and MOBA genres, but the visuals of this game were enough for me to give it a try. To start, the art-style is beautiful, the soundtrack is pleasant and gives the game a nice ambiance, and the animations are amazing! The gameplay (from what I've played so far, which is the tutorial) feels a bit slow, and I feel like the tutorial was unnecessarily long (although I believe you can skip it to begin playing the game), and the controls took a bit for me to get used to, but other than that I feel like this is definitely one of the better MMO's you can find on Steam (not to mention it's free!). I'd say download it, try it, and see if you enjoy it.Full ReviewThis is the first MMO I've played in a long time, and it's probably one of the first turn-based strategy games I've been able to play for more than an hour. My opinion is more focused from the average FPS/MOBA player's point of views, please keep that in consideration while reading my review.Visuals (9)The only reason I decided to try this game when I got a hold of a closed beta key was the visuals of the game, and once I entered the game they really, really impacted my overall thoughts on the game. The game is beautiful, and the art style is perfect. Not to mention the game's animations are amazing, they truly and firmly ""say what needs to be said""... if that makes sense. Not to mention character customization is great and makes you really feel unique. The only reason I didn't rate the game's visuals 10/10 was because majority of the playable characters all seem fairly feminine and cuddly, while my goal when I was creating my character was to be masculine and fairly intimidating. In the character creation, I didn't realize there was an option to switch from male to female and actually thought several of the male character choices were supposed to be female! Regardless, the game is GORGEOUS and fresh, there's no doubt about that.Controls (6)When I first tried the game, the controls weren't really what I was used to. Being a primarily FPS/MOBA gamer, it definitely felt weird left clicking to where I needed to be and right-clicking on things to interact with them, and one thing that really bothered me at first was the fact that there wasn't edge-scrolling and that the camera wasn't centered on my character the entire time (although I have suggested on the forums to add edge-scrolling and/or the camera focusing on the charcter), and a little bit in I felt a bit tired of clicking everywhere I went, so I feel like the controls weren't the greatest but still worked enough for me not to give up completely.Audio (8)The game's soundtrack is great, it has this... warmth to it I guess, and it really makes the experience pleasant for me. The sounds are good too, and I feel go almost perfectly with the visuals! A few sounds are a tad bit annoying to hear, like these little rabbits (known as ""Woodlets"" I believe) that did this sort of... giggle, and it slightly bothered me after hearing it (or a certain variation of it) every time I attacked one of them. Other than that the audio is great and well-fitting for the game's style.Gameplay (7)The game plays fairly smoothly, from what I've played (the tutorial) it seems like the game is mainly just accepting tasks and engaging in them (like most MMO's), but the tasks aren't always the same thing over and over, so it doesn't really get stale. The game is a bit slow-paced though, which I'm not very used to. The combat is good, and the spells are unique and fun to use and learn. The only reason the gameplay got a 7/10 was because the tasks seem slightly boring and overall not very exciting (to me). Regardless though, I feel like I'll definitely be coming back to this game to play several more hours.Try or nahhhh?Definitely try, it's a quick download and is a great experience, I'd highly recommend this game to any gamer (besides my brother, the only games he plays are those of the Call of Duty franchise... that poor, sad little man.)Thank you for your time, consideration, and for reading my first review! Feel free to comment anything you have to say about it and/or questions you have for me about the game!Sincerely,Your friendly neighborhood (not to mention 15 year-old) Sweatshirt.			"

haha wow look at these nerds around me giving this game bad reviews over playerkilling and bad customer support and whatever like every other top MMO review on steamHowabout a review that looks at the game itself? I've poured enough hours into Wakfu to make it feel worth my salt, so stay awhile and listen.Final Fantasy Tactics/Disgaea/2.5D-Turnbased-Game meets French Anime: The MMORPG.If you're not sold by that phrase, then this game probably isn't for you.If you are sold, then prepare for a good co-op experience.That being said, this game mostly shines with its' co-op play. Unfortunately, there seems to be a big void between starting players and end-game players.If you're starting out in this game, do your best to make links with other people. Make friends, bring friends along, join a guild, anything like that. It'll make the journey from new to end-game all the more pleasant, enjoyable, and certainly easier.I'll put a + next to pros and a - next to cons.ahem+Wakfu's player side of combat consists of over 15 classes that can straighten down into four roles: Damage, Tank, Support, and Field Control. Albeit, some are a mixture of these.Wakfu's classes are diverse, and each have a level of complexity to them to suit most, if not all players. Want to learn a class quickly so you can get to smashing things up, whilst being as powerful as any other damage class? Iop's for you. Want a class that's difficult to master and has tons of things to learn about and with synergies to discover? Xelor might be your pick. I had to cycle through nearly all of the classes and test them out before I decided to settle with Rogue. or you could just be a fat stinky lazy Cra and shoot arrows from the far back all day i mean geez+The game also has a virtually completely playerbased economy, with little to no ""pricing metas"".That means you can sell whatever you want at whatever price, and if someone thinks that's pretty legit, or even a steal, they'll buy it. At-least, I haven't seen too much of a meta other than higher level stuff = more money, and pets/costumes/emotes/all that = a high price.+There's 15+ Professions to choose from which can help this economy out.There's lots of demand for people who are high-enough level in professions, and some people will pay kilograms(tonnes?) worth of cash to just acquire the stuff they can make. From the Baker, who bakes bread(duh) to heal health and give small maxhealth boosts, to the Handyman who can make dungeon keys, crafting workshops, and more. Speaking of...+Haven Bags / Haven Worlds and Guilds, your own little slice(s) of the worldHaven Bags are basically transportable 'homes'. You can decorate them, expand them out with Haven Gems(acquired through multiple means that don't cost realworld money), craft using purchasable workstations(at a hefty price, those things don't come cheap), and even grow crops inside of your bag.Yeah, that's right. You can carry a farm with you. Crazy stuff.Haven Worlds, however, are Haven Bags but on a much bigger scale, designed with big guilds in mind. You can do everything a Haven Bag can do there, and even more. Set your spawn point there, spawn mobs(usually penned up to stop them rampaging everywhere and breeding wildly), and probably lots of other stuff that I don't know about because I haven't done haven worlds too much and I can't be bothered to look at a wiki.+Woah, this game isn't Pay 2 Win?Not exactly. More like ""Pay to make everything grindy a little easier"", or ""Pay to look cool"". From EXP bonuses to emotes/costumes to restat scrolls to class switches. (The last two have 30 day cooldowns, I believe. Don't worry, Ankama has standards.)Plus, costumes/emotes from the store are tradable, which means people can sell them on the market. No need to fork out realworld cash when you can earn it with blood, sweat, tears, and mostly time. Definitely a lot of time.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Which brings me to my first con:-The grind is real.Literally just that. Both your level /and/ your professions are going to be a total grindfest. I feel like lots of people are deterred by this, and it makes some essential professions(like Trappers, who spawn in mobs because most ecosystems don't spawn mobs themselves)an endangered species or something. It does, however, pay off. Perhaps you can even make some money from it.Wakfu does try to ease combat grinding with 'Challenges', though. Things like 'Do not get hit from the back', or 'Kill two enemies in one turn', which awards a bonus EXP/Loot percentage/chance/whatever. Only slightly eases it, though. It'll feel like a chore to some. I believe this puts a lot of people off from continuing to play the game, too. Especially if you're soloing.-Solo play can feel boring.Wakfu's a 2.5D turnbased strategy RPG. These kinds of games are usually pretty boring on their own, and more allies/characters/players makes the game more engaging and fun, /especially/ when there's diversity, which Wakfu shines at with its 15+ classes. It leads to another problem, though, which I discussed at the very beginning.-There's a void of players between early and end-game.Naturally, joining a Guild fixes this, though. Lots of guilds like recruiting at Astrub, the starting hub of the game.(Past Incarnum. That's the tutorial level.) Don't be shy! Ask a guildie to invite you. It'll be worth your while. (Certainly was for me. Big shoutout to 'The Secret Society' people, especially if they're reading this 'u')And one final thing.???This game certainly isn't for everyone, especially if you rush people into it.If you want friends to tag along, do your best to be nice and slow about it. Let them grasp the game by themselves. I find Wakfu to be a very 'learn at your own pace' kinda game. You can not know the inner works of your class, but you can still play it and win battles. It isn't like Dota(oh boy im gonna get flamed for this) where you have to learn an entire character to play them successfuly and win, otherwise you get flattened out.---SUMMARY AND WHAT I THINK OF THE GAME---Even with  its' flaws and its' grind and its' poorish solo play, I still enjoy Wakfu and rate it one of the best MMORPGs I've played. Compared to every other standing MMORPG on the market, I'd say this is an amazing little gem in the rough that needs more attention. The server populations are always low, and never full. I'd love it if we could get Wakfu a thriving community again.Do share this review, or even the game with your friends! Who knows, they might've been looking for a game like this. Thanks for reading.

												Wakfu is an ok game, full of bugs and a horrible community.If you dont mind being harrased, player killed, lose ur progress thanks to bugs, grind for hours doing the same exactly boring tasks to achieve nothing at all, being ignored by the developers/support/moderators/community managers, feeling like ankama is laughing at you at every moment, etc.... then play the game, you will regret it. Also dont be fooled, the game isnt free, you have to get a subscription if you want to achieve something... and by the way, the game is almost always empty. Good luck. I wasted 4 years of my life playing this piece of crap, dont waste yoursEdit.Just uninstalled it, Nox have the most toxic players you can find in any game. Last patch also made the game unplayable, the small balance the classes had is gone, is a cash grabber... dont be fooled by the cute graphics, this game is worst than a second job... you have to work EXTREMELY hard for no rewards at all...

												Update: Server Merge postponed till the end of the year, as usual 0 discussion of how they are going to deal with the economy after the merge... Let's see if they finally do something right or  screw the few people left that are still playing the game..They had an amazing game with a unique concept and beautiful gameplay. Sadly like others have said they are probably one of the worst developers around, they don't listen to anybody unless it's too late, they focus on the wrong stuff most of the time and frankly they don't care if you love the game only that you buy stuff.For quite sometimes the  game  is only plagued by bad decisions so overall not recommended as long as ankama is behind it.

												This game was almost everything I asked for artistically and combat wise and was an extreme upgrade from playing Dofus (which I also loved). I started late; last year and had a beautiful time where I met a very friendly guild, new people, and learned how to do everything up to Present dungeon with the help of many friends. Although, everything changed when DDOS' were happening where relics were duped and things were magically bought off the market for absurd amount of kamas and everyone became rich. This did not help when the promising new update of Moon Island and Heroes where it basically made everyone play by themselves and did not have to rely on anyone else to do dungeons anymore. Things became very introvert and very independent.Overall, I would not recommend this game if you start this year and on. The community is very small, but polite (once you get to 175s+) and is very heavy on finding a guild. You will NOT survive alone. As agreed with many people, this game would have gone a lot further if they listened to the community.			"

												Not a review, but I just wanted to point that this is probably the most f2p game of the whole steam MMORPG library.You will go to lvl 1 -> late game only depending in the hours you spend in, and you can't be better than someone just paying.Paying of course will give you something (skins and furniture for your ""house"", and you can buy sidekicks, secondary chracters that you control).Definetly, give it a chance. Any action though, slow combat sometimes.			"

												Thought you could play alone?. Hahaha, the only thing you can do in this game is grind. I did like this game a lot in the earlier stages but as time went on it became more of a grindefest than game. I literally thought I was working for one day. 10/100Only get this game if you have 5 friends and love grinding.EDIT:If you are gonna play this game just remember the only place that isn't a ghost town is Dathura (French Server) and Elbor (Spanish Server). The entire game gets around 5000 logins everyday across all the servers and they have started to shut down a few. Hopefully Ankama will save this game.			"

												I can no longer access this game, despite spending in game money. My account has been put in to ""protected"" status. The cause is, most likely, from suspicious IP addresses trying to use my account. To recover, I have to submit: a valid form of identification (driver's license, passport, etc), the date of purchase (I purchased before Steam, so this is a bit harder), and a new email address that isn't the same as the one they have on file. I enjoyed Wakfu prior to this, but their protection mode is quite the opposite. The game is linked to Steam, but that's not enough to verify ownership. If I could do a charge-back or refund, I would.			"

												This is the best MMORPG I have played in a while, despite the buggy state it more often than not sits in.I think what I love the most about this game, is the fact that there's a whole animated series that is based in the same universe as the game, which goes by the same name as the game. They did the same with their last MMORPG, Dofus, which also had an animated series, even though that was more 15 minute short stories instead of a whole storyline of events per season.All in all, this game is one of THE most unique experiences out there, if you're patient enough to bear with a bug or two every now and then.I'd recommend it to anyone who is willing to try out something new, as you'll probably never run out of classes to play with the 16 classes already in the game, and the new class coming early December.

												The number of hours I played this game before it launched on steam by far overshadows the 277 hours I have recorded here. It used to be a great game but was ruined by many poor decisions and a bad dev team. Every time I try to log on now, another basic game function is broken and I can't play because of whatever they've most recently broken.They keep revamping the same things over and over and it's still missing features that were promised when it launched in 2012. Worse is that they half put in features then never finish them. Some features have been put in game then removed.I made many friends playing it but I absolutely cannot recommend the game in its current state. Something drastic would have to happen for this game to be playable again.			"

												This is my kind of game! Beautiful graphics and music, turn based tactics on a timer so it works perfectly with people. You can join anyone and help them out in a battle as long as they are still in the setup phase and they can do the same for you. The survivability of species' in the game relies on the players ability to plant their seeds and hence, rebirth the creatures you kill and so much more.

												Did you love Final Fantasy tactics?Do you love that feeling of accomplishment despite the hellish pain of constant death that rivals even Dark Souls? Do you love deep tactical rewarding strategy based combat?Then Wakfu will probably be the game for you. On its cute and pristine exterior, there's a huge amount of depth and punishing dungeons and temples. This isn't your average MMO, you wipe in a temple that can take nearly an hour to complete? Well that's too bad, you'll have to start from the very beginning. This isn't some game you can get away with spamming. Positioning, timing and execution is key. Even basic battles against mobs have a strategic depth to them that feels foreign to an MMORPG. This game runs on turn based grid combat, you level your character like any other in an RPG, however each element has its specialties. Fire is typically AOE (area of effect) , Earth is typically direct damage, Water is usually healing or mobility debuffs or buffs with some damage mixed in. Air is usually knockbacks or line telegraph attacks. But that's only typically, each class feels extremely different. From manipulating time, to picking up your foes and tossing them, to entirely relying on lady luck in combat. Wakfu brings a whole new fresh style to combat that I've never experienced in an MMO before.Words of warning, if you like questing, you'll find it extremely lacking on quests until you reach the out-lying islands of the nations of the World of Twelve. However they continue to work on updating the game with more quest lines that guide you into areas. I say your first real challenging quest chain is on the Wild Estates, where a mixture of puzzle solving, challenging battles, even sports and an Indiana Jones style hunt for an artifact will take center stage. Did I mention its really hard? Because, it's really bworking hard! There's a large slew of crafting professions, an entirely player run economy, and the most challenging PVE MMO experience I've ever had. As for the PVP I haven't experienced too much of it. It depends on the server you join but the economy has been somewhat at a standstill and it's more likely you will get trades from your haven bag or face to face than the market. Kamas, the games currency aren't all that hard to get however, especially considering you can mint them yourself.Wakfu is a beautifully designed, deep and well made game that is literally the most challenging experience I've had in an MMO, rivals even what I experienced in my days of EVE in terms depth of combat. There's really a whole slew of possibilities you can approach a battle based on your class and playstyle, those possibilities yet nail biting, hair pulling difficulty is something I do have to admit that I love. We need more games like Wakfu, not MMOs, just games period. This game is the XCOM: Enemy Unknown of MMOs, it's about as tense too. Give the game a shot, add me on Steam if you'd want to party up, don't be afraid to ask questions to the community either, they're quite understanding and helpful, there will be a few bad eggs I'm sure.  In closing, Wakfu is a generously made game, with a lot of love and hardwork put into it, down to the extremely artistic style handcrafted areas, and lovable design			"

												In one word: obsolete.As you can tell from my hours played, I used to play this game. A lot. And this is only the hours logged on this character on steam, I had probably double this overall. However, I haven't touched this game in over a year. It runs on an obsolete version of java and the creators show no real intentions on updating it anytime soon. When I first started, it was a very vibrant game, full of excitement and fun. However, like so many others have commented, it's not what it used to be. The fighting system has been revamped over and over, so much so that it's just not fun to learn a new system every three months. It's not fun to deal with terrible support and a system that barely scrapes by. It's a shame, because this game used to be amazing. The music for this game is incredible, to this day I still go back and look up my favorite songs and listen to them on youtube. Like everyone else has said, the creators have pushed themselves into a corner by alienating the fanbase by removing exciting features, putting crap into the game, and punishing players for the actions of the few. I wish I could recommend this game, I really do. There was a time when I could; that time is gone. This game is on the downhill slope, which is sad considering where it has fallen from. That being said, if you want to give it a try, go for it. It's free and you can always use this as a time sink. But this game had its glory days, and those days are passed.			"

												[English at the end]• Wakfu é o MMORPG mais F2P do mercado.Começo com essa frase para você ter certeza de que ele é grátis de verdade, não há limitadores sobre o que fazer, e justamente por isso faço questão de apoiá-lo comprando itens que gosto no ogrines shop.• Wakfu tem fortes aspectos de sandbox.Se você jogou Ragnarok Online, então já está treinado para Wakfu. Imagine um RO evoluído: com controle do ambiente feito pelos jogadores; itens super diversos feitos por jogadores; política feita por jogadores; risco de deixar seu personagem ruim se não pensar direito na build, guerras e tratados de paz, etc. Mas também temos o grind, que se você não diversificar fazendo outras atividades (que não são poucas) te deixará entediado.•  Wakfu é muito bem desenhado.É um jogo bonito, não se pode negar. Seus equipamentos são realmente usados por personagens carismáticos, que começam usando coisas ""fofas"", que transparecem bastante o ""newbie"", para um dia ficarem imponentes e ameaçadores. Os locais visitados possuem características fortes, que deixam claro, por exemplo, a nação daquele território, e visitar os mapas é sempre agradável.• Wakfu é estratégico.Há muitos elementos estratégicos em Wakfu, do combate (que é feito por turnos) até como você lida com o ambiente com seu personagem. Há estratégia no craft, na política (que oferece diversos cargos para os jogadores), no estilo de jogo dos personagens e na interação entre eles, nos itens que você usará, nas habilidades, enfim, falar em Wakfu é falar em estratégia.Então se você chegou até aqui, dê uma chance ao jogo. Uma vez nele, leia, entenda-o, sinta-se livre de verdade, sem um caminho pré-definido a seguir. Não se prenda às missões, faça-as quando quiser, se quiser. Use a janela de archievements para guiar seus objetivos e viva o mundo de Wakfu à sua maneira.E faça o tutorial!______• Wakfu is the most F2P MMORPG in the market. Beginning with this phrase for you to make sure that he is really free, no limiters on what to do, and rightfully so I must support him by buying items I like in Ogrine shop. • Wakfu has sandbox in his veins. If you played Ragnarok Online, then you're already trained to Wakfu. Imagine a RO evolved: the control of environment made ​​by the players; various items made ​​by players; policy made by players; risk of build your character wrong, wars and peace treaties, etc. But we also have the grind, if you do not diversify doing other activities (which are many) that leave you bored. • Wakfu is very well designed. It's a beautiful game, one can not deny. The equipment is actually used by charismatic characters, who start using ""cute"" things, which are reflected quite the ""newbie"" for a day become imposing and threatening. The locals visited have strong characteristics which make it clear, for example, the nation that territory, and visit the maps is always nice. • Wakfu is strategic. There are many strategic elements in Wakfu, the fight (which is done in turns) to how you handle the environment with your character. There are craft strategy, politics (which offers various positions for the players), the game style of the characters and the interaction between them, the items you will use, skills, finally, speaking Wakfu is speaking strategy. So if you got this far, give the game a try. Once there, read, understand it, feel free indeed, without a pre-defined path to follow. Do not hold on to the quests, do them when you want, if you want. Use the window archievements to guide your goals and live the world of Wakfu your way. And do the tutorial!			"

												It's kinda rare to see Turn Based Strategy MMORPG.Wakfu is one of those rare gem. The gameplay kinda similar to Final Fantasy Tactics, but you only control 1 character, well. with sidekicks though, but still not much.Now on to the review.+ So many different class to choose of.  Each class have quite a lot of skill, you could make your own unique build.+ There's a profession system in this game, so apart from the main game itself, you could become a farmer, a blacksmith, tailor, and many more.+ Community oriented game, you can't sell your stuff to NPC, this game is really community based game, you must actually sell it to people, or... just throw it out. There's Region president election, Guild, and many more. You can join the bad guys, or become a guard instead.+ For people who prefers playing alone, there's a sidekick system. At least, there's someone to accompany you. Though, i recommend you playing with actual players.- The community is almost non-existent, many people said this game is still alive, but that's not applied in my case.  I'm playing in asia server, not sure about other server though.- Grindfest, and it's even worse than other MMO in general in my opinion.- Customization, There's costume and stuff, but... well, it's not rare to see people with a same face.- Progression, this game had quite an interesting story, but to progress in the main story is really hard. The level gap to actually progress in this game is really high. If you have a friend to play with you, i really recommend this game, It's really fun to play wakfu together. If not, find oneright away, join a guild, and have fun. "

												2 years ago I would have gladly recommended Wakfu. It had great graphics, fun gameplay and it was sandboxy enough for things to not seem too linear. Unfortunately it kind of spiraled into a huge mess after Ankama rolled out changes that completely split the playerbase. Some people really loved the changes. Others, like me, really hated them.While I personally wouldn't get back into the game in its current state, I wouldn't turn anyone away from checking the game out if only for the novelty. It IS a good-looking game with good-looking mechanics, unfortunately marred by excessive grindiness and a not-so-nice playerbase.			"

												This game is great... I mean it.  One of the best and most unique games you will ever find.I've been playing this game for years now (before it comes to steam) and I was in love with it.  I had many charecters at cap level... But one day.. my account got hacked ( I mean all gamers know this would happen to them once or twice in their gaming life it's not a big deal right??) SO I did what anyone else would do and opened a ticked... but guess what they will do for you? NOTHING! ya they might reset you password if you want, but other than that NO... NOTHING.so imagine playing for few years in this game and some hacker come in steal all your cash, spend all your cash-shop currency to buy stuff and give it to his main, sell all your rare armors and weapons.... so I basicly ended with 8 max level charecters naked with no cash... just nothing.  And they will not do nothing for you.  If you don't believe just go to their website and check it for your self.Link to their ""account theft information"" : https://support.ankama.com/hc/en-us/articles/201609246-My-account-was-stolen-what-do-I-do-and you will find this warning at the begininga ""Warning: although Support is able to help you regain access to your account, they can do nothing about any losses and modifications resulting from the theft. All stolen items or kamas are permanently lost.""So ya... Go ahead and play this awesome game... invest all your time (AND MONEY) in it... but if your account got hacked one day... you can kiss it goodbye.			"

												I would recommend this game, but there are certain things about it that different kinds of gamers may or may not like, I'll try to sum up some of the specific qualities.1: Like most MMOs it's a long grind to the higher levels, but it doesn't feel like you're doing the same thing over and over, generally you get to go through different dungeons and fight new monsters the more you level so you aren't always doing the same thing.2: You have specific skills you can build, everything from Farming/baking to being a jeweler there's lots of stuff you can do other than punching monsters faces all day, you don't absolutely have to if you're the kind of person who just likes fighting, but it can be helpful and even fun to learn these skills, some sidequests involve using these skills as well.3: There is a story to the game but it's really not the main focus until you level up drastically, but even so there are plenty of other things to occupy your time in this game, really half of it feels like you're making your own story with other players, which moves me on to the next topic.4: Politics, yes I said politics, there is a political and economic system in the game world that is run by the players, you can vote for elections or even become governer yourself, laws are set to keep the economy well (or to leech off of other players if they're a dirty politician) not to mention if you break the law you will be labled at a ciminal that other players will attack, and if you are caught then you will have your character sent to jail, also laws are in place to keep the ecosystem in order, which once again moves me onto the next topic.5: Ecosystem, yes there's indeed an ecosystem in this game, you want wood? Plant some trees but don't cut too many down, want to hunt some monsters? Make sure too many of them don't get killed but also don't let there be too many ect ect. There are generally laws in place to help keep it balanced.6: Character Classes, there are a total of fourteen different classes to choose from ""Damage dealers tanks and healers oh my!"" There's tons of variety in terms of how each class plays, each have their own mechanics making none of them truly ""useless"" Yes there's one that's overpowered but even that one has a down side, so in terms of classes you won't be dissapointed.So if the things I just mentioned sound interesting and maybe even fun I would highly reccomend trying this one out, it has a beautiful art style and TONS of content to keep you playing!

												EDITI played this quite a bit since I wrote the review and even got some friends to try it. Thing is, I don't like MMOS. There is something about it that just doesn't work for me.That being said, this game is an amazing turn based strategy game. If you like MMOs and turn-based combat, do try it!If you're like me, it's not unlike any MMO. It gets boring too fast.Original review-----------------------------------------------------------------------This game has one of the best turn based combat I've ever played. All playable classes have 20 spells and 5 passives you can skill and level up, allowing you to build it any way you want to suit your tastes. There is a lot of ennemies and they all feel unique.But that's pretty much it. There is no drive to level up, very few quests beside some for the intro, some milestones and the dailies. That's enough for me but it makes it hard to get friends into the game.Also, the politics, crafting and environnement things seem like useless or almost useless gimmicks to me.On top of that, the game have a lot of issues. The Steam achievements are not working (and at this point, I doubt they ever will). When my friend created an account, he got locked into a different region than mine and he gave up on the game.Give me a propper coop RPG with those classes and ennemies and I would buy it any time.

												I believe this game is worth your time. You can choose to invest money in the game, or you can choose not to. Either way you will have a fun time. This game is like Capitalism in a game format. You always want to make more money and increase your businesses and professions. The story is incomplete at the moment but it's a very beautful and interesting gaming concept. I reccommend it to everyone. It may not be the right game for everybody, but it deserves a chance. Too many people read the reviews and think this game is a waste of time. So just take the reviews with a grain of salt, and play the game and give it your own thought. Thank you for reading(:			"

												The developper has a shotgun approch to balancing, for 3 months the class I played was unchanged, then suddenly the dev nerf'd dmg output, healing and summons per turn by -50% making it not even remotely viable anymore.To be clear: that's half the summons and half the damage, so only 25% the original damage potential.Accoridng to rumors, all because of 1v1 pvp, in a game where pvp is barely even a thing.Aside from the asinine balance, there is an unbelivable amount of bugs and performance issues. The game is coded in Java and has memory leaks that make the game stutter real bad. A lot of content introduced had been disabled because the dev couldn't figure out how to fix it.Community seems really young and rude with very few exceptions. There's a lot of ""white knights"" that defend the dev's changes for no good reason and seem to advocate worse conditions for their fellow player. Most likely because they're subscribed and wouldn't be affected by the changes.			"

												Wakfu is a phenominal game filled with an innovative turn based battle system. Very similar to final fantasy tactics and other games of the genre. The tutorial is long and tedious because it has to be. The battle system is complex to those new to the genre, but once you can look past that; it's a game that you can tell lots of love and creativity was poured into it. Classes~ They're so many classes to choose. They vary from the typical archer and warrior to flying faeries and time robots.  Each class has it's own individual spells and abilities. For example, I have an Eniripsa. The Eniripsa is a support/healer class that can spec into fire, air, or water abilities. Without getting too much into this to prevent spoilers, (and because of my ignorance considering I have only played around 20+ hours) I can assure you that each class is innovative and will be fun to play.People~ People fuel everything in this game. They're no npcs, not too many quests, yet why is this game so fun? Because people make the combat system REALLY ♥♥♥♥ING FUN. You find a party of about 5+ people to do this exceptionally hard dungeon or invade another person's territory ( at level 18 you pick a civilization to live in) and after 25 hours I'm still having so much fun. Professions- If you want to plant a seed. Plant it ♥♥♥♥ing anywhere. If you want to mine a rock go build a bomb and blow up the rocks to find the rare minerals within. If you wanna go trample on someone else's freshly planted seeds (♥♥♥♥ you btw) then go do that. There's total free roam in this game. ZERO RESTRANTS. Art style/music~  Wakfu is very colorful. Has pretty good mustic, and a flowing animation. Don't be fooled by it's cartooney style though; this game is ♥♥♥♥ing bloody. If you wanna go kill a cat and cut off it's fur go ahead. The blood will be on the picture in your inventory. The games completely free~ That's right, it's free. Go play it you nerd.			"

												After having played for a good month or so, I have to say, this is a rare find among rpgs. Albeit starting the game is mildly difficult, it's a fun and interesting game to play! For what it's worth, I love this game mostly because it's all about the player.The economy is not run based on a setup from the developers, it's completely player-based, meaning you can set up shop in the little customizable bag you are given at the beginning of the main part of the game. Not only that, but there are a bunch of balanced, customizable classes you can jump into depending on your play style! Couple that with spells you have to use to improve, gear you can craft/find/buy from others, and all sorts of bonuses like Clan Member bonuses and Guild bonuses, you can increase your stats and quickly find a build for yourself! If that wasn't enough of a hook for the gameplay, you have several opportunities to ""Restat"", or change up all your spells and ability bonuses!There are a few major downsides to the game: There are NO NPC characters that are useful. By this, I mean there are no shopkeepers or helpful questline helpers, it's all based on you and your groups. This might be bad for some people, but this means you can literally cut through all the crap with hirelings and stuff, and just find like-minded players to work alongside!+ The game is simple to work with, using mostly the right and left mouse buttons to control your character and your surroundings.+ You control the environment! You can decide what crops to take and what all is removed from the area, like herbs, trees, and even the monsters!+ The economy is easy to understand, you sell anything at whatever price you want! It's up to the player that wants what you have to pay the price.+ The graphics are good, as well as the sprites and animations!- There are bugs, as with every game. If you spot something, report it, please, the devs will want to know what is going wrong.- Guilds are at a downside, as there are what are called Haven Worlds, or a World for your guild members to use. Others can slip in and steal stuff from it if you aren't careful, and you'll want to realize you probably WON'T be getting one for a long time if you're a new or semi-poor guild.- PvP is included, so those of you who are low-lvl with high professions, beware other players! Some will want to steal all your crops and leave you nothing in return!- You have to reintroduce anything missing into the environment. If there are no more Ash Trees, to name something important, then if you have the seedlings for it, you'll be forced to replant.There are ways around all the farming/environment stuff, but until you get enough money to buy the Haven Gems needed, it's a bit much to go after. Alot of the players love to help one another out, so ask questions if you want to know something. That said, enjoy playing Wakfu, and hope to see you in the World of Twelve!P.S. if you steal my crops, I'll shoot you. It's as simple as that. D:<			"

												Dude, how is this MMO NOT more popular? Yeah, it has that kid freindly aesthetic that might turn off some potential players, but for those who can love that cartoony vibe will find a game with a lot going on and a lot going for it. An wide expanding world with nearly everything being player run: the factions have a player leader, the mobs must be spawned BY PLAYERS, resources must be renewed by the players, you can only purchase items made by other players on a free market system; All of this just jazzes me so good. The combat is an absolute joy and endearing as well, being a turn based strategy MMO. Who does that!? Wakfu, that's who. It's free, man. C'mon.			"

It is fun for both free-to-plays and people who buy stuff for the game. I love the character selection. I was so curious I had tried all the classes. I love the game. I especially love the show. Anyone who has, or even hasn't played the game should go and watch Wakfu on Netflix or something (I suggest watching it in subtitles) . It can help understand reasons for updates in the game like the Eliatropes that were just put in. This game is just loads of fun. Very fun to play around with friends. Just download it and you will have no regrets.			"

												Wakfu is a gem. The game is amazing but its not for everyone. The game play is turned base so by nature it is slow. The game is grindy as a korean mmorpg so western players may find it unbearable. The graphics is cartoony so that also rules out the people who like realistic graphics.For me who likes to consider himself a hardcore mmorpg player finds this game amazing, you gotta use your brain, its no hack and slash, the grind is rewarding and also as a dofus player, this was perfect.7/10, I would have given it a 10/10 but its riddled with unbalanced classes which made pvp terrible, and as a pvper, thats bad.

												Now I played Wakfu before it came out on Steam, and it was a very fun experience to play through, along with the lore it had and each class having a unique style in their own right. When I got this game and started it up, I was abit skeptical about how it started off. But later in the game I got used to it and I felt right at home. It's a great MMORPG RTS game that I reccommend to those who want to have a fun experience. It's not meant for everyone, but it's something that I will keep coming back to when I feel down. The graphics in the game look pretty nice, and the world is VERY huge aswell. The fights are fun to, having a tile based fight, and each move counts as you try to figure out what to do. And if you have your friends, you can try to come up with more strategy. I was really impressed on the execution, and it's something that I will continue to love until the end of time. Not the best, but it's still unique. I would give this game an 8.67/10			"

												I played Wakfu a couple years back, then tried to get back in recently with a Freshly made character for testing purposes.They made Xp earned through fights terrible as hell now.In the past say, 30% of the Xp earned is gated behind Premium, which is cool, I think its a fine system which keeps the game free, yet rewards Premium purchase.But now, 70% of the Xp earned is gated behind Premium. Literally makes the game slow down so much for free players. Not sure if this is an action to severely gut the people who Power Level up to past 100 with help from friends, but this hurts newbies trying to level.Scaling is also terrible too, because while every other dungeon can have the difficulty level reduced to Rapid for faster clearing, Quest dungeons (Bovis) can't be tuned. The worse part is that the end boss of these type of dungeons usually aren't even hard, they trounce the player (at the recommended level) through pure stats and damage. If yur starting out in Wakfu, please get someone to carry, or there is little to no fun from Level 1 - 100, and even then, who is to say yur not already burnt out.			"

												I am not very experienced with Wakfu (as of this review) but I have got to say I was excited to hear that it was coming to Steam, and was free to play. Wakfu is a pretty good sized media franchise from France, there are currently 5 games ""in universe"", 4 released, they are Dofus, Dofus Arena, Islands of Wakfu, Wakfu, and Krogmaster (a tabletop, digital tie in involving minifigures). There are also multiple animated series and movies, including the animated Dofus and Wakfu series. Overall there is alot of lore to take from, and the universe is rich and fun to look at.Wakfu itself however is a pretty good game in my book, It feels like it has alot of strategy, combat wise, compared to most modern mmo's. The level cap in the game is pretty darn high though, so it may feel a bit grindy at times. But with the large and varied amount of classes and builds, I have got to say you wont run out of things to try!Overall I recommend anyone who is a fan of mmo's or turn based strategy games to take a look at Wakfu, and I recommend everyone take a look at the series as a whole!Edit: The game has been released on Steam for a while now, so I have a few additional notes.1. The player population seems to have increased, and is pretty lively compared to what it was before (at least in my opinion.)2. I just realized that the Steam achievements no longer unlock, I dont know what the deal with that is but it should not cause any real problems, its just a minor nuisance.3. have fun!			"

												Terrible. I've been playing it since the beta. Apart from the weird gamaplay and mechanic's decisions which is another big (but subjective) minus, the app is completely bugged out. You see people complaining about bugs at beta and these bugs are still there at the 5th anniversary. Multiple times their database glitches out leaving you without gear, throphies, costumes, materials and other stuff which took weeks to acquire. Best you get - some silly gift from Ankama as a ""compensation"", other times you're just completely being ignored by support.Game community keeps shrinking and that's no surprise. Comparing to what it was years ago, it's just dead now. Disappointed people log back in hoping something had been improved and abandon it again.Also there's no way of disabling unbearably lagging effects which makes you watch spells slo-mo and not being able to do turns in fight. And that's even on new computers with unsupported graphic cards. For instance, my 10 years old laptop with a supported graphic card runs it easily while on the new one with 8 gigs of RAM on the board the game lags out at you big time in fights.			"

												At first, Wakfu is a fun game. It has a really unique gameplay style and fun characters. However, once you get farther into the game, you notice problems that start to pop up. Its starts with small things. Maybe your character bugs out a little, or your spells don't work the way they should, and it isn't too big of a problem to begin with.But then these things stack up. And up and up and up. The development team is horrifically slow when it comes to fixing issues. Well actually, I take that back. Whenever there is a bug that HELPS players, it gets fixed very very quickly. But if you've got a gamebreaking bug that halves the damage you deal? Well, maybe they will get to it in three or four patches. And you get a patch once every two months if you are lucky. Whats that, your class is broken? Don't worry, you can always buy the 30$ class change!And don't even get me started on the support, oh lord. I sent in an issue, and a week later, after not hearing anything from them, I tried to contact them again. Again no response. So I tried to contact them a THIRD time, and finally, after almost a month, they contacted me back and said they had looked at the issue, and decided to do nothing about it.You'll notice I have a lot of hours on this game. That isn't counting the time I put into it BEFORE it was released on steam. Its because they keep promising to fix things. Every patch that comes out I think, hey,  They continue to try and put more and more things into the game without ever fixing the old stuff.  And I hope you like doing hours of research in order to play games! Many stats and spells are ambiguous, and there is NOWHERE in game that explains what they do. So, you have to scour the forums, hoping that your question has been answered somewhere, and that if you do find an answer, it isn't outdated.TL;DR this is ""Wasted Potential: The Game"". The base concept of the game is great, and so much could have been done with it, but in the end it just leads to bitter disappointment.			"

												I have played Wakfu since the first beta. Since the very start of the game. Since 2011. I thought Ankama Games had the right idea by combining their great game with a great video game company like Valve. Since Ankama Games is a French game company, creating a connection with the United States and other countries really helped the game with one of the problems it had, population of the English servers. The things that make this game great are the ideas introduced into the game mechanics itself.The grid-based strategy aspect of the game, combined with the different ways of stat growth and play made this game trully creative with the way players enjoyed the game on a fighting aspect. Another great form of the game is the creative design of the world of Wakfu. Every city, every character, every monster is unique and beautiful. One more great feature of the game is the way real people manipulate with the enviornment, the government, and the people who play the game. Wakfu shines with the idea that people have everything and anything to do with the world in which the players play in. The player can manipulate the mobs in given areas. The player can vote for government officals to enact rules for the country to follow.However, no game is perfect. Wakfu has problems, and unfortunatly the problems happen to be fairly large.Because Wakfu is a game made from a French company, support is not the best when something happens to happen, whether it be in the game or in real life. Although the content is large and the world of Wakfu is large, content seems to be lacking for people who don't want to 'level up'. There aren't many different ways to enjoy the game to its fullest, and although Ankama Games has tried to include ways of enjoying the game, it doesn't seem enough to really keep the players they recieve.I believe Wakfu is a great game and it should be looked at for players who want something different in their MMO. However, Wakfu lacks the ability to keep the players they recieve and although I greatly enjoy the game, and everything it provides, I can't help hoping for more of the game. 7/10 "

												I played this game when it still came out in closed BETA around years ago. The game once really great and enjoyable to play for hours. Too bad the developers make it even worst. Iz still kinda gud, but there's some changes that really hits me...Pros :> A turn based tactical game like no other> Really cool concept> The systems really nice... not just for fighting and looting whiches you can really bussy over something > Sometimes can be relaxing for some reason...> The deck system is nice, you can choose almost limitless possibilites to maintain your skills and build> Respect system <3> Free sidekicks!! ( but reroll every week...)> Unique crafting systemCons :> grinding grinding and grinding...> grind more until that 0.5% relic items drop> The government systems sucks, sometimes they corrupt the country and makes everything bad> Service system really costly to pay for items, (it even has items that drops in the game that you can find easily and they    price it almost 10 times from normal in the OG shop!! whices ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off (x_x) )> Unbalanced classes (sometimes abandoned, like the dev's has no interest in class development(especially unpopular classes) > The XP systems sucks, you cant almost play solo for XP grinds and its hard to get a good party member...> Slow levelingOverall Wakfu has a lot of potential they just need to keep fixing it...

												It can be enjoyable if you got enough people around you to play it with, as many things, but get ready to fall heavily behind while playing with anyone if you aren't using a booster, they become a must after reaching level 80, that's when the idea of exploration and a world of content infront of you closes down to a linear checklist of grinding, running the same dungeon 20-30 times to get an ""almost"" needed item is something that most of the people still playing it seem to consider acceptable or have to put up with, and after reaching it, all that is left is doing it again somewhere else, again, the boosters help alot there too, putting enough hours in trying to ""get good"" at the market eases the burden alot, but then, it's a dying game, if you still haven't played it you are probabbly too late and alot of empty areas and people full of despair await for you, unless you are French, I suppose their server is alive.There is pretty much zero costumer support and alot of unimplemented content or just stuff that were never finished, might as well try runescape.

""STEP INTO A LIMITLESS UNIVERSE"" - WakfuWhat is Wakfu? Wakfu is a limitless universe, with 15+ classes, cute graphics, an amazing amount of content, 17 professions, nature management, government and politics, turn-based combat, player-driven markets, and most of all, 99% of all content is FREE.Wakfu lets you play as a character in a vast universe, to travel it, to traverse all kinds of terrain, to explore, to meet new friends or enemies, but most of all, to enjoy.You can choose amongst 15+ classes (that's a lot!), each with their own unique skills and way of combat, and you are also able to learn and master 17 different professions, from farming, cooking, baking to even tailoring. You can have all of the professions, but it's up to you on what you want to level.This game has a dynamic environment; this means that the world isn't fixed. It's up to us, the players, to plant if the environment lacks plants and to reap if there is too much. It's up to us to decide what will become of the environment.With that being said, a player can lean towards being beneficial (Wakfu) or destructive (Stasis) towards the environment. Wakfu and Stasis are paths you can choose on how you interact with the environment, planting plants, trees and monsters seeds makes you lean towards Wakfu, while cutting down trees, harvesting plants and others make you lean towards Stasis. Most people misunderstand this as Wakfu being good and Stasis being bad, but the proper statement is that: Wakfu is growth as Stasis is regulation. We can't live in a world with a tree in every grid cell, right?Economy is also purely player-driven, you won't find an NPC buying your items for Kamas (the only currency), you'll have to find other people to buy it from you, or sell it in the outpost, where other players see items for sale, easier and in a more convenient way. There are 4 nations that a player can join upon reaching a certain level, each with their own respective territories, laws and government.Politics also play a role in the universe of Wakfu, every 2 weeks, there comes an election wherein a governor is chosen by the players. It's up to the Governor to change laws, pick members for the government and handle relations with other nations.Conclusion? I don't know if you'll like it as much as other people and I do, but just give it a try, play it and you'll find out.			"

Strategic grid based combat, unique classes, a beautiful art style, and a magical story are all found in this game. Try it out for free with a couple friends. Form a group. Have a laugh. Try to beat a dungeon. Specialize in a craft and trade with each other. Propose Friendly dual or attack a player and become an outlaw. This is truly a multiplayer game.			"

												Great MMO Clicker, I highly recommend this if your looking for a relaxing but still challenging game. Beautiful graphics, very  fun but serious story line, an ok class system, and most of all, friendly player base. It's not hard at all to join a guild, players manage the ecosystem, politics, and economy, and they do it well. It is not a pay to win, but pay to play is available. I never used the p2p but I certainly would if I didn't have bills to pay! Although it is a major improvment from Dofus, there are a few bugs that can interfere and hurt your experience on the game. The game is java based and the game client tends to leak memory causing your game to lag or ""stall out"" and even disconnect you. Some players can take the game too serious and PWN players that just unlocked pvp or players that forgot to turn off their pvp. The reason I make that point is because the players that PWN are not just PKing but are rude and nasty. One last thing, the story is not complete and continues with updates every 4 or 5 months from what I have seen. I consider it an up and a down; It keeps you coming back, but who likes a cliffhanger.Overall, This is definatley a must play. AND IT HAS STEAM TRADING CARDS!			"

												I really the game. The classes are pretty unique and amazing. BUT The game trips on itself. With loads of bugs (quests not counting, quest objectives not appearing, monsters being untargetable) and some inconsistencies in translation, the game just feels like its still very much in beta. They just released the Hero System, which in theory is awesome- you can create a team of your own characters. However there is a catch- 10$/month to max your team at 3 AND the really weird restriction of requiring the characters to be of the same nation AND guild. I don't get that at all. Until these are fixed its just a sad thing to watch such a promising, gorgeous, innovative game ruined by its own creators.			"

												3/10It's fun at times and the references can be clever. However, it does not retain my attention for long. It grows rather repetitive and the constant grinding is tedious with little reward until you're well into your 60s-70s level wise(which can, on estimate, can take up to 2 weeks. If you don't care to sleep.).I, personally, also don't care too much for the grid battle style, which, in no way to me, makes it more difficult, only annoying. This game bores me and really offers no great difference from any other online MMORPG. For the download time I suffered (I have unreliable internet at times), it really was not worth it in any means.I have certainly played many MMORPGs, having been playing games since I was eight, and this is certainly not a ""best"". It goes more along the lines of ""Those Generic MMORPGS with a relatively simple and boring plot"".Don't get me wrong. The art was great. The strategy involved is wonderful. It is really just the whole ""Grindy-grindy until you're whiny. Waste your time and lose your mindy.""I've always been a picky person when it comes to plot and grind. I just can't stand it.			"

If you like being ganked by ppl twice your lvl constantly or you're one of those losers that gets a kick out of it give the game a try, as for me i'm out.			"

												ANKAMA BANNED ME BECAUSE I TRIED TO SETTLE A PAYMENT DISPUTE! Ok so I heard tons of stories of how terrible the support for this game is, but I didn't want to believe it was a common thing. That it was just a problem with a few unlucky players and maybe there are just a couple bad employees. Boy was I wrong. I went to buy the drheller and the krosmos harness for the week 3 wakfunding campaign and I only received the confirmation email that activates the in purchases in game for the krosmos harness. I sent a ticket to ankama support as well as PayPal, but they BANNED  ME because apparently the drheller was a ""fraudulent purchase"".  Aside from my personal experience, if you want to talk about the actual game itself, I definitely know now why 80% of the veteran players from years ago abandoned this game like a sinking ship.A lot of complaints I read about are pointless nerfs, next to NO support for North American players, updates are exclusive to end game players and they NEVER fix or expand on the current content for the early game players. If you do try to play the game just to check it out keep in mind that the world supposedly has a LOT less players than it used to from what I've read in the forums, and there's a TON of grinding involved, I didn't mind this because I do enjoy tactical RPGs and I loved the class system, and I started playing about a month ago so I wasn't personally affected by these less than stellar updates.But man, this is completely ridiculous and a freaking shame considering I'm a big fan of the Dofus and Wakfu TV series and comics. I really wanted to see more of this game to make a decision on whether or not it's worth the time, but I guess that's not happening. Season 3 of Wakfu better be worth the money I lost.EDIT I got my response to my ticket, and before they'll look into my case they want to see my birth certificate, passport, or driver's license... I guess this is common practice for most mmos when it concerns your account but I'm still not too keen on giving away crucial identity information to a foreign company. Despite my saltiness I do recommend checking out Treasures of Kerubim and Wakfu, as well as the tie in comics. You can find English translations on brotherhoodoftofuv2 on tumblr.			"

												I was planning since long to start Wakfu, now that it landed on steam I picked this opportunity.I'm really enjoying it so far. Turn-based mechanics are very interesting, the game is group-focused and community is nice compared to other MMO's. Sandbox elements are also pretty interesting. The player-driven economy is a bit broken, but anyway with the new players who joined on steam release there is market and trading for us new players as well.Definitely a game to pick if you are looking for a good turn-based mmo (you have only Atlantica as second choice eheh) and especially the feeling of being rewarded with your hours of gameplay. There is no rush to endgame or max level in a week like almost other MMO's nowdays. "

Then all of a sudden my data kept deleting itself, and then the game wouldn't even open. After repeatedly contacting customer service and being told to do the equivalant of ""turning it on and off"" , they finally agreed to actually take a look at my game data. Lo and Behold, after a month of back and forth they realize that it's nothing that I did, but the games issue. They then promised to fix it soon, and to have a bit of patience.

												A really unique MMO that uses a system akin to that of Final Fantasy Tactics.However the support for this game is nonexistant and it's not at all player friendly. It came out almost a year ago on steam from when I'm wwriting this review and they still havne't even fixed the steam achievements. For a game with 149 achievements it's rather unfortunate when you can't unlock over half of them due to an almost year long unfixable bug.If you don't care about achievements and don't mind a game where if something goes wrong you will get no support then by all means this is a pretty great game. The world is fun to explore and the combat is just as fun with lots of interesting classes. However due to the lack of support from the dev team and the fact bugs just aren't getting fixed I can't recommend this game.Update: Apparently the achievements have been fixed finally.			"

This one was sopose to be new, better, the future, it turned out to be ♥♥♥♥. From bad inventory space management that got solved later, to player economi that was bad from the first day. The 4 nation war was also not much since most people picked 1-2 nations rest were empty. The game wasnt any good compared to Dofus, that is its preducessor. When you make a new game, you try to make it better from the previous one, not make it worse. Whats most anoying to me other than bad inv space management is the damn Trapper and the need to have to level it and replant mobs so some **** can come and kill them all not caring about the negative points. They should just close the servers and move on, they screwed up dofus and they destroyed wakfu from the start. This company used to stand for something, be something, now they are just money hungry asses that try to push crap into the market.			"

I'd say the developers spent a lot of time making the open world as beautiful as 2D can possibly get.Gameplay - As many people will say, this game plays similar to Final Fantasy tactics. You play as one hero in a turn based setting with a series of Action Points to use for spells and a series of Movement Points to walk around. There are large assortments of unique classes and no class plays the same. What makes this game fascinating is how creative every class is.Players - This game has a surprisingly low population for how fun it is. There are many friendly and unfriendly players like in any Massively Multiplayer Online Game. Since the populations are so low though, some higher level players tend to become localy fameous within the servers.Story - I have to say, i haven't even touched the story. It seems kinda iffy to begin with. You incarnate into Astrub and do some mercenary work. Than a giant tv face guy tells you that you are the chosen one to defeat the mighty Ogrest. I'd have to say the story for me is the weakest aspect of the game.			"

Curious, heavily strategic combat system, mounted audiovisual and overall quality will impress many players but...The more you get into it , the more complicated it becomes, after some time appears grind, and micropayments quite clearly show numerously restrictions. It's a shame, thus we miss a lot of joy. Wakfu could be great, and it is just good. Personally, I was not convinced to this position, but maybe because I'm not a fan of this type of game. I found this very good position to be installed on the laptop, because during frequent trips, I can quietly play the levels in Wakfu, instead of playing sapper. On the other hand, you can't fail to notice the enormity of work involved in the production. Drawn graphics, dozens of statistics that describe your character, hundreds of skills, equipment, thousands of quests, in one word good job. Ultimately, this is a niche title that is unlikely to made an international career, but certainly appeals to maniacs of turn-based games and drawn the world.			"

												I like the unique look of the game, the unusual character classes, and the turn-based combat.I don't care for the open world system of advancement. With no specific quest line to follow, it leads to a lot of time spent searching for quests, or grinding to advance.The world intrigues me enough to want to play it, but actually playing it feels like a chore when it's so hard to find quests.So for me this game is a ""no"", but it does have a lot going for it. If what I've described above doesn't put you off, it's definitely worth checking out.			"

												This game is for fans of turn-based RPGs and also for the fan of Dofus, another game by Ankama that very much inspired the world of Wakfu (most locations return from Dofus but in a different layout). I've played this game in beta a few years back and I can say it got alot better since then. Give it a try if you're a fan of the genre/of the Dofus-Wakfu Universe.			"

												Love Wakfu, great to see it on Steam. If you're looking for an mmo that's a little different but still lots of fun and actually pretty cheap, this is your chance. It is a wee bit pay2win though, and keeping a wiki on hand is very helpful.			"

												Again and again I find myself returning to this game, only to encounter a diffirent disbalance and same broken AI. One would think that since the game came out, developers could adress these issues. Instead, we get alternative questlines and new cash shop items.The gameplay is enjoyable. The artstyle is good. But the world feels very, very empty.The game was originally intended to have a community. Players run faction politics, entire economy and even location ecosystems. It has now gotten to a point where people jump to another server, just because it has a spike in population. Many people who return to the game after a long time seem to be bewildered by the state of affairs.There is variety of classes, each with their own, unique abilities that grow stronger as you use them. This is great, except because of the aforementioned imbalance, which in turn leads to a class getting nerfed or revamped. Remember that character that you played a while ago that you really liked? Here, have a totally diffirent one.Crafting is a grindfest. If there was an active economy going, this would have been easier. But if you want to create a good item, you have to personally collect all the components required for a specific item and craft it. Both of these require a good amount of time to get the skills for. And the list of required components can often be quite extensive. This repeated process is the only way to advance in a crafting profession.There's an extensive list of unique enemies, who often come in matched groups, so as long as you advance in level or just travel a lot, you get to face various new challanges. This only lasts until later levels, when the grind sets in, or when you just need to acquire specific components or a piece of armor. This uniqueness also causes AI to frequently do random things. And woe upon you if you picked a summoner class - healers who prefer full health targets over dying allies, melee summons who decide to just step back a bit and skip turn...I wish the game would do better, I really do. But so far I've come to be repeatedly dissapointed.			"

												Visuals----The one thing that's still great about this game. Ankama took their existing universe of Dofus and expanded on it. Everything is nice and lovely and vibrant, the setting is very consistent with itself. It's a great example of worldbuilding making a game notable and able to stand out above the crowds.Gameplay---I can handle most turnbased things, Xcom isn't a stranger to me in any way, but the turn based style does not lend itself well to multiplayer in this fashion. The gameplay doesn't change that much between level 20 and level 100. There's no real defined niche that you can build your character to fill that can't be filled by someone else of your class with 5 minutes of free time. All in all I think they kind of lost sight of what made the game good in the first place and decided that it was easier to update Dofus than it was to flesh out Wakfu more.Tech-----Somehow, a PC that runs Overwatch at 1080p at 100fps constant has terrible jitters in this super simple java game. I'm running 16gb of ram but the game chugs even when I use launch paramters on the standalone client and feed it up to 12gb of ram. Overall, the game is a 3.5/5 for me if you like turn based tactical games. I'd suggest something else if you are looking for an MMO to play with friends however, the community is just about nonexistant(on Nox anyways, the North American server)			"

												Played since launch on and off and cannot recommend to anyone.  Had a lot of fun in the beginning but after revamp after revamp dosn't feel like the same game.  On the positive side charming graphics, great music, and unique gameplay.  On the negative constant class revamps, stat revamps, lack of crafting and gathering revamp (crafting is utterly pointless), and duplication bugs that ruined the market.  Honestly feels like the game has never left open beta.			"

												If I could give a mid-ranged review? I would. The game had and still has a lot of potential and nostalgic feel to it for those of us especially who enjoyed games like Final Fantasy Tactics.The Crafting and Gathering system is huge; big enough to be it's own thing really. You could almost make a Wakfu version of Stardew Valley out of all the stuff you can craft and the things you have to gather, how and where. For my inner crafter and explorer.. it's great! I love teh fact you can transplant not only plants, but animals and mobs into different areas.. though the current system still gets abused, the way they discourage that abuse is a creative addition to faction gameplay I simply didn't expect.. and still appreciate. Multi-level maps are lots of fun to run around on usually, though there are some drawbacks.The downside hits when you get into progression through the rest of game. It's slow, really slow after you get through the opening city quest. And I mean this is crawling a mile on your belly through a corn field not knowing what direction you're even supposed to be going, slow. Getting anywhere with dungeons is a pain alone unless they're severely underlevel, or you manage to find a party (good luck with that!) And actual quests are so few and far between on the slow grind, or worth so little that it actually makes it feel slower at times. Combat is fun but difficult solo at times, and the overall health loss when you die doesn't help encourage solo players towards the story or content at all in my opinion. The maps, while fun to explore especially when they become more multi-level? Can be very confusing for that same reason, as the way up to a higher tier of the map or down to a lower one isn't always clear: wasting a lot of your time running in circles only to find out you can't even get to X place from where you're at or without crossing some bridge a zone over.Don't get me wrong, it's lots of fun if you have one to three people to play with all the time.. but otherwise main progression and catching up if you get behind your group can be really tough. It's incredibly easy to have double the level gathering and crafting, from what you have as a battle class, if that tells you anything. Which, is fine with me at this stage. As I said, that part can be a lot of fun on it's own. Still grindy after a certain level, but fun.Overall, I do reccomend this game if you like crafting and gathering, or especially if you have a friend (or more than one preferrably) to play it with: but definitely take this into consideration. If you're not up for a grind of any kind, or want to play through the main content on your own sometimes? This probably isn't the game for you past Astrub (the first City.) If you do enjoy crafting, gathering and exploring though? Try it. You can get lost in this game for hours if you do.			"

												Updating This Review from formerly Nov 7, 2014Wakfu is a unique game like most have already told you, it mixes MMO with turn-based battling ALA Final Fantasy Tactics and to a lesser extent, things like X-com, though the visuals may seem cartoony the game is still very complex in my opinion and you need awareness and quick-thinking to fight some higher level enemies with specific mechanics and priorities in battle. The sad thing about Wakfu is that it has changed several times in the past years, some for good and some for bad. I still stick with my original belief that this is a fun game with the potential for enjoyment for a lot of people.The Good :Character builds and customization are great, although the last change to the system limited potential, I still am able to make builds that are to my flavor and effective in combat past level 150+ where I currently am.I use the heroes system they have to play my myriad of characters who usually complement each other in some way. The Heroes system was in beta for some time, and essentially just allows you to play three characters on your account for a fee. (Booster + Heroes System costs around the same amount as a standard MMO sub).The Challenge system in this game adds much needed variety to farming, though some challenges are left better suited to particular characters in the game. Being turn based, you're able to effectively ""backstab"" enemies for more damage on your turn by being behind them. Some challenges require all enemies be killed this way for a bonus to exp and drop rate. Sometimes its worth it, sometimes its not, choose how to spend your time and you may cut your grinding in half.Dungeon System in this game is interesting, and it is good for the most part, being able to set dungeons to an easier difficulty for less rewards or making them extra hard for potentially double the rewards is great for people who need to learn a boss mechanic or feel up to overpowering a boss/groups and getting a better chance at those rare/unique items they seek so desperately.The community in Wakfu has always been an interesting one, somewhere between hospitable to passionate individuals who try their best to work with Ankama and revive this dying game. They love the game, and so do I, and I wish to see it thrive. It shows when I login and people are hanging out, talking about strategies, calling for dungeon runs, selling their stuff, and generally just wanting to have fun together.The Bad :Wakfu is a hard game to get into past a certain point, while being visually welcoming to those of a young age, you will quickly understand the elemental system and either learn to memorized enemies weakness/strength or grow frustrated as your damage is abyssmal because you forgot X monster was strong against X element.The customization for the game as far as battles has become a little more limited since the changes, and you will see optimized builds (like any other game) are almost necessary with the lack of choice. Though you can skimp on one or two skills, always having the core ones assures near maximum potential for damage/survivability especially against enemies who may have strong resistances against two of your three elements which each character has access to spells for.Grinding can be pretty bad unless you have friends to run dungeons with, and the shame is that the heroes system while making it fun for soloers, makes going in with randoms more unnecessary as well. With just yourself and a single other friend paying a premium subscription you can practically do all dungeons in the game, or six box accounts like some have in the past.They somewhat recently changed how gear in the game drops, claiming it was for more ""unique builds"" with elements being rolled out randomly with gear but this has just made rerolling stones more valuable and frustrating. Now you can't simply get a set and use it, you have to get the elements for your build correct as well. Just a chore, really, along a lot of other systems in the game unless you nibble at the grinding of mats, tokens, and crafting a bite at a time.Ankama mostly puts out cosmetics while delivering small trickles of actual content, changing the game seemingly with no input from the community (Though you see when Flat responds in the forums all the time) and its moreso they can't seem to filter the ""bad"" suggestions from the ""good"". Bugs still exist in the game for 3+ years ago. Oddly enough its their birthday for this game as of writing this and I feel like the cake is a little stale.The Overall TL;DR VersionWakfu is a game I love, and this review is probably biased as hell, but I am aware of it. In saying that, would I recommend this game to new people? Yes, for a while, levels 1-50 might be fun to dabble in but once you get 80+-100+ is when the game ""starts"" and thats when it will either make you or break you. Do I think its worth playing right now? Maybe? Depends on how much you can tolerate. Bugs, graphical issues, optimization problems, class balances, promises both delivered poorly or well, or not at all plague this game. It has its faults. THIS GAME IS NICHE AS **** AND YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT GOING IN! Besides that, I enjoy it, I put away my 13 dollars a month for it, even when I don't play, because some days its just fun to hop in, say hello to my guild, kill a few things, bake a couple of loaves of bread, and then go on about my day.The game features 17 unique classes, all with strengths and weaknesses, healing or tank, positioning or dps, and mixtures of both. Not gender locked, lots of cosmetics to buy, emotes to find, places to explore, and all set in an open-world environment (For grinding mobs). There are a handfull of big ""Quests"" to do at certain levels such as 50, 100, 110, etc that will boost you a few levels.Heroes system allowing to play 3 classes/combos at once. Guild level up system, pvp (Haha don't), and a few other things you'd come to expect quality of life wise like teleports and lore. While the game is not pay to win, the premium sub makes this ""easier"" to deal with. The typical 30% ""faster"" for premium sub, but if you don't want to invest, you can still eventually get there...albeit in a car with one flat tire.I have stockholme syndrome, its a terrible drug. =/			"

Then Wakfu may be good for you.Do you have a bag full of money to spend? Yes? then you gona spoil part of the grinding fun =/Its not a BAD game, its just that grinding is 90% of the game. And most times there isn't a single mob to fight if did not grind points on ""planting monsters"".But, even with the grinding, the Gameplay mechanics are unique and its worth playing for the experience.

Rating: 6/10What I like about this game is that its a turn base strategy mmo game.Could have been a decent game but there are some reasons why i only gave it a 7/10 ratingbut with the recent update its 6/10.Will I recommend this game to everyone? Read the PRO's and CON's then you decide if you want to play the game.PROS:* 17 Playable classes each with its own unique set of skills.* You can create up to 5 character per server although you have to pay for 3 more character slots.* Customization for gender, eye color, hair color, skin color, hair style and default outfit.* Eco system which lets player control the environment per map* Haven Bag that lets player create and customize his own house/place where in he can do garden, crafting and also sell stuff.* Lots of things to craft and do.* Lots of dungeons you can explore.* You can join a nation and colonized a territory or even vote for ruling governor(for booster users only).* You can create/join a guild and get world haven where in you can create your on place to farm, fish, mine, etc...* Hidden treasures and secrets.CONS:* Achievements on steam does not work.* Bugy, not just few but lots of them* some environment buff dont work properly you will have to relog to fix this problem* when you trade with someone sometimes you wont be able to cancel the trade or close it, again you will need to relog.* sometimes when you are in a battle there is a bug where in you can't attack properly, again relog.- when you have a poor connection sometimes the sprites are missing, broken or mixed where a    fish turns into a box.- and so much more... isnt that fun exploring bugs? ^_^* Some updates and events are not announced on time.* To much grinding and farming.* Player Base is getting low.* PVP is not balanced.* There are things that only a booster pack user can do.Recent Update 1.52PROS:* added a ranking system for dungeons* added new crafting itemsCONS:* They changed the repeatable quest in maps where in now it gives you less exp, you will need to be a booster pack user to get the max exp reward bonus that it use to give. This game is already a grinding game and then you make decisions like that and the best part is that you dont show that in your updates hiding it to players. Way to go anakma you'll defenitely going to lose players with that, keep it up. ^_^			"

												Personally, I feel like the game is too rigid, and it doesn't give enough space to socialize or explore the NPCs and towns freely at your own pace. Perhaps it's like that after only spending a few hours playing it and not exploring other places. However, I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would (these reviews give you too much to hope for). Leveling up even at low levels is slower than I'm used to. (So, if you don't like grinding all day everyday then stay away. Although that's mostly what mmorpgs besides the quests are all about. Let's be honest, lol.) I feel like there could be room for improvement in the structure of towns and NPCs that surround it, better introduction than just tutorials about how to fight, etc. Although I may just be giving a hasty generalization as I was expecting more from many positive reviews.

												A suprisingly entertaining game that deserves a try by anyone who enjoys turn based strategy games! Obviously similar at first glace to games like Final Fantasy Tactics and the Disgaea series, but with it's own twist and features for online multiplayer!A few hours in and I still have quite a lot of learn about how to play Wakfu, but that's part of the fun! The medium strength learning curve means things may feel familiar to you from other games, but not entirely. One of the best designs is the classes themselves. A large number to choose from and not the standard, boring names and designs like Warrior, Mage, and ...well actually there is a Rogue, but it's cool! The artistic design of this game is fantastic and also adds to the familiar, but fresh feeling that Wakfu brings!Oh, and you get a crate for your bag....house...thing! :D			"

												(ignore the hours; I play on the actual client)So I played Dofus briefly in 2011 and only recently downloaded Wakfu. My main is just a level 25 Pandawa (I'm taking my time) and I think I'm in love. This game hits many points for me; it's cute, turn-based, and it's got loads of content. Score!Also, part of the reason I like it so much is because it reminds me of Spineworld, an old MMO on miniclip (2007-9)... Gosh I'm feeling so nostalgic right now, haha. Kind of wish I downloaded Wakfu sooner... /grumblesSeriously, if you're a fan of 2d turn-based games, try this one out.Overall: 10/10 ☆彡			"

												Great game, fairly addictive.Addictive how? I don't know how to explain. It's just a personal preference thing.If you enjoy games that are slow and casual, you'll want to try this out.You'll spend most of your time harvesting resources you'll probably end up selling.The combat itself is turn-based, so that's self-explanatory. If you want a fast-paced game, you're looking at the wrong place.The first 12 levels or so, you'll find yourself with a bunch of interesting quests, but pretty much after that the story kinda disappears. I've only played till lvl 50, but so far I haven't had any storyline quest after the intro.At any rate, the most appealing factor of this game is probably its style and art. The grind itself isn't hectic, but farming for resources might break your sanity.Personally, I think this might be more of a social game.Also, this game has no problem showing animals mating.			"

												Hello all! Finny posting here, some of you who are reading this might want a brief review, some of you might just be looking at another Hardcore Wakfu players opinion so I'll give both. Played hours here 600 odd actual? 3.3k (no life)1st things 1st, this game is extremely unique i've never played a game like this, a game like this is truly amazing and so is the fact that the game is available on the Mac platform (what i'm using). TLDR: Game is amazing but VERY VERY grind-y, lonely and un-sociable (Read bottom paragraph). Would recommend :]Story: This is extremely limited, this is newbie friendly but is very short and only links to Ogrest which is still yet to be incorporated into the game (I think this was going to be level 200 content) once you progress to mid 100 content (level 50) the newely revamped islands (currently 2 out of 5-6+) you then get new quest-lines which feature ways to get Kamas (In game money) quicker through even more exploration of the game, this is tedious but can be fun for people who are casual and don't mind spending 20 hours+ running around the game. The story then jutters and jumps to mid game content (level 100, 118, 120 and 125) these questlines again feature kama making methods and are EXTREMELY fun and give an insight into the story of the game and the Ultimate Bosses (weekly bosses, sadly no challenge what-so-ever) you then have the section of the game which is the most grindy, intensive, game quit feeling inducing moment ever, this is the jump from 120 to the next 140 quest, this is the most boring and lonely grind experience ever, this puts most people off the game. From here you have more quests more frequently and you would have probably found a guild and start to have some online Wakfu friends, you then lead into the high level content, I won't speak about this since you'll probably have a basic understanding of the game and some good friends etc.Guilds: This is all down to preference but the size of the guilds aren't huge and you are basically forced into high level guilds just to see anyone online, there are a few English guilds which are really nice and newbie friendly (notice how I said few, it really is hardly any guilds that are newbie friendly) when entering this game it's not advised to ask high levels for leeching I will give you a quick run down of why:XP is grindy as HECKYou'll be on 0.5-0.75x XP meaning that someone grinding you a few levels will feel like a life time, period.Fun factorIs it fun for high levels? Yes and No, depends on their mood and what you're like as a player etc.Language Barrier Hit and miss remember this game is multi-cultural so be wary of whom you ask for help due to language barriers!In game revenue / money methodThis is called 'Kamas' you gain some each fight and with chests that you open from completing a respective Questline, this is tedious but you get quite a lot of money, awesome! On Remington you have quite a nice economy meaning that while some items are crazy high they are endgame and so you'll only aim for these once you have complete knowledge of the game and dungeons etc. Majority of other high level stuff is dirt cheap so that's cool!Dungeons:Fun and grindy you don't have to run it 1,000 time for an item to have 1 chance of dropping it but instead....! You can run it 1,000 times to get enough tokens to buy it huzzzah! So it's all down to your opinion, there's also major awesome guides online showing you how to complete these dungeons as-well as other players that you'll be running with experience!PvP:Completely broken due to only a select amount of classes being revamped and overly powerful, unless you follow the crowd with new classes i'd advise against it.Classes: Old ones are much weaker and often not taken/ accepted as much in dungeons compared to newer classes, same with other games but sad really R.I.P Sadida ;w;Bugs:This game has a fair amount of bugs in it but these seem to be ironed out fairly quickly, until recently where dupers have been duping end game items and selling them for very low prices, this has in turn kinda ruined the economy and the player base due to not trusting the market and other players, a lot of people such as my self feel slightly cheated that new people pick it 1-4 of these duped 20million each relics and I spent months farming 1 worth 4 million... This is a major problem as of May 26th 2015 so if you're reading the review take this into account!			"

												Honestly the tutorial and opening quests were so horrible that both me and a friend trying it for the first time couldn't stand it and quit. Shame I did really like the combat. I mean there was some weird pizza quest that took so long we just quit. In general I wouldn't recommend playing it until they revamp the beginning of the game. To start the forced tutorial needs to be optional, the game isn't that complicated and having played many tactics style games it was absolutely painfully slow.			"

I was dropped in a world with no info!No clue what stats i should be investing my points,no idea what my skills did,the quests were scattered and the constante mob noises were trully annoying!Still i kept on going,but i soon realized another important issue! This game is impossible to play alone! Half a dozen quests in and i'm stuck fighting mobs way above my level!I either missed something or you need to grind a ton inbetween quests!I thought the interaction with the biomes to be interesting and was looking foward to explore the politics meantioned in the description since it seems amazing.By me this game just doesn't deserve a recommendation!I was expecting a fun game and instead i got a grindy, confusing mess. . .

												Do not let my play time on Steam fool you, I played this game for countless more hours than what's stated here. I just keep coming back to it, because it's really what you make it. You can hardcore grind all day long or play more casually like me these days, lounging about spamming the best emotes I've seen in a game, role playing, or PvPing. I also voted it for Steam's ""Game Within A Game"" award because there's just so many side quests, mini games, and achievements. I do wish Steam would fix it's achievement registry though because I have way more than 2!This is not to say the game is perfect. I've seen some major bugs over time but they do reward fair compensation and try their best to fix things in a quick manner. I'd say that's normal for most any MMO though, wouldn't you?So try it. One of my favorite games to date.			"

												I loved Final Fantasy Tactics A2 and the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon series and always wished for a multiplayer version of those games. This game does a pretty good job of putting the combat experiences of those games in a multiplayer setting. Besides the combat, I also enjoyed the game's environmental mechanics because it kind of gives me a Harvest Moon or Animal Crossing kind of vibe where the world gives you these resources to do things with, and the players are responsible for tending to them or making something out of them. As for the grinding, I personally don't know if it is actually necessary or not, but in any case I managed to skip the first story quests altogether and head to my chosen nation (Bonta) and then proceeded to grind the highest level mobs and dungeons that I could manage, purely because I love overwhelming myself in these tactics games and barely pulling through. It also helps that the only punishment for death is no exp gain for a lost battle, reduced stats for about 3 minutes and a respawn back to the previous checkpoint area of your choosing. I've spent no money on the game so far, but I might in the future if I keep playing. Paying players get some nice bonuses, but I've been playing comfortably without them. There's also some nifty costumes and stuff too. I recommend the game because it's free and I enjoy it. If you get it, I'd definitely recommend doing the tutorial and trying out a few different classes. I went through a couple classes and then went with the Elitrope as my main because I personally loved the portal mechanic. My brother went with the archer because he loved the obscene range and then the huppermage because of the elemental/light attack dynamic. There's a lot of variety, so don't be afraid to try a few out. Also, your lower level alts will gain an experience multiplier to make grinding levels faster,			"

												I have been playing this game off and on (mostly on) since 2012. I more than likely have thousands of hours of gameplay which I think is more than enough to warrant me to review it. And yet... reviewing this is hard. The game itself conceptually and artistically is fantastic. It is such a visually pleasing game and the music is pretty great too (after a while I put the music on mute however). You can really feel the thousands of hours of hand drawn work that went into making Wakfu such an attractive game. But the two caveats here is that the game is buggy and the customer support is lackluster at best. But before you turn away and never touch this game - just give it a shot. The game itself is good enough and challenging enough that you might really take to it. If you loved those JRPGs with the word 'tactics' thrown onto the end (or front like 'tactics ogre') of their titles then you might really fall for this game. What is more is that it is an MMO and as anyone who has really dug deep into an mmo knows you start to form bonds with these people that you play with. It is really unlike any experience a video game can provide.			"

												Honestly, I went into this game not expecting too much since it's just another RPG. I'll be truthful, the character design is extremely pleasing and creative, gameplay is. . . alright I suppose. The issues I found, though not playing it long (for a reason), is that there's very little ambience. It gives the game an eerie feeling. . ? I mean sure there's bright colours and I can turn on my own music but besides loading screens, don't expect too much sound unless you enter a fight and EVEN THEN there's no battle music to submerge you in it. Also, besides quests I didn't see much else to do. . . Better level up!! Since there's not much else to do!  The other issue I found was that I made a character and DID the tutorial and leveled to almost level 10 in one night (which isn't difficult trust me, there's plenty of enemies). I quit the game EXPECTING IT SAVED PROGRESS that I could come back to, but INSTEAD when I reopened the game it's as if my character or rogress EXISTED in the first place. I even used the same character names and everything! So, I had to redo the entire tutorial and everything. Yes because that's my favourite part of an MMO. . . If I even open the game again and my character was deleted once more I can gaurantee that I will be furious. There's no ""save"" option or is it just ever so hidden away that I can't locate it. . ?Anyways, to put it simply:Character design - HighGraphics - HighGameplay - Medium to lowOverall - an OK game, if you need to pass time.

												At first I thought this was just going to be one of those bad MMOs you find. But, I was completely wrong. I'm sorta glad my friend bugged me into downloading this game now. I mean, I'm not a pro at it or anything. But the game is actually really really fun. You actually have to work at your goal. Which I really like. Though some of the players can be quite immature and you'll have a few of those nubes that will spam their emotes, and you'll find a few (and weird) bugs here and there in the game. And the admins could try and get rid of some of the lag. Other than that I don't see too much of a problem with the game. That being said I rate this game 8/10. Probably the first MMO I actually enjoyed.			"

												* CaveatsFirst of all, the caveats.  If you can't handle these, don't bother:** Partial pay-to-winBonus XP and loot abound alongside otherwise-unatainable items for those who open their wallet.  I wouldn't call it a true pay-to-play since it's entirely possible to compete with people who pay, but it will take significantly more effort on your end.  The items may even make sense in some cases if they're cheap enough, but I would never recommend to anyone the booster pack or paying continuous fees for the new hero system  It's preposterous unless you have far too much money and nothing better to do with it.** SlowTactical, turn-based combat that gives everyone 30 seconds to make their move.  With up to twelve players per battle (6 players per team PvP), there can be something of a wait until your turn.  For me, this is an advantage since I can plan out my approach more carefully, or even do other things while playing (the game makes a distinct sound when it's your turn), but people who prefer action will find it a bit troublesome.** ConfusedWakfu sometimes wants to straddle the line between single player and MMO.  The scenes when following the main questline definitely try to feel like you're playing through a single player RPG, and those other players with you are all extras.  You, yes, you are the hero of prophecy, and it is your task alone to defeat Ogrest.  It's a neat approach, but the disconnect is sometimes a bit much.** TrollsDon't like being randomly killed by someome three times your level?  Might not be your game.  The only way to completely opt out of PvP is to stay in Astrub, where you'll never be able to level far.  Honestly, this doesn't happen often.  Once every couple months or so, it seems to happen to me.  The consequences of losing are pretty miniscule -- You reappear at your phoenix and there's a negative status effect attached to you for three minutes.  My suggestion is generally to ignore them because of this, but some people have strong emotional reactions to this, so they should be aware.** PerformanceMy laptop is hardly top of the line, but it plays a number of my games with no problem.  It doesn't even slow down much on Minecraft most of the time, and we know how badly that was coded.  Why, then, does this 2d game sometimes completely tank in framerate even when the graphics settings are at the minimum?  Why can it then run quite well sometimes with the graphics set to max?  There's a wide variation possible based on what's happening at the time, both visually (there was a problem with the steam/smoke effect a few months ago that brought both machines I used Intel cards on to their knees, while my significantly older Radeon didn't suffer at all) and in terms of action (beginning and ending battles, loading areas, players suddenly logging in, etc. can sometimes leave Wakfu unresponsive for seconds on my laptop), so if your machine is fairly weak, prepare for occasional input or display lag.** DocumentationMy goodness.  There are tutorial panels that come up occasionally to try to tech you what's going on.  Some of them are massively outdated, some aren't descriptive enough to be much help, some come up at bad times and block your view, or even mouse (Though most can be dismissed with a click, I encountered one that could not.), at awkward times.  Frequently, the best option is to ask someone.* The restNow, on to the good stuff:** Class selectionThere are a variety of classes that can represent a significant range in play styles.  The classes I love the most aren't neccessarily liked by my friends as I do not always like theirs, which I generally take to be a good thing on variety.  Even within classes, there are a surprising number of variants available based on the spells you choose to bring to battle and where you spent your points when leveling.  There are some respec opportunities available for free (as well as one for cash and one that requires you to collect a rather shocking amount of items), and it's relatively easy to level a character once you learn where to go and what to kill (so you can even discard a character and redo it all if you don't feel it's worth earning a respec).** Fun combat systemIt's not the best system I've ever seen (Makai Kingdom forever, man!), but the combat system is remarkably nice.  With the recent update, you are limited in the number of spells/abilities you can bring to battle.  This has significantly hampered one of my characters, who was a staunch generalist, but it has helped refine a few others.  The spells, active abilities, passive abilities, and attributes of your character are genuinely brought to life by a combat system that effectively allows you to translate your choices during character growth into sometimes novel and interesting results in combat.  It then goes further by offering additional challenges in combat that you can complete for bonus XP and items.  If you decide to go along with it, these can sometimes make a battle much more interesting.  Even enemies notably weaker than you can get complicated when you refuse to give up on any of the challenges, which can be a delightful way to keep things interesting when you need to gather items dropped by weak enemies.** GraphicsThe anime-style graphics are generally well done, with good customization for your character's appearance (Your equipment appears on your character, allowing for great flexibility in appearance if you're not too worried about having great equipment, or you can use costumes to hide it and choose freely.) and relatively fluid animation that feels quite right when put together.** StoryThe story itself is pretty generic, but it's realized in a remarkably nice universe with solid backstory and a wide varity of interesting characters.  Suffice it to say the world has a great feel to it.** CommunityYeah, I mentioned trolls earlier.  They definitely exist, and there's no real way to control or contain them implemented.  They're a small portion of the population, though.  Some of the conversations and interactions between players are hilarious or intriguing, there's a wide variety of emotes to unlock, and even text smilies are brought to life with the vizage  of your character doing the expression above your head.  There's plenty of people to talk with, and sometimes random people just feel like inviting you to join their group.  Being an introvert myself, I was rather cautious at first, but I've grown rather fond of people randomly inviting me to go stomp through a dungeon or two with them, or to do a bit of this or that quest line with them.  It's really rather fun.** TypesA bit of a note, the options available to players are a bit more vaired and detailed then Healer, Tank, DPS.  Obviously, there will be damage specialists sometimes, but they can specialize on distance or close combat if they can afford to sacrifice the other, there will also be those who specialize on moving allies or enemies to different spaces in the field to maximize the advantage for their side, characters who can use a great number of status effects on friend and foe alike, characters that place blockages on the field to keep enemies where you want them or who scatter automated turrets or summoned allies across the field to win with sheer numbers...  If you're expecting battle to always be straightforward, you're in for a surprise.* ConclusionWhile I hate some of the free-to-play nonsense, and I mourn the great potential the hero system had before it became the rent-a-slot deal it is, I have a great deal of respect for the effort and thought that has shaped this game into the remarkable thing it currently is.  I enjoy Wakfu a lot, and many of my fellow fans of tactical turn-based combat will likely come to the same conclusion should they give it a long enough try.  I wholeheartedly recommend Wakfu to those who enjoy a good turn-based tactical fight.			"

												Hey, look, it's Wakfu! Played only tutorial stage, didn't experience full game as I saw the game costs lots of storage space on my hard drive.Pros:- Good storyline.- Many character classes to choose from (aside from Disembodied or something whatever it is called)Cons:- Weighs too much on my hard drive.No conclusion because the review may get updated.

												Ever played Final Fantasy Tactics? Or how about Disgaea? Anyways this game is a turnbased tactical rpg with a cute appearance. makes me feel like im playing something magical girl themed with the large amount of cuteness to the characters and environment. the only flaw in this game is that it has a nasty and overly convoluted metagame of sorts that takes the fun away, luckilly its suppose to be easy to reallocate points and other stuff from what ive heard recently so it's not a problem.This is the most important thing i can say about this game. This is one of the few GOOD mmorpgs that work on linux. I can't emphasise enough how there's a lack of mmorpg games for linux and the ones that are available for linux rarely work or are any good. Just the other day i decided to download a different mmo called champions of reginum and i couldnt even register an account. so yea Wakfu is the only mmorpg that i have installed and functioning correctly on linux.

												This game is a fantastic amount of fun, even compared to many other tripple-A titles. It has a way of easing you into the gameplay and system that fealt like the right ammount of hand-holding and freedom to make mistakes. I do understand that Wakfu or it's parent game Dofus are not for everyone. It being on the turn based and tactical side of MMO's it does take the right fit for a gamer to enjoy. That being said however if you are new to turn based tactical RPG's and want to give them a try, this game will not let you down. It can work as an excellent introduction into the genre, and the community in this game has proven time and time again to be very welcoming to newcomers, and you will get every bit of assistance you could ask for.All things being equal, I would highly recommend this game to everyone who enjoys this genre of game and my personal overall score of this game would be around 8.5/10The flaws are few and not wanting to repeat what my fellow reviewers have said I will make a refrence a particular reviewer for his/her hard work and broad grasp of the game. Having read through the majority of the reviews the one I do most agree with is Myrtæth's.Myrtæth gives a fairly informative and detailed review of the game.

												Wakfu is an interesting game.Firstly, I always misread it as ""waifu"". Secondly it's one of *those* MMOs. By which I mean, it's great fun, but you probably need to go in with some friendsThe game features turn-based combat (alike FF:Tactics) and varying professions in which to craft weapons and armour. There are 13 classes with a variety of appearances and skillsets for every player. Overall a very robust and interesting game. But I must implore you to bring a mate - the game unfortunately lacks a certain factor without a few friends to joke with along the way.			"

												The moment I entered this game only one thought was in my mind - Bastion! :DIn reality, it looks a lot like Bastion, but the gameplay is very different - the battle system is turn based and the movement is click-to-move. The gameplay is nice, the graphics is very good and colorful, which is a huge bonus for me (I like a lot of color in games).Quests are interesting and the NPC's text is hilarious and very smart. It's a nice game, unique in it's own way and definitely worth you time (and it does use a lot of your time, once you get your hands on it it will be very hard to logout of this little gem).I'd recommend this game to anyone who likes turn-based rpgs or colors in games, like I do :)8.5/10			"

It's worth a try since it's free to play and I didn't encounter any ""paytowin"" aspect.short summary: -*cute -*funny -*kinda complicated on start.-* Turn based combat system.______If you expect immersion like in Wow this game isn't for you since it's kinda small in general with 4 nations plenty of areas, isles & co but focuses on social aspects.Also should you bringt atleast 1 friend with you into this game because it might get boring otherwise. Of course you're free to join one of those plenty guilds but they are mainly just inviting players for their ""guild-points"" they recieve for each fight you win ^^			"

												It's a shame that you don't see much turn-based combat in MMOs anymore, especially when it's done so well, like in Wakfu. Really, there's a lot of great mechanics in the game that are super unique and fun to play around with, but the game is pretty empty sometimes and there's no real questline structure past the early areas. You're kind of just released into the world to grind, and while the combat is unique, it's really personal preference as to how fun it is. Overall, the most innovative MMO I've ever played, though innovative doesn't necessarily mean outstanding.			"

												Wakfu is a tactical MMORPG unlike any other MMO except for its prequel, Dofus.  It has play style similar to Final Fantasy Tactics where combat takes place in a grid. The character classes (15 of them) in Wakfu (and Dofus) have unique play styles and the classes themselves can be played many different ways.The spells have a variety of rules, and positioning makes a big factor in damage dealt/recieved.The art in this game is very charming.  It's very pleasing to just look at the content in the game.The music is very pleasing as well.  All from playful, cheery music to serious, blood-pumping music.There is a lot of humor in this game and a lot of funny parodies.  A lot of naughty references are in the game too, but are subtle enough that kids wouldn't (or shouldn't) understand.Of course, playing in a team with others is a lot of fun (and often necessary for tackling dungeons of your lvl).  Being in a guild & the in-game group finder tool helps with playing with others to enjoy the game better.Players can also make an impact on the environment.  Most mobs can be planted to have them spawn, and they can also be killed enough to have very little to no population in the area (sometimes ghost forms appear when that happens). Flowers, Trees, and crops can also be planted in the world and are shared with others, and they can also be completely harvested with none left for others.  Making certain plant/mob population too high or too low or just right can affect area bonuses and nation bonuses.  One nation (Riktus) benefits from other nations having their bonuses ruined.The environment, plus nation laws and wars set by a governor voted by its citizens (who then can appoint other people to different positions in government), makes for interesting experiences in the world.I've been playing this game for a long time (since open beta Jan 2012).  It's enjoyable and I recommend it.			"

												This is my experience of finding Wakfu.I really love a legendary game Final Fantasy, all of them. but the most I personally like, is the tactic. I played it on every game station it has. Started on PSX, then Lion War on PSP came out, I even installed emulator so i can play on my phone. Thats how much i Loved it. The Grid-Based battle. The Story written. The Plot. The Character classical grinding process. The Class complexity and lots of skills each of them have.  The Game was simply.. perfect.Until I reach a point where I want to explore another great game with same criteria. I try a lot of games, not very satisfying. Sometime the battle was not good, the story not interesting, too easy. it always lack of something, that tend to makes me stop playing. ""Maybe  FFT is the best game after all."" Thats exactly my thought at the time.Then, I found Wakfu.It was an RPG. MMO at its best. Grid-Based Battle, and Free roaming. Various Character you could choose to play with and the complexity of each character skills, is remarkable. It has profession system, side quest like. A Guild, Nation, Outlaw, and environmental system. Also, It has many secret too. I found several secret places that even havent used. I saves several and upload on my profile. It has so many element that hasnt been implemented, yet the game was this much interesting.Long story short, this game is worth your time.			"

												I really want to like this game.  I mean I REALLY want to like it.  There are a few things preventing me from giving my full life to this game.-Pros--Great design and look-Unique classes-Interesting skills (more on this later)-If you like tactical RPGs and MMOs then this is probably for you.-Cons--VERY complicated for a beginner to get into. (this seems to be a theme)-Not very beginner friendly, most things have to be explained by long-time players within the game.-Skills are horribly explained, skill buffs/beduffs are explained in pop-ups within pop-ups within pop-ups at times.-Very convoluted texts and quests.-Some things such as haven bags, setting a location, and professions aren't explained very well at all.-Unexplained reasoning for actions having to be taken by the player, such as HAVING to have a respec at lvl 10 or you cannot fight anything in the game, ever.  If this is a bug of some kind, it should be stated as such by the developer.  Otherwise, it's quite jarring to suddenly realize you can no longer battle anything in the game.Again, this game is great and has wonderful depth to the classes and skill sets, but the convoluted execution of it all does not create a well-thoughtout package for beginners.  The tutorial in the beginning leaves much to be desired and only prepares the player for the battles.  Everything else in the game has to be found out, missed, or learned through other longtime players in the game.I still recommend trying this game out and see if you are willing to spend the time necessary to learn all of what it has to offer.  I'm still learning as I go, gaining a little bit more knowledge as time goes on through other players.  It's a slow going process but it might pay off in the depth and fun to be had.			"

												If you like Final Fantasy Tactics (PSX) and Dungeons and Dragons. Then YES! this game is for you.I've been browsing and testing alot of free to play games on steam now for a year now and I've finally came across Wakfu. At first I thought ""O.K... now let see what this game has before i uninstall it and move on to the next game."" and holy sh!t guys. I've been hooked.Now this game isn't perfect, but no game is without it's flaws.Combat, when paired correctly with your LV, is tough. Very good challenge.There are no ""in-combat"" consumable items, so no potion chug'n. No NPC's you can sell your junk to, all currency is player based. Player to Player trading help build teams and connections.Almost every item is a crafting material, even your equipment. Meaning most of your items can be upgraded to better teirs of equipment. However you need the the crafting skill.You are not limited in crafting, so you can make everything in the game. Most game rules are controlled by the players, that sound a bit confusing but once you understand how the game works and it's politics. You can really do some crazy things. This world is digitally alive.If you're trying this game out for the first time. Play until LV.10 and decide if this is worth your time. And try multiple classes. Now I'll admit that this game is a grinder. There are times when I thought or said, ""F**K THIS SH!T, I'm sick of killing these damn chicken peacock things."" but still, it was so worth it when I collected all the items and made some sweet armor. Trust me the grind is worth it, and this game is worth your time. ""just with i had more time to play... (T_T) "

												I have over 100 hours sunk into this game so I feel that I can properly review this game, if you do not want to read the whole review then scroll to the bottom to see the pro's and con's, here we go.   Wakfu Is a turn based strategy anime MMO RPG (a mouth full I know) by Ankama. This game originated from France, something pretty rare to come from them, it also has a anime that is subbed and dubbed in English on Netflix. The gameplay is something new and unique to this style of game, it takes concentration and planing in battle, should you use up all the points to move in close and unleash a flurry of attack or stay back and chip away at you enemy is up to you and your class. This system makes PvP a real challenge, most classes can far well in PvP due to the way you can build your class, all classes have at least some ranged spells, even those up close types.   Oh boy the classes, one of the best things about this game next to the combat. There are 17 unique classes that all have there own style of play, some examples are the Cra, your run of the mill pew pew archers, they have accses to these things called beacons, which they can use 3 different elementle attacks on the beacon which will have different affects depending on the element (Air, Fire, Earth). Another good example is the Sram, this class is all about assassination, going invisable and closing the gap behind there prey, also they use giant scythes, whats not to love.   The community of this game is hit and miss, you will have some people that are nice and try to help you and some who spam you with guild invites because they just want more guild points. The big areas where people gather are hot spots for spam bots trying to get you to go buy accounts and that junk, just put those people on your ignore list, the starting area seems to have some pretty chill people but if you are new or do not like trash talkers DO NOT go to The Temple of Scriptures. The Temple mostly has high level people that challenge eachother to PvP at the base of the steps, after sitting there for an hour to listen in on people all they do is call eachother homophobic slurs and offensive names, unfortunately you will have to come here once a day for a quest and it is also the best place to do high level gear trading due to all the high level people hanging around there.   Are you one of those ""save the earth"" people? Well guess what, this game has its own eco-system that you, the player, have control over. Do you wanna make a jungle? Go right ahead. Wanna destroy another nations resorces and laugh as they can't craft anything? Well you can, you sadistic monster.    Ever wanted to be a baker, a chef, or even a talor, making cute dresses for your in game wifu? Welp get to grinding that job XP, or run for governer of a nation and have everyone look up to you as a god. Of corse if you don't want to rule a whole nation you can always run for Vice governer, or Head of the Guard, and even control the weather of the nation, if you are having a bad day, flood your lands with rain. PROS-  +Has unique gamplay   +Can run on most systems  +Has a plethora of classes   +Not pay to play at all   +Has its own in game eco-system   +Prices in store seem really far   +Has its own government   +Anime Wifus-------------------------------------------------CONS-  -Small player base  -Players can leave a sour tatse in your mouth  -Takes a lot of grinding   -Can be boring playing alone  -Have to redeem all DLC code through Ankam's website  -Graphics are nothing special  -Fixed cammera can make fighting very difficult  In the end, despite its flaws I really enjoy this game, and would highly recomend it to all my friends			"

												Wakfu is a tactical turn based rpg successor of the Ankama game named Dofus. The world is the same in both games, but the time and story have a huge leap, while you have almost all the same classes, the skills each one have is different in every one of them. But not different in sense that is only an upgrade, it's more about a different system without touching the gameplay itself, which is quite frankly almost the same. Like j-rpgs and korean rpgs, wakfu is a game where you gonna need to grind a lot in order to get strong, craft, obtain powerful gears. that could bother some players that wish to have more action. well in that case this game is not for you. Also it's a teamwork game, so party, groups, friends, guild is a must. Of course you can play solo, but you will need multiple accounts to fulfil your party.The wakfu art is very cartoony and charming, I really enjoy the draws since Dofus, the french guys really got nice artists. Heck they even did an animation with tons of episodes , it's interesting , cool and a great addition to the game story and vision on the world of the twelve.Unlike dofus in wakfu you don't have to be a subscriber in order to play, But obviously if u p2p you have advantages suck as + 30% exp and drop bonuses. Howeever the game isn't p2w so no worries about that, every player can have the same stuff that someone that paid have. Most of stuff are cosmetics or consumables.Altought is not all rainbows and sunshines, the game currently have a few bugs that has to be fixed. The devs are kind enought to give a compensation, but some stuff may still bother some players. Keep that in mind if you gonna play. See you in the world of the twelve !			"

												Wakfu is a turn based mmorpg with a cute anime-like style. The combat system is similar to final fantasy tactics and players are able to shape the the environment. But there are not a lot of quests that will tell you what to do and lead you the way, it's more of a sandbox game where you decide what to do and where to go.If you prefer quests from Lv. 1 to XXX this game will not appeal to you.Main Quests:When you create your character you will get your first quest chain until like Lv. 12-15.I think the next is around Lv. 35 to get your first mount.The next one is at Lv. 50Then there is another one around 90~100...As you can see, there is alot of spare time between those main quests. So, if you don't like to explore the world yourself, you will be stuck after each quest chain ends.Classes and SpellsThere are 16 classes to choose from, each once has its unique fighting style. These are no archetype classes you'd normally expect. Except like 3 classes which are similar to Warrior, Archer and Assassin. But you probably won't know which one is the warrior, if you see them, they are more like a mix of a Barbarian, a Warrior and an idiot (The game calls them stupid, not me I swear). There are also Faries, Bamboo-Milkoholics, Machosists, Robots, Human-Plants, Gambling Cats, old greedy Farts, Terrorists and a few more...But there is no higher class change at a higher level or something like that. You will be stronger when you level up your Class abilities and elemental spells.There are 4 Elements: Fire, Water, Earth, Air. All Spells in the game are categorized in one of them.Each class has access to 3 Elements, 5 spells for each Element.Each class also has 10 Class specific supportive abilities. 5 of them are active spells, the other 5 are passives.What are the elements for? Everything has Elemental Damage and Resistance. If you have a lot of Fire Damage, your fire spells will deal more damage, if the target you attack has a lot of fire resistance, you will deal less damage with your fire spells.Elemental damages can go over 100% to infinite. Elemental resistance has a maximum of 100%(which would block 100% damage of that element), but you cannot reach that. I have about 60% resistance at Lv. 105. So you can at least reach that :)For your first 20% resist in each element you will need 100 points in resist, which are 5 points for each % resist. After that it will slightly increase the amount needed for each % resist.LevelingThe best way to level up your character is probably by doing dungeon runs. You get a wisdom bonus in there, which increases exp gained. 20 Wisdom = 20% more exp after the fight. To enter a dungeon, you will need the corresponding key, which are usually not too hard to get. If you know what monsters are inside the dungeon, kill the same monsters outside of the dungeon, they will drop it sooner or later. You can also craft keys by using the items those monsters drop. Usually its 7x Item X.There are also daily quests in each zone of the world, which tells you bring 10 items of the monsters that are lurking around. If you collect 20, you don't need to hunt them tomorrow, just accept and finish the quest immediately. Those quests give you a decent amount of exp.I think in all zones except the first one in each nation are also timed events with a small variety of quests. There are either monsters appearing, or other random stuff you have to interact with before the time runs out. Those are highlighted in green if you see them while the event is ongoing. There is a new event every 10-15 minutes I think and the exp is also decent if it's around your level.There is a lot more to talk about this game but if I tried to explain every detail I know, I would need 2+ hours to write this review. I will try to end this with a short Pro and Con.PROS+ High Variety of Classes (16 Classes)+ 10+1 Crafting Professions (the extra profession can't be leveled. you can create in game money called Kama with it, if you have the materials)+ 6 Gathering Professions+ Battles get more challenging at later levels (monsters gain passives, you can't always ignore to win battles)+ You have your own home, which is a bag and is accesible from almost everywhere (You can put furnite in it, plant stuff and there is an item storage)+ A lot of costumes for customization. Also everything you wear, besides the belt, can be seen on your character, haven't seen that in many 2D games.+ If you don't have friends, you can have 2 Sidekicks fighting by your side.+ Shape the world, Kill monsters, replant them, cut trees and flowers and plant them where you want em, but be careful, in the open world everyone has access to this.CONS- Bugs, Glitches. The longer you play, the more you will find. Some are just minor bugs that don't matter much, others are killing you in battle. The worst battle bug I know is that you can't do anything for 1 round. I have that once in maybe 2 weeks. The friend I play with has it every 25-30 battles. I guess, it depends on your computer.- lack of guidelines- Most crafting professions don't feel satisfying to level (only a few things you can craft are better than hunting equip)- Some gathering professions are really slow and boring to level (Ex.: Trapper, most stuff you collect from monsters to level up will be thrown away to save item slots)I play and like this game because the combat is fun and challenging to me. In an even battle, every wrong step you take, might cost you or your party members life. The special effects are also pretty well done. If some bugs and glitches scare you away, you won't be playing for long. Give it a try if you like most of the things I have mentioned about Wakfu. If the bugs you find don't affect your gameplay experience too much, you will enjoy it.			"

												short version:think final fantasy tactics mixed with a bit of harvest moon (or....augh....farmville.....we dont have long wait times though) and a dash of borderlands comedy into a sandbox MMORPG.long version:1.its a turn based MMORPG (all capitals btw,because they REALLY focus on that),there is a good community,and a ♥♥♥♥ ton of classes to choose from,and they're pretty non tradisional,except some ofc.2.while not as hard as fire emblem,you might need to think of a plan sometimes,like if placing a trap on the floor to finish off an enemy while reseulting to friendly fire (did i mention friendly fire is on?yeah,have fun trolling),3.No friends or no one to join to help you fight?No problem,they have a sidekick system (although i prefer to call them minions)basicly they're like those characters in turn based RPGs that you can control,they start at level 1 when you get them,so dont be surprised if they have less health,although some have skills unique to them,which can be advantage,you mostly need to get to the cash shop for them,which i hate doing,it is pretty nice of them to give you a free minion (cant help calling them that) after a quest and a trial one every now and then4.there is a ecosystem....system built into the game,you can replant and harvest some crops/trees and animals(?),if the ecosystem reaches a certain threshold,you get a bonus.5.professions,there are alot of professions you can chose,mind you professions are different from classes,classes are MOSTLY combat base,while profession is can become a side income or help you in combat by either making food for buffs,close range weapons,AoE weapons (yes there are AoE weapons) or armor,or just a plain hobby,and these professions arent limited to crafting weapons,food or armor,they can also become a handyman or lumberjack or hell,a fisherman,most professions can help each other,so having other poeple in different professions help.and all those stuff you can get into in a matter of hours,hell i havent joined a guild or faction/nationpros and conspros:1.free to play2.an ACTUAL turn based MMORPG thats good3.ecosystem4.professions5.nation (joining certain nations will make you their enemies,which is a nice lore effect)6.active community7.secrets within the game,like a portal giving you a cape somewhere in the beginner area (hint:its at the lower right corner of the map,also when you get it,read the description)cons:1.with everyone F2P...there are always microtransactions....although its not as bad as others,its still there,they do give you a free sidekick and a mount via quests and 5 character slots....im looking at you realm of the mad god2.its a birds eye view game,and when you start at the beginner town,its pretty hard to get a grasp of whats what and whos who,like if this chocobo thing does anything or this statue have any fuctional purpose,or maybe if this board will lead me to the market3.speaking of grasping,they dont really teach you what is what and where,hell i had a friend tell me the minimap pops out via shift+m,and best thing is they dont tell you how to use the market or what it looks like4.since you have a ecosystem to run,you need to watch what you kill and what you harvest,make sure to replant EVERYTHING you kill just to be safe5.you REALLY need to read stuff,like badly,if you dont,you might not learn what to do or get the humor of it,its not as bad as dark souls lore being hidden in item descriptions though6.when you finish the tutorial,you're probably gonna exited to chose your class,the thing what i hate about choosing classes IN GAME (you can probably wiki them for better description) is they're vague,you might THINK that feca's shield is a tank but nope,its a (ranged) buffer and trapperoverall it takes a little learning and adjusting to the game,and if you can do that,you'll start having fun,plus it is a free to play game with optional cash shopmy review:8/10give it a gotakes a few hours of adjusting to the game thoalso read item descriptions,you wont regret it			"

If you like strategy, turn based fighting, alot of variation in how to build your hero, skills, items,spell configuration and so on, well you will love this game.- Graphic 9/10   At some angles in fights, it feels like the view is blocked by a building, object in somekind of wrong way, other than that, VERY NICE.- Overall feeling 10/10- Music 10/10- Gameplay 10/10- Questing 9/10  = needs more quests, - Community 8/10 = reason why not more = there are some heros that just stand and spawn ""buy gold from store"" messages and GM`S not directly bannig those IP´s are unfair against everyone enjoying game.Now, why I don´t give even lower score = theres not alot of them and you can put them to your ignore list and that goes for their whole account and not just character.- SUpport 7/10 ,  Outside game = great INside game ? hmm, haven´t really noticed if there is any and WHY ARE THEY NOT REACTING TO SPAM HEROES?- All else in game = 10/10 and theres alot alot alot alot , to write about, so I rather play and waste time with writing of all that works.Just go into game, put like 20 hours and after that, seriasly  your eather stuck for life or it´s not for you.

So support sucks and I only cover the beginning only.The artstyle is ok, but the tutorials are hardly ever tutorials, most of mechanics and the interface are not taught. Being a first time MMORPG player I hardly can grasp anything at all. The checkpoints and objectives are not really that noticeable in the interface and you have go into some places and get back out to let the waypoint refreshed.If you are well verse in the 2D MMORPG games, you can go and try.

												Charming aesthetics. Reminds me of a more modern Ragnarok Online and Final Fantasy Tactics. Wide variety of classes to fit multiple playstyles and you get free respecs at levels 30 and 80. Combat is turn-based, so that might not be everyone's cup of tea.I played this once before two years ago, it was terribly terribly grindy. Now, they've lessened that grind just enough to make it more enjoyable. Leveling crafting is still rather grindy, and good luck finding beanstalks.Community definitely needs more players, however, and it can be hard to find up-to-date information on something as the game has gone through many changes over time. More players can certainly help this, though, so I'm trying to spread the word!			"

												TL;DR- Great Tactics/MMO game. You should give this amazing, under-rated game a shot. Wakfu is an amazing game that doesn't get enough credit. It has been (mostly) improved by the most resent major update. (9/9/2014) The art and animations in this game are beautiful, the music isn't bad, and the new revamped level up system makes the game much more accessible, and actually give you a feeling of progression over the old stat system. If you like Tactic games and MMOs I don't see how you would not enjoy this game. There are two free and effortless character respecs. The first is given at level 30, when you have all of the skills unlocked and plenty of time to try them all out, and another at 80, when you have a much better understanding of the game. Aside from the two respecs given you can do a quest to respec, or buy a respec from the cash shop, to save time.There are many classes to choose from, and they are all very different from each other. You have the more basic classes, such as the Iop, who is just a front line warroir. Then you have the much more complex classes like Xelor, whos spells have alternating effects every turn. On top of that each class can be played multiple ways. No matter what class you are looking for Wakfu will have a character for you. The new starter zone/quests are mostly enjoyable. The starter quests explain a bit more, and reward with more items that you weren't introduced to at all before, such as; Weapons/Armor, Haven Bag Decorations, Shop Stalls. Inventory Bags, and a Pet. HOWEVER. The quests themselves are ... not very fun. Its not that they are bad, or poorly done, but they do not fit into this game. A sliding block puzzle is great, but not in a turn based tactics game. The other quest that doesn't fit uses silly context to teach you the mechanics to a (boss?) fight that you have to do right after... It would have been much more enjoyable to just FIGHT something. There is a daily quest NPC on every map that is simply collect X from Y and bring them to me. Much less annoying. Although nothing original there, if you are fighting the monsters to level anyway, it is a welcome bonus to exp. I have not tried the new ""Mercenary"" quests, so I cant give a review on those. Dungeons are fun (I enjoy them at least) and there is no lack of them. The new token system means you wont run a dungeon 20 times and still not get the drop you were looking for. On top of this, any item from the token machines is account bound, so you can't flood the market with items you got from boss tokens. At the start of the game Dungeons and boss fights are simple and straightforward, the further you get into the game the more challenging and complex dungeons become. PVP has had more content added in the recent update, bringing PVP gear and rewards. Much more active PVP with the nation vs nation, and limited alliances between nations. If you do not have PVP turned on the only way someone can attack you is through the PK system, witch was already in the game. The level range to attack other players with PVP turned on is much too high right now, at 50 levels apart. I have high hopes that they will lower this range to 20, at the most. I believe for that to happen we would have to see a population increase. The Ecosystem ... system, is both fun, and frustrating. On any given map there are values of monsters and resources that should be on the map, within your nations you gain points by putting said resources within these ranges. While the ecosystem is in balance, you will also enjoy a buff on that map. The Riktus clan gains bonuses by destroying this balance, so this also fuels PVP. The frustrating aspect of this is that little to no players seem to care about the ecosystems, the problem with that is that monster populations are a part of these. I have gone to maps with monsters nearly extinct because no one is repopulating them. An easy process through gathering from said monsters, and simply using the gathered material on an empty cell on the map. I believe the reason behind this is no one really want to level the professions used to manage these things. As much as I would love to see a population increase I fear it will bring mass extinctions to the beginning areas of the game, so please, at least repopulate the monsters.			"

												Alright before anyone complains about my time, I played this during its closed beta period and I have the costume and title to prove that.Now:wakfu is pretty interesting for a mmo as it takes turn based strategy to the next level by making you have to think ahead to compete with others.For Example: I play a xelor, which is one of the least player friendly classes you can play. To use this class properly you have to understand how to use the dial ability that comes with the race/class. Proper use of it will lead to either your victory or imminent downfall.Now for those of you who are free to play gamers: Fair warning, I'm not sure if this game still uses its membership policy or not for minting kamas and using your factions land. So if it does, you are only really going to be able to affect the eco-system of the starter region, everywhere else you will need membership to modify. If it does not do that anymore than thank god and good riddens. Now go out there and train your skills..... And thats all I got for this review...			"

												Only played for 7 hours, and didn't get far in the game. Just one character at lvl 14.I liked this game and still plan on playing it. It's pretty fun, and I don't even like anime MMOs to be honest. The choices and strategy is what caught my eye, and it's easy. So that's a bonus.Kind of annoying that you absolutely need to do the tutorial every single time you make a new character, because if you don't, you do not get skill points and the level you were in the tutorial map. If you decide to skip the tutorial, it puts you into the online world with no skill points to spend, and you're level 1, and all the ""low level"" creatures are level 5 or higher.So skipping the tutorial is an absolutely stupid idea, and a waste of time. Because it traps you in the house and will not let you leave. So you have to delete that character and do the tutorial. It shouldn't let you skip it if it just traps you inside of a house and never lets you decide if you want to go back and do the tutorial or actually leave the house. You're just stuck there until you decide to redo everything. Which is the most pointless option they give you. Long story short, DON'T SKIP THE TUTORIAL. It's an absolute waste of time and your character will be useless afterwards.Also the compass sometimes does not track my missions. It will for a short time, then it vanishes without explination. I'm talking about the above ground quests, not the quests underground. It get's really irritating having to keep pulling up the stupid quest thing and  click the compass ""Follow"" button every single time. I'm still trying to figure out how I sell my garbage items to get money. Where is the NPC that just buys all your crap items? Or do I have to drop everything on the ground. Some things aren't explained in the game, and you have to figure it out for yourself most of the time.			"

												You've already played this game twice. The first time was when the game was still under Squarenix's publication (They later relinquished it due to Ankama's lack of management). You left it once the game left beta and it created one mistake after the next. The second was when everyone flocked to the SEA servers which were free to play, unlike the American one's monthly fee for a laggy java game. You quit a second time after you calculated it would take you months of clicking on rocks to get your mining level to where you want it to be.Now you want to try it again. Oh, maybe it will be better. Maybe it will be more fun. While you're betting on that, Ankama is betting on you falling into the same trap for the third time. Just go watch the anime if you want your French hips so badly.			"

												A fun MMO that has a different playstyle than any other MMOs I have played. Turn based, although it is quite grindy. Crafting is useful though be prepared to also grind for materials, and have professions require mats from different professions. There is government and PvP for those that like that.Interesting storyline and there are quests to be had. I've played since its beta and it has come a long way, mostly for the better I feel. Cash shop has mostly cosmetic purchases, and while free to play there are benefits for being a subscriber/premium member.

												Most of the time went to troubleshoot this game until it finally got fixed so I managed to play a few small hours and then stopped. So support sucks and I only cover the beginning only.The artstyle is ok, but the tutorials are hardly ever tutorials, most of mechanics and the interface are not taught. Being a first time MMORPG player I hardly can grasp anything at all. The checkpoints and objectives are not really that noticeable in the interface and you have go into some places and get back out to let the waypoint refreshed.If you are well verse in the 2D MMORPG games, you can go and try. For first time beginners, just stay away.			"

												A very beautiful and unique take on MMOs. The strategic turn based combat is very well done, the monsters, skills and spells look good and its a world I keep going back to. Like any MMO, it will take you some time to level, but the game gives you a companion that makes levelling a lot quicker than it otherwise would be. Im more than happy with the pace of levelling and you get a level every couple minutes if you are in level appropriate areas.The only thing that frustrates me is that the game has recently been updated to be a lot better and more friendly to players, but the player wikis have not been updated to reflect this. Mob levels have changed, some locations have been moved about, and I have found myself directed to places that no longer have the item i require once or twice. But the exploration aspect is a very big plus.Overall, an amazing game. Like it so far (180+ hours as I write this) and will udpate if my feelings change			"

												TL;DR- Great Tactics/MMO game. You should give this amazing, under-rated game a shot. Wakfu is an amazing game that doesn't get enough credit. It has been (mostly) improved by the most resent major update. (9/9/2014) The art and animations in this game are beautiful, the music isn't bad, and the new revamped level up system makes the game much more accessible, and actually give you a feeling of progression over the old stat system. If you like Tactic games and MMOs I don't see how you would not enjoy this game. There are two free and effortless character respecs. The first is given at level 30, when you have all of the skills unlocked and plenty of time to try them all out, and another at 80, when you have a much better understanding of the game. Aside from the two respecs given you can do a quest to respec, or buy a respec from the cash shop, to save time.There are many classes to choose from, and they are all very different from each other. You have the more basic classes, such as the Iop, who is just a front line warroir. Then you have the much more complex classes like Xelor, whos spells have alternating effects every turn. On top of that each class can be played multiple ways. No matter what class you are looking for Wakfu will have a character for you. The new starter zone/quests are mostly enjoyable. The starter quests explain a bit more, and reward with more items that you weren't introduced to at all before, such as; Weapons/Armor, Haven Bag Decorations, Shop Stalls. Inventory Bags, and a Pet. HOWEVER. The quests themselves are ... not very fun. Its not that they are bad, or poorly done, but they do not fit into this game. A sliding block puzzle is great, but not in a turn based tactics game. The other quest that doesn't fit uses silly context to teach you the mechanics to a (boss?) fight that you have to do right after... It would have been much more enjoyable to just FIGHT something. There is a daily quest NPC on every map that is simply collect X from Y and bring them to me. Much less annoying. Although nothing original there, if you are fighting the monsters to level anyway, it is a welcome bonus to exp. I have not tried the new ""Mercenary"" quests, so I cant give a review on those. Dungeons are fun (I enjoy them at least) and there is no lack of them. The new token system means you wont run a dungeon 20 times and still not get the drop you were looking for. On top of this, any item from the token machines is account bound, so you can't flood the market with items you got from boss tokens. At the start of the game Dungeons and boss fights are simple and straightforward, the further you get into the game the more challenging and complex dungeons become. PVP has had more content added in the recent update, bringing PVP gear and rewards. Much more active PVP with the nation vs nation, and limited alliances between nations. If you do not have PVP turned on the only way someone can attack you is through the PK system, witch was already in the game. The level range to attack other players with PVP turned on is much too high right now, at 50 levels apart. I have high hopes that they will lower this range to 20, at the most. I believe for that to happen we would have to see a population increase. The Ecosystem ... system, is both fun, and frustrating. On any given map there are values of monsters and resources that should be on the map, within your nations you gain points by putting said resources within these ranges. While the ecosystem is in balance, you will also enjoy a buff on that map. The Riktus clan gains bonuses by destroying this balance, so this also fuels PVP. The frustrating aspect of this is that little to no players seem to care about the ecosystems, the problem with that is that monster populations are a part of these. I have gone to maps with monsters nearly extinct because no one is repopulating them. An easy process through gathering from said monsters, and simply using the gathered material on an empty cell on the map. I believe the reason behind this is no one really want to level the professions used to manage these things. As much as I would love to see a population increase I fear it will bring mass extinctions to the beginning areas of the game, so please, at least repopulate the monsters.			"

												Wakfu is good, That's pretty much all that's. It's a tactical turn based strategy game that is also an mmorpg! Not many mmorpg's are like that. It has it's own unique style of gameplay the world feels alive even though you cant REALLY change it just makes you think you can. The lore is kinda broken a bit, however it still leaves you with the feeling of being able to love the world of Twelve. I have 400+ hours as it stands on the steam version and I have been playing since closed beta..I dont even wanna know how much hours I have in total xDPros:+ Turn based strategy+ Solid Gameplay+ Completely Unique classes+ Huge world with a lot of content+ Not pay to win (big for a lot of people)+ Amazing artstyle (however it may not to others)+ SoundtrackCons:- Small community sometimes hard to find groups (you can fix this by joning this game though!)- Crafting is pretty bland- Very very heavy grind, however the grind doesn't get boring however some people might just not like the grind- It's made by java so it has memory leaks- You cant acess the newest island free to play players can experience the newest content apart from the new area istelf   so in other words lets say the new level cap is 170 you can get to level 170, but you cant go to the new 165-170 area    that was just released leaving you to grind. (can be frustrating but it's not game breaking)  "

Great atmoshere, innovative gameplay, world ruled by the players and ofc since they go to f2p - this is MUST try, or better MUST play game! Since i mentioned the bad sides of Wakfu - it's support! Yeah, great game and devs and support guys tries their best to ruin it. Each update are worse, they did the most insane thing - made great Prison Island and after few months - they remove it ?! WTF ?! Who does that ? You must fix and made better the content u made, Ankama, not to remove it! Other bad thing is - they advertise something good on the cash market - u bought that precious item, and after month or two they change it and U left with worthless piece of trash. The support: well common joke with Wakfu people is ""what support?"" :) So this is it, good game with few negatives ... but it's pretty addictive, so u can handle the bad sides :P Have fun!			"

												Sure, the hours I've put in for Wakfu on Steam so far have been measly, but I've been playing Ankama's games ever since Dofus came out back in 2005. Any avid Wakfu player should know that Dofus is the game that started it all.But I digress. Wakfu is definitely worth your time if you love RPGs. If you don't, well, now's the time to start loving them. Beautiful, artistic, modern graphics combined with addicting gameplay, old school turn-based action, and funny NPCs make Wakfu a blast from the past as well as a next-gen RPG. So go ahead, give it a try, and if you don't like it then you can go back to CS:GO and/or TF2 and leave the rest of us alone.			"

												Although I have been play the game for 2 weeks, but got deeply attracted by its outstanding contents.The “Wakfu” here is not the fantastic French Cartoon, but a MMOSLG game. The game offers many distinctive classes/characters which have 3 different elementals each. People in the game, will never repeat killing stuffs, but also plant something, including mobs. The diverse crafting system will satisfy the most needs of your gears, furniture, keys (for entering dungeons) etc. Different pets/sidekicks offer different passive buffs to enhance your char/team.   Although you can solo most dungeons with your sidekicks, you will still need a community to share the thought about the game. I had joined a friendly guild in Asia server which is called Sacred Feathers. They offer me a really professional suggestion which saved a lot of time/money for me.  I think most ppl in that guild are Chinese but they really friendly, the guys called Mathers and Izayoisakura really helped me a lot, one is providing useful suggestions, another offers power levelling. Its only 2 weeks and I’ve almost hit lvl 60. Awesome!  "

												Great fun game that feels a bit like an anime. Tactical and clever, this game will make you think as you roam the lands. Easy to pick up and simple combat, as it is a tactics based game, this is a great free-to-play game that you can get pulled into. The races double as the class, but this is minor compared to how much thought went into making it all look great. Popular refences to major movies and cartoons can be found, as well as a well thought out crafting/harvesting system that few has ever tried. All and all this is one to get, if only to have something different yet fun.			"

												If you're a fan of Final Fantasy Tactics, and like playing MMORPG games, then this game is for you. Unlike your typical mmorpg game in were half of the time you just need to click on an enemy and watch your character smack it to death, this game actually requires you to use your brain. Its a turn based mmorpg style game in were every (well...not everytime i would say) combat actually requires you to have a strategy as you can't just randomly do stuff and expect it to go your way. It also has a very nice cartoonish/anime-ish type of art style which will remind you (atleast for me though) of the old 2D games that you used to play back in the glory days before 3D games started ruling over the game industry. Did I mention its also F2P? :D Sure, the game has some few bad points, but if you're a fan of turn-based type games and like playing mmorpg games as well, then this, my friend, is the game for you.

												Charming aesthetics. Reminds me of a more modern Ragnarok Online and Final Fantasy Tactics. Wide variety of classes to fit multiple playstyles and you get free respecs at levels 30 and 80. Combat is turn-based, so that might not be everyone's cup of tea.I played this once before two years ago, it was terribly terribly grindy. Now, they've lessened that grind just enough to make it more enjoyable. Leveling crafting is still rather grindy, and good luck finding beanstalks.Community definitely needs more players, however, and it can be hard to find up-to-date information on something as the game has gone through many changes over time. More players can certainly help this, though, so I'm trying to spread the word!			"

Short version: Wakfu is a game I would like to enjoy. The art style is unique and well made turn-based combat is a rare thing to find in any MMO. But there are some glaring issues that can keep you from enjoying the game. Grind being the biggest one.With a good group, however, the game is much more enjoyable. Try to lure in a few of your friends.Good sides:+ Art style is beautiful,+ Combat is, at it's best, very challenging,+ Unique and interesting world with economy ran purely by players.Bad sides:- There is barely any info for new players on what to do. You can call this a sandbox game, but you should definitely explain at least the basics. I was 13 hours into the game and still clueless on so many things,- The Grind. In action filled MMOs I can accept this and even enjoy it, up to a point. But in a turn-based game it becomes so mind-numbingly boring to constantly repeat the same process over and over. Quests are as grindy as they get,- Party tools. Ways to easily find and party up with other players are missing or at least I wasn't informed of any during the first 13 hours. This is a pity as the most challenging fights could be very interesting due to the variety on comboes and tactics available.Overall I can't recommend this unless you happen to have a group of friends to actively play with. Taking on considerably higher level enemies and coming out on top is a great feeling and the fights can be real brain-teasers sometimes. But the game's just too obscure and the progress too slow for those few instances to be worth it.			"

I recommend this game to anybody who wants to play something new but remeber this always know your place.			"

												WAKFU is an interesting type of mmo, a grid based stratagy rpg. It's easily one of the top games of its genre and should be looked at. Just making a North America/ Canada server, from just the French server, the game its opening up.  Using the manga/anime tv series WAKFU, you embark on the story line journey of the World of 12 to climb and defeat Ogrest (an ogre) who pretty much messed up the world and is on this Mount Zinit. Now like most RPG games you choose a class. Here there are 15 (?) very diffrent style, culture, playing styles for the game. Foggernaut, Cra, Scram, Xelor, Huppermage, Elcaflip, Eniripsa, Sacrier, Elitrope, Rogue, Feca, Enutruf, Pandawa, Masqueraider, Sadida, Iop and Osamodas. Now the names are crazy, but everyone brings something new and diffrent to the table. Each class has specific elemental abilities witch is the base of the game. ELEMENTS. Bad guys have strength and weaknesses to the elements and so do you. Each area and boss and creatures all changes by the elements and what is happening in the game....So keep on ur toes. You and can change the elemental happenings by doing certain things in the ecosystem to help, or take advantage of, or find that the one boss will eat you cause fire does nothing to him at this moment. You can even change baddies to extinct or help them out along with your gathering items. Controlling the ecosystem and elements. Thats alot of power... Along with a class you take on a nation to help you politic, merchant, protect and help along against the Ogrest bad guy. Brakmar, Sufokia, Bonta and Amakna. Politics is very real with the economy and both are in according to your nation. Perks for your nation add to your crafting skills. Crafting in this game you can take them all. No choosing. Take on gathering skills to obtain items to craft, to up craftingskills . Its the usual RPG gameplay here, but its ALL available to you. There is mining, lumberjack, farming, tamming for cooking, armorsmith, close and distance weaponary, handyman, and just all sorts to do. Use these gathering skills and crafting to make your character better while you follow the story line through the World of 12. NOW, the aspect of the game is that it is grid, turn based, stratagy combat. No mobs or running to and frow baddies. You click, challange a group and go into tactical combat. You lose- you go back to a Pheonix save point. ( its not that bad)  Win and gain loot equipment and exp. ALL THE RPG GOODNESS. Equipment, level elemental spells and characteristics to be the best. The usual. Combat can be casual to slow to OMFG, I made a wrong move and the boss destroys you and your group. Remember it is turn based and planning and thinking is required...It's not a faceroll keyboard or click shoot till you hit the baddies.YES ! groups are made and incrouraged in this game like most MMO's. You also can have a sidekick to help you out. Sidekicks are leveld and geard by you and are earned through quests, missions, acheivments and such. Everyone starts off with the Astrub Knight. Hes a neat soldier, with a lance and melee, chopchops for you. Pets and mounts are also in game for fun and helping.  Custamize and collect pets, mounts and sidekicks to your liking or play style.So what class will you make? will you get to the top of Mount Zinit? and master your characters abilities for grid based stratagy combat!. It does have humor, the story line is pleasing with good music and voice acting. Its more fun then chess and checkers and its casual . The graphics and baddies can be a bit on the kid side, due to it being a kids ''cartoon''. The first dugeon bosses are a Cat, Larva, Chicken and Sheep. So yeah no ghoulies or anything to make your kids wimper. Also there is a problem that steam acheivments have not and seem not to be fixed yet for the game and the game of as now, is kinda low in number and population. BUMMER.			"

												Definitely one of, if not THE best MMO I've ever played. Other than amazing graphics, rather catchy soundtrack and a real user-friendly community, the list of faults is pretty small.Pros- .Flexible combat design. Lots of options to change strategy without losing the feeling of a fast-paced           challenge          .A friendly community that is fairly easy to emmerse yourself in and almost stress-free when looking for guilds to            join which is also encouraged since guilds provide helpful allies and stat bonuses.          .Not the average Pay-To-Play game. Subscribing does give you an upperhand to make you near invincible.          .And the class are extremely even, making the duels come down to skill and smart builds.          .The item crafting system gives an even larger feel to the gameplay, broadening the options further.Cons: .Like in most online games, it's got the fair share of trolls and ne'er-do-wells. Usually in the form of player killers            or simply disrupting the ecosystem.            .When new to the game, walking around to find dragoturkeys takes up a large portion of your time. The spacing             between each dragoturkey, depending where you are, makes it especially tedious should you forget to             'remember' one. However, this is do-able thanks to lush, vivid scenery and overall whimsy.           .A good amount of loot or quest rewards could be tagged as 'linked', making it impossible to trash. This could be             a mild irritation due to the fact that enough of these items could take up useful inventory space. A good way            to bypass this is to click the trashcan icon manually on each item instead of the click and drag.              Though I found, sometimes, this does not work.           .Your character's journey is NOT narrated by Morgan Freeman. Other than that, it really is a great game all around. The tutorial is HIGHLY reccomended for people new to class-buildingand strategy games. Each Spell, Passive, Stat and combat mechanics can seem a bit overwhelming at first, despite the childish look to it. I say, it's free, try it out. "

												The game is fairly good, people bypass its incomplete state because of the genre (?) and the chance to meet new people (social game), regardless of which, there are a few problems, such as the tutorial phase, it can reach up to 30 minutes to figure out what to do if you're a new player, PKing happens fairly easy, saw higher levels killing lower levels regurarly, reason? None I think. The game is built in a beautiful way, definately, but major parts of it are broken, I'd suggest to play it first to convince yourselves. I wouldn't recommend this game for everyone, mainly I wouldn't recommend it for its current state, it can become annoying after a while. Peace!			"

												The interface doesn't scale with higher resolutions, meaning it's way too tiny. Doesn't really matter though, cause it doesn't do much to inform you of anything. In other MMOs, the lack of information wouldn't be a problem. However, Wakfu includes quite a few puzzles and tasks that have nothing to do with the combat (and that every class must attempt). Most of the time reason saw me through the puzzles, while other times I found myself performing a task over and over, trying to figure out the exact order of things to accomplish. It was annoying and frustrating, considering the main draw for me is the combat.The combat is highly tactical, yet poorly explained. By the time you start to figure things out you will've already committed your character to a path you may not like. Several abilities are only usable on party members, but not all the abilities make it clear how they should be used. Worse still, the balance in several areas is extremely odd and non-conducive to experimentation unless you are in a group. This is not an MMO you can really play in single player, and that for me is a deal breaker. With so many good free to play games available, in addition to the good multiplayer games always going on sale, I can't recommend Wakfu unless you have lots of free time and like the style.			"

												So let's get this out of the way...it is not perfect.  I am not going to preach that it is the best thing since sliced bread but I am not going to say it is absolute ♥♥♥♥.  This game was made with children in mind and some of the visuals and names suggest the same.  This game was also a game you had to pay to play but as you can see it has gone free to play.  However, I do from time to time find some really funny, slightly immature jokes, that actually make me pause and laugh.  The infamous section in one of the regions named Mourning Wood is a big example of this.  There is even references to pop culture such as TMNT and it pokes fun at that series and the series of MMORPG's in general in some points.  However, some references are actually quite infuriating with their difficulty.  This can be solved with grabbing a friend or guild mate and running dungeons.  If that doesn't help you can always take up one of the environment quests that happens every so often that spawns in either special enemies or special objects into the world for a time and if you finish the quest, you get a decent reward of experience so it is not completely pointless.  They make the world feel very alive with the mobs interacting with each other and carrying out their daily routines.  There is also a special form of housing in this game called Havens.  You get a Haven Bag after the tutorial which is your portable house.  You can craft decorations to decorate or sell your useless ♥♥♥♥ to the unfortunate if you have a Display case to store them on.  There are also large zones for your guilds called Haven Worlds which contain buildings and houses.  I do not know much about this due to my guild being only level one.  But you can do Guild Quests which are 3 random assignments assigned every so often to earn guild points to help your guild level.  In addition to these quests, you can fight other guilds and other nations (Nations are basically a form of Alliance vs. Horde style and there are alliances and stuff and blah blah blah.) and earn guild points for every person in attendance of the battle.  Dungeons require keys that you can either farm off of the surrounding mobs, buying them from others or marketplace, or by crafting it if you have the materials and the proper training.  Dungeons are far from a cake walk and most definetly require at least one other person to help you.  But if you don't have anyone to play with, don't worry, you can unlock side kicks which are your companions that you control which come with their own abilities and can help you win the battles.  It plays similar to Final Fantasy Tactics.  As you use them, they grow more and more powerful.  So do your elemental abilities.  Of the probably 16 or so races, all can use magic, just some use it better than others, and there are specific spells just for your race.  You can have ordinary weapons, though these do not scale in damage and efficiency as you use it, so magic is a prefered option for heavy hitting.  Harvesting even has special encounters to mix it up, if you win, you gain 10x the resource you were collecting but if you fail, it halves your productivity with harvesting anything for an hour and it stacks higher and higher until you beat him, when you win, the buff and all the stacks are gone.  Good balancing.  This game is very strategy focused and if you get surrounded with no assistance, you are doomed.  Character customization needs some work but it is still great with some of the choices they give.  Combat is fun, dialog is interesting, and the social aspect is there.  There is no advertisers and everyone is friendly for the most part.  I recommend this game highly to all who love a challenging turn based strategy RPG.			"

												Now that Steam has fixed its issues with Achievements, I'm enjoying seeing what I didn't realise I never knew about Wakfu. I started with Dofus, and gradually made my transition to Steam where I discovered more resources and a larger fanbase of my favourite games.Wakfu, like its predecessor, is a player-controlled environment where the ecology and economy of the world are entirely dependent on the users. While that seems simple enough, the game goes slightly further, allowing players to be elected as the governing rulers of an entire area of the map, dictating how money should be spent, and how the environment should thrive. The downfall to the above is that 100% of your item profits are from users. There are no NPCs to whom you can sell or trade items from your inventory.With a large collection of classes, Wakfu (and Dofus) has ensured the general availability of most preferred character archetypes, and has done extensive work keeping all the classes fairly well balanced. The tutorial is only generally comprehensive, so it's strongly suggested that trying a new class is done in the Incarnum world where everything is easy enough to not concern oneself with the dangers of durress. I personally prefer playing support roles, and have found that the highly acclaimed Eniripsa is fun, but the Eca and Xelor make healing very different, and definitely a lot more worthwhile in the aspect of overcoming challenges.Leveling is tedious, and the quests aren't very well thought out, so once you're finished with Astrub, prepare to grind. The maximum level takes a while to reach, especially since it's primarily done by grinding the entire way after LV20. Max level is 170 at the time of this writing, so there's a bit of perspective. The dungeons are awesome! when you can get friends to tag along, especially if you're following the difficult to locate storyline. I've read the manga and watched the anime, so seeing the dungeons and being part of the story is definitely a great deal of entertainment for me.If you're having a tough time getting through an area or quest, and haven't made friends on your server yet, no problem; Sidekicks are available in the market for Ogrin. If you're from Dofus, you know Ogrin can be purchased with Kama (in-game money), and thus is possible to acquire at no cost (for those who prefer not to pay). As a long-time subscriber, I highly recommend you give Steam's monthly options a try. I'm used to getting a pet or piece of gear with my Ogrine each month, but Steam goes a step further including more items that are only available through the now gaming giant.My final, most important factor to playing Wakfu is this: It's adorable! I love cute, and Ankama has done a great job at giving exactly that to me. Have fun, everyone, and feel free to join me on Nox or Remington. Just let me know you're coming.			"

												Easily one of the best games of it's kind. Wakfu is an amazing addition to the Dofus universe. It takes place in the same world, same classes, and same French art style and humour, but, it is in the future of Dofus' ""World of Twelve"" in the aftermath of a flood-related cataclysm. The content and story are rich. The evolution of the classes, creature, and world as  whole is amazing. If you like RPGs then you need to try this game. It is free, after all.			"

Being VIP gives slight boost which is reasonable and you probably should get it if you enjoy the game and want things to go faster :)			"

												So let's get this out of the way...it is not perfect.  I am not going to preach that it is the best thing since sliced bread but I am not going to say it is absolute ♥♥♥♥.  This game was made with children in mind and some of the visuals and names suggest the same.  This game was also a game you had to pay to play but as you can see it has gone free to play.  However, I do from time to time find some really funny, slightly immature jokes, that actually make me pause and laugh.  The infamous section in one of the regions named Mourning Wood is a big example of this.  There is even references to pop culture such as TMNT and it pokes fun at that series and the series of MMORPG's in general in some points.  However, some references are actually quite infuriating with their difficulty.  This can be solved with grabbing a friend or guild mate and running dungeons.  If that doesn't help you can always take up one of the environment quests that happens every so often that spawns in either special enemies or special objects into the world for a time and if you finish the quest, you get a decent reward of experience so it is not completely pointless.  They make the world feel very alive with the mobs interacting with each other and carrying out their daily routines.  There is also a special form of housing in this game called Havens.  You get a Haven Bag after the tutorial which is your portable house.  You can craft decorations to decorate or sell your useless ♥♥♥♥ to the unfortunate if you have a Display case to store them on.  There are also large zones for your guilds called Haven Worlds which contain buildings and houses.  I do not know much about this due to my guild being only level one.  But you can do Guild Quests which are 3 random assignments assigned every so often to earn guild points to help your guild level.  In addition to these quests, you can fight other guilds and other nations (Nations are basically a form of Alliance vs. Horde style and there are alliances and stuff and blah blah blah.) and earn guild points for every person in attendance of the battle.  Dungeons require keys that you can either farm off of the surrounding mobs, buying them from others or marketplace, or by crafting it if you have the materials and the proper training.  Dungeons are far from a cake walk and most definetly require at least one other person to help you.  But if you don't have anyone to play with, don't worry, you can unlock side kicks which are your companions that you control which come with their own abilities and can help you win the battles.  It plays similar to Final Fantasy Tactics.  As you use them, they grow more and more powerful.  So do your elemental abilities.  Of the probably 16 or so races, all can use magic, just some use it better than others, and there are specific spells just for your race.  You can have ordinary weapons, though these do not scale in damage and efficiency as you use it, so magic is a prefered option for heavy hitting.  Harvesting even has special encounters to mix it up, if you win, you gain 10x the resource you were collecting but if you fail, it halves your productivity with harvesting anything for an hour and it stacks higher and higher until you beat him, when you win, the buff and all the stacks are gone.  Good balancing.  This game is very strategy focused and if you get surrounded with no assistance, you are doomed.  Character customization needs some work but it is still great with some of the choices they give.  Combat is fun, dialog is interesting, and the social aspect is there.  There is no advertisers and everyone is friendly for the most part.  I recommend this game highly to all who love a challenging turn based strategy RPG.			"

												Turn based Strategy? Not accurate. Turn based TACTICS, more so. With 15 (Completely) UNIQUE classes, and a minimum of THREE different ways to build offensively per class. The graphics are childish and anime styled, but the humor is not. You will be met by crass jokes when you read most of the gear you find, and characters too! The game is designed for laid back party-based fun, but it is still possible play alone! On top of that, the entire game has 5 'factions' which are OPERATED BY PLAYERS. Also, the eco-system CAN go bankrupt, but thanks to a great community, it never does! For those of you with more than enough spare time, feel free to join!			"

												This game is great!I played this game in the early beta before it went p2p and quit a long time after that. I started playing again when it wend f2p and now I use steam to play it. The game is much like it's predecessor Dofus. A turn based tactical mmo. But unlike Dofus you can change the world around U in real-time. Kill a lot of monsters and they get extinct cut down a lot of trees and there gone. And you can of course plant trees to let them regrow and you can even plant monsters so they come back.There is a lot of crafting in this game and you can do them all! I advise you to at-least take up backing and farming because bread is the most used way of healing after a fight. You can wait to heal, and that's OK when you are low lvl. But after a while when you get to a point where you have a lot of HP it will take to long to just wait to heal. There is a recent revamp of the game that changed the lvling up system. I think it did this in a good way and allows for more unique builds. They also did a revamp on the in game sets. You used to get a bonus from having a X amount of set items. These bonuses are now on the items themselves and the dmg type a set have is now randomly generated. I understand why they did this. So you can have any item you want and not be forced to use a complete set just to get that +1AP. But I Prefer the old system. That update has broken the economy a bit to. Items sell for a lot less now and its a lot harder to earn a decent amount of in game currency (kamas). But I hope that this is just now and will recover in a while. I think its best to join a active guild because this game really has a nice community. And its best to play with others. Best thing about the turn based system is that you have time to chat in fights with your team and discuses tactics our just have a good chat.  All in all its a great game and recommend it to everyone to try. It has a nice player-base, looks great, easy to run on almost any machine and although you can go P2P and never feels you have to, F2P gives you just as much to do in the game.			"

												To be honest i was a bit sceptical with this game since it was by the same producer that made dofus. I mean i really liked dofus but the pay2play subcription was a real downside. But turns out wakfu is huge improvemen of dofus and best of all it is completely no subscription to be able to enjoy the whole game content.8/10I would recommend playing this game if you like turn based combat. Alone or if you have a friend to play with that would be much more fun from low lvl up to high lvl.Pro:+ Player driven economy+ 4 nations with players controlling them/governing them with rules chosen by the ""leader"" of the each nation.+ Can start war to control more lands for your nation or become allies to control more lands together+ All class skills are available once you have reached past lvl 10 and they have their one lvl depending on how much you use it in combat, no more lvl up for one skill every 10-20 lvls + Turn based strategy combat <- I LOVE STRATEGY <3Cons:- No Trade NPC to sell junk item to so you can get easy kamas(games currency).- Rather hard to find party at low lvl since you get your own sidekick and lvl up rather fast alone.Currently i'm around lvl 20 so don't have much experience of this game but i have played dofus and reached lvl 40 or so. The similarity are almost identical but with new changes.			"

												Wakfu is a turn based MMORPG with a crafting system, political system and ecological system. There are multiple classes to choose from, all unique, no archetypes are used, and combat is interesting, if not engaging. Party members can make or break certain dungeons and the learning curve is certainly high, but once you hit your stride, the game opens up tremendously. There are also several gathering and professions you can learn/master all of which can factor in your early game. All the content is well thought of until you hit level 120-120 and then it all becomes irrelevant. The game has no endgame goals, PVP is pointless, token and nonexistent. The ""government system"" doesn't actually impact your game in any way and ecological features do not factor in the endgame content. Wakfu is a semi-meaningful 70 hours followed by nothing. If you like spending time by yourself crafting, farming and turn based combat, I recommend either getting Xcom2, Stardew Valley or Rune Factory on DS. Now, let me get to the bad stuff. The cash shop does not work. READ: Does not work. It isn't 100% reliable, which is pretty pathetic as far as F2P games go. Payment options are extremely limited cash shop or otherwise and there doesn't seem to be any change in the system. If you're looking for a more robust MMO experience, hit up Terra online, Tree of Savior, or even Ragnarok. Let this game die in peace.			"

												It was a great mmo with partial skill based leveling, full player generated economic system (the only way money appear in a game is being crafted by players), simulated ecosystem (climate, monsters and resourced depend on players behavior) and friendly adventure atmosphere, little buggy and class imbalanced, but tottaly playable.So it was two years ago. Steam says it was released  18 sep, 2014, which is not quiete true. According to wikipedia it was released 29 feb, 2012. Now servers populations is low on all the shards, and almost every start location is empty. The thing is, this game is not supposed to play in an empty world. So Steam is kinda tricky saying it had just released.But it's free and enjoyable without donate on low levels, so you should check it.			"

												If you like turn based games, you might like this one too. For me honestly it was an acquired taste, cause I felt that the combat was boring at the start, and the missions too. So at the start of the game, I was already discouraged from playing more, but then I decided to play a bit more, to actually get somewhere in the game, I put a little more effort in and then some more and more, and gradually I felt that the game was becoming pretty fun. I have a level 25-ish character now, there are tons of dungeons, some quests here and there, and a craft system that DOES NOT limit you to only 2 ♥♥♥♥ing proffessions(as many as you want to have, instead). I also really love the idea that the entire ecosystem is the entire playerbases responsibility. They do a pretty decent job keeping it all going. If they decide, ""I HATE THESE GOBBALS!!!"" They can decide to kill all of them and extinct the species. There are 4 nations and they all have their own set of laws, and they are either enemies or allies of each-other. The laws are pretty cool, cause  if the governor chooses to  declare an endanged species as ""ILLEGAL TO INTERACT WITH"", you can disobey them and become a criminal to your own nation lmao.There's alot to this game and it is fairly unique, give it a go, and put a little bit more effort in too, this is a slower paced game.7/10  Awesome community, unique game			"

												The game is very pretty and you can loose yourself in it for hours on end and barely notice it. The characters are cute and silly... there's a bit of sexism here and there but nothing enraging - unless you count the obvious ""sexy"" character designs. It's one of those pick your battles instances I guess.Anyway! It's rather fun, the economy being entirely player based means theres no way to sell off your junk to an npc (last time I played anyway).			"

												Keep trying to fall in love with this game.Light TBS is so my style. Nothing too heavy unless youre really looking to kick ♥♥♥Its a grid based affair with elemental attacks, positioning, leveling abilities and a diverse class syste that encourages messing around. There's mecahnisms to respec for free and starting a new journey is always fun as each class has its own fighting style on the grid.Mechanics lend themselves towards the application and development of your own skills, little quests and a vibrant crafting economy.The choice in armour and gear is broad enough, and being part of a Guild can put you into a living community.Unless you choose your class to be money printer, where what you do is literally cause inflation. YOUR WHOLE JOB IS TO PRINT MORE MONEY, WHICH INCREASES THE AMOUNT OF MONEY IN A CLOSED SYSTEM. THE ECONOMY IS ♥♥♥♥ED UP. THE SYSTEM CRASHES IF NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE ARE PRINTING MONEY AND CRASHES AGAIN IF TOO MANY PEOPLE ARE, AS THE ONLY WAY TO DELETE MONEY IS TO HAVE IT POURED INTO A GUILD BASE FOT ITS UPGRADES.Also everything is adorable. Super adorable. So yeah. A Turn BAsed MMO with a lot of choice and quite a few little adventures to be had as you refine your strategies and travel with new freinds to kick ♥♥♥ and collect loot.

												NOTE: Steam DLC for this game doesn't go towards cards/boosters at all.That being said, you'll get more bang for your buck if there's a sale on them if you're a core player.In game shop isn't availble in tutorial.+ point for making it super easy to log in with steam- point for the gamer sin of locking a hero behind a paywall. A very high paywall.- steam sales =/= in game store sales on top of which there are sales on stuff in store. If you run the same game, why can't you package the steam bundles INTO your in game store the same as having sales on steam? Advertising trading cards that buying FROM the steam store don't go towards smack of free publicity without the payoff. In fact, a simple search on google reveals you tinkered with the in game/out game currency price to cash in on the new market on steam. The older players, who now can link into steam and may be interested in the card feature, won't exactly like the sales and booster unlock being on two seperate paths. In fact, it's almost a slap in the face of anyone interested in your trading cards, as you're effectively saying: ""buy stuff on sale and unlock all this in game optional frill bonus content, or unlock the booster pack for the cards and just buy some exp boosters, which is almost begged for by rhe see through costume, 2,500 in game currency I might add, that just lets you stay the same way you looked without your silly bunny hat equipment...I'm happy you can pay to make some armor sets look like others just with the same stats as the other one, but I've never quite heard of a game that charges you to look naked, it's neat, I'll get it that, but for the price????????????!??????????????The paywalled character isn't game breaking; the in game shop is lacking in my opinion, except the boosts/subscription(exp boost/item drop/curency boost)/sidekicks, the costumes are kinda...limited. In spite of the franchise, the low costume count and their contents are just asian mmo style lazy, with the only one that really glows being a spikey samurai affair that we're all so familiar with, and hell, it only comes in one color mix of blue/teal/black. *I'm just getting into the series so this may be wrong *trying to avoid all this I simply bought a farmer costume, but my only options were pirate/drag queen as the rest is clearly geared towards ladies, muskateer, golden helmet = justice league/superhero (eh), dastardly black caped guy, mohawk S&M and that was about it. Whereas the female costumes had more variety and unless you count the super saiyan zodiac glow gear, generally better but not by much.All of which is really kinda spendy. I can only hope the money goes towards animation costs as well as server maintainence, because aside from sale prices on steam, I can't see someone except a die hard fan of doofus/wakfu or the cartoon wanting to spend these high prices, except for the exp boosts, to reward the creators and devs, and good for them, but it really feels more like a friendly mugging then a reward.28$ will get you 13,000 in game shop currency.3x30 exp days (90), which start the second you buy them, costs 8,100 in game shop currency.As far as sub prices go, especially an optional one, that's pretty good, but with every other item ranging 2000-3500 in game shop currency, to emotes, of all things, costing 900(effectively 2.5 dollars a pop) in game currency and there's about 15+ of them. Yeah, but at least unlike the sub it stays with you and that should make up for it, riiiiiiight? Ouch. Not for me, but for whoever is out there looking to unlock every little social thing in this game, it'll cost you. ...at least they animate nice, but maybe they should have been made into upgrades or version 2's of already available free emotes.Simply put: who is the target demographic you're trying to sell to? These prices seem wonky.The exp rate isn't an issue unless you can't stand a grind, especially knowing you can put money on it to speed it up. Depending on how you approach mmorpgs, this would be a deal breaker as for some, that would mean they're holding the xp hostage and the grind is even more arbitrary.That being said, have been meaning to catch up with this game and I'm glad I played it.

The list goes on and on.This game has personality by the boat load.  It was originally released in 2012 after a Closed Beta phase.  It is the successor to DOFUS, Ankama's other successful tactical RPG.  The games are different though.  I've never played DOFUS, but I know they're different.

 I want to start out by saying, that if you can look past the initially grindyness of all MMORPG games, this game has a great community that you can return back to whenever. It's got great art, and wonderful music, cheezy PG-13 humor, and a great combat system. Possibly my favorite things about this game are the fact that the four nations of the game are entirely player-run. Economy, Ecology, etc. I play as a character that makes sure other players have enemies to fight and I try to keep a good ecological balance in the places I go. New players don't seem to realize that you can actually make an enemy type go extinct, so you have to be careful. This game gets an 8.5 or a 9 out of 10 from me. Anyways, that's it for my little introductory, brief review.  Full review; - Wakfu has an anime art style. This is because it's based around an anime of the same name, which is a french anime that, while I've personally never watched it, I do know plenty of the characters from it and I do know that it is a really rather nice anime, at least, from what I've heard from my friends. It has a great soundtrack also reminescent of the anime, and the humor is right around the same. The character designs for the game are all very solid, and even though it looks more reminescent of, say, a flashgame, where you can notice like, how the limbs move, maybe stretch, you'll notice that here, but it's in a cartoony sense so you won't pay it much mind, Id think. - Wakfu has a very robust crafting and harvesting economy. All your resources, except for ores, are things you either have to hand-plant, or harvest from groves or gardens that are maintained by other players. Nations can impose limits to how many plants can be harvested or planted in a percentile range, and going over or below those percentiles will actually impose a penalty on you, being something as low as a 'citizen-level' penalty, to something as strict as a kill-on-sight bounty. The monster ecology for this game is exactly the same as the herb/tree/plant ecology, and everything is controlled by the players, even influencing the weather in the game for certain regions, making one region better for certain plants, and even time of years will influence the temperature! - Wakfu's combat system is probably just as robust as it's ecological and economical parts, and I'll echo the sentiment that this game's combat system is similar to Final Fantasty: Tactic's. I can't really say too much about the current state of the combat system, as it's apparently undergone a good deal of revisions, according to my friends, and skills and passives no longer work like they used to, and work in different ways, but the combat system is still very in depth, and you can view all of it's workings, majorly, in your own character screen, so it may be intimidating at first, but the more you play around with it the more you get used to it. I'm not a very serious combative player so I can't fully explain how the combat system works, but there are a lot of classes for you to try out and tinker with, so there's probably at least one playstyle for you to like!- On Wakfu's community.. I'm going to make one thing clear; Every game will have it's people who are there to ♥♥♥♥ with other players. This game is no different, and there's no exceptions. Players from hostile nations can invade your nation and try and instigate you to attack them, or deforest your region you're in. They can also try and bring your nation's enemy population down, but that's majorly it, people can be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, but a major group of people are either rather kind and helpful or they keep to themselves, which is understandable. This game shines in my opinion for how it's all player run, and you, yes, you could be nominated for helping whichever country you join, or even ruling it, if you make enough friends and prove yourself to be worth of such a responsibility. It's daunting at first, but you'll meet plenty of people who've played as leaders or as parts of nations. It's like, a half-sort of roleplaying thing, half nation management for your role. I've never been a member of a nation's staff, but I plan on working my way to that. (I'm currently reinstalling this game, and the game's done-- for now, this is my review, but I will add more later!)			"

												Well its still good for new players and i have pretty good fps on max sett. with my hoover (wooden pc). Even if i have seen the bugs (i didnt see game mechanics bugs or itemsdrop, only about customization) it was fixed in 15 sec by restarting the game. I have no idea what these ppl (with 1-2k hrs) talking about cause i have a 7k hrs in (ded) game which was supported ONLY by community for 5+ f..ing years (yes, its TF2). And if u still crying about ur hats and money hmm, u know u can f2p this one (even if its 10$ for mounth for this game WHO CARES its just f..ing 10$). So as i said its have a big stuff for new players and i think u'll enjoy it if u like any RPG or tactical mechanics games.			"

												Ahhh, this game...  This game is definately worth sinking some hours into, especially if you're into Tactical RPG's, MMO's, or even managing a Nation!I first found out about Wakfu by watching the series on Netflix.  I thought ""Oh boy, i wonder if there's a game for this!""  Turns out my ignorant self was unaware of the series being based off of a game!Finding out as much as I could, I was extremely pleased to find this game on Steam, and absolutely FREE, too!Anyways, back to the game itself, I've spent a good 130 hours on it now and I am STILL exploring the world that there is to see!  After a while you get tired of playing by yourself (if you're a social introvert like me) and you want to expand a little.  That's where making/joining a guild comes in handy.  You can find plenty of people to kill and gather resources with.The system incorporated into the game are kinda... well, up and down.  The currency system, as well as the ecosystem and government, is all player-run.  So you'll have to checkup daily for new prices on an item you want.  And the crafting system is a little over-the-top.  Why do I need almost 32 bits of wool to make clothes!?All in all, it's a good time-killer if you need an excuse from the world and want something a little different than MMO's like World of Warcraft.I give it a 8/10.

												I love the game. Really do. It has the old isometric feel of old rpgs, and maintains the turn based combat with grace, hardly any part of the combat system feels clunky or out of place. Even grinding for xp (Trust me, you'll have to do that A LOT), there is a sense of achievement in beating your foe. The artstyle is really good, on par with the French TV show about it. It also has a nice diversity of classes, weapons, and fighting styles, for a free to play game. Also, DUNGEONS! There's a fantastic diversity of dungeons that help you level up, get some kick ♥♥♥ items, and are evidently made with a lot of thought and care.Now the bad parts:It's often a bit laggy, not enough to make you sick, but enough to annoy you after several hours of viewing it. The game as mentioned before, is incredibly grindy. They give you a few missions to get you on your feet, and then set you free. to some, that sounds like a gift, but trust me, it's a curse. Yuo get lost easily, and the map is no damn help at all, so you end up killing Bow Meows (cats) until you stumble on an adventure. They have a lot of items and dungeons that can be only unlocked by being a certain level, which is to stop new players from being stomped, but leveling up becomes so hard after level 10 that you end up forgetting about dungeons, which is a shame because they are SO FUN. Customization, one of my most important parts of an rpg, is pretty much nonexistent, so make sure to create your charater EXACTLY AS YOU WANT THEM TO LOOK LIKE becaue there is no covering your mistakes in heavy armor.Other than that, the game is a really good time waster. Even though it gets very dull quickly, I find that I keep coming back to it, and I've made it a bit of my daily habit. Would recommend at the very least, try it. If you don't like it, the uninstall button exists for a reason.			"

												This game is pure genius.  The battle style is similar to Fire Emblem, but you can actually play with other people in real time.  Only annoyance might be waiting for them to complete their turn.  The game is colorful, bright, and welcoming.  Plenty of ""classes"" to choose, all which have a male/female version of them (even Robots).  Level up and do dungeons with your friends to gain equipment, stats, skills, items, and keys to more dungeons.The game even features some other skills such as mining, farming, and crafting.  There seems to be always something to do.  The game even has competing nations, PVP, and guilds.The only gripe I have with the game is that it's primarily sandboxed; in the beginning you'll have plenty of quests to get you going, but at some point the quests do stop, which leaves it up to you how you want to play the game.  Do you want to grind to the highest level?  Do you want to help newer people grind to the highest level?  Do you want to take it easy and become a farmer for the rest of your life? The choice is yours.  However, when I got boosted to a higher level, I had no idea what to do because of the limited amount of quests.			"

												I really love this game, I also played the original one (not from Steam, the one from Ankama). The Steam-version lacks some sounds, what is a bit disappointing because they, too, made the fights and so on more interesting. What's bothering me is that I had an Ankama account before and linked it with my Steam account. Now it seems like I can't get any achievements on Steam for the things my character (that I already played before linking the Ankama account with the Steam account) does. Summed up, it's still a pretty awesome game but it lacks some stuff that the original from Ankama has. I'd really recommend it because it's fun to play and lets the players their freedom, the classes are interesting and if you know the series you're pretty much in heaven. Let's keep our hopes up that the lacks I mentioned before won't bother us for too long.			"

												Wakfu is a fun and adventurous game. It has turn based battle style fighting, a huge and expanding open world, interesting mob monsters (little birds called tofus- if you're vegitarian you won't want these Tofurkeys, Bow Meows, Treechnids, lots of weird stuff). Its a player run game, with 5 different governments that players can be elected into. Bonta, Amanka, Brackmar, and Sufokia cough cough Sufokia being the best, of course cough cough are the four land owning governments. The fifth is a group called the Riktus Clan who are sort of a pirate/rogue group who go around and wreck shop and steal land. You join one of the land owning countries at level 18 or so, and later get the option to join Riktus, if you're so inclined, aroud level 35.The best way to level up is to scour the many dungeons scattered across each country, and the neutral lands (ex Astrub, The Sadida Kingdom, and other such islands found on the map). Getting into the dungeon itself provides a challenge as you have to fight area monsters to get keys or ingredients to make keys to get in. Each player requires a key to get in. Groups are suggested for dungeons, though you can use a 'sidekick' which is basically a second character you control. Sidekicks require you to use a key as well, as they count as a second person linked to yourself. At the end of a dungeon you earn experience, items and tokens which allow you to buy other items from a machine outside said dungeon. Those items from the machine are linked to your player character. You can also run the dingeon multiple times to get all the items from a set without them being linked (most times).Then there are things that I consider 'sub classes' that help you make pretty much anything in the game. These jobs allow you to make armor, weapons, furniture for your havenbag/home, accessories, food, etc. They are on their own leveling system unrelated to your characters level. The CRAFTING professions are: A.O.E Weapons Master, Armorer, Baker, Chef, Close Combat Weapons Master, Handyman, Kama Minter, Leather Dealer, Long Distance Weapons Master, Jeweler, and Tailor at the time of this review. There are also GATHERING Professions, which help you get the ingredients for crafting. GATHERING Professions are: Lumberjack, Herbalist, Miner, Fisherman, Trapper, and Farmer. These professions also offer unique items to craft, though are best leveled up by actually gathering things.This game is very time consuming. But fun as all get out.In this game there are a lot of guilds. When I say a lot I mean, like, over 500. Many may be in disuse or inactive, but there are a lot of options out there. Look into the guilds and join one that makes you comfortable, you can always make one of your own if you want to. Guilds provide boosts you can't earn without being part of a guild. Stuff like increased HP or damage for a certain element, depending on the guild level and amount of points they've earned. Guilds have 3 daily quests that grant 15-20 points per quest per character that does them. You also earn small amounts of guild points just doing whatever if you're grouped up with members from your guild- like the little environmental quests (like kick 10 Gobball Balls or stomp some weeds type things), running through more than one dungeon (though the one daily quest for that grants 20 each time after grants a few points too). You can always leave a guild as well, f it no longer suits your playstyle, though you will lose all related bonuses.On the topic of dailies; there is a temple called the temple of almanax. It has 4 doors correlating to the seasons inside, and once a day you go to 'pray' to the merida of the day. It grants a token that allows you to buy cool stuff like costumes or a pet or haven bag upgrades, something like 10,000 exp, and a randomized bonus (something like +40 Wisdom or +30 HP and other things like that. the bonuses last one hour of gameplay).Theres so much in the game, it is really worth it to give it a few hours to try, it is free after all. Theres also a user-run wiki for Wakfu that covers a bunch of stuff and is always expanding (albeit slowly sometimes). Theres also Ankama's site that has more info on specifics as well.All in all, its worth a try at the very least. Its fun, its enjoyable, and its free (though you CAN choose to spend some real cash if you really want, but you don't have to)			"

												This is one of the best MMORPGs I've ever played. The textures may not look so good if you play games for what they look like, but they've got theyr beauty. Also every single thing in this game is amazingly complex, like the ecosystem or the jobs. Damn, it even has political stuff in it if that's what you're into. Also the classes are sooooooooo varied, each with it's own huge range of unique spells that provides a ♥♥♥♥ load of combos and stuff. One more thing: the game is MASSIVE, it has tons of areas to explore and a lot of dungeons, items, jobs, quests, anything... The bad stuff? Well, if you play alone it kinda gets boring, but it's a good thing that Wakfu has this amazing comunity, everyone is so friendly and helpful and stuff, no trolls, nor scammers, so you'll make friends real fast and you'll have for sure someone to play with. In the end: great game, also free so it won't hurt to try.			"

												A few key things to know about this game.1.) You will do a LOT of grinding.2.) The end game dungeon currently requires you to pay to even ACCESS. (No sub means the highest level area is locked out for you.3.) If you pay money you get to field more heroes/sidekicks allowing subs to monopolize more turns per fight4.) PvP is dominated by people who have sunk hundreds, if not thousands of hours into the game, even with subscriptions. If you plan on doing any serious pvp, it won't be until your AT LEAST 1,000 hours into the game. Until then be prepared for a lot of repetition. If one of these points don't turn you off then you might want to check the game out. Mechanically it isn't bad and the community, for the most part are a cool bunch of people. That said, around 120-140 prepare to spend hundreds of hours running the same 1-2 dungeons fighting the same group of mobs over and over again. Unless you can join a guild to find people who will help pass the repetitive nature of the game it will eventually get to you.NOT FOR LONE WOLF PLAY - PERIOD			"

												Despite the amount of interesting open-world area, Final Fantasy Turn-by-turn gameplay style, it seems that it is just now mainly for Windows instead of the Mac, due to JAVA-Based compatibility. Especially from users that are new to Steam for Mac on Yosemite and Higher.The only fix is this is just only using a VERY OLD and maybe unupdated service to Java for Mac. Sooner or later, Java will kill off Java 6 (the game currently utilizes this version of Java) for all the new versions, so where does this leave this game?I think it maybe safe to say that the developers may soon need to think about bringing a major update to have new Java version support (Java 7 or 8 and newer in the years to come).

												The game itself is very dull and slow paced. Tactical RPGs should never be MMO's to begin with and the game has very little driving aspect to get the players to play the game. That being said it still has unique features and fun gameplay mechanics that is better suited for single player. You can play single player in the game by building a bunch of characters and then sidekick them to your main character (with the only fatal flaw being you have to spend over 25$ just to even do that for 90 days). I like where Ankama is going with this but they are doing it the wrong way. They should do what Squaresoft did when they made Final Fantasy Tactics for the Playstation 1. If they were to do that and sell the game for roughly 20$ on steam than they would be able to have a successful video game. If people like tactical RPGs, this game will be up your alley. Just a note though: Game is kind of buggy and not many players to play with.			"

												Wakfu is a turned based MMORPG, that has interesting graphics, music, so on and so forth with things that've already been touched on. Lemme tell you about the part of it that really makes ME excited. Wakfu really tried to build a world that was entirely dependent on the people who play it. So, right off the bat? There are zero NPCs, aside from the occasional quest giver. That means if you're looking to sell your ♥♥♥♥, you better start up a stand. There's also an Ecology system that effects monsters and gathering nodes (trees, plants, ore, etc.) wherein, if you kill too much, or take too much, it'll actually GO AWAY. It's up to the player to repopulate these areas by planting things, breeding animals and generally working with the ""Wakfu"" of any particular area. Some other notable parts are as follow: Player elected governors, citizen points that can effect how the world treats you (Wanna be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, be an outlaw and go to jail? Hell yeah you do.), instant player housing (Haven bag) that... also works as your store, a place to decorate things, a place to put gathering nodes and so on. There's also huge maps, the ability to spec into every kind of profession, interesting character classes that have little to no over lap as far as utility... I mean, come on!I'll admit I'm pretty stoked about this game. However, it is definitely not a game for everyone. The combat can be pretty off putting, and it's generally not as fun of an experience if you go at it alone. But, if you're the type of person that really likes to see a game take some amazing steps for MMOs, you might wanna give this a shot.			"

I'm normally not a fan of Turn Based Combat--I like to kick'em when they're down... or something like that, but Ankama has found a way to make it work. I spent a while looking for an MMORPG that would work on Linux, and this one happens to work on Linux, and Windows. They've apparently updated classess and some quest, and I expect there's more to come; however this game does require that you have patience. But overall a good experience.... ****/*****			"

												The game itself is quirky, beautiful, and addictive. The classes are completely unique, and each has four different elements it can focus in, which makes for a lot of easy tailoring to play style.Even though it's the most aethetically pleasing MMO out there, it's still infested with middle schoolers learning their first swear words. It's an interesting sight to have some grouchy kid stomp the plants you're growing for a recipe while cussing you out, saying your flowers are too close to theirs. If you were expecting this game to have a nicer commmunity, boy, are you naive.Luckily, you can pick and choose which chat channels you see through buttons on the right of the chat box. You can have groups and guilds and the like, but I have become a hermit and still find the game fascinating.			"

												If you are one of the blessed souls that played Final Fantasy Tactics in the old days you might like this, every race in the game has his unique playstyle and can be forwarded into 3 different elemental branches or combine them for unique playstyle, of course as it is a free 2 play game it has it's upside downs, the time you get to lvl up is huuuge and the people who pay have some advantages but still its a pretty good game specially if you have friends to play with, the races are pretty balanced and the enemy AI its pretty well done you will get challanges playing on PvE and the PvP its hell fun, definitively a game you should play if you like Strategy per turn games, it has it own economy AND ecology system, 4 factions and Wars between them :) you can even also choose the gobernor of that faction, overall wakfu its a 8/10 and if you are not sure about it try it! you might find that mmo that hooks you up for a while!

												I played Dofus for years. I always said that Dofus is great game and you won't ever find game like Dofus. How wrong I was. Wakfu is like evolved Dofus. Sure it lacks some things we didn't even know we like in Dofus (e.g. you don't get all skills at once so you have more time to learn using them), but generally Wakfu is even better. Why is Wakfu so special? You have to use your brain while fighting. Of course you will have some skill pattern, few skills you will use again and again, however you have to know where to go, who should be killed first, etc. New monster means new type of battle. And another great thing Wakfu offers to its players is economy and ecosystem. There are no NPCs for buying/selling, everything is on players. Another thing, that depends on players is nature. You can gather plants, you can cut trees, but if you want them to grow again, you have to plant them. And monsters as well. Also everyone in certain area can get bonus, because special NPCs who take care of areas will tell you how much trees they want there, how much monsters, ... And if they are pleased, players get temporary bonus stats. I am not saying everyone will love the game, but I think everyone should at least try.			"

I love this game with its ecosystem and its fun lil tid bits, its characters classes and its turn base stratagy, is INCREADABLE and im the type of person who hates TBS mostly for the reasons of End war on the ds.

												If you like rpg's,mmo's or strategy games you will love this title. This game is soo good, while I haven't played too much Dofus, I am 18 hours into the game and I can say it might be as good as Dofus. + Hilarious dialogue and character names ( Also you can see animals make out )+ You are free to do whathever you like. Whenever you grind and feel like you are getting bored, there is a lot of things that will make the boredom go away, like doing dungeons,crafting,harvesting,exploring,pvp,guild wars and much more.+Quest's are always fresh and dont feel like your average MMO where you need to either collect this and this from an enemy or killing this and this number of enemies. Usually the only collecting thing would be harveting materials , and from killing monsters, its only optional because they will give you only a little bit more exp from eco quests or like i call them ""field quests""+Beautiful art design , and just exploring through the scenery feels relaxing.+Great skills that have multiple uses,and skill resets if you are not comfterable with your char.+You can choose from a wide selection of  unique characters. Even the archer is so unique.+You can put items on sale while offline and you can fast travel + Ton of archivementsNow for the bad things-Game might get grindy at times-Discarding items is a pain in the something to do-You can't sell at merchants , instead you have to sell your items to players, or discard them.-You need to put a lot of time into it if you want to get to the fun stuff-You cant move with keys, mouse only. And no camera movement besides zoom in and zoom out.-Glitches. You have them.-WHEN CAN WE WATCH THE ENGLISH ANIME ?-With friends, this is a bit easy. (But still ton more fun)Final reviewIf you put time into it, its a amazingly unique game. If you wanna get through it fast, its gonna get boring really fast.7.5/10 Recommend it to anybody who loves things like fire emblem or final fantasy tactics.			"

												Very addicting MMO, i've played a bit of Dofus back in the days and the art style was really attractive to me. To see it continued and improved in this game makes me really happy. I really reccommend at least trying this. There's something for everyone in this game. PvP, PvE, gathering and crafting, lots of dungeons, stratagy turn based combat and a lot of beautifull art.

												I am returning to Wakfu after a 2 year break. I love the changes that have been made. That being said, there are still a few bugs. However, being an mmo/rpg/tactics fiend, I highly recomend this game. The community is awesome, great pvp, crafting/farming, and tons of builds (for those who love to tinker & theory craft). For those of you who want to learn more, join us on the Nox server. I'm also working on resurecting my old guild (Drunken Heroes) for interested players.

												A fairly interesting MMORPG. For anyone who played the early stages of this game, or even the Beta like me - I can assure you that there has been some major progress since those times. Not something I would recommend to people who despise grinding, but for those of us who are sort of accustomed to the old Ragnarok way of things, this should be no problem. I've played past lvl.30 and I'm still having alot of fun with it.Looking for a MMORPG with a turn based tactics twist to it? This could be for you.			"

												Confusing at first but highly addictive later Wakfu stays a classic must play for all tacticalturn-based RPGS fans and it in my honest opinion is a true succesor to the genre of TTB RPGs. Just Imagine Disagea and FF Tactics with strong MMO and semi-sandbox elements where you (the player) is responsible for ecosystem/politics/economy/ecology and more. The only down side is the games extreme grindines from time to time and highly group/raid based gameplay, meaning that soloing content is a lot harder than do it with a group, cause there is no downside in having a larger group.Final personal score - 8.5/10			"

It provides a surprisingly close knit community and has a very unique feel different than most MMOs with it's strange art style and almost slapstick sort of storyboard.  Also, all the cash shop feature does not feel overly pushy and the items are decently prices compared to other games who feel like they are just out to grab cash.			"

I fell in love with this game instantly brought my friend and we spent the entire day grinding levels and trying out classes until we found out favorite. We got to a point where the story kinda dropped off and we had to figure out what the game truely was we got kind of annoyed at first but we played it more learned more about it from veteran players which btw the comunity is amazing, but now that we know more about it this has become one of our favorite games.

												Been playing this game all day and I only have a few gripes that are overwhelmingly outweighed by the positives.Cons: 1. Up until level 10 or so there are some really annoying quests but that's expected out of an MMO. There's one specifically which has you pushing flower pots into plants in some sort of puzzle that I find mind numbingly stupid. 2. The professions are an amazing part of the game but there is no mission or anything that really explains any of them. You have to track down the trainers themselves and read the little mini books the give you on each profession.3. The starter area is way overpopulated and makes grinding out some of the lower levels/gear grinding kind of annoying.That's the only real gripes I have, now, for the positives.Pros: 1. When they game says it has unique classes it really means it. I found myself making quite a few new characters just for the sake of trying out the classes. One that sticks out in my mind is the Escaflip which is a gambling class in a since. Certain skills in the class (namely the ""Earth"" path) are 100% based on pure luck. There are passives that make you luckier but I just find the class overall interesting.2. The amount of stuff to do fresh out of tutorial is amazing. Immediately what came to mind is runescape just on a smaller, better scaled version. Including the gathering, crafting, etc. which brings me to pro number 33. This one will vart from person to person depending on who you ask but I do not find the gathering to be tideous or boring, Wakfu is a beautifully designed game with vibrant colors and cute, anime like avatars. I found joy and going around collecting seeds from animals. Yes, I said seeds from animals. This sort of solves the issue with con number 3 because it takes roughly 5 seconds (no exaggeration) for an animal to spawn after you plant the seeds. 4. The community is very friendly and talkative. Now, me being a somewhat older player I found this to be annoying as well as helpful because, like I said, the game is very anime-esque. This means LOTS of 13 and 14 year olds. As long as you're the type of person who can easily ignore this it's no issue. If you go dungeoning that's where you'll find the informative, helpful, mature mmo players.I could go on and on about this game because I literally plaed it for about 8 hours straight. It's a fun game and I reccomend it to anyone who's looking for something new and different. solid 9/10			"

												Despite the amount of interesting open-world area, Final Fantasy Turn-by-turn gameplay style, it seems that it is just now mainly for Windows instead of the Mac, due to JAVA-Based compatibility. Especially from users that are new to Steam for Mac on Yosemite and Higher.The only fix is this is just only using a VERY OLD and maybe unupdated service to Java for Mac. Sooner or later, Java will kill off Java 6 (the game currently utilizes this version of Java) for all the new versions, so where does this leave this game?I think it maybe safe to say that the developers may soon need to think about bringing a major update to have new Java version support (Java 7 or 8 and newer in the years to come).

												The Show is wonderful and the game isn't all that bad but that being said it isn't all that good ether. It does little to hold your attention as I played it I found very little enjoyment in the combat system as I was thrown from boring quest to boring quest. What really hurts the game most though is how it trys introduce mingames viva the combat system one fine example is the Pizzalarva quest where the player is asked by a NPC to cook larva as this will train him somehow to fight Cult members. The idea was forced and the mingame itself was horrible as instead of just straight up fighting you had to not only keep the larva from reaching the end of the track but also had to tenderize and granish the larva the correct way. Sounds simple but in reality all the player finds themself doing is running back and forth from granish barrel to conveyor belt hoping that the next larva is the correct color and trying to keep other larva from escaping.

I have tried to play this game at least 5 different times now. Every time I install it, the beginning is different. This game is NOT bad.

												Eh, it's pretty good if you've played league or any other highly competitive games, you get the idea.Lovely community (except maybe the italians) , compared to League, its a community upgrade, specially for the casual players. For the competitive players, keep in mind that the game is made first for PvE so PvP might not be as balanced as you'd hope for, but i've heard that'd be a PvP overhaul coming, so looking forward to that, might turn out to be really good, or a total disaster.

												PROS:Best ever game environment.  Beautiful art and style. Extensive crafting system. PVP option. Dungeons are unique and mob's are difficult to master-  they all have different abilities. Gameplay grind and difficulty creates a relatively mature player base. Can play for free if you can stand the grind punishment.CONS:Gear acquisition until you have a maxed out character is very punishing! If you're used to Warcraft dungeons, where you can get all the gear you need that matches your level running  dungeons, you're going to be frustrated. Dungeons AT YOUR LEVEL, are DIFFICULT for a group, YOUR LEVEL. So you're basically left with hoping you have some maxed level freinds to run you through, over and over. Which by that time, you've leveled past the gear you were after in the first place. The system really makes no sense.Getting groups at levels other than high levels is hard. Most players are maxed and have no incentive to help you with low level dungeons. They need to introduce player scaling and rewards so high level players are compelled to play low level dungeons.BIGGEST CON:  THE GRIND.It's the most punishing grind I've ever experienced- even if you purchase booster packs for 3x the XP. Now I only get to play an hour or two here and there and on weekends, but I've been playing about a year and my highest toon is 115 out of 165. People get around this by being ""power leveled"" by high level players- which is about as fun as teasing a cat with string... You're just there for idle chit chat while they blow mobs down- for hours....SUMMARY:One of my favorite games ever due to art, sounds, playstyle and difficulty. But it has serious flaws with helping and keeping new players interested (grind and grouping). Best summarized as an MMO Chess Game.			"

												Good:Combat is fun, especially with friendsThe world is very open allowing for exploration and training your skills well beyond your level (like mining and carpentry)All currency and item value is created and determined by the players, creating a unique market systemYou can wage war on other nations with more than just pvp, you can destroy their resources as wellBeing a bandit is actually helpful to other players, because they gain citizenship points for correcting your eco-terrorismBad:No one usually wages war. Most of the time everyone is friendsThere are no incentives to become a bandit other than for the hell of itGame suffers from imbalanced resources (using three logs to get one plank, and using 17 planks to make a box)experiencing minor, but consistent lag. Game seems to hickup ever couple minutes, or when pulling up the map/gathering resourcesSometimes creatures are labeled as “Busy” but aren’t doing anything, so you can’t get rid of them.Overall, a very good game and most issues I have with it can be solved if players start trying to kill eachother in-game.

When it was official you had restricted zone!!! This is awesome!!!Cons:-There is nothing like site with builds,which means you must experiment on your build or ask experienced player about it.-Fell little empty and unsocial because you see people and you walk around and when you go somewhere there is little chance you will see again same person.I back to this game when I started play it nearly 3 years ago and I will stay like 16 hours per day on it.infinity/10			"

												Pretty cool game, it's a MMORPG with very different mechanics from the rest, sorta like final fantasy tactics which adds some very needed variety to the genre.Character classes take the word unique to a whole different level, you can think of any typical archetype of a character and you won't find any of them in here.As a combat focused game you're also expected to progress through combat so expect some grinding, thankfully grinding doesn't involve right clicking a mob once and falling asleep while you repeat this 500 times for each 1%.

												I haven't put much time into MMORPGs, but I do like tactical strategy games, so Wakfu looked promising. However, the game seems extremely convoluted and unwelcoming to new players. The user interface is cluttered and full of irrelevant information.I could accept that as the habits and trappings of MMOs, but the tutorial itself seems to be buggy. I'm supposed to be gathering a bunch of flower seeds, but the game is refusing to count them as I harvest. Then the ""Report a Problem"" link locked up the game.I can't comment on the quality of the game, because I can't play it. It seems like Wakfu needed to be baked a while longer before release.			"

												I'd like to start saying my hours played isnt very accurate. I played via Wakfu launcher for much more than i did here.This game is a remake of a popular game known as Final Fantasy Tactics. a Square grid based, turn based tactical game.There are some great features of the game but most are overshadowed with extreme lacklustre support and game management. Ranging from hacks and exploits never being dealt with causing the entire auction house(market) to flood kamas into the game nulifying the years spent aquiring them. Top end-endgame gear being duplicated and flooding the system making them about as expensive as a level 20 set.Even dealing with the PKing system which is an absolute joke if you run into a kiddie that has nothing better to do then camp decent leveling zones ( such as A.W) and kill you for no reason hours on end. (Which wasnt really a problem  after a while because i just Ddos'd him anytime i needed to enter the zone again so my friends and I could atleast play the game hassle free.) Then there is the subscription issue. As a player that has been with Wakfu and Dofus for many years now and owns all DLC and content. My subscription has finally ran out and I am no longer able to enter most end-game zones to further progress my character. So I provided Wakfu with money to assist with producing new content for them to release the content and then make me pay again to play on it... Seems a bit stupid from a consumers prospective. My friends and I have now actually quit Wakfu due to extreme neglect from Management and lack of content advancements over the years.While i DO recommend this game for a new users for a few hours to pass some time. I do not however advise you to ever pay them for their lack of service and progress and just quit once it gets a little boring after a hour or two.PS. There is a reason the ""Bug and Issues"" forum is bigger than the ""General Disucssions"" forum..			"

												Wakfu. The name alone makes people cringe like, you don't even want to go there.In the beginning there was Dofus, and I'd be lying if I said all was well.Dofus was the first of its kind, back when Steam actually made games and we were all little younglings playing 'Gunz: The duel'. Dofus was an interesting beast because unlike conventional play to win games at the time, Dofus was an over glorified demo of an MMO back when other MMO's thought they could actually stand up to the likes of Everquest and World of Warcraft.As time went on, many of us old guard who rememered the awful, oppressive treatment at the hands of Anakama had moved on and seemingly so had a large enough portion of the playerbase that a sequel was in order!A strange move indeed, making a sequel only a few years after your base product had launched. Wakfu of course is that sequel. Well it was announed years before it arrived and that signalled only the beginning of its issues. Not as late as Duke Nukem Forever but late enough to miss its own funeral because Wakfu is effectively dead.I say effectively because the servers seem to still be online, probabaly with the funding from the first game and piggy backing on those servers too no doubt.Dofus became a franchaise even having its own cartoon series over in France and its nice that we have a game filling this cutesy on the surface but brutally difficult when you play niche, but Wakfu is an MMO and with so few people around to play with, it just falls apart.But lets go back in time! What about when there WERE people to play with? Dofus was still a better game! Its like they took out all the things in Dofus that demanded teamwork and made Wakfu a 1 player game with online connectivity.Some people may like that idea but remember that this game was born from an MMO; it is akin to World of Warcraft having a World of Warcraft 2, still set in Azeroth only now its a one player twin stick shooter. It might be good on its own merits but we can't ignore the dramatic shift and we know the old crowd, the ones most likely to even want a sequal are going to feel very alienated.That is Wakfu. Welcome to Wakfu.Now all that aside is the game even good? Well the animations are fantastic, no really they are a joy to look at! The music...Well it exists. Yeah no one track really adds much which is a shame. The graphics are once again top notch like the animation and looking at the world around you isn't breath-taking like in Dark Souls or anything like that but they look great. Real dediction went into every art asset.Wakfus biggest failings are not even its own fault. Communities grow and wain as new products come out to tempt the crowds. Anakama are terrible at customer support but that is more of an 'outside of the game' issue. The music might lack pepper but that is very minor indeed. Really I don't recommend Wakfu but only for 1 reason and that reason is that its old! I don't mean old games suck, not in the least but what I mean is the community is effectively gone, its like Guildwars, which is a fantastic game, but going into Lions arch and having no one to play with, well it is the death kneel for an ""MMO"" and while people are playing Wakfu, the vast community has long since moved on and when I played I found barely anyone to interact with, even my screenshots were barren of life when I took them.What a shame.If you and enough of your friends can populate the game, you may have fun. If however you are looking to play this game in order to make new friends then move on, their is nothing to see here.Join Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews "

												Years ago, this game was roughly 5% F2P. You could hardly do anything. It was fun but so incredibly limited. Now that it's ~95% F2P, you can do pretty much everything. So far, the only thing I've seen in-game that costs real money is an account-share vault that allows you to store items to be used by all characters on your account. A huge improvement from what I saw so long ago.The fighting style is very similar to Final Fantasy Tactics, one of my favorite games of all time. Play with friends or else you'll feel lost in this big, confusing world. You can solo but it's a lot easier with friends and the game seems to lean heavily on party play.I'd rate this game a 9/10 with a half point deduction because of repeatition (which is in pretty much every RPG) and another half point deduction because it's not as fun to solo. I highly recommend you play with friends.			"

												I am, by no means, a long time player nor have I ever actually been into the animation/show that is related to this game. I could be considered the average player.I do not actually think the game is very bad. I just don't think that at this point there is a good reason to pick the game up other than curiosity. It's free so if you are looking, yeah give it a try.Graphics are good, but just good. The style all fits together well, but things started to feel just a little samey after only a bit. Even still I say good. I enjoyed them at least. I love the stylization and I have always been into the pointy ears and stuff like that. (I'm prolly biased in that regard) I also have the complaint that although grid based and isometric, some of the graphics had me confused as to where I resided spatially. Because there wasn't a lot of shadowing to indicate it, I'd rarely find myself wondering if I was up or down. The ui was smaller and not really appealing to me. Felt too generic and made it hard for me to read/see even if I tried to adjust settings.Controls were...meh. I think this is fair bit of a problem for me. Sometimes I'd click to go somewhere and the character wouldn't move. I also didn't like that you have to click. AWSD or w/e could work if done right and would be more comfortable for the game especially over longer distances. Also aiming in combat is really obnoxious. Like really obnoxious. Once you understand that you can see where you're aiming by looking at the grid/cell and seeing if it's highlighted things work out, but it's still weird.Story/lore I didn't really find myself following. You can increase the size of the chat text, but not the boxes and the text in them? On higher resolution I feel like something is lost in trying to communicate via text when the text itself is difficult to read or not really expressive or interesting. The presentation just didn't grab me. Not to mention that I found it difficult to even find the story.That kinda brings me to a big point I wanna make. This game's presentation is not good. Yes the graphics and such are appealing as I said, but knowing what you're supposed to be doing at any given time can sometimes be vague or just completely confusing. Now I'll USUALLY take my time to learn a game and in this scenario I did, but even still sometimes I will log into the game and just stand there trying to figure out exactly what I should be doing or what I even want to do.Alright so arguably the most important part is the gameplay/combat. It's all turn based but every turn in the game has  a time limit. This is probably the thing that bugs me the absolute most about this game. It's TURN BASED and there is a time limit? I can understand in multiplayer, but there is really no reason when soloing and even parties should just be able to configure that. Really hurts my time spent on the game because I can't really THINK about what I want to do or learn while I fight. I have to fight, guess and then learn after. Then fight again and sometimes I'll forget and try to look while fighting and then be rushed to finish my turn.Now that that complaint is out of the way, the meat of combat is pretty great actually. I like how it works and I like the idea behind most of the abilities and combinations. With Iop there are a few combos you can do that trigger off one another and cause more damage or effects that help you and I like that. I also like that some abilities cost movement to use and that you can store up some charges. I like that you get boosts after a certain number of turns (but feel like there could be more to that system). It also felt awkward having a giant sword and not using it. I do want to note that there was a certain...weirdness about combat that I couldn't put my finger on, but never really made me upset in any way. As I mentioned before I haven't played the game super seriously so I don't have 'high level' experience so I don't know what all is up there if there is anything. I feel like I learned how my class functions though a long time ago and that not much new would be introduced. I also didn't really get a sense of the point of grouping and in an MMO isn't that the point? Otherwise you're just playing a single player game with others walking around and if that's the case why the hell is there a timer on the turns? I would have liked more synergy with others and more clarity to the abilities. Mostly you play solo, but you can have some NPCs in your party or other players. There is also the option of playing with your other characters! I LOVED that idea. Unfortunately it's behind a cash shop. Disappointing to say the least. Not just that but it's expensive AND monthly. Seriously wtf. I have been waiting for more games to do this, or for phantasy star 2 to come west, and now it's done and it's behind a freaking monthly pay wall. What the hell? I GENUINELY may have been more interested in the game if I could play with myself (yeah, yeah w/e) and I understand that group content like dungeons should be group content, but when adventuring and just chilling (which is really the best experience I have with the game is playing it while chilling) having the oppurtunity to play with my own characters really seems awesome. I MIGHT be convinced to pay like 5-10 dollars to UNLOCK the capability to group with myself, but not for one slot and certainly not for a limited time.Just to put it on record the classes I played were Eniripsa, Sacrier, Ecaflip, Foggernaut and Iop. Iop was my favorite.Anyway I might go back and play it at some point, but I really feel like the game cripples itself with a few too many mediocre game design decisions and some annoying business ideas. Still, I LOVE the idea of the game and I adore the art style! I genuinely want to like the game more and often find myself wondering what could have been. Turn based strategy MMO... so close and yet so far.Hey if you're on the fence though, it's free. No reason not to give it a try...except maybe if the DAMN LAUNCHER WANTS TO CRASH REPEATEDLY. No for real, give it a try at least.			"

												I'd heard about this game before, and decided to give it a shot.  Between the absolutely terrible tutorial on my first session, and the failure to connect through steam on my second session, I don't recommend it.   The characters are cute, but as with many MMO's, the story is so nonexistent as to be pointless.  Whether RPG or tactical, I come to an MMO for the story.  That story should be something that engages ME, and the character I've created, too, not just some authors' buttpatting himself and his side characters.  I should know my character's role in the game, and what the plot basis is, within the first ten minutes of playing.  In that regard, this is a complete failure.  I played for over and hour, and had no idea.  I finally got to a cinematic, and it wouldn't play.  What I've seen of the anime is also so deeply geared toward making you want to play the game, that it burns the heart and soul out of anyone who loves animation in its own right.  The anime is to this game, what My Little Pony was to their toys, back in the 80's.  It's just self-aggrandizing garbage, made SOLELY TO GET CHILDREN TO BUY INTO A PRODUCT LINE.  It's the kind of thing that knocks the world of animation to the stone age.  In a period where there are a ton of folks trying to elevate animation into an art form and a craft, people are still shoveling out cartoons like Wakfu, which exist only to be advertisements, and they destroy the credibility those people have worked so hard to build.  Shame on everyone with their hands on it!  The art is beautiful, I won't lie, but they essentially sold their soul, and far too cheaply, at that.If you're feeling in an MMO mood, go play WoW, EVE, or Guild Wars 2.  You want FFT style tactics, then just go replay FFT.			"

												First ImpressionsWell i haven't played a MMORPG for a few years now. GW2 was the last, but also played in the day LOTRO, Metin2, Linage II, and a few others can't seem to remember. So after, i installed the game which didn't tell me exactly the file size of the actual game (not the starter), I started where all should start - Tutorial. And sure enough I was like WTF?!Tutorial if anything is anything but a tutorial - they obviously expect players to know how to play the game straight off the bat. What was bad is the mechanics... ie choosing a tile behind the character is sticky unless you zoom in. One has to guess what each button on the keyboard is for straight away - So understanding the hotkeys is all guess work. Even then, the setup for the hotkeys is .... defined for one way.Kind of reminds me of Final Fantasy Tactics, with a Baulder Gate Overview where you cannot rotate the screen, but a Borderlands feel of graphic design. I don't know if this is suppose to be a mixed of some cartoon or Kungfu Panda but it doesn't grab me. But appears to be another Cash Grab FreemiumsUnless you want to slog it out farming for wheat for over a few hours and then move onto the next item just so you can build something else. And the fact that I have all the stuff that I can't even sell to a NPC or buy ♥♥♥♥ from a NPC is annoying. I couldn't even work out how to setup shop for when I logout, i read forums but still no step by step instruction on how to do it.Does this game have potential - sure, any game does. But, by the time I got to level 11 I was wishing I didn't even bother with this. Maybe someone might lend me hand/ear/nose in the right direction but really - I am not bothering. Forcast for deletion in 5 days time.			"

												Love the show, don't love the game.Improvements I think that are worth my time:*Making dungeons playable with a single character*Balancing outside mobs      (EVEN in the STARTING AREA a level 6 and level 3 are easier to kill than a level 3 and level 5 cause the level 5 can spam heals and the level 3's AI tells it that if it gets hit run on a tile that heals every enemy, for a noob and even a returning player when your trying to do the early level grind it will kill you if you are not careful and they are the starting area mobs, like really?)*Don't give stat point control to your player classes        (YOUR NOT DARK SOULS, you have a level cap and rng on good equipment making players rethink the points they spend constantly)*Don't have a spell level up system if you keep having to fix it         (After playing tons of other mmorpgs, seeing a xp grind system slapped onto spells(skills) makes the game punishing when after hours of grinding you find out that one spell in your build becomes pointless and should be switched out.)*Lower the drop rate on emotes or any cosmetic items        (If I can't play the guitar in battle then it does NOT need to instill the faith I have of the sheer chance of a werewolf trying to dry hump my leg before it ever thinks about droping.)*Cut all the grinding for xp in half         (Oh I don't mean like get rid of the xp booster, keep those and make them give even more xp than before! I understand you got to make a living but people who can't invest in alternate characters without a booster makes them jump ship to another game.)*Fix your REPORT FEATURE         (I think they still haven't fixed the bug that makes your computer freeze the screen almost every 5 seconds of character movement.)Til then enjoy having the Nox server look like a ghost town. Really is looking more empty everyday I get back on.			"

												I don't have any play time Via Steam because I've been playing it for months via Ankama. This is an extremely fun game, with quite a lot to do. from dungeons to professions, challenges, quests, and its getting bigger and better every day, While the customer support at times is lacking. the game is amazing. full of comedy, and also peverse sense of humor can be found in almost everything, from the monsters drops to the equipment, some of them are just outlandish, take a look at the Tofu Rump monster drop if you don't believe me, its a literaly A hole lol.The game has a political system, with an ever changing ecology for every zone, containing plants, crops, tree's ore and mosnters. all of which are depleted / maintained through players, and naturally occuring reproduction ( you can watch some Gobball / Tofu porn while you wait for spawns :D lols ) and a weather system, while not entirely visual, its presentm and affects growth rates of plants. all in all, I would very readily reccomend this game for anyone interested in an mmorpg with tactical grid based combat.

												Wakfu is a great open world MMORPG, it has a variety of characters who bring different aspects to combat and exploration. Wakfu gives you the ability to choose your own play style and professions, Farming, Baking, Cooking, Mining, Forging, Fighting. The stats, levels and customization system is awesome, there are so many options you can choose from and it does not restrict your choices.			"

												What is the point of this game? Grinding quests? Gaining levels using the same spells from lvl 1 to 21? There is no bank, merchants or spellshops. Just user economy, everybody wants alot of cash to sell you stuff you have. So you get the gear you loot. Bad loot. Kept throwing away everything because my inventory became full and nobody wanted to buy it and I couldnt use it. Spent most of the game planting trees and crop to be able to plant better crop and trees. And killing stuff inbetween. Pointless...			"

												My hour in game was spent planting bunnies and not knowing the what F to do. I suppose the fighting style is Final Fantasy like but that was not enough for me to push through the bunny planting and lack of direction this game has. With FF:Tactics being one of my favorite games of all time I could not reccomend this game to a fan; or to anybody for that matter. In summary, you better be on lots of drugs or 5 years old to enjoy this game.			"

Game itself has very interest of possible characters, you have find out, to me seems major of mobs are bit corrupted or non corrupted, Could we attack not-corrupted? or that just mean? Seems you have finish lengthy tutorial in order to be free of directions in or be free play? I don't know when that is. More like game that keeps giving. You could keep playing forever and ever but updates make me question lot of things. I had uninstall because there was strange bug, flashed screen all over the place. I took photo crashing right in middle of 1st dungeon.  It then proceed as safety mechanism to log me out.

												Dont play this game on Steam. I couldnt even get it to work. Im about to try it from their website and use that downloader but who knows.The game's installation went fine no problems. But when I started playing, I chose to go through the tutorial, made my character and then nothing. It said it created the character but I wasnt taken anywhere other than back to the main menu. I went back to my character list and the character I had JUST created is now gone.I said ♥♥♥♥ it and skipped the tutorial, chose Eliatrope, created him, and the same exact thing happened. Character gone and im not even in the game. That basically made it unplayable for me and when I tried to send in a bug report or something, I was just given a black screen. I dont know what happened but this game through Steam is unplayable.I was so excited to play it too after I saw the showWish me luck with the version from their website although it might not be much better			"

												Dont play this game on Steam. I couldnt even get it to work. Im about to try it from their website and use that downloader but who knows.The game's installation went fine no problems. But when I started playing, I chose to go through the tutorial, made my character and then nothing. It said it created the character but I wasnt taken anywhere other than back to the main menu. I went back to my character list and the character I had JUST created is now gone.I said ♥♥♥♥ it and skipped the tutorial, chose Eliatrope, created him, and the same exact thing happened. Character gone and im not even in the game. That basically made it unplayable for me and when I tried to send in a bug report or something, I was just given a black screen. I dont know what happened but this game through Steam is unplayable.I was so excited to play it too after I saw the showWish me luck with the version from their website although it might not be much better			"

												This game has a lot of potential. Too bad it doesn't make any use of it.The combat is fun. It's different than what most games do, it's pretty tactical. It lasts you for about 2 days, because it gets repetitive fast. Why? Well there are a lot of classes, they are pretty different from each other, you can really find one for you. Each class has 3 branches of abilities, depending on element you will be using.While you have up to 15 active abilities you will only use about 2-3(at most) from them, since there aren't many situational skills, there are just those that do more and less damage. You don't want to mix abilities between branches, because that means less damage(best gear gives element based +%damage). Skills in the same branch usually have the same range, so you're stuck with either long range or close combat once you choose. And that's not a bad thing right? Well, no, but once again, you're stuck with using 2 skills because the others deal less DPS.It doesn't help that you kill the same enemies over and over again, because the game is so empty that finding a group for a dungeon is nearly impossible, except for the most popular dungeons, and even then it's problematic.Most people meet in starter area,which is pretty populated. After you get to your nation, you're pretty much playing single player with someone passing you by every once in an hour.At least the crafting system looks nice, after choosing to become an area of effect weapon smith I was greeted with message that I won't be able to harvest materials, and will have to buy them from lumberjacks and miners. Wish I had some kind of warning before I chose my profession, but okay, I'm fine with that, the system looks great! This means that what I make will surely have buyers, because if you're a lumberjack you won't be able to make those weapons. If you're a baker you will buy my weapons and I will buy your bread. That's awesome! Finally someone did it right.Except I still could harvest. I could chop down the trees and gather iron ore from deposits. I could learn all the professions and create anything I needed myself.Instead of having good economy based on supply and demand, they screwed it up completely. You want to be a baker? Well you better be a farmer too, because otherwise you would have to pay for the flour. It's fun for about 2 days, after that you have tried all classes, finished the Astrub(starter zone) quests 10 times, and there's no point in moving to main land, since there's no people there.That's a shame.

												The tutorial is compltely broken. To progress a player needs to plant some seeds but they aren't able to because ""area is full"". The solution to this problem is to have some players that somehow found a square among about 9243847 different tiles where he/she can plant the seeds, gain the ability to fight mobs, and pretty much grind eternally so others can progress.Edit:The grind also barely does anything so you'll be stuck there for a while.

												This game has a pretty unique turn based, tactical gameplay which is actually kind of fun. What makes it tactical is the fact that you might block other players view, you have a limited amount of steps you can take per turn, and stuff like that.It also has an interesting ecological system in which you can take part. To take part in it you can plant new trees, spawn new enemies, plant crops and of course harvest all this stuff, etc.BUT if you are looking for something like a ""classic"" MMORPG with straight questlines you might want to try another game because this game is a pure grinder. Except for the starting zone there are like no quests. All you do is to go from one group of enemies to another. While doing so, do not expect to meet any other players.All in all, I'd say that this game has a great potential because the tactial fighting system is a lot of fun but there are hardly other players except for the starter city but still there are like a 100 servers. What ruins the game for me is the lack of quests.			"

												Pretty decent game but I definitely wouldn't spend any money on it. The mechanics and whatnot are decent as well but it's designed for co-op play really. Solo players will have fun but some content is designed for co-op only, which is quite sad because it means you cant experience certain game content without friends or grouping up - and we all know what a pain grouping up is, which is why most MMO's fail (the dumb kids of course). It does entertain you, but if you are looking for a serious and fulfilling way to spend time gaming I strongly suggest something else.			"

												I tried, I really tried to get into this game. But here is my perspective:The game is quite nice but I do not reccomend this to brand new players. It really is not new player friendly, and the dungeons are very difficuly for new players. You need patience to play this game.It is turn based, and the combat system is unique but what made me (as a new player) leave this behind were:Dungeons that are puzzle based, really give you zero hints on how to beat it. You are forced to use google on this and you cannot leave a battle unless you quit the game. Other tactical based mmos allow an ""escape"" feature if the battle is too tough or you need to leave, this however does not.  This right here is a red flag for me.Another feature that didn't really keep my interest is the quest system. For new players, if you log off, you have to manually try to find your quest destination as most do not give you a compass (quest tracking tracing feature).So in summary:Pros____Unique battle systemTons of classesSmall Patch and DownloadCons____Not new player friendly.Map layout can be confusing for new players.Google how to beat puzzle dungeons (new players).No hints on puzzles from in-game.Can't leave in the middle of a battle without logging out. (no escape or flee chance option).Overall: Do tons of research and look up guides if you are new to Wakfu. If you are a veteran, then jump right in.New player perspective: 3/10			"

												Very dissapointing.There were loud gongs everywhere, and I couldn't figure out how to assign any passive skill points, and for some reason there was a 30 second timer on turns that made it super hard to even read all the abilities, and it stuck me in a server full of cane toads and it looked like I'd need to grind forever to to even unlock a party. Soo everything they could do to form a ♥♥♥♥ poor first impression they went ahead and did.Plus, lets face it, a hex based tactics game where you only control one unit is probably flawed from the outset.At least the puzzles that led up to the first boss were nice.

												A charming game - initially.Cash shop is more cosmetic than gameplay - except for boosters to xp and drops.Combat is a plus , its highly tactical , full of MANY skills  with a broad array of tactics to use depending on the skills you choose to develop. Many different stats affect gameplay.There are no NPC's. Players will have to barter or trade for any ingame currency. This can be a blessing or a curse depending how it is implemented in a game and how a games economy is setup. In wakfu , this is a curse.Wakfu suffers from an extraordinarily handicapped economic system. There is a central auction house however most things cost 1-20 / ea , ingame currency. If those things are even listed. It is cavernously empty most of the time. Many items run 20,000 - 20,000,000. Prices vary wildly , not because of some economic principle , but because there is a large glut of equipment left over from those whom are ""Leeched"" through most of the games levels to level 105 by already established guilds. If your a new players who does not wish to interact with or play marco polo trying to discover who the major guilds are - Good luck.  The player base is sharply divided between old veteran players (commanding in some instances hundreds of millions of ingame currency) , whom are largely silent and meandering new players who dont seem to understand what todo or where togo and whom appear to be largely confused.Leveling is fun ....... the first 50 times you encounter mobs.  Once you realize exactly how much grinding is entailed you begin to understand the presence of xp pots in the ingame item mall - and why new players are encouraged simply to quit the game if they cant find an active guild which they can tag along with during higher end repetitive runs. Seriously , I was told this several times.  Respec'ing your character? Is considered an act of god in this game. An occassion so special that it requires no less than 1400 items spread across 8 different mob types which must be killed to gather at a pace of about 1-3 per encounter (Not kidding). Even THIS can only be done every 30 days.  Act of god? Or act of marketing? You decide.  Oh and if your a new player - you can expect these encounters to last anywhere from 5-10 mins , EACH.   For a game as complex as wakfu is with so many different tactics to try - to have such a choke hold on simply redistributing points you earned through gameplay is rediculous in the least in my opinion. It is clearly a money grabbing effort.  Almost no information is available for many of the classes , many posts date back to 2012 - some so far as 2011 - so one is never sure whether the information you are getting is upto date or not.  The game is updated semi-frequently however , going so far as to literally change the stats on sets of armor between updates***     Have fun with that!Despite all of this?  Im still playing it. Glutton for punishment? Likely.			"

												ya baaa not good the only reason they made this game is because of the anime and the anime wasent even doing good.This has to be one of the worst games. the fighting dosent even seem fun at all you go up to it hit it and its dead it dosent even twich the only things they update was what happened in the anime.  Sence the anime finished they stoped updateing the game and theres like no one playing this anymore it looking better in anime 100% and more beautiful and the quest tracker sucks balls.  ya if it tells you GO KILL SWETTY BALLS where is swetty balls and you go search for a hour and still cant find swetty balls.  the biggest snitch about this is XD you need to do things in the game to get more classes ya like in gonna go back and do a class that has a pet  and dose 4 DAMGE.  This game is crap they should remove it from steam no one bothers with it anymore probbly not even the developers. overall in my way its 3/10 the artstyle is not good (Was 2014 the year that everything looked like it was real and had over 1000 graphics and chould make you speachless) and i call BS too the story  STORY: you warp in too a place that looks like a kid made it up when he was dreaming you greated by a FAT ♥♥♥ PANDA that calls you a noob ya i started but dont have to be a ♥♥♥♥.

												My experience playing WAKFU;Decides to play as an archer, doesn't start with ranged weapon...ok, I think, maybe I'll get one later.1 hour in, past tutorial...gets another tutorial and gets tutorial equipment which amounts to armor, no ranged weapon.3 Hours in, try to craft a ranged weapon...not allowed to collect any resources while being a ""Weapons Master"" oh...that's rich, wish the game told me before I chose to try and craft a ranged weapon...don't have the materials and no one in town has them either...why do I not have a ranged weapon yet? WHY CAN I NOT COLLECT RESOURCES ANYMORE!? Why would you not tell me this BEFORE I choose a profession!? Your tutorial sucks!4 hours in, getting annoyed that I STILL DO NOT HAVE A RANGED WEAPON EVEN THOUGH I PICKED THE ARCHER CLASS. No money to buy any ranged weapons, no general stores to be found to even buy basic equipment having to pray to the gods that someone threw a bow on the ground to sell...still no ranged weapon...Nearly 6 hours in, encounter a glitch that made the pizza larva mini game strike against me even if I do everything the game asks of me...oh and still no bloody ranged weapon, got some spells but I am equiped like an axeman. Did I mention I STILL DONT HAVE A RANGED WEAPON!? Because I dont!I wanted to share my experience because it seemed the only way I you could feel my pain.What is the point of being a ranged class if they don't even give you want you need to be the class YOU ARE TRYING TO BE! Something is wrong here...why would you do that? Why would you force a ranged class into melee for so long? Not even a starter weapon for the class, I would of settled for a bag of rocks at this point. At least it's ranged, at least I would of got to put my strengths to some use. Why does the game only explain I'm locked out of something else after I learn it? Can I even unlearn professions? I don't know, the tutorial sure didn't say anything about it...hell, if I could ask NPC's in the starting town how stuff works I wouldn't have a problem with this...but that's not an option! You just get a text box telling you some vague things about what you did, and basically laughs at you because you didn't know before hand. The Souls series has better tutorials then this game, and that is the most bare bones tutorial I've seen ever...yet it told me more information then this game did. How do you do that!?			"

												The game seemed great and I personally appreciate the tactical aspect of it.BUT!There is no Auction House of any sort. You won't find any NPC vendor either. The only way you can sell your trash items is to place your own trading booth... Oh wait you cannot move without the booth disappearing... SNAP!What is more some quests give you little or no explanation of what they want you to do in order to complete it successfuly. Just go figure it out yourself mate.As much as i love candy-like anime-ish cutesy games this one just doesnt go well with my picky nature. Concept 8/10 Gameplay 4/10			"

												So, well, I might not be in the best position to rate this game, but when you have to spend ungodly amounts of time finding free spots to plant monsters because the game wasn't made to accomodate more than a few players, you are bound to lose the players who refuse to spend the first hour of their game time running around doing nothing but wait.I haven't played anything but the intro, so this is in no way something that should be regarded as a ""the game sucks"" post, but I'm just saying, a game which has no idea how to accomodate several players probably has more of these faults than would be acceptable.Perhaps in a year or so, when they realize how to make games for more than 1 player at the time it will be worth coming back.

												My review will simply be about things I wish people had told me before I clicked 'install' on this:1.) THERE ARE NO VENDERS TO SELL JUNK TO. Too much junk? Throw it on the ground. Click 'Ok' on popup. Did it have a little hammer icon on it? Whoops, looks like it was needed to craft some crap somehow. No big deal, was probably 1 of 90 of the item needed.2.) GOOD LORD THERE IS A LOT OF CRAFT GRINDING. Let's say you wanted to wanted to make a 'Ham Sandwich' so you got +2% damage for 15 minutes (in a turn-based game). In WoW, you'd butcher some mobs and buy some salt and then cook over a fire pit and *BAM* 'Ham Sandwich' ... but not Wakfu. Nope. Go grind mining until you mine raw salt, make 3 raw salt into ""Refined Salt' and then go out in the field and skin some mobs for meat. Hope you leveled skinning! Go farming for wheat. Make 3x wheat into flour. Draw some water. Bake the bread. Cook the Sandwich. Each of those skills, the Mining, Skinning, Farming, Baking, Cooking... are all separate skills with a METRIC TON of grind and there's a FAILURE CHANCE as you're crafting. ALL THAT FOR A SANDWICH BUFF THAT WILL BE OVER IN 1-2 COMBATS. Since there's no vendor to sell crap to once you're done, you either throw it on the AH (Governor sets a tax!) and it come down after 24 hours or you put that trash right on the ground because your bags are full.3.) SPACE FOR ALL THE MATERIALS. There's no low-end bag vendor. You get two quest bags early on, but you'll fill up soon and the ""You're too full"" popups always have a ""Are you sure?"" annoyance chaser. Nobody makes low-end bags on the Auction House, so you're left stumbling through a horrible crafting system. Often, you'll need stuff from Tailor, Tanner, AND Armor crafting lines to get an item made... and the next upgrade will need you to make 3x-10x more of those AND use dungeon boss drops. Don't forget the failure chance! Or you can spend $1USD on 9-slot bags or $3-$10 on bank slots.This game could easily be the MMO equivalent of a 'F-ville' game. You can walk anywhere without being attacked and just grind material collection. This could honestly be the best Mother & Son, Farming & Killing crossover game of all time... but that'd be such a rare niche thing to hit. If this was Steam Market-able, then you could play the game with all sorts of loot and then sell it or trade it on the market once you'd decided it was way to grinding and directionless... but you can't. Meanwhile, Ankama totally wants you to spend $10 on character pimping, $10 on functional stuff, and then $6 every 30 days on a 'booster pack' for XP boost and access to subscriber content.The last thing I can say is about the class I played. Sram. I HATED the character design of the Sram, but it did what I wanted. I hate, Hate, HATE the character design. It's a stupid sugar skull design tattoo'ed on a WoW troll, complete with troll witch-doctor hat. But you may think ""Well, weren't there cosmetic outfits or at least armor for characters?"" Well yes. But all the other characters have on short-shorts or just panties, so 99% of the outfits are designed to leave the legs bare. The stupid Sram is in a bone-print onesie, which bleeds through every outfit but one. And there's no reason given! None! There's no ""Oh, they have to wear this crap or their souls won't go to Sramville!"" ... it's just ""We didn't make pant-armor in the game so nothing ever covers that up?""			"

												Seems to be alright. There aren't enough games in the same style as Final Fantasy tactics.However, this game seems to be one of those that is rather selective in where it plays.As several other people exclaimed, this game does not even start after clicking the shortcut on Desktop. On my end, my PC even froze up and stopped responding until I hard-reset'd it.I'd have loved to test it, but no game is worth it having my PC freeze up for an undetermined amount of time.			"

												The game was ok when it first came out I've sunk hundreds of hours into it but with each new patch comes new bugs and suprisingly enough the issues i had when i first started playing are still around today such as immense lag. The delay in my text appearing on screen is almost 5 minutes long you dont want to know what its like in a battle.I don't have these issues in any other games other then wakfu even their prior game Dofus which has been around for 10 years isnt laggy. How this got on Steam i will never know.They keep bringing out more new cool things with each update but never actually work on the current issues not to mention their customer service is absolutley shocking. Countless threads have been made in the forum regarding issues with the game and they have gone unheard or simply ignored for YEARS! There is an issue that every person has ingame where they will start to freeze up at around the 3 hour mark of playing if not sooner. But as ankama doesnt bother fixing this long time running issue the players see it as a normal thing and actually accept that they have to restart their client every hour or two just to keep playing.. What if your in a high level dungeon and all of a sudden start experiencing these freezes. I know for a fact my guildmates have become frustrated to the point where they quit as have I.I came back to check it out as I saw it was on Steam but I am very dissapointed.The game has picked up in popularity due to its Steam release but alas I still think its not worth the time invested, As like me you will get a high(ish) level character invest money in the game and then it slaps you in the face and becomes unplayable.Also purchase Ogrines at your own risk there are multiple reports of people not recieving their Paid for Currency and as Ankama take so long to reply you may be waiting over a week to hear back.. I literally yesterday recieved a response to a ticket I posted LAST YEAR!			"

												I have played this game since close beta, about 2 years ago maybe?, then open beta, and then pretty much for a year.As some reviews say, and they are right, the worst enemy of the game is Ankama itself. It changes core features of the game with patches, and patches are common; it changes classes, changes skills, items, most of the times it makes them all obsolete.I remember playing a sacrier back then when the game got ""full"", i spent months building him tank, a lot of months and time, the GRIND... What happened next? Ankama decided to nerf every skill of the Earth Sacrier... ok, so i can live with that... what happened next? There was ONLY ONE BOSS that COULD USE an Earth Sacrier that was build IN ONLY ONE WAY... so i was obsolete/useless. Pretty much 8 months wasted.I dont even want to start with the loot.The Game Art its beautiful, lovely, i really like it. The gameplay, is good, sometimes the fights are intense. Some fights can change with just a blink, you may thought you already won the fight, but then something happens, like a critical, and it changes everything. It can improve drastically, it can learn from really good RPGs like Final Fantasy Tactics, but overall its ok.Classes balances where ok back then, but as i said, Ankama HATES this game and its players.I encourage you to try the game because it has A LOT of potential, and hope someday Ankama dies, Square Enix dies, and a good developer gets its hand on it. Sorry i dont want to offend anyone from those companys.			"

												Confusing as hell. How kids find their path in this game is beyond me. I have a level 5 quest and it's impossible to find where the location is. Games which make you alt-tab to go Wiki or google aren't worth playing in my book. The controls are very akward. You click and run and click and run. Or hold and the toon does a mix of running and walking. It just looks off and feels like you're driving a car with 4 flat tires. Pressing the action keys feels delayed, and non responsive. Very very very annoying to play. Installing a Free2Play title is like hiring an employee knowing he's insane, it's an tragedy waiting to happen.			"

The U.I. seems like it was designed by someone who has suffered a traumatic head injury.  The pace was glacial and even with climate change this is not fast.  I suppose that some people will probably like it but then again some people like 'Two Girls One Cup' as well.  Try it but I think the only result will be another scathing review on Steam.			"

												I played this game when it was on the open beta.The game was fun, addicting and crowded.Now its left with hacks, bots, scammers and a few dedicated players who somewhat manage to go through the game remake which in my opinion, was the coup de grace on this game.The game has already very few skills and combos, like 3 elements for each class, 4 skills for each element and a class passive related skills, in a total of 16 skills, from lvl 1 to 200, the same over and over again.But now, its like 8 skills, including the passives.Plus, since its release, there was no new classes added, barely a new contect now and then, must of the stuff are cash content, and prepare your mind to the grindfest. GL with that, i ain't playing this crap again. "

												WAKFU is an amazing game about wandering around a fantasy landscape and murdering countless cats, chickens, and sheep until you realize what skills are. There are 15 unique class/race/mishmashes in WAKFU, but the only one worth using is the Blue Loli class, for they are the only ones who can harness the raw power of sheep. WAKFU features a beautiful selection of gorgeous armors, like sheep armor, and spiky sheep armor. Overall, I would recommend WAKFU to anyone who is a fan of sheep.10/10 it's like Skyrim with Guns - IGN9.5/10 Masterul Story - Metacritic8/8 m8 I r8 this b8 a perfect 8 no h8 - That guy in my English Class			"

												The anime for this game is great and explains a lot about the lore and class' but the game is far more difficult than what it lets on to be.First off the game is loaded with bugs and not the kind that can help the player early game.Secondly the begining quests are a tad bit far apart in levels as when i got to level 5 they sent me on a level 10 quest.Honestly this game could use a lot of work but how it is now i cannot reccomend it to anyone unless they enjoy mindless level grinding after each quest.On a more personal note that i do not let spoil my reviews; i hate games that let you customize your stats each and every level rather than the game just giving you whats balanced as to me that says the developer got lazy with the game			"

This Game is Extreamly Fun!After getting past the intro, learning some stuff on your own, and finding some friends, this game can be hours of fun! Also if you like the game go check out the animated series its just as good, or even better!			"

												I couldnt even get past tutorial. There was no arrows or something to help me do stuff. I was so confused. Game looks great though, but I wasted 20min already and i'm frustrated and sick of it. Its also annoying to move the character, why couldn't you use keys instead of clicks with mouse. This is by far the worst game as it takes to long to understand how to play the game. Also everyone on the game is soo small!!			"

												Only other MMORPG I quit within ten minutes besides Vindictus. Wakfu looks nice, it sounds nice (Except for the ""voices""), but this game is just real boring and the combat is dull. Then again I've been spoiled by Dungeon Fighter Online, and that game delivers the action packed fast paced fighting I thirst for, while Wakfu is like playing a weird mix of Ragnarok Online and Final Fantasy Tactics, but nowhere near as appealing as either.

												Do not bother with this piece of trash. I know this comes off as incredibly negative review but I was trying to curb my frustration with this game for the simple reason that I REALLY wanted to like this game. The genre is SO rare to find a good version of it that isn't plagued by utter stupidity.The BIGGEST and most SACRELIGIOUS issue with this game is the TIMER. Don't EVER make a tactics game with a timer. There's NEVER a reason to do this and it just rushes things.Now ... this wouldn't have been such a massive issue if it wasn't for the fact that everything is SO hard to understand. The translations aren't HORRIBLE, but the descriptions are rather ... vague and subpar. They make figuring out how abilities work and effect function more trial and error than actual reading and understanding. Which is made harder by a short turn timer.Then you have an opening tutorial that does nothing to grease new players into the game. This will be a grindy game, from beginning to end. And in all the weirdest ways. Grinds in the typical ways of course too, but weird ways like forcing yourself to learn a new game that fights against you because the genre is so promising and the like.It's very painful to see such a pretty game turn me away because of simple, outright, horrible execution. I sometimes wonder after playing a game like this .... Do these people even play their own game?			"
