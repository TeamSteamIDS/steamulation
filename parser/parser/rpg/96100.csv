												Defy Gravity is a platformer with a simple concept:  Get from point A to point B by creating attraction/repulsion areas.  The game is simple but fun, and provides a good challenge during the second half of the game.  It can be tricky but the checkpoints are placed in such a way that you're willing to take risks and try new ideas to get past some obstacle - a very important attribute for puzzle games.The only thing that is sub par is the animation (or lack of).  It isn't really needed, but the game has the GameMaker feel, a bunch of sprites just moving around the screen with a short walking animation, which I find kind of off putting.  It isn't important, but it should be mentioned.If you like physics manipulation games or platformers, then I recommend buying this.  The game is $3 at the time of this writing, more than worth it.

												It's hard not to recommend this, given that I made a 7 cent profit from buying the game then selling the cards... getting paid to play a game is never wrong. :-)But even ignoring that, I had a surprisingly good time with it. Defy Gravity is your basic puzzle platformer where you have to use an unusual mechanic to navigate levels. In this case, you can shoot gravity fields that attract you or repel you and activate a shield that lets you ignore all gravity fields. By mixing these, you can sort of rocket-jump-grapple-hook your way through levels. Some timed jumping and obstacles that sometimes are and sometimes are not affected by the gravity are there to stop your progress.In the words of a wise man, you're going to die. A lot. The game takes delight in throwing stuff in your way at just the wrong moment. But at the same time, it's surprisingly forgiving with how you swing around the level and you can often brute force your way through tight spots. ""Hectic"" is not a word you usually associate with puzzlers, but Defy Gravity can get pretty hectic -- and that's when it's arguably at its most fun. For me it hits just the right balance between frustration and challenge.The graphics and sound are absolutely nothing special, but in terms of pure gameplay, this is value for money even when it's not 90% off. When it is, of course, it's a no-brainer, just get it. :-) "

												I just bought it for cards admittedly (at $0.29), but I actually found it rather fun to play instead of just idling. The game is short so I have to say only buy it on a major sale, but well worth the time if these kind of games interest you.Gameplay wise it is a fun platformer, and does remind me a bit of Portal. It isn't an exact copy though, instead of Portals, you manipulate Gravity to repel and attract yourself and other objects. The momentum and physics of the game is fun to toy with, though it CAN be frustrating at times. Checkpoints are placed in fair spots of most stages to reduce frustration, but later stages stretch this out quite a bit so you will have to keep on your toes or be prepared to die again and again.I did beat the main story but I decided to leave before continuing deep into hard mode. It takes away one of your powers and while I do feel that's an interesting challenge, I'm satisfied with just beating the main modes.			"

OverviewDefy Gravity Extended is a small game, with only a few tricks, but does it very well. It lacks the flair of a quality game, but once you go in and try it, it certainly redeems itself. In this game, you play as a spacesuit wearing gravitymancer trying to pass the gauntlet. You are equipped with a gravity gun (not the HL type!) and have to traverse many levels to prove your worth!The Pros:Simple Concept - If you can make a simple game fun, you have succeeded as a developer. The game mechanics are very simple. You move about, and create two types of ""portals"". One that has a strong gravitational pull and one that repels objects. You can also activate a shield around you that negates any gravity effects. Leaving breaking the laws of physics aside, you must combine these simple actions in order to get yourself to the exit.Good Level Design - I'm not talking about the aesthetics, of course! I'm referring to the level layout, the challenges you face, their diversity, their difficulty. It impressed me how challenging this game became in later levels, without repeating itself throughout. The levels are many times relying on sinusoidal patterns and geometric arrays of projectiles!Challenging - The levels begin increasingly harder, and some are outright stressful. If you are looking for something to test your skill and patience with, you've come to the right place!Good Music - The background music is a nice relaxing tune that suits the space environment we are supposed to be in. Really helps ease out the stress from those hard levels.Cheap - The game is 0.99€ at normal price and can go all the way down to 0.09€ when on sale. So, just give it a try, it will cost you basically nothing. (Not to mention it has Steam Trading Cards)Achivements! - Few achievements, only requirement is passing the game. Sounds easy, huh? It's not, but good luck, hunters!The Cons:Ugly Visuals - The textures aren't eye candy and everything is flat and pixelated. While I'm not saying a game is good if it looks good, it wouldn't hurt getting a little face lift every now and then.Shabby Animations - The animations are barely existent, sometimes movement may seem plastic, especially the way your character tilts its body when looking at the cursor.Conclusion:Defy Gravity Extended is certainly not a game for everyone, so if you don't like skill-based platformers with minimal controls, then look elsewhere. If however, you like that sort of thing and still have the pocket change from grocery shopping, then consider giving it a go!If you enjoyed this review and want to see more of my work, consider joining my group and follow my curator page!

												Defy Gravity (henceforth known as DG) is an example of what a small indie game should be.Gameplay:Based on two types of gravity spheres, one pushing you away and one pulling you towards it. Using these you have to traverse levels and bounce/throw yourself across pits. Overall the gameplay is simple, standard WASD and mouse, plus having support for a controller. Graphics&Sound:What are you expecting out of an indie game? The sound is above average, as the music is pretty nice. The graphics are typical, though not bad enough to be annoying. The one complaint i do have with this game is that your character looks as if he's using a Super Soaker rather than a gravity gun. The Good: I got this when it was on sale for $.14 (yes, 14/100) and it was a nice, cheap pickup. It'll provide a good amount of fun.The Bad: The controls are a bit wonky and some of the levels require split-second reactions.Overall Grade: C+ Not Bad, but it's a small game, good to play if you got a few minutes to kill.

Fun gameplay for about 15 minutes2.) Alright music for a cheap indie game3.) Controller support (If you like that)4.) Really inexpensive alternative to the Portal franchiseCons:1.) Graphics could have been run through MSDos2.) Locked resolution3.) It's that kind of game you will play for fifteen minutes, beat it, and never touch again4.)

												Bought the game for 10 centsGot 20 cents by selling the game's trading cards10/10 would get free money againBut seriously, this game is a real gem.It's a simple platformer, where you have a gun that allows you to manipulate gravity, in order to get past the various stages that will get harder and harder, until a point where you will probably rage quit. I haven't finished the game, as i'm stuck in stage 5, but with enough effort you can finish it and feel the joy of completing such a difficult task.I'd say this game is well worth the full price for its gameplay, soundtrack and challenge, but you may as well wait for a promotion, as the price goes down an insane amount (around 90%).

												Defy Gravity Extended it's an indie game based in physics / gravity laws. It could looks like a horrible game. I mean art and animations are simple and it can feels empty, otherwise it's too challenging. You can feel that it's a 2D version of ""Portal"", you have a gun that has two functions, repel and attract.Something that i loved in this game was the relaxing background music that makes you relax during stressful levels.It has enough good levels and after finish it the nightmare haven't finished yet, you have to complete it twice in order to get all achievements, something that will make you rage.It's always on discount (95% off i guess), so if your style it's the challenges you can give it a chance.7.5 / 10If you found this review helpful you can find out more at our Completing the Backlog's Curator page.

												Decent puzzle and platformer game that involves placing gravity and anti-gravity wells strategically across hazards and obstacles Kara must travel across to reach the exit in every stage. There are approximately 21 levels altogether, plus the same 21 levels for the real Gauntlet mode where Kara may only place gravity wells. Although some levels can be frustrating due to the random and unpredictable movement patterns of some of the hazards, the game is forgiving and has checkpoint locations to enable instant retries at each checkpoint location along various intervals in each level.

												This game was a lot of fun and very reminiscent of the early 2000s online flash games, which gave me a wonderful nostalgic feeling all throughout the game. This puzzle-platformer is straightforward, however reaching your end goal can and will be difficult. The simplicity and correct execution of this game's design creates that unique feeling, where the player knows finishing this level is solely due to the player’s ability to perform. No game exploits, no grinding to get to a certain level or luck driven events. Just simple, skill-based levels with original and adaptive gameplay.Granted that not everyone is into 2D flash puzzle-platformers, this game may not be what everyone is looking for, however if you do purchase this game and give it the time of day, I think you might be pleasantly surprised at how much fun you'll have.Extra - The authentic soundtrack is very atmospheric and enjoyable.

												Tough platforming game, but worth the cheap price you can find it at, or especially when it goes on sale you can easily find it for less than a buck.  The goal, to reach the end of each level offering a different level of difficulty with different obstacles.  The gimmick, a double jump ability and an anti-gravity/well-gravity gun.  Using both of these while stagnant is easy though tricky, but when you have to use them while on the run can prove quite difficult and at times frustrating.  The hard mode features only the well-gravity gun.  Beating this latter mentioned segment proved really difficult and a true test of the puzzle and platforming skills.  I did find a few odd issues.  At times the screen would go black when loading or reloading a level.  Shooting would fix the problem, however, if the level was saved at a save point, you may need to act quickly, shooting and eliminating your gravity shot then moving forward when given limited time only added to the difficulty and when it's unnecessary difficulty, it made it really bad.  The graphics are simple, the sound and music forgettable, but it's the gameplay that wins this game a recommendation.Overall though, I did appreciate the tests and found the game worthy of playing and I do recommend it for you if you can deal with proper frustration and sometimes improper and unnecessary frustrations.

												Defy Gravity Extended is a puzzle platformer game where you play as Kara, a gravitymancer. You will use a gun that places gravity wells and anti-gravity wells. You will use them often to solve various puzzles throughout the game. Gravity well pulls you into its center, while anti-gravity wells repels you from its center.Defy Gravity Extended has a very unique game mechanic, it is quite different than most puzzle platformer games I've played. The soundtrack for this game is very nice and relaxing too. You can get 100% achievements just by finishing the game. I like that the game doesn't make you finish a level in a particular time so you won't be pressured while playing. The game has 24 levels and certainly doesn't lack in challenge. There is also a checkpoint system in the game, so if you die, you won't start from the beginning which is nice.However, for me, it is more frustrating than It is to enjoy while playing this game. The controls are a little bit difficult. I don't like the animation. The game looks very unappealing to me. The game lacks on the options menu. You can't adjust the game's volume at all, so you will need to change it from Windows or your speaker. It also lacks in resolution options too. The game at one point crashes, but it wasn't in a middle of a level. The story is pretty much non-existent.In conclusion, Defy Gravity Extended is a unique and very challenging game. But it is very frustrating to play. I don't enjoy this game very much, maybe because this game isn't for me. The price seems a little fair though. But I do not recommend buying this full price since it goes on sale quite often. I do recommend purchasing this game on sale because it's usually on sale for 90% off or more.			"

												This game was absolutely fantastic. It has an original concept, and good application. It was challenging, fun, infuriating at times, and immensely satisifying to complete. The storyline is relatively simple - as are the controls. You will almost always be able to understand how a level should be beat, but the application will still be somewhat challenging, and may require a few attempts. Once you've beaten the game, there is a secondary playthrough which removes one of your abilities, rendering the game a completely different approach - needing more planning and less random leaping about. It assumes you know how the mechanics work at that point, then puts your knowledge to the test. The game was a bit short, but well paced. I would happily buy the game again, and at it's current price, it is more than worthwhile, even just to test it out.			"

												""Release Date: 18 Mar, 2016"" Fake release date. This game has been out for at least a year, maybe 2 even. The release date has changed simply so that the game will appear on the Steam store front. Very fishy action from this dev and this should not be alowed on Steam. The new release date is simply fake and false. I played it for 5 minutes and crashed 5 times by pressing W at the start point. Seems to be made with Unity (or Clickteam), but badly coded. I also looked al the reviews and most of them now show up a 'pre release' due to the fake release date. Not to mention that a lot of the reviews seems to be super positive with a 10 minute total play time, so I call those fake too. I can't really check how good/bad the game is ,because I crash every minute just by pressing a key. This game does not seem to be something to be super positive about.Edit: apparently the game was released on steam in 2011.			"

There's all kinds of cool things up there, all of which could kill everyone on our planet in the blink of an eye. We could all just be a little flickering candle of a planet, snuffed out by the flap of a little space butterfly's wing. It's pretty cool.We've obviously never really been in space though, or on the moon. That's a conspiracy perpetuated by Richard Nixon and the Disney Channel. You don't want to believe the lies, but it makes people happy. Just like the tooth fairy or the concept of chivalry. You can believe whatever you like, but really all they want is to get in your mouth and leave some money on your nightstand.While humanity will probably never REALLY be in space, because space is actually also a conspiracy that Disney Channel likes to keep going for their ""special interests"", we can imagine what this fictitious place called outer space is like through video games. Yeah!According to the legends, people can float in space. There's a force that pulls things towards planets, but there's none of it in space. ""Gravity"", they call it. It's apparently what holds us onto Earth. Even though everyone knows that we're actually held to the Earth's surface by the natural paste on our feet and shoes. If you ever sprayed non-stick cooking spray on your feet, you'd float into the sun and die.But gravity makes for an interesting theoretical concept, and an even better game. Defy Gravity, which has also apparently been Extended, is a sweet little gem of a PC game you can get on Steam.Defy Gravity is a little budget puzzle platformer. Nothing too fancy. I probably bought it for a quarter. But definitely a quarter well-spent. It's short, sweet, fun, and surprisingly smart.There's a definite Portal vibe going on here, and it's at least mildly Metroid-inspired in some way. Your character controls gravity with their gun, which is capable of shooting two different colors to make pushy gravity and pully gravity. They also PLOT TWIST ARE GIRL WITH BOOBIES. GIRLS CAN PLAY GAMES TOO.WHEN HE TAKES HIS HELMET OFF AND HAS THE BOOBS SO YOU KNOW IT'S FEMINISM.DID YOU KNOW GIRLS CAN DO THINGS.Defy Gravity packs a lot of punch for a simple game. I can count the amount of stage hazards on my fingers. And yet the way they're combined is never dull. It's a short, compact game. There's not a super bountiful amount of content. But for what you're paying for, they squeeze every little drop of game out of it.Most puzzle games need to be this huge-♥♥♥ Rube Goldberg type of thing. There's so many things everywhere, and you need to remember all these different elements that interact with one another in all these ways. And when all of that combines, you can pop a balloon or some ♥♥♥♥. Defy Gravity has like, a brick and some lemons. One lemon has a nail wedged into it. There's a dog. And yet they manage to pop the ♥♥♥♥ out of so many balloons. There's some really memorable levels with only those elements. It's humble, and it's simple. But it's smart, it's fun, and it's well-worth the quarter I spent on it.It's a budget title for sure. Everything seems to follow the basic theme of ""Not amazing, but for a quarter this is pretty nice"". It's not meant to be the biggest, most impressive game you can buy. Graphically, it's incredibly simplistic. It almost looks like it was done in Flash or something. The sprites are decent, but everything is very basic looking. The graphics work though. They're unimpressive, but they're not ugly. It has a nice look to it, the sprites are well made, and the general art direction and style works.Its game design and mechanics are its biggest selling point. It's not even particularly long. It's pretty short actually. But it's a brutal platformer later in the game, so it can definitely take you a few hours to complete with the excellently done difficulty ramp considered. And if you're a sucker for brutal puzzle-platforming, the extra Hard mode post-game is enough to frustrate most platformer fans.There was clearly some love put into the game. It's well-designed and has a nice coat of polish. Cheap polish, yeah. Not the name brand polish that all the super models use. More like store brand Kmart polish. It'll get the job done. Might even look nice. They'll never know, probably. Your mother-in-law will be able to tell, and she'll gossip about it to everyone just to spite you. You ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥. But no one else will notice otherwise.It's a nice game. It's pretty nice. Better than most things you'd buy on Steam for the price. It's like the difference between putting your quarter in a fancy machine with flashy lights and junk, and giving your quarter to a homeless heroin addict. You want to pay for the nice machine, not only to reward yourself with the gumball but to reward the nice people that took the time to build this nice machine. You don't want to flip a quarter to a guy that's gonna save up to shoot himself up with heroin, break into your house and ♥♥♥♥ your guinea pig or your sister or something. Think of the guinea pigs.

PresentationDefy Gravity follows a similar road with some other platformers we've seen lately, using space as a foundation for the game, as you take control of one of the Gravitymancers who came to the Gauntlet, the ultimate test, in order to prove themselves. However, where other platformers with a similar pattern such as The Swapper manage to tell an interesting and unique story using the darkness and emptiness of space, Defy Gravity only introduces you to the Gauntlet, without actually telling you what it really is, what purpose does it serve and why would anyone risk their lives just to prove that they can get to the end. It is quite obvious that story isn't the main focus here, but even so it's hard not to notice the missed opportunity, since The Gauntlet itself could've been filled with messages from others who tried and were defeated by The Gauntlet or pretty much anything at all to justify your desire to finish it; instead you're left with a left to right Mario-style platformer without any princess at the end.Rating: 4GameplayThe gameplay is based around the use of gravity wells, which can be created using your gun, in addition to the ones that are already placed on the map and cannot be moved; using those wells properly and learning how they influence other objects is key in Defy Gravity, as almost every puzzle is based on how well you manage to use the gravity wells depending on position, as well as timing. There are two types of gravity wells: positive and negative; the positive wells will attract objects towards them, including yourself, while the negative ones will repel them, and combining those wells with your anti-gravity shield that makes you immune to all wells is what makes the gameplay unique and interesting. The whole concept does wear out by the end of the game, as there won't be any new ideas introduced into the game later on, leaving you mostly with more bouncing objects to avoid in order to make the game harder, something that does happen once you finish the game and Hard mode is unlocked, disabling negative gravity wells and changing a few things in each level in order to make it more challenging.Rating: 8.5GraphicsThe first thing you will probably notice are the backgrounds, which look amazing and change from level to level, but what on the other hand, the levels themselves are designed using the same monotone, gray blocks and the only thing that differentiates them one from another is the layout of those gray blocks and the bouncing objects between them. The visual effects are basic and nothing stands out, mostly because no beam or ray of light can move your eyes away from the galaxies in the background.Rating: 5AudioThe tunes are okay, but since there is no story or momentum to what is happening, this is probably one of those titles you'll play with your own music in the background. The sound effects feel absent most times, as they are either too quiet or not in total sync with the action, but then again you probably won't need those anyway.Rating: 4.5ExtrasFor its 3€ price tag, Defy Gravity offers enough to justify the purchase, even if you can finish the game in less than two hours, adding 2-3 more hours to that time if you're down for the Hard mode, but if you are looking for anything extra, there is nothing more to the game than the adventure itself.Rating: 7VerdictDefy Gravity is an okay platformer if you only care about the gameplay, as it does introduce a new concept even if it only lasts for a short time, but for anything else you might expect from this game, you will probably be disappointed.Rating Overall: 5.8Check out the full review and a lot more about Defy Gravity at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=366 "

Defy Gravity Extended is a very nice and short game that will satisfy anyone who has had enough of mindless shootings. The biggest asset is obviously the freedom to choose while solving puzzles and a feeling that the laws of physics are at our mercy. The graphics and music are perfectly matched. Everything is in its place and a pleasure for both the eye and the ear. So take a gun in hand and ... go right? Yes. It's just a simple, small, modest low-budget minigame.			"

Gameplay'Defy Gravity' is a platformer that uses physics (gravity). It has the usual jump-or-die and dodge-or-die mechanics, but you can also create two kinds of wells: a gravity well that pulls you and certain objects towards it an anti-gravity well that repels you and certain objects away from itAdd to that the option to switch on a body shield, which renders you immune to all gravity and anti-gravity effects, and you have some nice mechanics to play with.DifficultyI'm not a big fan of the platformer genre because I find standard platformers too 'twitchy' for my taste. But occasionally, I wil try a platformer game that has some special mechanics like the wells in 'Defy Gravity'. So you need to read the rest of this section knowing that I'm only a very casual platformer gamer.I have to admit I liked 'Defy Gravity' and I had a lot of fun until the 'Grandmaster levels'. Judging from the Steam Achievements, that's almost halfway through the game. At that point, you get a warning screen letting you know that the game is kicking it up a notch and is about to get - and I quote: ""much more difficult"".I noticed in the first 'Grandmaster level' that the game was no longer my cup of tea because it got way too difficult and yes, too twitchy for me. But I suppose for hardcore platformer gamers, the fun would only just begin at that point. I would like to point out that all the footage seen in the demo video here on Steam is from pre-Grandmaster levels. I'm not saying that's a conspiracy on the makers' part or something like that, it's just so you know when looking at that footage and thinking to yourself 'that doesn't look too hard to me'.Graphics and soundThe graphics are ok. They are nothing special but certainly good enough for a game of its genre. I invite you to take a look at the video and the screen shots to judge for yourself.A lot of reviewers don't like the music. I can relate to that but personally, it didn't bother me and I have a low tolerance for annoying music and sounds. For the most part, I even thought the music was nice and at least fitting for the game. So it's clearly a matter of personal taste and let's leave it at that.There are no options whatsoever for graphics or sound. A word about the Steam extras'Defy Gravity' has 5 Steam Trading Cards. You'll get 3 just for running the game.The Steam Achievements are uninspired. They are limited to your classic 'pass x number of levels and get an achievement'. If you just play through the 'easy' part of the game, you'll end up with 4/8 so a 50% completion rate.			"

												Nailing that feeling of satisfaction when you’ve figured out a solution to the task at hand is very difficult. Not all mechanics allow it and not all games offer more than one route from point A to point B. I believe gravity manipulation and physics-based gameplay is one of the greatest things gaming has bothered exploring. When done well, it is logical, intuitive and rewarding. It’s like pulling out that second to last piece of Jenga.This is what Defy Gravity Extended is: an extremely satisfying game. You play as Kara, following the Samus school of power armour where you couldn’t tell the gender were it not for the game description. She has to prove herself as a Gravitymancer in the Gauntlet, using her sassy gravity gun (which looks a bit like a Super Soaker). The gun can set two kinds of fields: one that attracts and one that repels. This is the basic premise, and the levels are variations upon previously-set rules. You might encounter enemies who are also affected by the gravity fields, a level may turn your anti-gravity shield permanently on, or you’ll have to use platforms affected by your gravity gun as well.The graphics are really basic, and I admit I was a tad skeptical when I saw some screenshots, but after 5 minutes into the game all my doubts were washed away. The levels are very well-made and reward smart thinking. The first few stages give you hints where to place the respective gravity fields, but you will soon realize that you can use even less resources than recommended.The music is also really good. Now, I’m not a music reviewer and I lack the capacity to translate how music feels using words, but Defy Gravity’s soundtrack took me off-guard in a very pleasant way.The only complaint I can think of is a lack of level editor, which seems extremely appropriate for a game like this.

The gameplay is fun and at time makes you want to throw the keyboard out the window.It has plenty of levels and has a good degree of difficulty. Only thing i would recommend and would definitely purchase as well is this same game with a online or local 2 player co-op mode where one player has the blue gravity shells and the other has the orange gravity shells,  this would definitely make for some interesting gameplay.

												You get an excellent puzzle platformer for this price. It mixes mechanics that are a bit similar to Portal's mechanics with Braid's platforming (or jumping, really). Of course the game has its own style and own mechanics, so don't expect a clone of the games I just mentioned. The graphics are extremely simple, but they get the job done. I absolutely love detailed, well animated 2D graphics, so I'm a little bit disappointed, but for this price, I guess I can't really complain. The gameplay is the most important factor here and I have absolutely no complaints about that. Controls work well, but take some time getting used to though. The game is also quite forgiving in parts where you die. It makes the game fun and removes the frustrating parts. But don't expect an easy game. It will still take some skill to finish it. Go for it ![Rating: 78/100]			"

												Hey! I know most of you already have this game, because it gets so damn cheap, considering the card prices, it even had effectively negative prices in the past.So, this review is not to make you buy this overlooked gem. It is to make you play it.First, who is the targeted audience here? If you liked, Rochard or Outland or any other puzzle platformer, you will feel like at home here. I know most of the reviewers really like using shortcut of, ""Yes, this is puzzle, and the most commonly loved puzzle game around is Portal, so I will just call this Portal in 2d AND space AND gravity guns rather than portal guns AND without an actual story AND heavily amateurish -or indie- AND with some minor bugs making controls a bit harder AND....As you can see if you say this game is similar to some other with some exceptions, but if number of these exceptions are more than 5, actually your so called similarity does not convey any information at all. So, I will just skip calling this ""2D PORTAL game"" even though I agree that it sounds catchy. It is not similar to that game. And btw, if the idea of 2d Portal sounds enticing to you, here is the original Portal game that started it all: http://armorgames.com/play/107/portal-the-flash-versionThis game is a puzzle game. You use a gravity gun whose stationary bullets move you towards it, and another one whose bullets repel you. You also have a shield, causing you not to be affected by those effects. You can just use once for each type, until your feet touches the ground. You use these mechanics, together with momentum to overcome some obstacles, reach some high places which is not obvious how to reach. Levels get progressively harder, introduces some enemies, some hazards, and new tools like free to move platforms, vanishing platforms etc to increase the complexity a bit.I really liked playing through it. The most used ""tactics"" is same for many puzzles, put an attractor, jump to it, put a repeller behind, cancel attractor then you are flying ahead.  Of course there are some others, and even using when to use that changes from puzzle to puzzle, and in the later levels, choosing where to put starting attractor also becomes a part of the question. But still, if this game was longer, it would be prone to become a chore. In current case, it introduces the mechanics, uses them all, tests whether you are really able to use all, and says farewell before giving you a chance to get bored.I have one minor and one more minor negative. First, minor one. Even though I can feel the effort put for attracting and repelling mechanisms, they dont work in a predetermined way. Sometimes you perfectly know what to do, still a milimetrical wrong placement of the ""bullet"" destroys your strategy. Not being able to assign moves from before hand, together with general difficulty of placement of ""bullet""s midfly, helps the feeling of glitchiness. I think there is no glitch here, only some calculations is not smoothed out. Really really really minor mistakes, even the ones that is not visible to the eye can cause to death.More minor one: In the last level, checkpoint placement sucks. I had to read through all of the Credits 50 times before finishing it. For the first 5 times, I thought ""Wow! Such a nice idea to implement credits here!"" Nearing the end, my thought was like this: ""These ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s are stealing my precious seconds again.""If you can oversee some minor problems with games like these, you will enjoy the effort and thought put here. There is also an extra ""New Game+""like mode, supposedly taking the option of attractors out, but I did not try it, so I cant comment on it. From what I have played though, I know that you will enjoy ""Aha!"" moments, and succeeding ""Finally nailed it"" moments. Not expect a perfect platformer or a hardest puzzle ever though. It is mediocre at both of these.TLDR:=========================if indie_tolerance==0{ignore;end}if indie_tolerance>0 and puzzle_love>0 and platformer_love>0{if cheapskate>0{get;end}else{maybe;end}}			"

												An interesting platformer that although it may feel a bit cheap, i enjoyed it. Here you have a gun that can create a gravity or anti-gravity field, and you must use that to go through the levels. One thing i liked is that the gun isn't always necessary to progress, making the level design feel more balanced. There's 24 levels, and after that you unlock the hard mode, but either way the game isn't too hard, just challenging a few times. The graphics and music weren't impressive, but they got the job done. One thing i didn't like was the lack of a level select screen: you can only start a new game or continue. But it's a decent game nonetheless, and for cheap is worth of your time.			"

												The ability to alter gravity in a platformer is nothing new, but using gravity wells to do so is a novel concept that I haven't really seen done- at least, not with player controlled wells. At 24 levels, Defy Gravity is pretty short, but...Despite only having 24 levels, this is one of the most frustrating games I've played in a while. To put it bluntly: the main mechanics don't work right. Sometimes the wells pull you in/push you away as they're supposed to, sometimes nothing happens. Often with the blue wells I found myself looping around the center and dying, simply because the game felt like it. The design of most of the levels, especially near the end demand near perfect control with this utterly broken mechanic.Oh, and your air jump replenishes weirdly, sometimes triggers on the ground (hello, death!), and cuts all horizontal momentum when you jump.Hard mode strips you of the anti-wells and the only way to get any reliability from the mechanics is to use both in conjunction.Literally the only upside to this game is you can buy it, turn around and sell the cards for more money than the game itself. I guess that it's short helps too, but really this is not worth the effort to play through.			"

												Decent game, especially when it's on sale and you get it for next to nothing. As the others said, it alone is worth getting for the cards when it is on sale, but you will also get a couple hours of enjoyment out of it as well.Basically, your goal is to get through levels using a portal that can pull objects in towards it and a portal that can push objects away from it. The levels start out quite easy, but they do start to get more challenging towards the end and especially in the mode after you beat the game on normal. Overall pretty fun game for 22 cents when it's on sale.			"

												Altering Gravity is nothing new, however altering it with those Gravity Wells is somewhat new, and unexplored.So the concept is great. But you only NEED to use the Wells in the last few levels, the rest is almost completely possible without them.Another big issue I had was the limit of the Wells. You can only have to Wells at a time, with one being normal-, and the other anti-gravity. They don't have a timelimit so that's nice, but I would much rather have unlimited Wells with a timelimit than two infinite Wells.But it's only one dollar, so if you feel like playing a little platformer pick this up.

												This game requires good forward thinking, great hand-to-eye coordination and an unearthly amount of patience to beat, especially if you want to get all the achievements.The use of gravity wells to adjust your jumps is the gimmick in this game, it is implemented to the core style of play and you’ll find yourself using it pretty much for all kinds of situations. Thankfully, the mechanics are very easy to learn, though it will take more than a few tries for the trial and errors to take hold in experience.There are 24 levels in total, you can expect to die countless times on laser traps, football-like projectiles, collapsible platforms, shuriken shooting bots, moving walls of doom and the classic never-ending pits of doom. It won’t be unfair to call this game brutal, but you’ll have unlimited continues in your disposal, along with a save point practically after every trap.The length of this game will vary depending on how good you are at it, a speed runner can do this in 20 minutes, a good player may get away with 2 hours, it took me around 12 hours to complete it entirely along with the hard mode.If you are someone who likes a real challenge, get this. If you’re a casual gamer who can’t take setbacks very well, please avoid it like the plague.			"

												Although very simple, it's really addicting due its difficulty, but, most of this difficult, is just finding out the trick of each stage and their sections. The faults of the game that gets irritating are when, sometimes, the blue vortex fail to grab the character, or sometimes expel, and the other is the jump/jetpack, sometimes it doesnt work and sometimes activate right after jumping, killing the momentum. I managed to finish the game in the Hard Mode, and not because of that, I recommend, it's really worth a try.			"

												Defy Gravity is a fairly minimalist 2D platformer. The game’s controls are very simple:•	You can jump.•	You can double jump in the air (with a cooldown between aerial jumps – but it is possible to jump more than once if you spend enough time in the air, such as if you’re in a gravity well).•	You can create a gravity well which sucks you (and gravity-sensitive objects) towards it. You can create one of these at a time, and have two shots before you need to touch the ground again.•	You can create an anti-gravity well which repels you (and gravity sensitive objects) away from it. You can create one of these at a time, and have two shots before you need to touch the ground again.•	You have a shield you can activate which prevents you from being affected by gravity (and in some levels, it is always on).The core gameplay mechanics are decent enough – the game has a very minimalist set of elements (platforms you can jump through (some of which move on their own, some of which fall down a few seconds after landing on them), enemies you can jump on top of to kill them and jump again, enemies you can’t bounce off of, and an enemy that kills you if you touch it which shoots other enemies which kill you if you touch them, and ground that kills you if you touch it). Everything in the game moves in linear, predictable paths. Some enemies can be affected by gravity wells (signified by them being gold-colored), others can’t (signified by them being gray); the same applies to the platforms.At its core, the game presents about an hour and a half of puzzles with these mechanics, and it is simple enough; it gets progressively more difficult the further you get into the game, and the last few levels are quite difficult. The game is mostly pretty generous with checkpoints, but the second to last level requires you to get through fairly long puzzles without screwing up.Once you beat the game, the game puts you back at the start in hard mode, in which you no longer have anti-gravity wells and all enemies are affected by gravity, which makes the game significantly more difficult. But the levels are the same as they were before, though I think there might be a few modifications to make it possible to solve some of the puzzles which require too many gravity well shots to solve otherwise.In any case, this core gameplay is decent enough, and while the game is quite short (about 90 minutes to beat the regular mode), it is probably about as long as it wants to be.The real weakness of this game is the fact that there is really nothing else here. The game is extremely simplistic, the graphics are clean and clear but pretty lackluster and not particularly pretty to look at, there is no story, and the levels feel clearly designed to be challenges without actually even bothering to feel organic in any way (which, ironically, may actually make sense, as the premise of the game is that you’re in there to… complete challenges…).Anyway, while this game has a fairly decent score on Metacritic, that is likely because, quite frankly, there’s not much to criticize here. But there’s not much to like, either; this game is extremely forgettable and I feel like I’m going to forget it within a very short period of time. The game never wows you, and that makes it hard to really love it or even care particularly much about it.All in all, this isn’t bad. But you can probably find a better use for an hour and a half (or three hours, if you really want to beat the hard mode and get 100% achievements) of your life. This game is simply unremarkable. "

												I enjoyed this game because it's a very portal-esque platformer, except that it's much, much, much easier to die in this game than it is in Portal. In fact, dying is a good 70-90% of what you will do.Basically you play as a gravity-mancer, which is a person who uses a gravity gun to create bubbles of gravity and antigravity. With these bubbles, you will redirect yourself, platforms, enemies, and platform-enemies to try to survive a series of increasingly difficult puzzles. This game requires as much skill in execution as problem-solving, and is more fun to play than most $15 platformers out there with better graphics. On top of all that, it's cheap. If you like puzzles, platforming and difficulty, you should definitely buy this game.			"

												Defy Gravity is a tiny little physics-based puzzle platformer in which you manipulate your movement through the creation of gravity and anti-gravity wells, allowing you to conquer assorted obstacles. Almost everything about the game is somewhat reminiscent of the big days of browser-based flash games. Fairly generic music loops, non-existent story, simplistic art style, and a pretty short length compared to most games on Steam (30-60 minutes for a basic playthrough, or 90-120 minutes if you're including all achievements/hard mode). The concept's not too bad, but the puzzle design is somewhat repetitive and the difficulty progression is very uneven (the final supposed-to-be-climactic puzzle is actually one of the easiest rooms in the game).Overall, there are plenty of worse ways to spend an hour or so. Defy Gravity is definitely worth the summer sale price of $0.29 - especially considering it comes with Steam Trading Cards which you can easily sell back for more than that. At full price, however, the cost is a bit steep for the paltry amount of content here. Grab it if it's on sale and you have a huge fetish for physics puzzles, or not at all.			"

												A 2D version of portal, with a little twist that really makes the game unique, not just another copy. Just a tiny tip : If you can't control your rage, I am not going to buy you new keyboards,mouses or controlers, got it ? coolGraphics - If you are not a sucker for great looking games, then you should have no problem with what this game has to offer, graphic wise. It has a rather strange style, by using textures from retro games and giving them a twist from textures from newer games, you get this, a strange looking game 7/10Music - The games strongest point, great choice by the Devs to put in calm and relaxing songs, while you are being irritated by dying at least a 100 times on a single level, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ LEVEL 9/10Story - You can't say this game does not a have a story, yes it is pretty small, but it still does. Like many games, you are the chosen but first you have to prove yourself by going through a variety of (let's call it chambers) till you get to the end. Just to be suprised that you have finished nothing, you just unlocked hard mode. OMAHGOD 6/10Content - Hmm, well 2-3 variations of enemies,  a lot of rooms (chambers) to pass, get's even more difficult the more you advance, but hey an interactive selection menu. 5/10Controls - Rather stiff movement, now you will say (but hey he is in a space suit, he is confined to certain movements), to which I will respond with (well in some games people wear armors that cover their whole bodies and they are still more maneuverable than he is). Plays almost the same on a keyboard+mouse or controler setup. 5/10Gameplay - The game runs at a normal rate, nothing too fast or too slow, you can have as much time as you want to think how you are going to do the certain challenge or how you would like to approach it. 7/10Overall the game is a fun time killer, for a few hours or like me for probably a few days, GODDAMMIT, either you are going pass it with no casualties or with, have fun xD   Overall score: 6.5/10			"

												+ Challenging, but fair puzzles+ Good music+ Charming- Short- The second half of the game is a copy of the first half, the difference being that you don't have access to one of your 2 powers.- Very basic sprite-based graphicsThis is an extremely charming game. It's a physics based platformer. The reason why it's so cheap is because it's a fairly short game (I have 100% on it, and I haven't been playing offline). You play as a sprite with the ability to shoot physics altering gravity and anti-gravity ""wells"". Think 2D Portal in which portals don't teleport you, they attract or repulse matter (including you). Apart from that theres a Bullet Bill jumping element to some puzzles, but imagine being able to influence their trajectory by shooting a well in the vicinity.Now, you gotta understand that Defy Gravity hasn't been made to look outstanding. I don't know what it is about it, but I can tell the devs were doing this out of love for making a game.Props to the music, it really clicks in with the puzzling around. There's no other notable sounds, the gun shooting is adequate.Graphics-wise... well its a 2D sprite game. It's also very blocky, and I do regret the dev's choice of font for the menus, but this is me nitpicking.The only true flaw this game has is how short it is. It's 24 levels with a hard mode for one more playthrough. It's arguably 48 levels long, but the difference between one half and the other is that you need to approach problems from a different perspective. A shame there is no climax to the game - it just abruptly ends.I say it's worth the price. I mean come on, it's the price of a cookie. Develop your brain instead of acquiring calories ;p. Just be sure that you're fine with dying a lot to find the solution. Don't worry though for the longer levels - there are frequent checkpoints (in my opinion too frequent).			"

												A decent game. You play as an astronaut basically, and you have the ability to create and destroy gravity fields at will. Gravity fields that either pull you in or push you out.With that ability you have to navigate through very tricky levels involving lasers, moving platforms and various other obstacles. It's a bit low on the visual side however it makes up for that with the gameplay. It's extremely difficult to master and the levels are very very challenging. I'm a huge Super Meatboy Fan (even finished the Cotton Alley on A+) and I would say this is harder than meatboy.I recommend this game if you are looking for a challenge at a low price. It's interesting, it's difficult, and it will make you cry... It will probably also make you regret your decision to buy it and actually try to finish it because of how challenging it is.Give it a try :)			"

												Defy gravity is an indie puzzle/platform game that deserves more recognition. It has its own unique puzzle mechanic. You control two gravity portals that either pull you towards or repels you away to help you solve challenging and engaging puzzles. The game is $2.99 USD at the price for all that you're getting it's a freaking steal. If you liked portal I would pick up this indie game.

												This is a clever take on the platforming genre.You are a space man who can ""fire"" two kinds of level changing shots.  Either an area of gravity that will pull everything, including you, towards it, or an area of anti-gravity, that will push everything, including you, away from it.  You also can toggle on and off a gravity shield that makes you immune to your own and any naturally occuring gravity fields.  Also, you can only have two of any kind of gravity field up at a time, and you have keys to destroy them?Sound like a lot?For me it was a little clunky to ever be intuitive to play.  However, the challenge of figuring out each level was still interesting.  The music and art was not fantastic, but it wasn't terrible either.

												Really fun platforming game. Use gravity wells that pull things toward them or push them away to hop along enemies, move platforms around, try to avoid killer stars, and often accidentally fling yourself to your death. Somewhat short, but totally worth the price for how much fun it is.			"

												I gotta say, I initially bought this game for the cards, but after actually playing it, I gotta say those 22 cents were worth it. For a game like this, I wasn't really expecting the game play to be quite interesting. It's a puzzle platformer but the mechanics work kinda like Portal, you have a gun that shoots force energy thingys that either pull (blue) you or push you (orange). Also really nice wallpapers. Give this game a try, unless you're a peasent that has a gaming pc only to play the free games on steam.			"

												--------------- Defy Gravity  ---------------        Defy Gravitiy is a 2D sidescroller puzzle game. The player takes on the roll of a Gravitymancer who uses a tool (similar to the portal gun from ""Portal"" which can fire a matter which pushes away objects or pulls them in) to overcome obstacles to reach the goal. The game isn't very long, but can be challenging. Once you do finish the game you'll be presented with the opportunity to replay it on a higher difficulty.______________________________________________________________      The game is ridiculously and worth buying. I'm sure your money will not be wasted. It also includes trading cards and achievements.			"

												Defy Gravity Extended is an...uh...extended version of what was originally an Xbox Live Indie Game. I forget exactly what's different about this edition, aside from being a fair bit longer. Still, this is a game that can completed twice in about two hours (if you're going for all of the achievements).Everyone buys this game for the cards right? After all, this is one of those games that can be had for so cheap, players will profit just by owning it. While it's tempting to turn on idlemaster and do something else, IMO this is a game that is actually worth playing. The concept is interesting, the mechanics/controls are solid, and there's a fair amount of challenge to keep things engaging. The pleasant low-key soundtrack rounds everything out nicely. Defy Gravity Extended a pretty short game, so it didn't give me many opportunities to find things to complain about. Actually, I suppose the hit-box is a little too big, but the checkpoints are generous enough so it's not really a huge issue.Give it a go sometime.			"

												Well, what can I say, sunk a total of three hours into this and all three were completely gratifying, you basically play an astronaut thas can push/pull himself through a myriad of obstacles using either gravity or anti-gravity portals you fire around you to gain advantage and pass to the next level, it has a very net yaroze feel I greatly enjoyed.Obviously, there are a few minor imperfections and if I'm to outline them briefly they'd outline the players ability to perform almost an infinite amount of double jumps in the air which makes a majority of these levels a breeze, there were only two real moments I felt a slight urge to rage quit and no doubt you'll experience them too, but I reccomend you push on through to the best of your abilities.The game is a great little time passer with moderate graphics, gameplay and music, definitley worth the eighteen pence I spent on it and brightened up my Saturday, my biggest dissapoinment which I'll hide behind a spoiler tag was that  once you've beaten the game you're introduced to the idea of a 'hard' mode, sadly, I found this much easier than the normal mode and some of the level recycling felt like a cheap, albeit enjoyable way to extend the game another hour and a half, though some will definitley lose their patience with the heavy trial and error segments of the game.Game on.

												Defy Gravity is a fantastic platformer with great gameplay elements. This platformer utilizes gravity as the main mechanic. The player can create gravity and anti-gravity pockets to proceed through the levels. I would say that it has a similar difficulty curve as found within Portal, but it lacks story elements. Being a platfomer, however, it doesn’t require story elements, just quality controls. Graphically, it’s lacking, but having solid controls is what makes this game fantastic. This game also has a “Hard Mode”, which requires you to only use gravity pockets, and the enemies are affected by the gravity. This “Hard Mode” extends the gameplay you will find within Defy Gravity, but it doesn’t come off as too forceful. The only real reason to play through “Hard Mode” is to get all of the achievements. I will recommend this game to anyone looking for a new affordable experience.			"

												Neat idea, but badly executed. Simple and repetitive graphics aside, the controls are wonky and don't feel right. Your character doesn't follow your cursor very quickly, and double-jumping robs you of all forward momentum for some reason. Most of the game's difficulty is caused by the counter-intuitive controls, and as soon as you get used to them the game is over in just a couple of hours.			"

The difficulty is quite high, but extremely frequent save points prevent replaying the same thing over and over.

												So, i only bought it because it was on a big dicount for 0,19 eur, but it may worth the full price for you.Pros: - Easy controls         - Hard Enough         - Cheap         - Controller support         - If nothing else then TRADING CARDS(yay) Cons: - Graphics look like the game was made in game maker          - Not that much variation in mapsOverall: For me, it well worth its money and it made me some happy hours of gameplay			"

												An original and 'fun-to-play-for-a-while' puzzler! I have finished it twice to gain the last achievement for this game. A little repetitive because in Hard Mode there weren't that much differences (mostly the lack of anti-gravity production and the fact that all enemies/obstacles now react on gravity and come towards you). I only played it twice because I was in for a challenge and it became challenging at times. I'd say this game is nice for a brain training :) Recommended, even for the current price! (bought it for €0,09)			"

												As of where I'm at now I haven't finished the game and can't offer a complete review. I can, however, offer a few comments on what I've already seen. This is an intriguing puzzle game with a unique weapon that has two main functions. Choosing to either draw or push things around the well will influence your character enough to navigate the level. There is no maze function, though there are many twists and turnsThe point and click functions well with the controls and there is a level of versatility offered as many keys have the same function. My only true complaint about the game is the camera view. You can shoot outside of your line of sight (which you are often encouraged to do in later levels) and yet you can't see where you're aiming. There are the suggestive little circles around it to promote the shot, so of course the developers intended for you to aim there. Unnecessary deaths aren't always fun.Anyhow, this game is definitely worth the money I paid (it was 90% off when I bought it.) That's just $0.29. Who wouldn't want it? Even at full price I'd definitely recommend this game.			"

												Defy Gravity is a very cool puzzle game where you use a gravity gun to either attract or repel yourself along each level. As the levels progress, new obstacles are presented and things become tougher. It is a very challenging game and some of the later levels look downright impossible. However, i was able to complete them all, even all the levels in hard mode. Sure it gets frustrating, but the checkpoint system is very forgiving. I had to lower my 2560x1440 display to 1920x1080 in order to get this to run full screen.Pros-Cheap price-Challenging gameplay-Smooth framerate-Extremely stable. Never crashed on me. I use Windows 8.1-Great mechanics-Good music (does repeat quite a bit but the songs never get old)Cons-Doesn't run full screen in 2560x1440-Not able to change key bindings. The ""W"" key is also jump and messed me up many times when i accidentally hit it. I picked this up for 29 cents. You can't beat that. Even the full price of 2.99 is good if you enjoy puzzle games that challenge you. 8/10 Very good. Great deal!			"

												As with many of the people here, I bought the game during the steam summer sale for 18p. I wasn't expecting much from it, anything better than being completely and utterly broken would be nice.Defy Gravity is actually a basic but pretty good platformer with an overarcing mechanic, making 'gravity wells' that either attract or repulse you. It's difficult, but not difficult enough to get you over annoyed, always a hard balance to get in a platformer. The only real problem is the graphics, which aren't the greatest, but serviceable. Soundtrack's half-decent as well. Sold the trading cards for 22p, so made a profit from it.Overall, a cheap and cheerful indie game that can currently be bought for next to nothing. Worth it at the (admittedly low) full price.			"

												Defy Gravity Extended is an interesting game, to say the least.  I got it on sale for $0.29 and it was worth every penny (especially since I sold the trading cards for $0.37 :PI would highly reccommend this game.  The difficulty is quite high, but extremely frequent save points prevent replaying the same thing over and over.  Although the animation and graphics quality are not the best, they serve their purpose and don't really take anything from the game.  The replayability is not very high, but I got 10 hours playing through normal and turbo mode once.Overall, I would rate it a 9.32/10.  Exactly 9.32/10.			"

												Okay, so sure, the game might not be the -prettiest-,  but oh my does it make up for it in gameplay! I completed it in 0.9 hours...and unlocked Hard Mode. And it is just the perfect follow-up to the normal game... because by that point, you've become the master... and it explains how you no longer have anti-wells, and you think ""Oh dear this WILL be hard!"" And then you eventually master THAT, and then a level comes along that wipes that off the board...In summary, a challenging but VERY satisfying puzzle game with a perfectly executed...gimmick thing.Gravity!And this may be the only game I get 100% of achievements... and only for £0.09! (If it weren't for sales, I never woulda seen this!)VERY RECOMMENDED			"

Its a 2D Platformer / Puzzle, where everything revolves around Gravity, being able tocreate gravity fields and anti gravity fields to attract or repel the character (repel = rocket jumps! true story)Its highly addictive, and gets pretty hard towards the end, but is a very short game.Even with hard mode (with no antigravity available), completing it twice only took me 5 hours.Then again, with its current price tag, its definitely more bang for your buck!Give Defy Gravity a try.

												""Defy Gravity"" is a decent puzzle platformer with rather simple graphics but good controls.To complete the levels, you use your gun to create gravity or anti-gravity fields, pulling/pushing you and/or objects like balls, sawblades and small platforms.The gameplay is quite refreshing for such a small indie game, difficulty is well balanced with the learning curve and the hard mode you unlock after completing the game gives an extra challenge by completely deactivating the anti-gravity function of your gun for another playthrough.Even though the game is very short, I highly recommend to get it, especially at a reduced price.

												Ini salah satu Game Puzzle yang buat saya salah kaprah. Awalnya saya sangka game ini ""gampang ""  karena gameplay dan misinya cuman melewati beberapa rintangan seperti laser, bom dan lain lain. Namun level kesulitan bertambah naik, malah makin susah T_T dan harus putar otak untuk melewati step nya .Sountrack nya bagus cuman hanya itu itu saja.Grafik nya jadul dan lumayan buat game Puzzle.6.5/10 bagi saya Game ini cocok untuk pelepas stress.

												I finished the game and it's hard mode. It's fun. It was a lot more fun than I thought I would have thought for a game I got for $0.50. It has an interesting concept that was fleshed out into a great puzzle game. The game is a little easier than what I would've liked, but it was still enjoyable (especially the hard mode). It has room for a sequel and I would probably buy that if it came out. Overall 9/10			"

												Lots of players are buying this game because of the low price - at sales usually it hits -90%, meaning that you'll probably profit from it's cards.But about the game itself: it's a good one. You control an astronaut (?) who has a special tool/weapon at his service: it can shoot two kinds of energy cores: one attracts things near itself, the another one repels. Sounds really basic, but the level design is really good, some levels require thinking and puzzle-solving skill, while other ones are more like  based on timing- and aiming.I can wholeheartedly recommend this game, if you don't mind the simple graphics, it's a really well-executed puzzler-platformer game with medium-high difficulty.

												As someone who's played a fair share of platformers and puzzlers and has pretty defined opinions about design and what ""difficulty"" entails, this game started out as decently fun and interesting. I enjoyed the music, and the title screen background art got my expectations comfortably high. But quickly, it feels like the game runs out of ideas for level design using the gravity gimmick. It starts to feel like a mediocre free Flash browser game - long segments of jumping on a slow stream of orb enemies, repeated ""use gravity to drag this platform around"" bits, and a lot of areas where the solution to the puzzle is to simply use the same bruteforce technique a few times, because the inconsistent physics will net you a win. Some of the puzzles that brag difficulty turn out to be boring - you have to place a grav/anti well at a very precise point that you won't realize is wrong until a full 10 seconds pass, so you try just a little bit to the right, etc. A browser Flash puzzle platformer game is the best comparison really, because of the inconsistent physics and drawn out level design characteristic of them. And the ""ultimate challenge,"" which is the game's sort of newgame+ hardmode, serves to limit your options to make levels feel even less creative to pass by removing anti-grav wells, and makes all enemies physics-based, allowing the often shoddy engine to make your play even less consistent than your first run. Ultimately, I gave up on that because I was bored, not challenged. Games like La-Mulana will leave you feeling challenged by the puzzles and platforming. Or, perhaps this game will as well. A lot of people seem to like the game, but I would have been bored of it if it were freeware. A lot of positivity about this game seems to repeatedly refer to the price point. A game at a comparably low price point which I will recommend in Defy Gravity's stead is Super Hexagon, a challenging game that tests skill rather than the sheer snoring patience required of Defy Gravity. Or maybe I'm wrong and don't know ♥♥♥♥ about video games.			"

												This review is for the game ''Defy Gravity Extended'',a video game developed and published by Fish Factory Games on July 25,2011 for the Xbox 360 and PC.The game is a puzzle platformer with action elements and the theme is Sci-fi.GameplayAs mentioned Defy gravity is a puzzle platformer where the player has to use his gravity and anti-gravity gun in order to overcome obstacles and solve puzzles for the level to clear.By using the gravity gun,obviously,the player can create small bubbles of gravity that can pull into orbit objects and the gravitymancer and by using the anti-gravity gun the gravitymancer can levitate him or push other objects nearby away.Using the guns is pretty simple but mastering them is pretty hardcore.And when you've finally finished the game after hours and hours of dying you realise that was just the normal mode.In Hard mode you can only use the gravity gun and all objects are gravity sensitive.RecapThe game is worth it's money.It can be really frustrating since you will be dying all the time but when you finish the game it leaves you with a great sense of fulfillment and most importantly patience and persistence.P.S Thank you Fish Factory Games developers and associates for this game.

												The animations in this game are at most decent. It's rather easy for platformer game and it doesn't have anything that could surprise fans of this genre... but while I was playing Defy Gravity Extended I had a nostalgia attack. It really remind me of few really old, mostly pre 2000, simple games. I remembered all of good times I spent playing those simple, shareware or freeware, games - without fancy graphics, with short but enjoyable music, focusing only on gameplay not some story. And it was really fun. When it's on sale, it's really cheap - you will be able to get most of your money back from selling cards. I was really surprised by this game and it should be at least tried by everyone, since you spend very little money on it and it can truly bring you few hours of fun.			"

												For the price, it isn't a bad purchase. It was fun to playthrough and some levels were quite challenging. The controls are a bit weird to use, but you get used to it. It's a gravity-based platformer with some nice features like gravity shield and anti-gravity. You control gravity to your advantage and you have to reach the door to the next level in every zones to progress. There's a checkpoint system in place too, so the is less frustating.To be fair, this game isn't the best, so if you have no games to play and are bored, might want to pick this one up.PROs:-Fun.-Easy to get started.-Very cheap.CONs:-Music is repetitive and cannot be muted.-Some levels are just alot harder than others ( at random points in the game, not really in the end. )-Game is completed in 3 hours.-Low quality graphics.

												I think this game is a great game. It starts of nice and easy and soon gets considerably harder over time. It certainly got me thinking on the levels where you could not use anti-wells. I believe the game is worth buying and have decided to recommend it as it was a brilliant game, cheap, a challenge and personally a blast! I will surely be playing this again in the future.10 / 10 for sure.Thanks for a fun, challenging game! :) "

												Very very good platformer game. Only played about 30mins and got 11 levels done, until they told that the hard part was comming, and i begin to get rly excited, and scared from the future frustration that i'll need to fight. And it rly got harder.So the point of the game is go to Point A to Point B using platforms, using your gravity gun to create ""platforms""(one to atract and the other to push away) or even bring the golden balls/platforms to whethever you want them to be, so as you can see, you may complete these levels in different ways, even going at the top of a map. You'll need to dogde balls , but you may jump on them ,making them usefull in levels, or even making them necesary, but you'll need to dodge the shuriken, and be carefull of the gold ones :). Another thing that i love of this game is its difficulty spike that it has after level 11-12, as i already told you.And the soundtrack, some of them are EPIC and other meh(dubstep) but ofc that's my opinion. What would i have liked to seen is some story, background , but still this is good, giving it a 8/10, recommend to all platformers guys or just normal guys who for 0,19€/2€ may wanna spend an hour or so.(And i would like to see this game have a community that make levels, would totally be cool having  User-Created levels in this game.)

												Although Defy Gravity Extended can be bought at a really cheap price, the game is not ""cheap"" at all. I enjoyed every single minute of it. Made after a pretty basic mechanic, the game offers a decent amount of gameplay time and it also feature trading cards, which will make you back the money you spend on the game. I never thought I'll find it interesting, but as you progress, the levels become more bigger, more interesting and even the puzzles are starting to be a little bit harder.Why would I recommend this game? Because the developer knows how to deal with the market and understands that using basic mechanics in a good way can turn his platformer in a appreciated game that will make people try it out just because it's a catchy game (not only because of the price)! I wish I could say something bad about it, but at this price, I don't know what do you expect. Frankly, I consider this to be the best cheap game on Steam at the moment.

												For the price, it isn't a bad purchase. It was fun to playthrough and some levels were quite challenging. The controls are a bit weird to use, but you get used to it. It's a gravity-based platformer with some nice features like gravity shield and anti-gravity. You control gravity to your advantage and you have to reach the door to the next level in every zones to progress. There's a checkpoint system in place too, so the is less frustating.To be fair, this game isn't the best, so if you have no games to play and are bored, might want to pick this one up.PROs:-Fun.-Easy to get started.-Very cheap.CONs:-Music is repetitive and cannot be muted.-Some levels are just alot harder than others ( at random points in the game, not really in the end. )-Game is completed in 3 hours.-Low quality graphics.

												Defy Gravity is a perfect example of why you should never sell a game with steam cards for less than the overall cost of the earnt steam cards. If a game is run idle for longer than it is actually actively played, something bad happened.The game is okay. You manipulate gravity. I mean the premise alone was fun to mess around with. Game is ugly though, and slightly glitchy. It sure as hell isn't the WORST 19 cent game steam has offered me.I don't remember why I never finished this game. I think I just tuned out.			"

												Defy Gravity is a puzzle game with a simple mechanic. You have a jetpack and a gun which manipulates gravity, and with this equipment you have to get to the other side of the room, avoiding obstacles using your gun, the jetpack or the enviorenment. It's not long but it can take a few hours to beat (4-5 for average players). The best thing about the game is the soundtrack, it will accompany you and turn something that could be very boring and frustrating into something interesting. I think it fits with the game, and personally I find the soundtrack very peaceful. For an indie developer with that people (during the credits i counted 6 or 7), the final result is impressive. It's cheap (2,99) but if you find it with a 95% sale, you will even get a profit with the trading cards!			"

												Defy Gravity is a decent puzzle platformer. The gravity orbs don't always work as intended and at some places there is a lot of trial & error, but I had fun with this game. However, I stopped my playthrough after 45 minutes (roughly 60%) because the game started annoying me. At this point the game tells you that it becomes harder, and yes - it is, in a specific way. It's not really the level design which becomes more difficult to beat, it's your sanity. There are less checkpoints and they are horribly placed.The passages are not difficult to figure out, the game just reduces itself to trial & error. After each respawn you have to wait up to 10 seconds for the enemies or platforms to move so you can continue. Usually I die and then I think ""Whatever, I'll just try again"". I reached the point where I just Alt + F4 out of the game after the 10th death because the game makes me wait longer than I actually have fun with it. It just feels like a punishment for bad playing which is inappropriate for a game like this. Or it's just really bad level design.At least I had 30 minutes of fun. I bought it for 9 cents and I sold each of the 3 trading cards for 8 cents. The game is worth a try, but don't expect too much.			"

												First let me make one thing clear. I hate platform games, I'm rubbish at them and they drive me up the wall.Now we have that out the way. I paid £0.09 for this in the 2014 Christmas sale, buying it as many did for the trading cards which were worth more than the game itself. I expected to leave the game running in the background for the cards and that I would be done with it.Well, actualy no. As it turns out this is a good game. Yes it is a platformer and yes it did drive me mad at points. The game while not easy is asscessable for those not of the platform minded. When you die you rarely have to restart that far away from death and the nature of the game with your gravity gun the is rarely need for pin point jumping and landing. No timers, no lives limit, no scoreboards with the simple goal of reaching the end of each level to reach the next.Played for 30-40mins completed about a 1/3rd of the game, 2 or 3 parts = many, many deaths that took a few mins to get right. Other than that an enjoyable plesant suprise.Graphics = Circa late 90sMusic = InoffensiveSFX = Not the bestControls = GoodTutorial = GoodValue = Exceptional@ the current price of £0.09 anyone and everyone regardless of there prefered game genres should buy this game without hesitation.

												Really intense platformer.Unlike supermeatboy, there will be times where you can stop and think. However it isnt like braid... once you are done thinking, the actions must be fast. Mixing both puzzle solving with fast execution.Basicly aside all normal platform stuff (jumping, platforms lol, things to avoid, etc) you have a gun that creates a repel field or a pull field. You must click. hold. shoot. so it aint simple as portal, for when you release, the gravity field stays. This means that you just dont shoot, you gota hold until the field is where you want... picture that while falling...The difficulty here is the amount of commands. Basicly you use more than 6 commands. You have jump, double jump (which recharges while falling), you have a repel field, a pull field, a cancel field, a immune to gravity effects barrier, plus all platform basic stuff.The thing is, you are sometimes expected to use alot in a really short time. so a difficult puzzle would go, jump, repel, double jump, pull field, cancel, repel, jump. Its just alot to control in a short intense amount of time.I definetly recommend it, but be aware its not your average casual puzzle... imo its a damn great puzzle and something i personally been waiting for (intense command/execution puzzles).

Its pretty fun and I got it on a 95% sale which cost 0.17 cents in SGD, so its very worth it, plus I believe (even though I have not complete the game) all achievements all be unlock when you complete the game, and there's also steam cards for this.In summaryits pretty fun and challenging if you like platformers			"

I like a challenging game, but this borders on punishing, Often crossing the border of when it's fun to play. Still, it's an interesting concept that I haven't come across before and if you quit for a while and return with a level head you can make it all the way through and the sense of relief when you do is beyond words.

												Defy Gravity. Its a simple enough game. making good use of gravity defying forces to pass through the levels. Its really just as simple as that. Its definitely challenging though as your astronaut isnt the easiest to control. I tried using both Keyboard and mouse & the Xbox gamepad with this one and found that either way, if your control isnt perfect then your gonna have a bad time. Thats not to say the challenge is unfair though. You dont feel cheated for failing here which marks the sign of a game developer that knows what they are doing. The music whilst sounding pretty basic actually helps the ambience of the game aswell. Its nothing to get excited about. it just seems to fit quite well with the kind of game this is. Maybe abit to boring for me but I can definitely see the good sides to this game, and it has alot more going for it then it does against it. At the end of the day, When all is said and done. I'd say for the cheap price its available at, Its not a bad idea if you need something to tide you over for a few hours.			"

												Summary: better than Portal.The thing you need to understand about Defy Gravity is not that it is good, play for a few minutes and you will understand that, no what you need to understand is that this is better than the Portal series.It doesn't try to beat you over the head with ""humour"" like Portal. It doesn't try to draw you into an un-funny joke. Instead this gives you puzzles to be solved with platforming and using your gravity gun and quick reflexes. A lot of thought has gone into it, so it will challenge but is beatable; and it was a pleasant joy to play. "

												For the price, Defy Gravity has a pretty good level of content and quality. The music in this game really helps to set the atmosphere, allowing players to focus on the challenges ahead of them and making the overall experience more enjoyable. This is by no means a horribly difficult game, but at the same time it's not too easy either. I could easily see this as a game to play with friends, if multiplayer was enabled and I think it would be quite a lot of fun. I bought the game for only 29 cents, and it has proven to definitely be a worthwhile purchase. Even if you don't like it, Defy Gravity isn't an expensive game, so it wouldn't be much of a loss to your walletSo basically, if you're into atmospheric or ambient music, love platformers/puzzlers and are a fan of relatively challenging games, then this is for you.

												First let me make one thing clear. I hate platform games, I'm rubbish at them and they drive me up the wall.Now we have that out the way. I paid £0.09 for this in the 2014 Christmas sale, buying it as many did for the trading cards which were worth more than the game itself. I expected to leave the game running in the background for the cards and that I would be done with it.Well, actualy no. As it turns out this is a good game. Yes it is a platformer and yes it did drive me mad at points. The game while not easy is asscessable for those not of the platform minded. When you die you rarely have to restart that far away from death and the nature of the game with your gravity gun the is rarely need for pin point jumping and landing. No timers, no lives limit, no scoreboards with the simple goal of reaching the end of each level to reach the next.Played for 30-40mins completed about a 1/3rd of the game, 2 or 3 parts = many, many deaths that took a few mins to get right. Other than that an enjoyable plesant suprise.Graphics = Circa late 90sMusic = InoffensiveSFX = Not the bestControls = GoodTutorial = GoodValue = Exceptional@ the current price of £0.09 anyone and everyone regardless of there prefered game genres should buy this game without hesitation.

												Short little game but cheap and I'd say worth its price. The gravity mechanics work well and the level design does plenty with them. I'd contest a few of the design choices (especially the second-to-last level which somehow manages to get EASIER or hard mode =.=; ) but overall it's a fair challenge without ever being overly frustrating. It's not really much about the puzzles as much as manuevering around and you're given a variety of ways to deal with scenarios instead of being stuck trying to figure out the one thing to do, which is what makes it pretty fun to play. The hard mode also rather well changes how the game is played and I didn't mind playing through all the levels again for it. Probably a fair purchase at full price and a really good deal on sale.

												To defy gravity means to not have gravity apply to the person.You could defy gravity in space although there is no gravity besides the gravity pulling you closer to the sun at a very slow rate. But other than that one main pull of gravity in space there is no gravity. Defying gravity therefore would be physically impossible without the help of external sources, such as airplane, jetpack, rocketship. If you were to defy gravity you would need to be able to bend Earth at it's will, deforming it's surface, messing with it's gravitational field, and messing with weather consistency.In the end it is physically impossible to defy gravity therefore meaning that this game is a hoax.

												I got this game off scrap.tf and it is an absoulute bargain. I enjoy it, I enjoy how hard it is, I enjoy how easy it is. I love the simplicity of the graphics. The music fits so well with each level, whether it is hectic or relaxed. However, there is always a catch. The first few levels were a bit repetitive, but once you get to the harder levels it is not repetitive at all, which I find nice. Overall, I give this game an 8/10. If the developer were to add anything, if there was a ""Defy Gravity 2"", it should be a bit more complex.			"

												I haven't played much yet, I have just had it running in background. Today I decided to actually try and play the game. Not too difficult to learn how to move the character around with the grav and anti grav beam/shot things. Seems like a fun platformer, and from the other reviews is quite short. Nice if you like the sense of achievement that comes with finishing a game! I give it 7/10			"

												This review is for the game ''Defy Gravity Extended'',a video game developed and published by Fish Factory Games on July 25,2011 for the Xbox 360 and PC.The game is a puzzle platformer with action elements and the theme is Sci-fi.GameplayAs mentioned Defy gravity is a puzzle platformer where the player has to use his gravity and anti-gravity gun in order to overcome obstacles and solve puzzles for the level to clear.By using the gravity gun,obviously,the player can create small bubbles of gravity that can pull into orbit objects and the gravitymancer and by using the anti-gravity gun the gravitymancer can levitate him or push other objects nearby away.Using the guns is pretty simple but mastering them is pretty hardcore.And when you've finally finished the game after hours and hours of dying you realise that was just the normal mode.In Hard mode you can only use the gravity gun and all objects are gravity sensitive.RecapThe game is worth it's money.It can be really frustrating since you will be dying all the time but when you finish the game it leaves you with a great sense of fulfillment and most importantly patience and persistence.P.S Thank you Fish Factory Games developers and associates for this game.

												Summary: better than Portal.The thing you need to understand about Defy Gravity is not that it is good, play for a few minutes and you will understand that, no what you need to understand is that this is better than the Portal series.It doesn't try to beat you over the head with ""humour"" like Portal. It doesn't try to draw you into an un-funny joke. Instead this gives you puzzles to be solved with platforming and using your gravity gun and quick reflexes. A lot of thought has gone into it, so it will challenge but is beatable; and it was a pleasant joy to play. "

												For the price, Defy Gravity has a pretty good level of content and quality. The music in this game really helps to set the atmosphere, allowing players to focus on the challenges ahead of them and making the overall experience more enjoyable. This is by no means a horribly difficult game, but at the same time it's not too easy either. I could easily see this as a game to play with friends, if multiplayer was enabled and I think it would be quite a lot of fun. I bought the game for only 29 cents, and it has proven to definitely be a worthwhile purchase. Even if you don't like it, Defy Gravity isn't an expensive game, so it wouldn't be much of a loss to your walletSo basically, if you're into atmospheric or ambient music, love platformers/puzzlers and are a fan of relatively challenging games, then this is for you.

												The card drops are worth more on the market than the game itself, so there is a profit just by buying and playing it for a little while.And the game should keep you entertained for some time, due to the fact that some skill is required to land the gravity gun combos needed to get through the puzzle/action levels the game is made up of. If nothing else, the soundtrack is amazing.			"

It's a neat little puzzle platformer where you use gravity and anti-gravity to navigate through tricky space hallways... of DEATH. It's a nice game to play when your bored, and is quite challenging. I wouldn't call it great, but it is definitely good. The visuals are reminiscent of a flash game, the backrounds are kinda cool, the controls are good. Overall very average, performance-wise. However, the music is really great, and perfectly accentuates the loneliness of space.			"

												So you're equipped with the Gravity Gun and as Gordon Freeman you must fight as... oh wait, not that kind of game... But you do have a Gravity Gun! With said gun, you must shoot blue and orange swirling vortexs to assist in passing each level in an effort to get cake and/or defeat an egomaniacal AI hell bent on testing, lots of testing, which... oh, wait, no cake or AI but you do have blue and orange swirling vortexes.The game seems fun with a pretty original CORE concept, and I would recommend it to friends, but the moment I read Gravity Gun I thought of Half-Life, obviously, and it's not something that will ever make me think of this game.

												This game is both relaxing and frustrating at the same damn time!  It has a Swapper vibe to it though this obviously came out prior.  Whereas that has cloning and using those to manipulate your enviornment, this has got gravity, or more specifically gravity and anti-gravity well you lauch.  Seems simple enough right?  Well...those to elements interact with the objects in your environment in unique and challenging ways that often have more than one way to get to your goal.  And although the static and moving objects follow patterns, the way your ""skills"" interact with them provides for some fun and frustrating moments.  I will probably go back and play this game again if only to chill out to the galactic chill groves of its soundtrack.  Reminds me of some of the badass music in Space Rangers 2.Oh and during this steam summer sale it's $0.30.  Yeah probably the cheapest game on sale, and worth more than that and a wee bit of your time.			"

												In a market saturated with indie platformers this game brings something refreshing to the table. Defy Gravity is probably best described as a physics based puzzle platformer;   You play as an astronaut in outer space equipped with a single use jetpack, gravity gun & shield.  The gameplay relies on requiring the player to shoot positively & negatively charged balls of gravity across each stage to aid their travel. Players will be navigating the astronaut through short levels of increasing difficulty, avoiding deadly laser beams and robotic enemies to reach the end goal.This title has no loading times between levels or deaths which results in seemless addictive gameplay. You may die instantly upon impact with a laser or enemy; but there are infinite lives and a clever checkpoint system has been implemented which means you will never be taken too far back, if you happen to fail any part of a level.Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by something so simple but different from the 2D puzzle/platformer genre.The game features Steam Trading Cards, Achievements & Xbox controller support as a bonus.I purchased this game on sale for a matter of pennies, however after playing it I probably would've paid full price.8/10 Non-stop physics based fun in 2D space but I wish there was a bit more variation in design.EDIT 6/Nov/15: The game appears to only support Xbox 360 controllers as it wouldn't recognise my unbranded PS2 style USB controller, which is a shame as it works in most of my other games.

												I'm among those many people who bought this game just because it has a ridiculously low price and the card drops have a higher value, but it was a pleasant surprise. I actually enjoy the game, and I'm not a big fan of platformers. The music is good and catchy. I ended up buying more cards to craft the badge.Totally recommended.			"

												As an action/puzzle platformer, Defy Gravity is quite basic: its mechanics, while somewhat original, feel repetitive and tiresome after a while. The soundtrack is decent, but the minimalistic visuals are very lacking, and there is no biome diversity, nor any kind of visual diversity for that matter. In terms of story, there is not much to say: there is none. The only type of background information you can gather is the one found on the ""About the Game"" section of the game's store page, which is disappointing, as the game would have stongly benefited from a solid narrative. 2.5/10 However, as a money making method, Defy Gravity excels itself, as the money made from selling its trading cards are is far superior to the game's cost. Therefore, I recommend it to anyone wanting to make some of that sweet sweet Steam cash! $$/$$			"

												Just got this game, and I've played through about half of it, and I keep thinking how much I would have loved this game as a kid.  It has the right feel for an old-school platformer, but it is a puzzle game rather than a shooting game.  It's designed like a classic 2-D sidescrolling platformer, but the trick is that you have a gun that creates two types of gravity fields.  One pulls you, and one repels you (along with some obstacles).  This makes it feel in some ways like a 2D version of Portal at times, although the feel is very different.  I am breezing through the game so far, but I have played a lot of puzzlers and platformers over the years and don't usually find them challenging anymore.  I think an average player would find this game very challenging, and it certainly is inventive.  So far, everything about the game is good from what I can tell, with one exception.  The aiming mechanic on a gamepad is a little hard to fine tune, and it's especially hard to aim when in motion on a gamepad.  This is bad as some of the puzzles are best solved with mid-air field placement.  Meanwhile, the usual gripes I have with this kind of game (bad hit detection, erratic controls, poor optimization, graphics glitches, etc) aren't an issue here.  The game feels pretty solid with the single exception of the aiming system.  Pretty good game.			"

												I'm going to go straight up and say that I did kinda buy this for the money. It's on sale for 9 pence so I decided to buy it and sell the Trading Cards for a profit. However this turned out to be suprisingly good.First off, the music isn't too bad for this type of game and the graphics... well why the f*** are people complaining??? It's not meant to be like GTA V Graphics it's a platformer! Anyway, it's a highly challenging game with good controls. It's absolutely worth the money... or the profit.The only bad thing is that it begins to get repeatative after the 3rd achievement you earn.Overall I would rate this 8/10Would profit again			"

												It runs. For sixteen cents, that's pretty good.In all seriousness, the idea of the game isn't bad. It's the execution that leaves a lot to be desired. The game is very basic- the menu is simple with next to no option, there's no story, no context, and the tutorials are just kind of shoehorned in. On top of that, the graphics are rough, the sound design is uninspired, and the controls are really awkward.If you can get it for a dollar or less, it's probably worth a look. For more than that, I wouldn't bother.EDIT: To clarify, no story or context is given in the game itself. There is an opening cinematic.			"

After putting only an hour into this game, I have to say it’s actually worth more than what I paid. The game style and play might not be for everyone but it’s definitely worth a try.  I just love how the color of the gravity/repulsion wells, and the gravity gun itself remind me of Portal.Bottom line... it a great little game.			"

												Defy gravity is one of those titles that can really (and I mean Really) get you hooked up to your monitor. Not in that classical ""Oh I lost track of my life in this masterpiece of a thing"" way. In fact, if you are that type of gamer, unless you love to get frustrated, this game is most certainly not for you. That said, if you indeed want a game that increases your levels of stress and frustration, and leads you to a path of self destruction, by all means buy the thing.I'm actually writing this review after a short session, in the hope of finding the magnificence of this piece. And guess what? Got surprisingly frustrated and full of strong emotions that made me swear like a sailor. But that's the point of a good game... right?To conclude, 11/7,5 would portal again			"

												Sales review, with 95% discount, sold the trading card twice the amount I bought.The game itself is not bad as we can see from the review.Basically the game is about moving your ♥♥♥ to a door with the help of your super gravitation controller gun.It is easy most of the time until you got into a certain stage which is frustrating since you had to jump over and over again to finish the stage.Overall it is good puzzle game.

												I got this as a weekly deal for $0.29 USD and I must say, pick this game up if you are into puzzle platformers.If you enjoy simple, yet challenging puzzle platformers, you will really like this game.The aesthetics are very simple but good - the space background is nice to look at. The music is very good, quite a bit of variety and I have been playing to both listen to the music and enjoy the challening puzzles. The controls are simple, however, you may need to practice getting used to manipulating the fields created by your gun - you can create gravity and repulsion fields. The learning curve is moderate, as the puzzles get pretty difficult once you reach the second half of the game - you will need to be good at timing to pass many of the stages. You can create one active field of each type with your gun, and you can fire twice - you will refill ammo whenever you touch the ground/jump on an enemy. The fields are destroyed when you place a new one, or you can manually destroy them. There is a shield you can turn on to ignore the effects of any fields. You can also double jump.Any golden objects can be affected by your fields, and many of the puzzles utilize this mechanic in a variety of ways. Your main hazard are purple lazers that will kill you on contact - your body explodes into several pieces (no blood), and this can be quite hilarious if you are dying within 3 seconds repeatedly and you consider the type of music playing (making it seem like less of a big deal). I've been getting into a lot of puzzle platformers, and the ones where timing is critical to completing stages are my favorite. In DG, timing is essential in the later levels. There are also several ways to complete the stages, and, if you experiment and become proficient with manipulating your fields, you can even bypass a few levels without having to use the objects the game places to help you.A very, very good platforming game, get it if you are even the least bit interested in this genre.Definitely recommend!

												Holy hell if that isnt a tough game. The initial levels took me about 30 minutes to go through but hard mode try an hour and a half. So here's my feelings on the game in 3 catagories...Gameplay:The gameplay is fun and easy to grasp, each level offers a new challange. The early levels are easy but as I got to the last 5 it took a few deaths to formulate a strategy. The gravity gun is a very interesting mechanic, left click fires a blue ball that sucks things in and the right click was an orange ball that pushed things away. I like the idea and would love to see the same concept done in a 3d environment. Overall, the mechanics were smooth and no glitches occured.Graphics:Not really an important part of this game as I'd have been just as happy with 8bit. The graphics are smooth and made for 1080p screens. The animations are basic with very few frames but this isnt really a con to the game. Really I think the artwork done for this game fit the theme and looked rather good for what it is.Sound:The music for this game is rather nice, one moment its calm and relaxing and then in some levels the music speeds up a bit for escape levels. One nice thing I'd like to note is that the sound enemies make when they bounce off of walls is there but not distracting. That I believe is very important and I'm very happy that they were careful about the volume of that ting noise they make.Overall I can definately recomend this game to casual and hardcore gamers alike. 10/10			"

												This is a nice short game with a good soundtrack.The concept on which it is based is very interesting, although it could be better implemented. You use your gun to create gravity or anti-gravity wells in order to make your way through the levels.Gravity is hard to manipulate and it can get frustrating to try so many times before succeeding, relying a bit too much on luck with the timings and the hard-to-predict behaviour of the wells.The controls are easy enough (although I had some trouble with the jumping, as it would only jump after I ran off the edge) and, again, the soundtrack is quite good.The graphics, however, aren't the best around, even though I believe the look somewhat agrees with the game. Nevertheless, the game is visually consistent and the space setting is always pleasing.With all that said, I found the game to be nice, but also frustrating and somewhat boring after a while. The good thing, though, is that it is short.All in all, it is a fun, short-lived experience, if you can keep your cool after dying so many times on the same spot because your gravity well didn't pull you well enough. I recommend you give it a try, especially since you can get it very cheap on sale.			"

												i think the dev trying to trick us here. im pretty sure the normal price is the same as the 75% (if that make sense). so apparently the dev just trick us into believing that we are saving money from the 75% discount where in the reality, we are paying normal price (a.k.a without discount). also this game is released a few years go but if u look at the store page, then u will see it being released in 2016. so in other word they just reaupload the game so people think that this is a new game. if this is true, that i am very dissapointed in the dev of this game			"

												This is a good game, but depending on what you're really expecting from a casual puzzle platformer, this game might not be for you. Takes a little effort and skills to go through late game, so you'll either end up enjoying it, or have more hair-pulling rage moments then you expect.Not bad to kill time when taking a break from the usual power gaming. But if you ask me, it should've been free, and not worth paying for. You can grab it when it's on sale, otherwise, there are way too many other options to choose from.			"

												So I only had $0.26 left in my steam wallet  (Too much spending in Dota), and was looking for something to buy. Little did I expect to stumble upon this gem. After spending only $0.14, I would have been okay if this game was literally nothing more than a pleasing menu. However, that was not the case. After playing for only about 20 minutes, I realized this is probably one of the most fun games I have played in a while. True, it is no Triple A title, but that does not mean it isn't compelling, innovative, and most importantly, just plain fun. I would highly reccommend getting it, and actually regret buying it so cheap; I would have been more than happy to support those behind such a absolute joy of a game. To not get it at full price is foolish. To not get it now is simply absurd.			"

												As this game is only 9p with its' 90% off, I wasn't expecting much, but I totally underestimated this game. Comparing it to a 2D Portal would be a vague comparison, but they are pretty similar.In this game you have a gun which shoots a blue ray, a pulling force, and a orange ray, a repelling force. Using these forces you have to figure out puzzles and ways to get around obstacles (similar to Portal) and interact with the enemies around you. The style of the game reminds me of the retro side of games, but it kind of adds some sort of character to the game. Oh and also, it gets pretty hard I wanted to dieAll in all, I really think you should get this game. Not just because it is extremely cheap, but that it has so much to over and it really enjoyable. I am not near finishing it, but I definitively have my moneys worth (it did cost 9p for Christ's sake).			"

												Pretty cool game. As others have noted, if you get it at a good sale price (0.29 cents, for instance) it's very possible to make more selling the cards you get than you paid for the game. Beyond that, however, it's just a lot of fun... it can be frustrating at times, but it's still very fair. The achievements are easy, but not too easy. It's not very long, but it's still long enough to justify the price.Bottom line: even at full price, it's worth it. But if you can get it on sale (the aforementioned 0.29 cents, for example) it's a no-brainer.			"

												This puzzle platformer is an enjoyable, quick, and (for this generation) hard game. Its achievements, although slightly buggy, are easy and basically the only drive you have to continue. I, personally, found this game fun although at points it got on my nerves because I died over, and over, and over again. However, I know quite a few people who didn’t like it at all so if your inpatient or have lots of good games to play, don’t buy this game. I bought this game on sale for 17 cents and sold its cards for more than that. Yes, you read that right and let me say it again 17 CENTS. It’s really hard to go wrong with a game you earned money by buying. In conclusion, this is a cheap game that’s an easily 100% and is actually quiet fun (for a 17 cent game anyways).			"

Well, its actually a really fun and challenging puzzle game that surprises you with what it will throw at you next. I almost forgot to mention the amazing soundtrack to this game, it is the perfect music for when you beat a level or in progress of completeing one. Unfortunantly, The only thing that bugs me are the horrible graphics but you get used to them over time...Since this game has trading cards that most sell for 0.09 cents each, and if you buy this game under 0.25 cents, you will literally make a profit from this game.

												What the hell?! The game is now so much more expensive than it was before!This game is surprisingly good for its former price. Pros: the difficulty is just right: it get's more difficult as you advance, but not to the point that you want to throw your computer against the wall. Cheap. At least it was. It was so cheap that you would actually make money from it by selling its cards! Easy 100% achievements; the graphic sprites aren't great, but are ok;  sound effects and music are satisfying. is not repetitive.Cons: if you have high expectations, this game will be too simple for you; no controls rebinding; not worth its current price; poor interface; one short gameplay and nothing else to do. No extras.For its current prince (BRL 6.29, USD 2.99), I do not think it's worth, but I will say it for my experience with this game, not only actually playing the game, but also considering the price I paid — almost nothing (BRL 0.24, which is USD 0.07): it was worth the value, so I recommend this.

												The game sucks. It really does. The controls are mostly functional, but usually not when you actually need them to be. The game randomly switches to a completely black screen in the middle of play, so you can't continue until you manage to fix it. Once youactually figure out how to use the controlls correctly to slingshot yourself around, the game becomes incredibly easy. Oh, and then there's the whole fact that this game looks and plays like it was made in Game Maker.I got it for $0.99, though, and it pretty much paid itself off with the trading cards, so I'm really not complaining.

												The game was $0.29, so I figured why not? When it's on sale for so cheap, there is definitely enough content for it to be worth the price, but overall the game wasn't great. The controls feel slow, and the physics aren't anything special. There's pretty much no story, so don't expect it to be thought provoking in any way. The game isn't bad, but it just isn't good. Keep in mind when buying this game that it's a platformer game where you mostly just dodge projectiles, and not in any way a puzzle game.From a value perspective, it's worth it if you buy it on sale, but from a gameplay perspective, it's nothing special.

If you're standing on a golden platform and make a blue portal in order to move passed a projectile, the portal may cause the platform to just start bouncing in place making you hit spikes if you're too close.

												Barely a puzzle game. Buggy, cheap looking and sounding with unreliable mechanics, bad unchangable controls, and heavy doses of monotony and unpuzzlelike randomness in later levels. Also barely a platformer since you spend most of your time helpless in the air hoping things don't kill you as you jump from buggy gravity well to buggy gravity well. Buy only if you want card profits.			"

												So Defy Gravity, quite a nice platformer, and I'm very terrible at these -.-. But this has handy mechanic which puts you in control of two wells one is pulling you (and other objects) towards it, the other is pushing you away. This allows for some dodging and jump'n'run action. Additionally you have a shield to protect you from these effects. I liked:++ unique gameplay mechanic+ cheap price (0,09€ in Steam Sale), extremely good value for your money+ challenging but doable, either with try and error or a by planning ahead++ multiple solutions for puzzles+ relatively fast respawnI disliked:- not so good collision meshes- no visual difference, levels are all looking similar to each other, variety would improve the overall experience- story is missing :((((- strange point-and-shoot feature, which requires timing (only when you release the mouse button a gravity well is created)- controls are unchangeable (but there is controller support)At the time of writing this review I did not finish the game once, but I think I may need a total of about 4 hours with my bad skills...I would recommend this game, because of its new mechanic and it is a great game to spent some time.

												This game is pure value for those that love puzzles and platformers.

												Defy Gravity is one of the worst games I've ever played. The idea itself is not bad: armed with a gravity gun, you have to make your way through all kind of (jumping) puzzles. Not enterily original, but still.But. Almost everything else about this game is awful. Sorry for the harsh words, but I find no others means to describe my feelings during playing. Controls are very, very poor, which is disastrous for this kind of game. I played it on an Xbox360 controller, which should be fine, but alas, no.Graphics are even worse - even in the 1980's, games looked way better. Sound is almost non-existent.The only reason I can see to buy this game, is for the trading cards and the xp when you craft the badge. The game is, understandably, very, very cheap, so you can even make a few eurocents if you sell the cards. Oh, there are Steam achievements too, but I gave up after under an hour out of sheer frustration.No detailed rating, but surely only 3/10 or so - and that's just for the cards. Otherwise, it would be even less.			"
