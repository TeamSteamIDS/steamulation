												How to start to describe one of the greatest games ever made? Well.. that's probably one of the reasons why I never did a review.Fallout has been, still is and probably will always be my favourite game (series) of all time. Ever since I first laid eyes on the game, somewhere back in 1997, I wish I could live in that same apocalyptic world. The perfect blend of a post-nuclear environment and 50's style, makes it unique and is the reason why I would pick this game over other great games like Baldurs Gate or Planescape Torment. Like many RPG's, you start of creating your character. Besides sex, there are no cosmetic changes. You do get to alter your skill points and perks. Depending how you create your character, you might get a whole different adventure, each time. Play as a female? You might get some unique conversations. Low intelligence? You can't even speak properly. The gameplay is real-time but turn-based in combat. You can do actions, based on your Action Points (AP) and so do your enemies. You can even aim on one of your enemies' parts; cripple his leg, shoot his head or bust his groin... it's all up to you. Your opponents often die in gruesome ways and there are tons of different weapons (melee, guns, heavy weapons, unarmed, energy), different armors for you to wear, tons of items and lots of (side) quests, so you won't get bored quickly.The writing in the game is exceptional. Most of the dialogue are interesting and often combined with a lot of (dark) humor. In my opinion, the humor is one of the best aspects of what describes Fallout, something Bethesda never got right (in Fallout 3). Only important NPC's have dialogue, which are often voiced by (former) celebrities like Dwight Schulz & Richard Dean Anderson. The narration is done by Ron Perlman, who rightfully became a Fallout Icon, over the years.The music, produced by Mark Morgan, is also excellent. It's without a doubt, one of the best soundtracks of any game. The experimental music creates the apocalyptic atmosphere, perfectly.  I highly recommend Fallout to every RPG lover out there. I could write a lot more about why I like Fallout but it all comes down to this: It's simply one of those games you have to play before you die.			"

												Let me begin by noting that I was introduced to the Fallout series with Fallout 3, back in around 2009. I put hundreds of hours into the game between Xbox 360 and PC, and I found the world to be incredibly interesting and atmospheric. The RPG mechanics and depth were like something I had never before seen, being a teenager and my life having been more saturated with more casualized games such as Call of Duty.Up until I finished Fallout, Fallout 3 was my all-time favorite.But now that I've experienced Fallout, it's as if my standards have risen tenfold. It may seem weird given that the game is seventeen years old as of writing this review, but I can elaborate. This game has managed to deliver an experience like no other game I have ever played with simple isometric graphics, and most importantly, a surprisingly complex and mature narrative. The music, sounds, and intriguing -- but again, simple -- visuals create an ambient feeling of loneliness  throughout the wasteland. The soundtrack is hauntingly fitting, for example in Necropolis, a city of ghouls. The sound creepy churchbells amid a fine chord of a low key sends shivers down my spine.Adult themes similar to the philosophy of the Ubermensch, and existentialism are very prevalent as well.I love this game, and it has shown me the real potential of video games. Books present you with narrative. Films, with narrative, visualization, and sound. Video games, with narrative, visualization, sound, and interaction.10/10			"

												Where to start with this game...'It's a classic' would be a good place to start, I guess. I have no problems say that from the outset. It's only taken me 15 years to get around to play original Fallout, but I can see without a shadow of a doubt why it's so highly regarded. Before you play this game make sure to download the Fallout Fixt mod, which is a very comprehensive community mod which fixes a lot of the bugs, and more importantly the resolution for modern monitors. Without this patch you'll more than likely experience a horrible rainbow pixalation effect during videos and gameplay. Anyway...Fallout is a turn-based RPG series which offers you various ways to tackle the game. Do you want to be a stealthy person, creeping around, pick pocketing your way to glory? Sure, why not! Do you want to be a smooth talking kinda guy who can talk his way in and out of trouble? Go on, be that guy! What about a bookworm who can use his brain to solve puzzles. Yup! And of course you can be a mix of all three, as well as a gun totting maniac! YEE-HAW!For my playthrough I used one of the pre-set characers (Albert) who was a Lawyer in a previous life and was set up with high charisma and speech skills. This opened up different dialogue trees throughout the game, which was nice. Anyway, I enjoyed this game - I enjoyed it a lot. The characters are great, the voice acting (while limited) was pretty nice (though it did give away who the 'important' characters were) and the story itself was pretty deep. The game starts, as always, with you the 'Vault Dweller' leaving your vault for the first time to explore the wastelands. You're tasked with bringing back a water chip to save your vault before everyone dies of thirst! There's a time limit to this, which (for me) cast a sense of urgency. Normally in Fallout games (Fallout 3 and New Vegas) I'm guilty of just going 'WHEEEEE' and exploring everywhere and not really caring what I'm doing. Yet in Fallout there's no time to explore, you've got to save lives!... if you want to. You see you don't NEED to save their lives, if you don't want to. In fact, you don't HAVE to do much in Fallout if you don't want to. It's not a narrow pathed experience, you can pretty much choose how you deal with the events in the game (and the end game cutscene will reflect on this at the end). A lot of games claim to be an open experience, and the actions you take reflecting on the game world, yet here's a game from 1997 which actually does that. I'm not sure it even heralds that fact that it does this. It just gets on with being a pretty damn good game. This brings me on to another aspect of the game - the many different branches of the game. People react to you differently depending on what you're wearing, what you're wielding, and what you're intelligence or charisma is. I find that amaizng now (in 2014), so I can only imagine how mindblowing it was back in 1997 when the game was released. The 'simple' graphics by today's standards shouldn't distract you from what is a very complex game. There's a lot going on under the hood of this game and at times perhaps too much.My eyes were really opened up to this towards the end of the game when I was struggling with killing a certain mob. I had went about it 'head on' and was killed a number of times. Yet, after a night's sleep I came back with a different approach, a more sneaky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s approach and it was so much easier, and strangely satisfying. I had killed the guy and he had never even seen me.OK, sure the wastelands were plunged into another 100 years of nuclear fallout in the process, but hey... I KILLED THE GUY!However, even with the Fallout Fixt mod, the game can be prone to crash now and again. I'm not sure if it's the game's memory file getting too big or a conflict with Steam Overlay (wouldn't be a first), but towards the end of the game (and a lot of different quest outcomes) it started to become slightly unstable. So save REGULARLY!Which brings me on to another thing. This is an 'old school' game. It will not autosave for you, you must take control of your own save files. If you die you won't be taken back to the next/recent checkpoint... you'll have to load up from the last point you saved. This was the only thing I didn't like, but in the end I learned to live with it and it made me realise how pampered I had become as a gamer. I didn't have autosaves and 10 minute interval checkpoints when I was a kid and I still played games all the time back then. Yet, here I am as a grown man crying about dying and having to go back 20 minutes in the game because I had forgot to save... a lesson in life this game has given me.Also, this game is tough. REALLY tough. Depending on how you build your character, or which character you choose. You will die a lot.A lot.So in closing...If you're looking for an old school RPG experience than I'd recommend giving Fallout a try. I appreciate at time of writing they're no longer available on the Steam Store, or GOG, but hopefully they return one day, as they deserve to be played.			"

												Warning: Disliking this game is punishable by death.Methods of execution include being dipped into a vat of goo by a super mutant, sliced and diced by Deathclaws, turned inside out by radiation, and the good old fashioned bullet to the head. Fun!*strolls around post-apocalyptic Southern California while listening to completely unfitting 1950's music.*(Ok, the game is fantastic if that didn't tell you enough. It's shorter than its sequels, but this one is very much worth playing. And if you seriously don't like it, don't get mad at me if the Super Mutants come and burn your house down! :P)			"

												This game is SPECIAL the amount of things to do in the giant wasteland is amazing. From clearing out raider camps to going on caravan runs just to name a few. I have never encountered a bug in all my time of playing. The story is quite long which is nice.And last but not least the RPG elements in this game are awesome for it's time. You can create your character how ever you want from age to gender to how strong you are or how smart you are. This allows for many different character builds. Overall I give this game a 10/10!			"

												Once upon a time. There was a guy who played Fallout 3 and New Vegas.He liked the games. And thought ""Hey, I want to play the first two"" So, he went onto Steam, and the lord Gaben blessed him with a sale.Immediatly, he bought the first, and downloaded it with all due haste. He excitedly loaded it up. Watched the classic Interplay intro, and clicked 'new game' as fast as his mouse would allow him.He made his character, watched the intro. And soon, he was on his way. To Vault 15.Unfortunately, five minutes after stepping into a new world, he was ambushed, he tried valliantly to shoot his attackers. But all his shots missed! Which lead to his unfortunate demise. So he rebooted, and died again. And again, And again.This guy is me.10/10			"

												First of all, I'd like to note that this review is made by someone who has recently picked this game up - no nostalgia, only objectivity.The good:- Works well, zero crashes so far, one very minor bug (Shady Sands citizen was panicking over Tandi when she wasn't even gone yet). Zero compatibility issues - they have seriously taken GOOD care of the game when they made it available on Steam (I believe it's even running on some MS-DOS emulator but you don't notice a thing about that. Also it comes with some sort of resolution patch). Also, the game is very alt-tab friendly, you can alt-tab at any time without issues.- Very good story so far (10 hours in, so can't say everything about it, but so far it's been really good). This game is all about the dialogue. There's an amazing amount of text in this game - and many characters even have spoken dialogue and animations when you're talking to them. I'd go as far as saying the story is on pretty much the same level as 3 and NV so far, in my opinion - with better character building than NV, but more of an RPG touch than FO3 (but I know opinions differ greatly on this part, so take it with a grain of salt, and feel free to disagree).- This game has aged very well. I don't exactly know how to explain it, but I actually guess the closest analogy would be the old Pokémon games, gameplay-wise. Top-down view, grid based, turn-based combat. 2D games like this never really get old. You can try to make them look better but it'll just end up looking weird. - Price. This game is dirt cheap, I got it for about €1,50 during the summer sale.Neutral:- It's a hard game. It definitely is less forgiving than Fallout 3 or Fallout New Vegas. Don't be surprised to find a surprisingly large group of surprisingly strong raiders in your path at an early level. And even if you've played FO3 and FONV, you will more likely than not screw up your S.P.E.C.I.A.L. which means you'll have to start over and make a new character early on. The S.P.E.C.I.A.L. and stats and perks are all rather complicated. I actually like it, though, despite having to start over because I have 1 strength and can't use my guns properly. The bad:-Resolution. It's locked to 4:3, and although the Steam version seemed to have some sort of Resolution patch and you can set it to your native resolution which lets you alt-tab quicker, you'll still have to either deal with pillarboxing or stretching. The textures also aren't of amazing resolutions, but that doesn't bother me much personally. The art style is amazing.- Might be hard to get hooked. Older games aren't for everyone and I understand that. I definitely love it though - and I only bought it during this summer sale. Never played it before. Hell, I was 3 years old when this game was released...Verdict:I personally think this game is easily worth the price they ask for it during a sale. It's old, but they took good care of it when they made it available on Steam. Give it a try!Edit - 18-1-2016I actually did end up playing this game a lot. However, I played it on my phone, in an emulator, so it still shows only 10.0 hours on Steam			"

												This is it. The Post-Apocalyptic RPG game that began a revolution and changed everything about the genre.PROS:- Well written story that will keep you interested until the end.- Charismatic and very well developed characters.- Karma and choice system (every positive and negative choice you made will count for the rest of the adventure).- Complex and complete interactive system and turn-based combat system.- The precise aiming system allows you to play strategically in battles (disable an enemy specific limb, blind it, stunt it, etc).- The S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system gives the game an amazing way to improve the main protagonist skills/perks.- High quality 2D graphics with exceptional animations (for its time) that gives the characters/enemies great personality and a unique style.- Music that gets you into a decadent atmosfere on a wasted and post-apocalyptic Earth.- Excellent voice acting (many of those actors are highly recognized stars from the cinema and TV)- Innovative buying/selling and trading system.- Very accurate Point-and-click controls for pointing enemies, weapons, items, lockers, treasure chest, etc.CONS:- A pair of minor graphical glitches due to its age.If you love turn-based RPGs, you like the atmosphere from the Mad Max movies and you don't care to travel in time to the 90's (technologically speaking). this game will assure you hours of fun and satisfaction.My Score: 9/10Note: Played it on Windows XP - SP3			"

												The original Fallout is hardly as accessible as its modern, 21st century sequels, however it is just as brilliant, if not more so, than the both of them put together. With fewer sidequests and a shorter main story, it isn't nearly as long as Bethesda's contributions to the series, however it more than makes up for that thanks to its incredible atmosphere and high levels of replayability.Now that I've gotten the necessary comparisons out of the way, I'd like to refrain from mentioning Fallout 3 and New Vegas from this point onwards. Yes, New Vegas ties into this game's story quite a fair bit more (considering 3 is something of an offshoot), however what it comes down to is those are two ultimately different games. What you're getting here is a turn-based strategy RPG that is dowright fantastic.I'll freely admit that the game didn't have me very intrigued when I first booted it up. The graphics were plain, the controls and interface decidedly confusing, and the mechanics unclear. However, after sticking through the game's beginning and unlocking both the world's and the story's fullest potentials, the brilliance of the experience washed over me; this is a game that is entirely dynamic. Every single action your player character takes has an effect in a far more dramatic way than most games, and a whole ton of things can vastly change based on how you respond to the challenges presented to you. I am entirely certain that after my first playthrough last week, I haven't even begun to experience the full depth of what this game has to offer.The battles in the game are initially unexciting, yet quickly become more unique. The ""Action Points"" system, while not entirely original, is still creative enough that so many years later it remains capable of keeping my attention and excitement at a high, something very rare of older RPGs (which are often plagued by interface and gameplay issues that could only be resolved later on with more powerful hardware and higher resolutions). My one gripe is the randomness of the critical hits found later on in the game; some seem to inflict so much damage to the player character that it is impossible not to be killed by them, even when at the level cap and using full power armor. This element of randomness is not appreciated given that it can instantly end the life of even the most well-prepared vault dweller. I also highly recommend you refrain from picking up the ""Bloody Mess"" perk, as it makes the gory death animations all the more satisfying when they do crop up.And make no mistake, they will crop up over the course of your playthrough, and when they do it is both grim, satisfying, and oddly hilarious. Watching a supermutant clutch at his stomach while guts spew out of them may at first leave you with a grimace on your face, and yet there's someting oddly humorous about the timing of the worm crawling out of his head when he's already been laying on the ground dead for a couple of seconds.Ultimately, it's the little details that make Fallout such an incredible game, especially given how they're able to factor into the overall experience. If you're willing to overlook an initially obtusely difficult set of game mechanics and UI elements, as well as some lacklustre graphics and annoying grammatical errors, what you'll unearth in the original Fallout is a dynamic RPG classic that is entirely deserving of its reputation as one of the greatest Western RPGs to have emerged from the lates 90s.

												When I played Fallout 3 and Fallout NV, I instantly became a fan of the fallout series. I've never played the first Fallout though. I struggled getting use to the top-down point-and-click way of playing Fallout, but I learned quickly. I learned how the game works, and I am having a BLAST! Good gameplay, fun to loot, this is a great RPG. If you love Fallout 3 and NV, then I highly recommend this game.			"

												An amazing game that laid the groundwork for an outstanding series. The first is still enjoyable today and you can see that not much has changed since 1997. Perks, SPECIAL, Pip-boy, manual targeting, character creation, leveling. It's all here. The only thing you won't find is real time combat because the game forces you into a turn-based system. That will take some time to get used to if you're a FPS player.The real shame is that most of the younger fans won't even give the first two games a go because of the graphics. The same can be said of the older players who refuse to accept the new games. I'm somewhere in the middle. I started out with Fallout 1 & 2, but I didn't become a hardcore fan until Fallout 3 and New Vegas. They all have their pros and cons, but the atmosphere and gameplay have remained mostly the same.There is a community of fans still developing bug fixes and resolution patches for this game. If you are a true fan then you owe it to yourself to play this. Might as well do it now while it still works on modern computers.			"

												Fallout 1, the Holy Grail, the Michael Jackson, the ♥♥♥♥ing Switzerland of video games.My grandma told me to pick a gift, anything really, for my 10th birthday and by some cosmically fortuitous chain of events and decisions, I found Fallout: A Post Nuclear Role Playing Game in the video game aisle to be the most to my liking. Of course I had no idea what a 'role playing game' was nor had anyone in my family ever wondered what PEGI 16 meant. Needless to say, with that purchase, grandma had probably affected my life the most since she decided to give birth to my father.Fallout is packed with (dark) humour, social commentary and pop-culture references. Honestly, I wouldn't get half the American idioms or jokes I do today... Playing it at a time the internet wasn't as ubiquitous, I completed dozens of playthroughs to explore all the endings, quests, dialogue options, nooks and crannies, lockboxes and special encounters. The fact I didn't get bored is an endorsement in itself. I still remember how eerie it felt arriving at the Brotherhood, figuring out The Glow or encountering a patrol of super mutants for the first time. I was quite immersed and instead of thinking 'I'll just reload a save', got genuinely scared of what would happen if the mutant with the minigun opened fire. (I'd be criticalled for 583 damage, having my head and arms torn off) The sense of free exploration and consequences of your actions you get when strolling too far west from the starting area and getting killed by super scary monsters is something most of today's RPGs are missing with their linear film-like narratives, tutorial quests and whatnot. Save game management is quite important, it may easily happen you'll lose a couple of hours of gameplay or that an earlier decision has narrowed your choices significantly or that you've managed to paint yourself into a corner bug-wise.The soundtrack is great, the S.P.E.C.I.A.L system is great. Everything about it is great.I know this was 90% nostalgia, but I don't care.			"

												     The original Fallout is a turn based RPG.  You create, control, and level up a single character, but you can also recruit others to your cause.  Unfortunately, followers can only have their weapons upgraded in the vanilla version of the game; however, with Fallout Fixit, they can level up and have the armor upgraded like in Fallout 2.     The game is short by RPG standards -only about 20 hours- but a low price should offset such concerns.  Furthermore, the time that you do spend in game is what I refer to as quality game play time;  in other words, there are no boring and repetive quests or other filler content that increases game time without really adding to the game.  Your time spent in Fallout 1 will be filled with lighting raiders on fire, taking headshots on super mutants, performing unique side quests, and collecting all manner of new and destructive weapons.     Unfortunately, Fallout 1 is not without it's flaws.  For one, the grapics are quite dated.  If beautiful graphics are a requirement for you, then you might want to skip this one.  Second, the inventory interface is rather clunky.  Such an interface would probably be considered unacceptable by modern standards, but it's not bad enough that it should destroy your ability to enjoy the game.  Finally, there are other small concerns (such as the inability to move followers that get in your way).  However, these are mostly fixed by the Fallout Fixit patch.  In fact, I highly recommend this patch (see the Steam Forums or do a Google search).  It restores some cut content, makes followers more useful/powerfull, includes the high resolution patch, and much more.     The game may be showing its age when it comes to graphics and a clunky interface, but RPG lovers willing to look past these flaws will find a diamond in the rough.  The RPG mechanics are quite satisfying and the world and atmosphere are so captivating, that even after 15 years and 4 other Fallout games, fans still can't get enough.			"

												One of the first real modern cRPGs and part of the late 90s cRPG revival which is now in old school territory. This single character classless turn-based isometric RPG is still considered a high-water mark of the genre. The quests can be completed multiple ways using multiple character types. The game is loaded with skill checks.  Combat, speech, and stealth paths are all viable and supported heavily right through to the end game. Replays are a must in order to witness this amount of depth.  The writing and voice acting is top notch and the dark/humorous post nuclear setting in an alternate retro-future timeline as imagined by 1950s America is something SPECIAL.  Perhaps the most controversial element is the time limit but I'd argue it adds a good sense of urgency lacking in nearly every other RPG. Truth is it's very generous and can be extended.  For those of us who played the game many times, it's actually moot since the game can be completed in 30 minutes if you know what you are doing.			"

												It's year 2017 and I completed ""Fallout"" for the first time. A post-apocalyptic turn based RPG. You need to help your nuclear vault community by finding a water purifying chip, otherwise they are doomed. Find your way in a desert world full of mystery, monsters and fighting factions. The game is really enjoyable if you like classic RPGs and don't mind older graphics.PROS:- Graphics is oldish today, but it sets the mood really well and is quite nice.- Atmospheric music.- Non linear plot with multiple ways to achieve goals and multiple outcomes.- Good story.- Character development impacts your fighting strategies and dialogue options.- Multiple factions to join, work with and fight.- Multiple weapons.MEH:- Some companions may join you and help you, but you can barely manage them and they may be a nuissance.- Interface is oldish and may be a little annoying at times (but only a little). By the way: you can enter numbers from keyboard when you trade with someone, you don't need to set the price with mouse (which is slow).- There is a huge random factor in combat, so you need to save often. Because even if odds are in your favor you may lose.CONS:- None :)Conclusion: I highly recommend this classic RPG with satisfying story and immersive post-apocalyptic mood.GAMEPLAY 8/10GRAPHICS 8/10AUDIO 8/10STORY 10/10			"

 Please consider that I am slightly biased, as I just finished the game, five minutes ago. Fallout: A Post Nuclear Role Playing game is amazing. No Fallout game has gotten as much of an emotional responce as the original.The locations are great, every location has it's own charm.Some characters are really memorable and cool, such as Harold, in Old Town.The turn-based combat system allows for actual strategy, though sometimes that goes out the window with Criticals.The fact that this game is so unforgiving makes struggling through that more rewarding,Call me a monster, but shooting your raider-attackers as they flee for their lives is strangely satisfying.I'm, personally, HEAVILY against time-limits. I'm in the game to see the sights, do the quests, and go at my own pace. (The game lets you do that once you've collected the water chip.) For the Fallout fans... The only negative thing I can say about this game, is comparing it to Fallout 4 really shows what's happened to the series. Depressing.Super Mutants aren't one-note brutes! They're organized, powerful, sometimes intelligent! The Brotherhood of Steel does their DAMN JOBPower Armour is *very* rare but it's very, very effective. With it, pistols, SMGs, even Miniguns have 0 effect on the wearer.No quest markers, not a bad thing, just a heads-up. Gods, I love this game.  "

												Fallout 2 is the better game. The mixture of a big world, plenty of unique NPCs, many side quests, complex dialogue trees, and a nice amount of adult-themed humor and social critique are still unsurpassed.However, Fallout 1 just oozes that dark, gritty atmosphere. The future happens to be a grim place. The awesome  atmospheric soundtrack, the memorable characters you meet (often with a well-aimed critical shot to the crotch), and the broken towns and nuclear wastelands you visit during your journey through southern California all contribute to that special post-apocalyptic ""feel"" in ways that Fallout 2 can't quite copy, and Fallout 3 is totally unable to achieve. This CRPG from 1997 was made for PC gamers who prefer good dialogues, adult themes, an immersive experience, and a deep role-playing system.			"

												Fallout 1 is an interesting game that shows the world that it's age doesn't matter. My first fallout game that i played was fallout 4 so it was quite a journey changing from a fps to turn based strategy. I'll be simple and write pros and cons of this game, if you don't want to waste your time reading through that...i reccomend it 9/10Pros:-Story is well written and completing quests really feels like a reward-Characters are very well done and you can hear an interesting story as well :)-Post apocaliptic California feels like a real post apocaliptic place, the vibe of this destroyed world is really well done-Weapons and thier sounds are awesome( it's about to get messy! )-Music, music, music what else could I say, it's a masterpiece and no other fallout by now couldn't beat this thing, it's amazing-Quests are really fun sometimes( like exploring the glow)Cons:-I'm a wrong kid born in a wrong time, therefor i don't really like the battle mechanic of this game but it keeps this game original-Quests tend break and that causes glitches and bugs, and some NPCs send you to a quest that you can't complete-I won't lie the game is pretty hard, even on normal difficulty Final verdict: Altough old this game is still fun for any rpg fan or even better a fallout fan, fun quests, great world and cool weapons what's not to like :)			"

												I HIGHLY reccommend this game to anyone who is a lover of roleplaying games, games where you can truly put yourself in someone elses shoes, break away from reality for a couple of hours as you immerse yourself in a world where your choices actually inpact nearly every situation. Trust me when I say this, this game may be old but its honestly better then most RPGs out today, the things you discover while out exploring the world will truly leave you with your mouth hanging open! Once you start playing you wont want to stop, you'll wana keep playing unril your sure you've explored every nook and cranny, talked to every NPC, and blew the face off of every enemy you encounter!

												Believe it or not I made it all the way to 2016 without playing a Fallout game but boy am I glad I decided to start at the beginning. Nearly 20 years after its initial release and this game still holds up. Like a fine wine or some scrumptious cheese it has indeed aged quite nicely. Although, I understand that this game may not be to everyones taste - much like that of the aformentioned wine and cheese. The dated graphics (and no, mods can't fix that) as well as the turn based combat may be an instant turn off for some people but I urge you not to judge this game at face value. This game is genuinly engrossing if you just take the time to sit down and immerse yourself in this masterfully crafted world. Your time will not be wasted. You can be what you want right from the start of the game you have the option of creating a completely customised character, which I strongly recommend. Even before the game has begun the entirely open ended adventure is presented to you. You have full command over the person YOU want to be. Do you want to be an honest man of the people? Skilled with a number of weapons, but only willing to draw on those who deserve it. A vicious psychopath? One who detests guns and craves blood with his bare hands. A free peace loving care free individual? Whom always uses their medicinal substances with the utmost responsibility of course. You can even play as a mentally damaged individual, struggling through day to day life and conversation in the wasteland if you so choose. Your adventure is unique.Another thing, the writing in this game is superb, and at times, downright hilarious. Just be prepared to do a lot of reading. In essence this game is a text based adventure with an isometric skin on the top. Which brings me to the animations, which are oozing with detail. Holstering weapons, enemy attacks and death animations in particular which always seem bring a smile to my face - although probably for the wrong reasons. Not to fear, it isn't just silent reading with some fancy moving pictures thrown in to keep you entertained. The audio is a real treat. Each settlement you encounter throughout your journey across the wasteland plays host to a unique soundtrack that does wonders for world building. On top of this, some key NPCs have completely voiced dialouge. In a game of this age a cringe fest of audio is to be expected yet you are pleastly surprised when you are treated to an atmospheric soundtrack and wide variety of  excellent voice acting. Seriously, wandering into a new settlement for the first time and being blown away by the diversity in the voiced dialouge is quite entertaining. I could go on about the writing of the questlines and dialouge or numerous amusing allusions to various pop culture icons...But I won't. Becuase this truely open ended experience is just that. An experience. To go on any longer threatens to ruin the magic of the unknown and adventure that is Fallout.			"

												The Fallout world is my favourite fictional world, period. The lore is deep and intelligent, and packed full of interesting characters, concepts, and secrets for the player to learn about and discover. The debut Fallout game itself is a classic RPG by an measure, and one of the best RPGs of the 90s. While not as accessible as the most recent games in the series, Fallout doesn't lack charm and depth, and for those with the patience to tackle a game that's part classic RPG, part adventure game, it holds a wealth of wonderful fiction to discover. However, As much as it was a great achievement in terms of storytelling and world-building, it is a product of its time and thus suffers from some of the problems that plagued both the aforementioned genres in the 90s: clunky UI, an isometric camera that often impedes movement and blocks items and people, combat that relies utterly on chance with little skill involved, unforgiving difficulty for beginner characters, and - worst of all IMO - illogical solutions to problems that can leave unwitting players frustrated. You didn't think to use a radio on that one particular computer? Too bad, buddy, you're stuckFallout 2 is bigger, streamlines some of the technical issues and irons out some unintuitive features, but I think that this is the superior game when it comes to plot, tone, and narrative. The fantastic voice acting from some great performers coupled with the driving storyline really draws you in and makes you feel like there is something real at stake. The narrative and the world really are the game's strongest features. Complaints aside, I do recommend that any fan of the Fallout series commit some time to discovering this game, and delving deeper into the world of Fallout.			"

nukes-viewHi all, nukes here.Fallout is a isometric, free roam, turn based (combat only), role playing game. I found to be a great game, although yes it is dated and hasn't aged well in graphical terms. The content and story I found great and enjoyed every minute.Considering its release date of 1997, it still is overall a brilliant game, anyway let me explain myself.The Game PlayBefore you start on your journey you are able to create a character. With various options and choices related to a point based skill system, that is also commonly used in the later fallout games.After character creation you are put in the shoes of a dweller of vault 13, sent out into the desolate wastelands save the vault.DifficultyThe difficulty of the game is, let's say unforgiving if you are unprepared. I must admit I died quite a few times walking into places I didn't belong or starting fights with bigger stronger characters.Hopefully you will find your demises just as funny as I found mine. (Save regularly)In the options you can set the difficulty of the games combat system in your favour. I left this at a default state to enjoy the game as it was intended.Controls & InterfaceI cannot say I am a fan of the control system but for the age of the game I can see why the controls were done in this way. Although once you get the hang of them it become straight forward.First of all they are a little hard to get use to as there is no definitive tutorial and is based on a left click and right click system with a hold function, the keyboard is not necessarily required.The inventory system is simple and works well, although for future games I hope to see much more functionality. It uses a drag and drop system with hold click as well.AchievementsThis game has no steam achievements. Which I think increased my enjoyment of the game.StoryThe plot of the story I found to be great as it gets you stuck in straight away. By giving you a lengthy time limited quest to save the people of your vault right away gives you a sense of urgency. I found the main quests and side quests fun which kept me coming back for more. The ending I found was very fitting and I hope anyone who plays through the game enjoys it as much as me.Combat System The combat is turn based, with each turn you have action points (AP) relating to how much agility you have including traits that can give you extra AP's for a turn. What you do in combat is up to you although everything will have a cost of AP you could if you fancy shoot your own allies or miss the enemy and accidently vaporise your ally.Skills & TraitsEvery time you level up you get to put points into certain skills and every three levels you can choose a trait, not counting the two you can choose on character creation.I chose traits and skills on how I wanted to build my character some of them you will find useful and some you won't. Try saving before hand to test ones out. So you're not stuck with something you don't find useful.Sounds  & EffectsDue to the age of the game the sounds are still pretty decent and fitting for the wasteland environment.GraphicsThe graphics although dated for game that came out in 1997 are still pretty good, although trying to find items on the floor can be a little challenging.Cut ScenesThe cut scenes, death scenes and endings are great, although dated now I still enjoyed them.Humour & TriviaI liked the games humour and spent a good few hours on the fandom wiki. I liked that Dogmeat is a reference to Madmax 2 which was completely unexpected.Woof!Game UtilitiesBe careful the game does not offer a auto save function so any vault dweller must be extra careful before taking important actions. Whether it is stealing from or killing an innocent civilian or starting a fight with a super mutant.You may end up quite dead.MultiplayerThis game is single player only and does not contain any multiplayer. Although you can hire non player characters (NPC's) as mercenaries to follow you around on missions. Which is highly useful so long as you don't accidentally shoot them instead of your enemies. Bugs - ImportantUnfortunately fallout has a tendency to crash at random times which I presume is based on the fact it was not meant to run on newer versions of windows.So vault dwellers I recommend you save regularly.Also be wary of tabbing out, many have reported not being able to get back into the game although the game seems minimised. This not necessarily true hover down in the left hand corner above the task bar and you will find an invisible box click it and should maximise fallout.ConclusionOverall I found this game very fun to play, par the minor crashes and issues with tabbing out. This game may be dated by modern game standards.I personally think this is a fantastic game and hopefully never forgotten, if you ever have the chance to play and you have played any of the fallout games I strongly recommend you play this one.Hope I helped.ηυĸєΜ266 "

												The Fallout Series has always been a favorite of mine. When I first played Fallout 1, I sucked so much at it. (Although this can be traced back to the fact that I actually didn't play very many turn based games) At times I would stop playing due to its difficulty, but after a while you get the hang of it. My suggestion would be if you like old school turn based RPG's that can be a challenge, definitely buy this game. The story is fantastic and the gameplay is fun yet challenging. The only complaints would be the few bugs here and there as well as the ending. There's nothing wrong with the ending itself, its just that after you beat the game you cannot continue with your save. Kinda sucks, but other than that the game is flawless. It will always be one of my favorite games of all time.			"

												THE game of post-apocalyptica.Nothing can beat punching the ♥♥♥♥ ouf ot a deathclaw with a powerfist while being a ""chatty"" character.The humor is more subtle than in Fallout 2 or any other follow-ups that just misunderstood the main idea.You want your nuclear warfare survival fix? This is it. Either this or ""Call of Pripyat'"" with Misery mod on full realism.Go for the eyes!P.S. The end bits of the game are laughably difficult, every enemy does constant critical hits on you and get two turns in one. It's a save-load fest, however other parts are quite entertaining.P.P.S.

												Legendary role-playing game with very sophisticated turn-based battle system and supreme universe of dark age after nuclear war.And, finally, it is working properly on Steam, with convenient High Res fix, which was really needed!I remember buying the game 2 years back, and it was without that fix back then. So it was lost for many players, until some wizardry wind (probably from GOG galaxy), turned this game alive once more. Now it is more stable and reliable on Windows 7 and upper, than Fallout 3.Another fix I've noticed from my previous experience - they cut all kids from the game, so you can't kill them and become child killer now. Good thing, even if it is a restriction for somebody role-playing a maniac. There are too many of them around us already.What else can I say? The game is a must-have for any real fan of true role-playing games and tough turn-based fights. It is much better than all three new Shadowrun games, in scenario, in combats, and overall complexity.Multiplicity of choices on every step, and various consequences for every step you'll made. Very clever opponents, even overpowered for modern casual players. And that unforgettable feeling of frontier, with that leather armor from old Mad Max on your shoulders.An essence of western role-playing games. 10/10 mark, as goes with all golden bars of gaming in my collection.

												An amazing isometric RPG with a post-apocalyptic theme, Fallout has become one of my go-to games when in need of a serious RPG nostalgia trip. The series is my favourite series of all time, for good reasons.Pro's:+ Amazing depth, with interesting skills and perks, making for awesome character development.+ Fantastic story with multiple endings, and long/short ways to achieve those endings.+ Engrossing world with interesting characters, quests and background stories to really set the mood of the wasteland.+ Steam edition includes some nice UI touches with the widescreen mod built-in.+ Combinations of points 1 & 2 make for exceptional replayability with different characters each time.Con's:- Unforgiving (Not really a con to me as I enjoy the challenge) Daunting for new RPG players unfamiliar with the genre.- Still some minor bugs present throughout the years.- Some redundant perks that can seem good at first pick and then become useless.

												War. War never changes.The Romans waged war to gather slaves and wealth. Spain built an empire from its lust for gold and territory. Hitler shaped a battered Germany into an economic superpower.But war never changes.In the 21st century, war was still waged over the resources that could be acquired. Only this time, the spoils of war were also its weapons: Petroleum and Uranium. For these resources, China would invade Alaska, the US would annex Canada, and the European Commonwealth would dissolve into quarreling, bickering nation-states, bent on controlling the last remaining resources on Earth.In 2077, the storm of world war had come again. In two brief hours, most of the planet was reduced to cinders. And from the ashes of nuclear devastation, a new civilization would struggle to arise.A few were able to reach the relative safety of the large underground Vaults. Your family was part of that group that entered Vault Thirteen. Imprisoned safely behind the large Vault door, under a mountain of stone, a generation has lived without knowledge of the outside world.Life in the Vault is about to change.			"

												Really amazing game. I have always enjoyed the fallout series. In my opinion 1 is the best game in the series while 2 is the second best, though i have not played any 2 on steam yet i have on my old computer with the fallout collection disc. Anybody who is willing to put some effort into it because there is somewhat of a learning curve should buy this game. For my builds i usually use the gifted and bloody mess perk's, Then max out int agi and per. that build along with tagged skills in Small guns for earlier parts of the game, energy weapons for later on, and speech to exploit some really useful stuff should get you through the game with flying colors if you know what you are doing. Over all i give it 10/10 its one of the best games of all time.			"

												""War. War never changes."" - Fallout NarratorFallout 3 was most likely your first introduction to the Fallout series, I know it was for me. That game came out in 2008 though. So, because of that you might not want to go back and play a game from 1997, a game, that is very different from the one that came out in 2008. I get it.I still urge you to pick this old gem up and give it a try. Yeah, it might be a bit dated and tough to go back to the archaic 90s gameplay of the past, but it's still an amazing game that can offer you a fantastic narrative experience, and great insight on the origins of this franchise from it's original developer Interplay Entertainment.If you are a true fan of this series, you owe it to yourself to go back and experience the story of the original game.9/10: ""A cult classic video game that started one of the best RPG franchises in gaming.""

												Very few games do what Fallout 1 does.Very few games let you play the entire campaign without firing a single shot or killing a single creature. Fallout 1 doesVery few games manage to tell a meaningful dark story while also making you laugh at jokes and references. Fallout 1 does.Very few games capture the table top rpg experience without losing much during the transition to video game. Fallout 1 does.Very few games provide a level of replayability that the experience is still exciting years later. Fallout 1 does.Fallout 1 gets so many things right it quickly becomes clear why it overshadowed the very material it was based upon. It has so many short comings and problems and graphically it doesn't stand the test of time as well as other games but to the individual who is willing to take the time to learn the systems and get involved in the world the game offers up will have the potential to lose many hours and restful sleeps as you always want to go on one more adventure or try something in a different way.The game is a true role playing experience, to enjoy it for what it offers you need to become less of a power gamer and instead focus on rolling with the punches and taking leaps of faith as you forge the story and personality of your character. You need to become the person who enjoys reading text and develop a love for turnbased combat. Fallout 1 isn't for everyone and coming here from fallout 3-current is going to be jarring and difficult for some, and that is alright, but it is worth the money and time to at least give it a chance as the game rewards you with an experience no other game really has matched.The steam version of this game runs fine on modern hardware with little to no setup however installing the fan made community patch 'Fallout Fixit"" will make your experience far less buggy, crash prone, balanced, and clean.I could not recommend fallout enough and it is easily in my top ten games of all time.

												""Get the vault a new water chip? How hard can it be?""*while travelling to Vault 15*You stumbled into a pack of radscorpions""Ok I'll just kill them with this 10MM pistol""4 turns later I'm dead10/1011/07/16I'm going to write an *actual* review now. Fallout is an amazing example of an RPG. It sets up the atmosphere and look of a world scorched by nuclear fire amazingly. The game hits the ""Post apocalyptic desert"" right on the head. There's no plant life, water, anything of that sort. As a first in a series it is a good solid foundation for the next game in the series, Fallout 2. You are able to completely design your character, there's no backstory of your character given to you. (I'm looking at you Fallout 4) All the game says to you is: You live in a Vault. That's it. You can be the second coming of Jesus, or Satan incarnate. Also most dialouge options will follow a forumla and you'll be given 4 or sometimes more choices. These are:Yes, I will do ____No, I will not do ____Say something that pisses the NPC off, failing the quest.Say something that causes the Super Mutants to find your Vault more easily. (Yes I borrowed this from another review but it works so)This game is the second best in the series, bested by only it's sequel Fallout 2. It is truly a 10/10 game.			"

												You know. I've not played much of this game. I mean, 34 hours isn't just something I did on my lunch break. But it's not hundreds of hours like I've put into other games. But honestly, I find that to be a good thing. Fallout left me satisfied. I felt full after eating this meal. I didn't want to go back and have seconds to fill myself up. My one singular adventure was enough for me to be happy. That's something that this game captured that only Fallout 2's been able to capture in the Fallout series for me so far. I've put a lot of hours into the other games. 3, NV, 4. And that's because for as great or terrible as they may be, I'm still left with a grumbling stomach. Really, that's why I recommend this game, because I'm sure that after one playthrough you'll feel full for a while and want to reflect on the meal you've just had, and not go back for seconds the second you finished it like with many other games.

												Summary: Post-apocalyptic isometric turn-based RPGMultiplayer: NoCompletion: 20 hrsCards: NoCloud: YesYep. Still good after nearly 20 years. Fallout presents a world that has been devastated by the nuclear apocalypse. Underground containment facilities known as Vaults house the last remnants of humanity and the battle for survival has begun.Fallout uses a hex-grid isometric turn-based combat system. Combat blends seamlessly into its map system, much like games made with the Infinity Engine. It's a fun system, but there's only one problem I have with it - everything takes its turn one at a time. This becomes problematic when there's 20 things on the screen and you spend more time watching the computer make its moves compared to your single move. If there was a way for all NPCs to take their turn at the same time, that'd be a vast improvement. For the most part the game aged well. The steam version includes tweaks to help it run on modern systems, which helps immensely. The chat interface is still rather confining, but you get used to it. There's a lot of freedom in Fallout.  I have an unhealthy obsession with making and optimizing new characters to suit my play style. You can gun down friend and foe alike, devastate entire towns, and still complete the game. Even though there doesn't feel like there's a lot of quests, Fallout actually takes a fair amount of time to get through without speedrunning. But I can sum up why we love the game - Power Armor. After mowing down hordes of raiders while wearing naught but leather, it's satisfying to procure the ultimate badass protection in the land. Oh yessss. And you can reinforce it for good measure!Fallout will likely remain among my favorites for years to come. Being able to create new character concepts and impose new challenges upon myself, I will happily play the game yet again in ten more years. I rate this a 9/10.			"

												Hey folks! thought I would give Fallout a quick little review rundown. Over the last few days, I have done nothing but play this game. It really kept me wanting to get to the end of it and see what had happened to the settlements I had worked with. What works about 'Fallout' is it starts off with a time limit for you to get a water chip so it starts off seeming really restrictive, Not soon after did I realize that went away when you get the water chip and I must have had around 1,000,000 random encounters through the entire game (obviously I'm exaggerating) Iook, I loved this game but I had a ton of issues with crashes and irritation from just how hard the game really was (not a bad thing at all:P) 'Fallout' is a game like no other and is different from other Fallout games for countless reasons. Looking back at it now for a 1997 game, what you see is what you get and what you get is awesome. Another thing that works in the game is the story and dialogue goes so deep it's ridiculous, you can tell how many playstyles the developers expected different people to go through. And high praise needs to go to the scary ♥♥♥ soundtrack for the game. Listenening to the Boneyard and Necropolis music in this just made me neither cry of fright. It's done so well. Just be warned. You might not exactly enjoy this game, it's an old game and takes some getting used to but for me well I play old games all the time! Fallout is near perfect and future Fallout games should pay more attention to this one.			"

												Fallout is one of those games that you just never forget. It's world and storyline just sticks with you and becomes part of the basis on which you judge all other games. It is a game that changes all of your preconceptions of how an RPG should play out. What is good? What is evil? Fallout is a game that ask you what is most important, the intention to do good or the end result being good despite the intention. Nothing is simply black and white and nobody's actions are simple.Fallout starts out simple enough, you are a Vault Dweller. Living beneath the earth sheltered from the nuclear devastation above you have never had to worry much about anything until now. Your vault's water chip has failed and there is no spare on hand so the Overseer, the supreme ruler of the vault, nominates you to be the first person ever to leave vault and go forth and procure a new water chip.As you leave the vault and begin to travel the outside wasteland you quickly find that you are not the only survivors in this post-apocalyptic world. Other vaults and just plain resourceful people have managed to build communities and the world is rebuilding, for the most part. As you travel around to these communities and their inhabitants question your sanity as you question them about vault's and water chips you quickly realize that a greater threat looms in the horizon, one that neither you nor your vault can ignore for long.Fallout is an isometric with turn based combat, you can recruit companions along the way but the lack of any direct control over them makes them rather suicidal, or in the case of the ones using burst weapons, makes you rather suicidal. The combat is not particularly brilliant but works well enough that you won't get annoyed with it until many playthroughs in.You advance your character using the S.P.E.C.I.A.L system, ""Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility and Luck"", and have a multitude of skills to help you along the way. Many of the skills are non-combat related and having high skills or stats can open up new conversation options and previously unseen ways of completing quests and objectives. Most notable is the low intelligence options. While having a low intelligence, and thus very low skills, will close off most of the normal options for you throughout the game it will also create unique dialog and options with nearly every character in the game making it an experience worth a playthrough all on it's own.Fallout's open and extremely non-linear world, it's superb writing and storyline, it's strong and memorable characters and it's unique take on morality makes it one of the best gaming experiences around, worth a play even today.It is a game that challenges your perceptions of grey and your perceptions of RPG's. As you travel through the wasteland you'll find greed, hatred, joy and sadness and you'll get to chose to help or hurt, just not always in the way you expected. You'll see things of pleasure and things of pain and you'll get to choose your own way through every challenge as you brave the wilderness of a post-apocalyptic world.In the end you will find that your ally is truth, your enemy is a desire to do good and your only hope for victory is tragedy...Buy it if you don't already own it. Play it if you do.			"

												This is it. The beginning of the Fallout franchise. And what a beginning it was.Fallout (along with its sequel, Fallout 2, and the spinoff Fallout Tactics to an extent) is an isometric, turn-based cRPG. The main premise of Fallout is surviving in a heavily destroyed post-apocalyptic world ravaged by nuclear warfare. The post-apocalyptic setting of Fallout is influenced greatly by other forefathers of the post-apocalyptic genre in fiction, most notably the Mad Max films and Wasteland, the video game. Interestingly enough, Fallout established itself as an immense influence in the genre not long after the game's release, becoming an iconic flagship of the setting for years to come.The game uses a top-down perspective, and characters can move in six directions, within a hexagonal grid. Combat in the game is based on using this grid-based movement system to move your character around the battlefield, and attack/do other actions using action points. Each character is granted a limited number of action points (AP) per turn, and when their AP runs out, the turn ends, and the enemy party is allowed to act. Fallout's combat system places a large emphasis on planning and forethought, and also on smart and informed character building. Fallout is apparently well-known for its difficulty, and although I disagree with it being a particularly hard game, it may still be difficult for new players to get into because of the depth of the gameplay mechanics, and how relatively badly they're documented within the game itself. While I by no means want to imply that Fallout is cryptic, there are still plenty of things within this game that are tougher for new players to grasp. The game has no real tutorial, and some of the menus are cluster♥♥♥♥s to navigate, resulting in the game taking a while to learn how to play fluently.Albeit the combat of the game is relatively simple, (you can move, open menus/your inventory, attack, and do aimed attacks) the combat system is extremely good, and also incredibly satisfying, especially when it goes your way. Probably one of the best I've ever experienced in a cRPG, in fact. The combat does exactly what it is supposed to do and does it very well, and can even be exploited by players that were careful with their character's build to get great benefits, like being able to get immense criticals by aiming at specific enemy body parts (Rat was critically hit in the eyes for 666 hit points, blinding the unlucky creature. Rat was killed.) or being able to attack more times per turn by stacking AP properly. Fallout encourages powergaming heavily, and greatly rewards players that are experienced in the game.Fallout's combat is not without its flaws, however. There is at times a frustratingly heavy emphasis on RNG, the best example of which being how the player's chance to hit is always capped at 95%, regardless of their skill in the weapon/other factors. This leaves a window for the player to be able to miss, no matter how ridiculous the circumstances. There is also a rather obscure critical failure mechanic, where if your skill in something is too low (or even if it's high enough) you'll ♥♥♥♥ up on that specific action so hard that you'll break what you're trying to do. Sometimes in combat you'll lose a turn or even break your weapon. While this mechanic was probably meant to make the gameplay more dynamic, it only truly results in making it more frustrating for players, and usually leads to players saving exceedingly often to pad themselves against the game's inherent unpredictability.The game is relatively short by RPG standards, usually lasting around 20-30 hours for most (non-completionist) players, but has an enormous amount of content. While a skilled and dedicated player can beat the game in under an hour if they wish to, there is nothing stopping you from tackling on Fallout's great many side-quests and encounters. There is a heavy emphasis in this game on quality over quality, and it shows, as every event in the game is unique and there is pretty much no copy-pasted filler content.All in all, Fallout is an iconic RPG, in great part shaping both the genres of modern post-apocalyptic fiction, and that of role-playing games, and is heavily befitting of being called a true classic. If you consider yourself a fan of role-playing games and haven't played this, you seriously need to. If you consider yourself a fan of Fallout games and haven't played this, you seriously need to get out.The darkness of the afterlife is all that awaits you now. May you find more peace in that world than you found in this one... "

												I think this is probably the Fallout with the best tone. From the very beginning with the hauntingly beautiful intro, to the very end with the greatest tragedy of the fallout universe, I personally see this as having one of the best tones in any video game. The gameplay may not appeal to some, but if you haven't heard of or seen the end of this game yet, play it. It's worth it.			"

However if you are into oldschool CRPG'S and are absolutely passionate about fallout and want to tell everyone youve played them all. Go for it. This game does requre patience to be fun.

												It almost feels blasphemous to say anything bad about a classic like this that people have always held in such high regard but the truth us its A decent enough game but definitely overrated and not just because its mechanics show their age. The visuals suck and the interface is clunky and cumbersome. It can be easy to miss items/NPCs/doors because of how they blend into the background share the same sprite as others or just The isometric view just being awkward . Locations can feel plain and dull. Companions are just an annoyance to trap you in a corner or shoot you in the back. Every settlement is completely anal about you putting your weapon away. Conversation checks are invisible (speech checks etc) so you won't know when you use them. Most skills are next to useless. It always felt like I had more to sell than shopkeepers could ever buy off me. There are some good and comical lines in conversations. Combat is Turn based fun and bloody/gore and critting super mutants in the eyes with a good plasma rifle never got old. V.A.T.S lets you aim for the eyes or private areas. Random encounters are dangerous to fun or funny or WTF lol. You can sometimes play multiples ways doing some quests such guns blazing or use stealth or tricks but these are not always obvious such as wearing robes for disguise or using the radio on force field signals. The setting feels right for what it is. The Voiced NPC's are voiced well. People recommend  you to save alot and this is true. But is this a good thing ? Punishments can be severe and situations do happen like a towns guards will try to kill you and your find out another time it was because something like you didn't put your gun away or killing someone in self defence can cause a town to be hostile/or ban you. Some people will like this but most people are just going to reload. Choices are good when done well. Later Fallout games you take responsibility for your actions still but give you more options for the aftermath. Alot of Fans of later Fallout games will naturally be interested to see what the earlier games are like. While you may love or hate them they are difficult to compare as they are very different. The biggest thing being perhaps an Isometric vs a FPS Style and for me I prefer the FPS style, I find it alot more immersive and fun too. One thing that could be shared is the dialogue. You have the voiced conversations and the choices of what to say be polite or not or funny.(Fallout 4 being the boring exception here) You also have the Extra type NPC's who just stand around saying their one liners just like later games.Another thing shared is the Lore and if nothing else people can may pick up some background info on the Fallout Lore and have a chance in some form to visit alot of the places and NPC's that are mentioned in later games. Many other things feel very different because its like comparing two different games an old isometric game vs a modern FPS RPG with a few hints and references that your in the same world. Overall Fallout 1 Is a good game but it has to be taken from a different approach to the later games.  Personally I would love to see Fallout 1 & 2 in the New vegas engine but most likely won't ever happen sadly.			"

												Being a fan of Fallout since Fallout 3, I've played New Vegas and Fallout 4 and loved them. But I wanted more. I wanted to know the roots, the lore, where it all began.Non serious spoilers ahed I picked up this game along with Fallout 2 and Tactics on sale.

												Owning this game as a big box PC game, I thought i'd buy the game on Steam to see if it still holds up today.Spoiler: It Does.Fallout is a very challenging game, especially if you compare it with later installments of the franchise such as Fallout 3 and 4. Don't let the isometric graphics fool you, this game is no cake-walk.From the beginning to end of the game, I was mindblown by the immense detail implemented into the world of Fallout 1, something 3 and 4 wished they could've acheived, 4 more so. Using past experience with the game, I was able to beat the game in around 10 hours, but if you are new to this game, expect this number to increase massively for you. If you are new and playing without a guide, you have balls of steel. People in the Classic Fallout community have acheived crazy things within Fallout 1 such as getting power armor at level 1, and other such things.Overall, Fallout, from 1997, achieves a more immersive role-playing experience than it's 3D counterparts, with the exception of New Vegas, of course.Also, I recommend getting a mod called ""Fallout Fixt"". It basically irons out all of the creases the original release had, such as bugs, and the time limit to find the damn water chip , which was always a pain in the ♥♥♥.10/10 - Amazing, immersive experience.

												After replaying this game after about 4-5 years, I have to say it is one of the greatest RPGs ever made. The Fallout universe is so rich and enticing. A lot of people worry they will dislike this game to today's standards because of it's bird's-eye/perspective view, but the story, dialouge, soundtrack, locations, factions and NPCs all come together so well. It is a game you really should not miss out on. If you love the newer Fallout's you should really come back to where it all started.There is so many different character builds you can make to suit your style. It has a solid combat system and level progression feels nice. You truly feel your character get stronger as you increase your level, improve your stats and get new gear. As you progress through the world of Fallout the way you go about your quests truly effects the world. This also effects the end game, as it shows you how you've effected the world and there is many varying endings.Overall this is a fantastic game, if you love Fallout, RPGs, tactical RPGs, stratergy games (To some extent) and games that are story driven, Fallout has it all! 10/10			"

												All I would say to potential new players of the first two fallouts is start with FO1, spend as long as possible in the first area to familiarise yourself with the controls, read the manual, and have a pen and paper to hand...you'll need them to note down the side quests you can go back to in areas previously visited, as there is no journal as such, and there's simply too much to remember, without flooding your brain.With that in place, sit back, enjoy, and realise how much harder games were back in the day!

												It is a somewhat pointless attempt for me to write a review of the first installment of the Fallout series, because I LOVE IT SO MUCH. I have to admit, that I'm a sort of a fanboy of this game (and for some extent of its sequel Fallout 2). This might be my all time favourite video game. I absolutely fell in love with it back in 1997.I love the 50s inspired retrofuturistic post-apocalyptic RPG setting. I love the character and combat systems. The overall graphics and especially the brutal ultra-violent death animations still please me. I absolutely love Mark Morgan's ambient soundtrack that reminds me of Aphex Twin's album ""Selected Ambient Works Volume II"". The player can approach quests multiple ways depending on the character stats. The consequences of player's actions affect the whole Wasteland. The choices really feel like they matter. This truly feels like playing a RPG.I admit there are some major technical limitations and some frustrating stuff throughout the game (Thanks Ian, for blasting me into a bloody mess with the SMG once AGAIN!), but the Fallout's awesomeness tops all that.If you enjoy this, you'll probably also like Fallout 2 even though I find it inferior to its predecessor for screwing up the setting at some parts. (I can't recommend the other sequels and spinoffs, because I haven't played them.)But yeah, I really recommend this! I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!			"

												I am someone who started the Fallout series with Fallout 3 when it came out, I then proceded to buy Fallout New Vegas, and Fallout 4 and I love the series, but after beating 4 a couple times I still wanted more so I decided to pick of the Fallout classic collection. I beat Fallout 1 and man was it good, for many reasons.The story starts out with a simple plot but then starts to get exciting later wich I won't spoil, and has some of the most interesting character, some of whom make an apperiance in future tittles, and the one of the best villians in any game to this day. The world was a blast to explore, with interesting places to explore, although not huge like current Fallout games. The character creation was great, and as much as I liked Fallout 4 the leveling system was dumbed down from its predisessors and quite awful, but Fallout 1 has a great leveling system with skills, attributes, perks wich any rpg gamer will love. Also the replay value is high with the ability to join raiders and kill everybody, to the choice to speak your way out of everthing and kill nobody, this game is solid and still lives up to this day. I highly recommend you go purchase this NOW!			"

												Note: Do not attempt to play this if you have played Fallout 3, 4, and New Vegas first! Do some research before buying Fallout 1.Where do i begin? You know it is amazing to see how far the Fallout series has gotten. And to think it started out like this. Most Fallout gamers will come to believe it's like the ones you see now.....it isn't. Not even close. Sure it has everything that makes Fallout very well known. But it plays extremely different. The game is two things. Turn based, and RPG. Turn base only happens during combat sequences and the RPG mechanics are completely everywhere. From the ""Character creation"" when you first start it. To the dialouge and choices you make throughout Fallout 1.This game is filled with content and lore that will make your head spin....or to make you rage quit at certain moments. It is best to save often because you will be needing it.....a lot. The skills and SPECIAL sort of works like what you see now. But it handles it a bit differently. My advice, is to do some research on the skills in Fallout 1 and how they work, same goes with SPECIAL. The only negative thing i could say about Fallout 1. Is mainly the Action Point system it's your everything during combat sequences from going into your inventory to choosing between vats mode and what i call ""shootout mode"" (Regular combat).I could've mentioned the story but it's best if you do the research first before buying like i noted in the ""note"" section above. Other than that if you want a blast from the past this game is for you.			"

												This is downright my favorite RPG ever made, but you gotta keep in mind, this game came out in 1997 and all I was doing at that point was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ my diapers, I have no nostalgic sentiment for this game and it was in no way colored by idealized childhood memories. When I was younger, my favorite RPGs were KotOR and its sequel, and I sank like 1000 hours in both I'm sure. So I do have nostalgia out the ♥♥♥ for those games and I do have idealized memories. I played FO1 for the first time in the 2010s, and the experience is so good it stands up to and even towers over the RPGs I loved as a kid. Nostalgia is a powerful force and if you can beat that, that's a really good sign.The port job here is actually one of the few times I can say the Steam version of an old game is a completely tolerable  version, as Bethesda has come in and spruced up the game with some updates, most importantly adding the ability to use widescreen resolutions. The game runs pretty much fine, and the only real issue I can remember is it may rarely crash, and if you alt tab, the screen will be black but it has this weird thing where you uncover the screen by moving the mouse? I fonud that bringing up the pip boy or skills menu was a quick way to fix that.And the game is excellent, the theming is incredible, the art design is old but holds up amazingly well to the point that the gore in this game will still make you go ""OH ♥♥♥♥ THO"". It's an amazingly tight experience, the quests are fun and memorable, the characters are fun and memorable with many of them depicted with these talking heads made out of clay or some ♥♥♥♥ that look cartoony but still look cool to this day. And the music is some masterpiece level ♥♥♥♥, with this and it's sequel boasting some of the best soundtracks in games ever, and this is before they had the disk space to just borrow 20 songs from the 30s-60s so it features mostly original compositions.I won't spoil anything but I will tell yout hat the lead villain is immediately one of the best in gaming history if not *the* best, the kind that can stand shoulder to shoulder with Andrew Ryan or KotOR 2's easily, but I can't go in to even basic details because spoilers.The game does feature an in-game timer, however this is not something you should be anxious about because your natural pace will probably be more than enough to get you to complete said timer in time, and once you do that you have all the time in the world to explore the world. The only limit from then on is 13 years, but that's a vast amount more than anyone would ever play because even the most slow player would see all the content in the game before that's even close to being over.The controls may be intimidating at first with the classic CRPG interface that we've been distanced from, but trust me, it's not all that hard to learn and most character builds can get through the game fine, Hit, I believe F1, and you can bring up a screen that shows you what everything is and does.I gotta say, from the bottom of my heart, Fallout 1 is an absolute classic gem even by modern day standards. If you're a modern day Fallout fan, a fan of CRPGs, or just a fan of RPGs, you owe it to yourself to give this a shot. Seriously, get it.			"

												The very first game of the series that spawned a great franchise. In Fallout, you play as a vault dweller who must save his vault from dying by getting a new water chip. However, you find out that there's more to saving the vault than just a water chip. The game is an isometric turn-based RPG and requires you to use various skills to progress through the game, such as picking locks on doors, bartering with NPC's and taking out various enemies with a wide array of arsenals. This game is nearly perfect, would recommend to anyone that wants to play an older, more challenging RPG games.			"

												Fallout is probably one of the most immersive RPG's I've ever played in my entire experience with gaming. For this review I'll divide it into categories of the game and discuss the ""Pros and Cons"". Gameplay Mechanics Fallout's gameplay is entirely dependant on the character that you create. This can vary based on the perks and skills you pick up as you progress through the game. The stats of this game are ""what make you  S.P.E.C.I.A.L "". Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility and Luck. Strength affects your overall carry weight and melee damage. Perception allows you to have more dialogue options, higher ranged accuracy and the distance in which you encounter random hostilities. Endurance modifies your health, resistance to poison/radiation, healing rate and hit points recieved upon leveling up. Charisma is what affects player interaction between NPC's. This stat will give the player the ability to barter more efficiantly and open up dialogue options. Intelligence allows the player to recieve more skill points upon leveling up, more dialogue options and skills. One thing I should also mention is that characters with very low intelligence are very funny to play as. I reccomend doing so if you want a good laugh. Agility allows the player to have more action points in combat and move faster in game. Lastly, Luck grants players bonuses to accuracy, critical damage chance and the gambling skill of the player. Perks also affect your character to further shape what you ideally want. For example, the perk ""Small Frame"" will give your character enhanced speed and more action points at the cost of strength.Combat in Fallout 1 is turn based. The amount of moves a player has is dependant on action points. Swift characters may have more action points, but could deal little to no damage if that is the only invested skill. Slow, but heavy characters can dish out loads of damage and possibly tank enemies to give companions opportunities of attacking, but can rarely move due to an undeveloped Agility skill. Combat is entirely dependant on what you want (like stated earlier). The various ways it can be shapen into is what gives this game replayability.Various skills such as Barter, Sneak, Lockpick, Doctor, First Aid are the factors that also affect combat. For example, if the player creates a merchant character (someone with high Charisma and Barter) then that player can profit off of NPC's and have access to numerous buffs and expensive items. Characters with high Sneak and Big Guns make great Snipers that pick off enemies and assist companions. Story You play as the Vault Dweller of Vault 13. The Overseer calls you as he needs your assistance in saving the vault. The water purification chip that provides drinking water to the Vault inhabitants is broken. He asks if you can adventure deep into the wasteland to bring back a waterchip and save the Vault. The player is only given 150 days to do so. This is the only information I feel is necessary to give as Fallout 1's story should really be experienced hands on. The only thing I will also mention is that the story will evolve into something more elaborate as you progress. Please, experience it for yourself. It becomes very philosophical. Immersive Factors: Music, Atmosphere, etc. Fallout 1 has an amazing soundtrack. It sets the tone of a dark, morbid post apocalyptic world. It embodies the wasteland that Western America has become. The hatred, emptiness and agony of the people that survived the nuclear destruction is captivated in this soundtrack. Like I said before, experience this for yourself. All I can do is praise it.The setting of this game takes place in the west coast of America. Due to the Great War sand and radiation is all that's left in the world. Throughout the game, you will discover settlements, villages, caves and cults. They're well made artistically and the music compliments them well.The people of Fallout will vary morally. The characters of this game juxtapose nicely as many of them have different interests. You have people seeking to bring justice and law to the wasteland, greedy and power hungry individuals that only care about their self benefit and an elitest group that I do not want to spoil. Overall Rating If you're a fan of RPG's then purchase this game immediately. I can say with utmost certainty that you will enjoy this game. You will be kept immersed and entertained. Let this game also prove that modern graphics aren't what make a game. This was released in 1997 and to this day it still has an incredibly large following.			"

												I'm not going to bore you with what you already know.  Instead I'll give you my personal evidence that this is a top tier game.  My account says I only played it for 12 minutes, but I can honestly assure you in the least hipsterish way possible, that I probably put in 1000+ hours before many Steam users were born.I have purchased Fallout four times in my life.  The original boxed version when it was new.  Then the regular jewel-case version so I had one to lend to a friend.  Then the double-boxed version when 2 was released and now Steam.  It's simply one of the best games ever made and will likely remain one of the best games ever made, forever.If you ever wanted to know what the New World Order is planning to do with you (most people don't want to know) then check it out.Yeah I wrote this review to finish the stupid Steam sale achievement thingy.. so what?  I know you did it, too.  Don't give me that look.			"

												A raider critically missed me and broke his right leg...Seriously, how can I review this game? It's Fallout 1, yeah it's rough around the edges which Fallout 2 fixes but still. Fallout is a critically claimed success of a game and spiritual successor to Wasteland. I do recommend getting Fallout 2 more then Fallout 1 due to two things! 1. The story plots are not intermingled with each other. Fallout 1 and Fallout 2 have two different stories which means you can play them in a random order. 2. Fallout 2 is more well designed as mentioned, Fallout 1 is a game I will be willing to recommend to those with a few dollars that don't know what to do with it or extreme Fallout fans who played Fallout 3 and 4 but never experienced the classics willing to bear with the awkward rpg controlls!Update: I alt tabbed from Fallout 1 to write this review, forgetting to pause and when I alt tabbed back the Raider killed himself.... How? ♥♥♥♥ed if I know but he is now a gelatinous blood pool on the ground with his limbs just...I ♥♥♥♥ing love this game...			"

												9/10 would barter for again. It's kind of a shame they never made any sequels to this game, but maybe that's for the best. I'm sure that if Fallout became an ongoing series, then by now, it'd be in the hands of a AAA publisher who'd be busy gutting the series one game at a time by replacing the story and dialogue with half-realized trendy gameplay elements, retconning the original game fifty times with every new installment, and leeching off unpaid work by the modding community while simultaneously relying on them to make the games playable to begin with. Yeah, I suppose it could be a lot worse. I can live with the fact that they only ever made one Fallout.			"

Fallout tells an interesting story, is housed with a unique environment and compelling characters, and rewards exploration very well. Basically, Fallout excells in the fundamental mechanics of an RPG.If you haven't played through this game from start to finish, you're missing out.			"

												""War... War Never Changes...""War may never change, but this game changed me back in early 1998 when I herd about a game where you could make choices that impact the world around you and do anything you wanted, even shoot up a friendly town.  In the golden age of C-RPGs, Interplay (lead br Brian Fargo, now of InXile) made some of the best RPGs ever to grace any gaming platform and this was one of them.  The Fallout series was progressive for many reason including its gameplay and player choices that impacted the game.  One interesting and frequently overlooked one is that Fallout 2 was the first game where you could marry a person of the same gender... but, lets get back to the game.Closely mirroring many aspects of its spiritual predecessor, Wasteland, Fallout is set in a desolate post nuclear apocalyptic environmental.  Fallout's dark adult humor, S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stat system, striking setting, strong narrative, characters and RPG elements are among far to numerous reasons to mention why Fallout was a not just a great and immersive RPG, but an amazing experience for any gamer playing it at the time... and it's still a trip now if you don't mind the dated graphics.  Although, it won't be quite as shocking as it was at the time and it doesn't have as much to do as a modern open world RPG, it's important to keep in mind this was released in 1997.Maybe it's a bit nostalgic to say, but Fallout isn't just a amazing game, it's a piece of gaming history for influencing all the other games in the genre that followed it and all of the people who played it.You can beat the game without ever firing a single shot or dropping a single body... but I highly recommend selecting ""Bloody Mess"" and taking your weapon of choice and creating as much pixelated carnage as possible because, well, the wasteland won't show you any mercy and you might as well have some fun before Ian inevitably shoots you in the back with an SMG on burst and leaves you to enjoy a premature ""Game Over"" screen... **SPOILERS**Truly 10/10... Would get addicted to nuka cola, not return Tandi to her home and instead keep her with me, never give Ian a knife and shoot him myself first with a modified plasma rifle before he can ""accidently"" kill me, beat a super computer at chess, have brain surgery to raise my intelligence and surgeory to make me sexier, steal parts to build power armor from an organization trying to rebuild humanity's technology, have a K9 companion follow me through the wastes, and have a critical failure that unloads my weapon when fighting the final battle at the worst possible time again... and again... and again... and again...P.S.  If you beat the game with ""Bloody Mess"" you treated to an extended (but brief) and totally fitting ending.  Also, look into getting some great mods.  Enjoy!			"

												Amazing! Better than Fallout 3. Although I did enjoy 3. The Original Fallout’s (1 & 2) have the best storylines by far, and everything in the world makes sense and looks good (as any fan of any original would say). But in Fallout 3, & especially ‘Vegas’ the storylines/people/objects & encounters don’t quite add up to the original Fallout lore, although they look Fallout-ish & say ‘Fallout’ on the tin.Anyway, I played this again recently and it’s amazing how well this game stands the test of time. I’ve bought so many games to try and get that ‘Falloutness’ back, but nothing compares to the original.If you haven’t played the originals but have played Fallout 3 & Vegas. You are MAD denying yourself this experience. "

												Highly enjoyable game that doesn't outstay its welcome. If you like FO: New Vegas especially because of dialogue and you aren't scared of old-school games, try this for a taste to see where the series began and then continue exploring into Fallout 2 if you want more.Vault Dweller: Who's in charge of this hole?Paladin: Hole? How dare you talk like that about the Brotherhood. You are a member of our order now, and should be proud to be a member of the Brotherhood of Steel.Vault Dweller: Proud? Why? You're all just a bunch of robotic hop-heads, hiding from the real world. There's nothing to be proud of there.4 RadAway out of 5.			"

I went in to this game without knowing that it was turn base.wow the amount of times I died left me angry it almost felt like dark souls. until you level up, got better weapons and armor and survived alot more (luck helped me alot)one thing you must know before entering this game is knowing how to build your character before starting a new game I didnt know till I was half way in the game and I could not go back its not a bad game but its not the best game IMOthe story is good graphics....ehhhhh (but thats because it old I know) there is a guide book in the steam community I highly recommend you read because it saved my lots of time because I was in this game wondering WHERE THE HELL DO I GO!!!7/10 would set the world on fire     "

												It's a really good game.  At first you won't like it at all.  I reccomend you go to prefrences and turn combat speed to fastest, because if you don't you are going to have a very slow, slow time.  Do not quit playing the game before you play 2 or more this.  Also look up guides before you start this.  I reccomend putting Strength to 6 than when you get the power armor it will add +4 to strength.  Also if you want the combat to go even more faster, try to max out your agilty to get more Action Points.  THIS IS NOTHING LIKE FALLOUT 3 AND NEW VEGAS!  I'm tired of people saying ""It's nothing like Fallout 3 and New Vegas.""  Of course it wasn't! It was made by diffrent developers! Do your research about it before you buy it.			"

												I actually had fun playing this. There was lots of settlements and other places to explore. The story is great, the soundtrack is phenominal for its time. But as you know, every game has a negative aspect to it. One of them is that combat and getting from point a to be is extremely tedious and it's a little tough being patient with it. I get it, there is some strategy to this and some people like that, and some people like me don't. Probably the reason why I don't like it is because I've played Fallout 3 and New Vegas before this game so it's tough getting used to. The second thing is that you don't have the choice to walk away from a fight and the game just forces you to fight even though you don't really want to. But these issues are minor. Another thing that really catches my attention are the hilarious face models. There is a really funny easter egg in the game that when you click on credits in the menu and type ""boom"". It will show the creator of the games head being exploded. Anyhow, I give this game a B. Although this game is a little too similar to Wasteland (A game that the creator worked on as well) I would reccomend playing Fallout 2 more.			"

However controversial it can be at times, it’s more than apparent that Fallout is a game that was made with a lot of love and I can tell you that more than fifteen years on it still shows.Here is one of the most fondly loved titles that developer Black Isle ever put out (the other being Planescape Torment), Fallout is a role playing game set in a post apocalyptic United States seeped in Fifties retro futurism and Cold War Americana.With its rather drab palette of colours, eerie ambient music and simplistic combat, you’d think Fallout to be a false prophet at first glance but that’s before you’ve experienced the writing. Every NPC you chat with and almost every action you take in-game is accompanied by strings of incredibly well written text that develop the game’s setting much further than its meager appearance would might usually allow.This is a one-of-a-kind series that redefines what a mature and well written RPG really is.Read the full retrospective at my blog »[www.celjaded.com] "

												War, war never changes...An amazing game that stands up to the test of time. This is one of the best roleplaying games out there. It came as close as possible to being a pen-and-paper experience - with the ability to craft your own character the way you *want*, without choices being forced on the player. There are a few quirks in the system, and it's certainly not as big as the sequel, but the non-linearity, interesting plot and backstory make up for it. Try this game as soon as possible - you won't be disappointed.			"

												Fallout 1This game is a classic cRPG for a reason, And very good one, The game holds up extremely well even today.Fallout 1 makes you a vault dweller, Someone who has to save his/ her Vault. The game starts you out very humbly, A lowly weak character fighting rats to get out of the cave that holds you're Vault, But soon you'll find a town, Some friends, And some weapons. Once you begin to figure out the game, You start to get your hands on more information, and more weapons, This game does a great job at pacing this. One of the biggest reasons you'll end up enjoying the game is because of how rich the world is, Every faction has purpose. You don't feel like the only important character, Infact most places would survive with or without you. It helps a lot in making you feel like a character in a world, Instead of the hero of the wastes that is the only one who can solve problems. The combat in the game is probably the weakest aspect of the game but for what it is, It works fine. The has some fun moments with the luck element. Characters use AP during each turn, To ethier move, shoot, reload, or go into inventory, and at the end of each turn, Your AP refreshes. The system itself is fine, except the maximum combat speed for the game isn't as fast as you'd like when you have 12 people or more in a fight. Usually the game keeps fights to numbers under 10 except for special moments which are fun, just hope you don't have to reload. Also the AI can be frustating to say the least at times. Getting hurt and running away into more trouble, or just being in the way, But for the most part they do their jobs and they do them fine.The Dialogue system will also give you a lot to work with, And A lot to enjoy. The dialogue system in this game is one of the best and most interesting parts of this game, You couldn't get so invovled in the world if you couldn't learn anything about it. Thankfully you have a ton of characters to talk to, learn from,  joke with, or insult in all manner of ways, Just be smart enough. The game's dialogue system is incredibly deep. You can't just say the ""right"" thing to a character, You need to think about their character and argue to what they would want to hear, Telling a evil man he's evil won't do much, But asking him to stop for something might. It makes you feel think, And makes you feel more invovled in the wasteland.Overall Fallout 1 still holds up as one of the best RPGs you can get on a PC, If you are a fan of oldschool games, Fallout, Table top RPGs, or just classic great games, You should have Fallout 1 and 2. This game is worth every cent you could possibly throw at it.			"

												It's... it takes some fortitude to get used to this game. Players today aren't used to the old control schemes of the old days, so a little bit of fiddling around in how to properly control stuff is suggested, as well as reading the manual that comes with the game. There's no tutorial to explain controls or concepts, which is why I'm suggesting that you do your research or you won't know what the hell you're doing.This game actually has a ton of problems, almost feeling like an early access title. I can't quite recall all the things I had trouble with it, but I would definitely call this a buggy experience w/ unbalanced gameplay. However, the game is pretty straightforward once you figure out what the game's rules are and use that to your advantage.Personally, I prefer the sequel to this game because it feels like a cleaner experience, but I still recommend playing this game just to see what it was like back when Fallout was just getting started.

												Beyond the nuclear wasteland, after the bombs fell many years ago. This game is one of the classic RPGs before this became a franchise years later. The story is interesting but I'll give a little spoiler alert, you left the underground shelter known as vaults, the known vault as... Vault 13. Your quest for this vault is locating a new Waterchip after the old one broke down. The vault needs it or else everyone will die in Vault 13 due to lack of water. To be simple, this game has time limit. All you have to do is focus on completing the main quest. You have plenty of time by completing side quests to level up, get better gear and such. Your choices will depend on endings for whatever actions you do that is good or bad. I'll recommend this game for it's soundtrack, story, gameplay and other sorts you like. One of the classics you'll enjoy.			"

My Personal Score: 3/5PCGamingWiki Page[pcgamingwiki.com]Issues: none experienced during playthroughs.Fallout is one of those classic games that never ceases to charm me everytime I play it. Being the root title in the behemoth of a franchise that it has become, there's nothing quite like exploring a post-apocalyptic Southern California in an isometric view and role-playing with Interplay's primordial SPECIAL system which still offers a unique gameplay experience despite its age. It's going to be jarring to play this game coming from the 3D sequels what with the lack of explanations for the mechanics and skill checks at every turn ala pen and paper RPGs but if you take the time to learn all of its intricacies and having the mindset to play a game like this, you'll be rewarded with a one-of-a-kind experience that only old school RPGs could offer.And there you have it.

""War, war never changes!""Said Ron Perlman back in 1997 when the first Fallout game was released by the company called Interplay. Unlike Fallout 3 this and its sequel put more emphasis on role-playing. Make no mistake - there's lots of fights but not that many weapons as introduced in later episodes, plus, there's no VATS system here making a single fight like a cutscene.A propos cutscenes: there are many such events occurring when we are met by new people - people that are important in the world and can bring the story forward. We complete quests, gather experience points, converse with strange people (even the zombie-like inhabitants of Necropolis), fight mutants and huge, red scorpions - all in a post-nuclear, radioactive, infested world that looks as if the '50s technology was brought forward. This retrofuturistic atmosphere certainly gives a plus to the gameplay.While there are 3 characters pre-made by the creators you can always create your own here with the game's SPECIAL system (acronym for Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility and Luck). Plus, you have perks, attributes, skills etc. This is a rather complex system that later iterations of the franchise all inherited.I know Fallout 4 looks better and uses all the current-gen graphical enhancements but if you want to know where it all started and you have around 30 hours for such a pastime (this is for completionists) then picking this one might just be an exciting story for you.PS: The number of hours I invested into the game can be measured in the dozens. This was the commercial version that was released way before Steam hence the short time spent with the game here. Still, it was nice to see that the Steam edition works well and offers even a full HD resolution.			"

												This review does contain spoilers and such, so be wary.Fallout 1, even as it has nearly been around for nearly 19 years, is still easily one of the best Fallout games in the franchise. Games such as Fallout 3 are only a 10th, maybe even less, than what this game was, even New Vegas as much as I love it, didn't come close to the experience I got from this.The quest was simple. Find a water chip to save your vault from certain death. Only leaving you with one location of a second Vault (Vault 15). Except when you leave on your mission, you find yourself getting caught up in the problems of other villagers and learning of new unknown locations, how these locations have grown and prospered. Not because you asked for quests, but because the town was placed in the middle of you and your location, not because you were told to. This happens again, with the hub, as you enter not knowing what you'll find, only to get yourself tangled between a shop keeper and a large casino owner in their feuds for business and profit, without you having to ask. And you get to decide who comes out on top, either with one dying or the other, both having their own pros and cons and each side having their reasons for their actions. As you travel further, you learn of factions, areas and dilemmas that you are able to choose who reigns victorious, whether it's the blades or the regulators, shady sands and the raiders, the ghouls of underground necropolis and set, along with the mutants, all while building up information on the much higher, more powerful threat that awaits. The super mutants are in general, dumb and strong, but compared to their creator, they are merely pawns in the larger plan that awaits. You only meet the antagonist once, at the very end, but it feels as if you've known him for longer. He never taunts you or mocks you on your journey, nor is he mentioned beyond the whispers of the cathedral. But you've been learning about him since you began, and it's incredibly fascinating to learn what you missed if you ever go for a second playthrough, which I highly recommend, and is even more of a wonder if you continue to Fallout 2 and absorb the lore, which if you enjoyed then I cannot recommend it enough. His presence is enough to give you goosebumps and you'll remember certain lines from him for a long time. Words can only put it so far. The best way to find out, is to play it. Next to 2, this is an outstanding experience, and makes you forget all about graphics, animations and gives you the freedom to delve into the attention to detail, the characters and the story. If you've played New Vegas, then I highly recommend this, but if you've came from 3 then this game might come as a bigger surprise than you might expect.  "

												one of my favorite games a true rpg where your actions matter entire cities in game can get demolished by your mistakes almost every quest has 3 to 5 ways to finish it. the dialogue is interesting and hillarious and personally i really like the art style and the gritty vibe of the talking heads the world is pretty big with lots of cities that each have a unique feeling and stories if youve enjoyed the newer fallout 3 and aspecialy new vegas you should definetly try fallout 1 and 2 and see what fallout's trully is 10/10			"

												Fallout is just one of those classic games that refuses to hold your hand through it.

												     very interesting game, not my favorite Fallout game but it's sure in my top three.  The story of the Vault Dweller is an awesome one and I had a lot of fun playing through and solving the wastelands problems. The combat mechanics could have been a little more flushed out and I felt like everything moved a bit slow. Even with that said, the game's story is not worth missing out on and do not look up any pictures of the main villan. His revel was creepy and made the experience even better.			"

												I Love fallout so i knew i had to go and play the original fallout. I tried to stay open minded since its the first game and probably not the best but overall its a good game. The story is somewhat small but the Side quest keep you going. For some reason my game crash a few times during my whole playthrough so when I finnally beat the ending boss so that annoyed me. I think this game has more of a RPG element then fallout 3 and new vegas, with more choices and way to do stuff. The game does not assist you on quest. You'll have to think of solutions yourself, which had me stuck at times during the game. but still Great game if you want to learn more of the lore			"

												This is one of the best of any games I've played! It was kind of confusing at first, and took alot of patience. I went to the options menu and set it to always run instead of that SlO0oow Walking. I also set the VATS turns to very fast. The Game was suddenly lots more fun and it is one of the greatest games once I get used to it and the only frustrating thing left was finding the controller chip in only 150 days. Which means you have limited time to play before you fail the main quest still a great game though. I still don't know where that controller chip is. I saw a dead feral goul standing up, which freaked me out when I thought it was alive. I spent 10 minutes trying to sneak around it then I tried the VATS button and nothing happened 13/10 would find dead people standing up again.			"

Brown. Brown Never Changes. - An Official Waffle King Review~Find more here.[lordwaffleking.com]Incredibly dark, gritty games are very bountiful these days. Almost everything is trying to be THAT game. You know the one. More shades of brown than the cast of a black sitcom. Everything's gotta be super dark and serious. This is war, man. There's gotta be lots of blood and explosions, and brown. This is serious. People die, man. Death is real. It's coming for you.It wasn't always this way though. It used to be different. It used to be a happier, more peaceful gaming landscape. Sure, there were serious games. There were games with blood, games with death, and games with brown.Super Mario wears brown shoes.But you kids that are always ♥♥♥♥♥ing about not having enough color in games and all games being too dark, you don't know. It used to be something special. It used to be a unique art direction. At least until everyone jumped on the bandwagon and completely ♥♥♥♥ all over it. There was an original brown game. A game that said, hey, you know the color brown? Well guess what, it's everywhere. And it was a pleasant surprise.The original is still by far one of the bests. It's got the unique art direction, the atmosphere, and it's charming in its own special way. In a sort of, giving a Get Well balloon to roadkill kind of way.Fallout is the original grit. Fallout is the original brown. Brown before brown. Rocks and sand before rocks and sand. The first Fallout. Way back in 1997. Surprise, the Fallout series did not start on 3. There was a first game.Fallout is a truly spectacular game. A marvel of classic RPG's, and arguably better than some modern RPG's in what it offers. Fallout is an open-world, turn-based tactical RPG. Set in an alternate future where Donald Trump became president and everything went to hell, you must set off from the safety of your underground vault to repair the satellite so grandma can watch Spongebob again. She gets cranky if she can't watch Spongebob.There's a pretty large emphasis on you as the character. There are a few pre-made characters to choose from in case you don't know how to choose your stats properly, but it's best if you make your own. Using the ""S.P.E.C.I.A.L."" system, which stands for ""Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility and Lemons"" you can make your characters as unique as you like. Assign them special skills and traits, and make them special.Not only do you have complete freedom in creating your character, but the game alters dramatically in how you play it based on your character and your choices. It's like some kind of Mass Effect kinda ♥♥♥♥, but like, before Mass Effect. Can you believe that? They had good game ideas this long ago? That's amazing.The major choices and karma system aren't the only familiar elements. There's also a time limit. If you don't get your vault up and running properly again, everyone dies and you're left to feel the shame of disappointing everyone in your life. Also they're all dead.A tricky gameplay element. On one hand, it limits exploration of Fallout's vast world. But on the other hand, it gives you a sense of urgency in your mission. It helps to drive home that feeling of desperation, of helplessness in a desolate world. It also keeps your playthrough fairly contained and quick. There's more to the game, much more. But with so many choices and options, limiting yourself to one long playthrough instead of a lot of smaller ones limits how much of the game you're actually seeing.Fallout has so much depth, and such a dynamic world. In my time with it, I experienced multiple different and unique playthroughs.In my first playthrough, my great hero Dubya set off into the wasteland to save the world. Dubya was a strong guy, but not a smart one. Or one that survived all that long. He spent days crawling through the very first cave, killing every rat he could. Unfortunately, I chose for him to have extra strength at the cost of his accuracy, so the poor guy was trying to punch rats for almost a week. And getting bit, and dying. He finally made it out into the wasteland, where he tried to punch scorpions until he died.At this point, I realized that Dubya wasn't working out and made a new character. Nookyalur, the agile Vault person, used her cunning wit and agility to steal some weapons, which she used to kill everything she could. She made it further, and eventually went on to die in a killing spree when she got in a fight with a merchant and his guards. She had to be left behind when she ran out of time, and her vault crumbled without its precious Spongebob reruns. Not the new ones, those are ♥♥♥♥. It's gotta be the old episodes.It was at this time that I managed to get a grip on how the game worked. So I simply restarted once more, and didn't ♥♥♥♥ up my character. With my powerful stealth and science abilities, I was able to sneak into a military base and set it to self-destruct. So in one fell swoop, without even equipping my gun, I killed so many things. So many. I got like a million experience points.From there, I managed to break my way into another base, and steal some power armor. I was pretty much invincible at this point, probably. So I saved the world, discovered the mutated remains of Donald Trump's hairpiece, and foiled his plan to end immigration once and for all.It was a pretty dank ride.Though all along my journey were other options. Did I recruit the guy with the gun into my party to help me kill things? Or did I go it alone, and use stealth to my advantage? Did I use my awesome talking powers to convince the bad guys to not kill me? Or did I slaughter them all without even blinking? Or do I agree with Donald Trump's immigration policies and decide to vote for him? I can't choose every choice in one playthrough.Even though I've played through the game a number of times, there's still so much I've yet to see. There are different endings, different choices. There are areas I've yet to fully explore, even. It's that deep and complex of a game.On the other hand, Fallout is pretty old. It's not as pretty as one of the modern Fallout games. It's not as user-friendly with its interface either. The interface is clunky by our standards today, but still definitely usable. It also has that ""old RPG"" vibe of all but requiring you to talk to everyone and everything. There aren't any glowing trails to show where you're going, or any markers to show what to do. You may even need a guide to help you through some areas.That's the only real issue that could turn someone away from Fallout. It's kinda old. And kinda dated in a few ways. At its core, it's still one of the great CRPG classics. C standing for cougar. It's that old, but it's still got it. And probably the mother of something, being that old and influential. So you could say Fallout is a milf, I guess.Milfs aren't for everyone. Some like them incredibly modern and fresh. But personally, I always had a thing for retro. Know what I'm saying?If you can look past Fallout's clunky old interface and admire it for its genius game design and aged beauty, Fallout will be good to you. If not, hey, I bought my copy for like a dollar. Besides, now I can brag about how cultured and refined I am for owning retro classics like Fallout. Like owning bottles of wine you'll never drink. You never know when you'll need to impress your guests with how refined you are. Even if you'll spend the rest of the night throwing up and sobbing.I feel as though Fallout has taught me valuable lessons though. Lessons about life, and the world. Like, if there ever was a nuclear apocalypse? We'd pretty much all be dead. Isn't that a comforting thought? We'd all be so very screwed, but at least we'd be dead. And that's okay with me.			"

												Fallout 1 is an old game. It held up decently though. You get sent out form your little hole in the ground community to get a new water chip. Because it's a wasteland full of hardened criminals and raiders - and you're the one that's less likely to get killed if you go into the world with merely a rusty knife (seriously a gun would have made more sense but I guess gaming rules have to go the route of ""Start with nothing and work your way up"").As this game's lore goes somewhere in the 1950s the apocolypse happened. The details are pretty unimportant as the war is something that's from a time no one cares about anymore. It was at least a generation or two ago. But the results of it lasted: a wasteland covering the entire world as far as most around can tell.One of the first things I discovered in this was it's very eager and able to kick your ♥♥♥. Sometimes simply walking into a public area is enough for the whole place to kil you. if you die you die perminently. if your party members die they die perminently. There's no revive in any sense of the word for this game. And it takes almost no time at all before any ally you get dies if you aren't abusing saves to redo every fight they died in. It wasn't until I managed to get ahold of Power Armor when I started feeling somewhat badass.It's possible that I am to blame though what with having prioritized non combat skills such as bartering and speach. I garuntee you'll never have any money issues if you put heavy amounts into bartering and charisma. When you start reaching 90% shops start paying you more than you pay them. So you can actually keep trading the same items between each other and just have them pay some caps on top of that - effectively walking away with the entire store for free if you wanted to.The AI in Fallout 1 is pretty terrible. If it's not simply blocking your way so you can't walk through a door for 2-3 minutes straight (and oh does it ever do that a lot) it's jumping in front of you in combat or worse burst firing so it'll kill everyone in front of it - often other party members and yourself. 40% of this game's difficulty comes from the party you babysit. The party doesn't level up with you so they quickly become flat out obsolete. With little to no personality or story surrounding them you really won't feel bad just giving up and letting them die when they die. They're practically faceless. I did find it pretty cool you could have multiple followers though. It actually felt like a party of travelers... until it became babysitting anyway. they lose their appeal when a single super mutant kills all of them with a single attack in your general direction.The turn based top-down combat was not what I expected when I started playing. It was honestly pretty good once the followers weren't involved though.This game suffered from lacking in explaination for the interface. There were some things that were vital to know - such as how to set traps or disable them, how to use stimpacks or how to use items on the environment (which left me stuck near the end of the game as I didn't know how to hook up a radio to a computer until I looked up help online).It also suffered from some nonsense errors throughout the game - such as trying to operate a switch to open a door and getting a ""no space in inventory"" response.Also deathclaws are hell. I have to point them out because ♥♥♥♥ deathclaws. The only way they could be harder is if when you killed them a second one popped out of the carcass of the first - wearing power armor and holding a minigun. And instead of bullets it shot more deathclaws out from it.It's a good game. By today's standards I'd give it a 6/10 realistically, but a 7/10 for fan-factor.			"

												Perhaps the strongest aspect of Fallout is that it is ideal for RPG newbies yet at the same time provides a depth of role-playing that veterans can really get stuck into. It also has the best replay value of any game I've experienced to date.The game play is smooth, using action points for movement and combat and the inventory system is easily managed. Fallout has one of the best character development systems of any computerized role-playing game and the graphics and story make for an excellent gaming experience.For anyone with an interest in complex, combat-heavy, lovingly produced RPGs Fallout is a must buy. In an age where many are predicting the death of traditional RPGs at the hands of multiplayer extravaganzas, Fallout is a glowing example of the genre, one which positively radiates quality. Fallout – it's da bomb.			"

												The graphics can obscure some crucial items or paths required to beat the quest and the game thinks you must've read the manual as the game doesn't explain how to use the UI to its fullest, however it still a great game thats aged amazingly, from what little i've played of fallout 3 i'd rank this game over it (i've only got a few hours in fallout 3 due to crashes). The open ended gameplay is amazing, for example in the quest ""Destroy the Mutant Leader"" you can go in and kill everything but if thats not yuour style then you can ask Morpheus to take you to the master and talk him  out of creating super mutants or you can do what I did, dress up as a child of the apocalypse, explore the base at your leisure but then get attacked by super mutants when you try to interact with a computer (which they shouldn't since you're dressed up as a child of the apocalypse). Then get suspicuos and repeat the process by reloading a save until you get into that room, equip hardened power armour, kill super mutants and find out the computer they were protecting sets a timer for a nuke to blow in 4 minutes.Overall Great game, if you haven't got it then go and get it			"

												Back in the days before people started complaining about Bethesda. A lot of these games, I'm also seeing in the new ones. It's even now considered sacrilege to speak of Bethesda. Well, I like the Fallout franchise as a whole even from both brands. The former members of Interplay will never get it back because they unforgivingly almost destroyed it with the console game Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel. There's no fixing.			"

												Fallout has got to be a hidden gem under my radar. Is still a good classic game and still held up after all those years. You feel like you have to work up your loot, weapons and armor to survive, like in a real fallout scenario especially when you have to talk ""smart"" to some people and make deals to get on thier good side if you want to progress the game further, and man the beginning is brutel (depends on settings) for me if you don't know what you're doing! The only 3 problems I can think of that bothers me is the trading system has a problem and is you can only trade stuff one digit at a time. Is annoying if you have alot of caps. so you have to click it so many times until you reach your number of caps to trade, is ridiculous for how simple it is to fix it. The second is a nitpick and is from the beginning that you have to figure it out on your own how the controls work and which button does it do. Some that are vital like the iconic focus aim shots, I later found the feature in mid game, which I could have learn it sooner before I die alot from the mutants.The third is the fighting system where depends on how many action points you have, you attack on the person, but if the person say 3 guys attack you and you only get one or two actions to attack, the others guys get 8 combine! Even if you're fighting one guy he gets probably 3 or if you're lucky 2 actions. And yes you can increase it, but is so slow to get more action points if you don't know what you're doing. You have to plan your attacks carefully and not strike it blindly which is good, but is hard if you need the exp. Yes, you can decrease the difficulty and plan making a better character but is just my take on my first playthrough.There has been some crashes on my Win. 7 34 bit but only when I input certain commands or moves of the game for reason I don't know why so watch out if it happens. I don't know if it'll work on 64 bit or win 8 but I know they have patches for that on some website that I don't know if it'll work, look it up in youtube.I give an 8/10 rated for a classic gem series that still holds up to a fun level.

												if you dont like older games or slow gameplay than i would advise not buying this game, however for being as old as it is, this title as aged quite well. even the graphics for the combat,areas,and characters are muddy at best, the overall story and feel of adventure you get when traverising the wastes is enough to keep you wrapped up for several hours of gameplay. one of the major flaws however is that it is quite buggy, for instince, i once had a broken arm so i was unable to fire two handed weapons but the game wouldnt let my character or any of the in game doctors fix it.                                                                 As i stated before the combat is slow but very involving and strategical, if youve ever played any x-com games than you will understand the mechanics exaclty. this allows the game to make situations more tense and difficult forcing to do more than just charging in and blasting dudes in the face, but is not such a bad thing. when you have to slow down and analyze scenarios, the combat is more involving and satisfying, because unlike other games where you can just shoot this random dude in the face, you can hide and set up explosives to blow his legs off, run up, and then shoot him.                            one major drawback to the gameplay though is the fact that there is a time limit of 400-500 in game days before you lose the game, so its something like dead rising 2's sand box, where you can goo off and have fun just dont expect a happy ending. also the display screen for your weapons and perks could be a bit more descriptive, but considering the pace games where at that time were at i'll let that one pass.                the last thing i wamt to talk about is the plot whic is actually pretty original considering the setting being completely cliche( post-apcolyptic america). you are a resident of one of the many vaults that protected a select few but one day the water chip begins to go down and you are chosen to brave the wastes and retrieve another. in your adventures you come across such things as crashed aliens, dr. who, deathclaws, giant master race mutats, raiders, and shotgun wileding robo-brains. you must battle all of these and more as you search for your vault's salvation. like i said pretty original.           So all in all it may be old and have some minor faults its still a pretty solid, and one of the best rpgs of all time. if you like turnbased combat, awesome storytelling,and hours of fun then this game is for you. i would rate it 9/10.

Quite a lot. Like wow. I've never beaten. my entire party and everyone I love died because I got into a shootout against Raiders with some pretty good weapons on them and me with a measly 10mm pistol.I've killed a cave of scorpions, And been killed BY a cave of scorpions.I've killed a death claw with an SMG a kife and my dog. I've walked into a couple of super mutants and have been murdered by them.I love this game whole heartidly. It's hard and confusing, Engaging and interesting, The lore is great.I won't spoil thestory because any Fallout fan worth his salt knows the story.It's worth the 10 bucks. Buy it if you want to know what Fallout was like when it was first created.			"

												Learns I need to acquire water purification chip to save my Vault, leaves Vault and proceeds to other Vault assuming I will find chip there. Stumbles across Shady Sands and learns they have a radscorpion problem, continues my journey to the vault only to learn that I need to descend an elevator shaft so I'll need a ladder or some rope. Goes back to Shady Sands and asks everyone I can about rope and ladders who all deny the existene of such things, Aradesh does not sell either. I learn of Junktown and a place called the Hub. So I travel to Junktown, they refuse me entry because it's night-time, I travel to the Hub and find a general store that sells rope at exorbitant prices. I purchase one rope, I go back to Vault 15. I descend the shaft, learn I need another rope. Return to the hub, purchase more rope, go back to the Vault. Discover there is no water purification chip there and find rope in a locker.From this day forward I always carry rope on my person 10/10 (The game is actually still really good, if you like today's Fallout games then you'll probably enjoy it.)

Despite any hype about F1, unfortunately in terms of complexity it is more like oversized Fallout 2 demo, than real RPG itself, basically 90% of possible content could be seen through single ""munchkin"" playthrough, but most of game-builds is either combat unplayable or meaningless in terms of quest usage. By modern criterias many key systems out-dated, especially in case of UI. Text content is worth look into it, but I can't say that playing first Fallout was particulary joyfull expirience. It is rise of legend, true canon, but not best possible game.			"

												Here's a recap of my first half-hour on one of my playthroughs.I created a character and named him Beowulf, and I poured all my points into maxing out his Strength and Agility.I then decided to NOT equip the Brass Knuckles, in favor of beating the hell out of everything with my bare hands - in true Beowulf fashion.I then proceded to use this method to kill every rat in the cave, then went to Vault 15 and killed everything there.After that, I went back to Shady Sands, went to the RadScorpion Cave, and punched a RadScorpion so hard in the brain that I knocked it senseless, pacified it, and ended the combat with it still alive.I then walked over to it and ripped its tail off, still breathing.I have since then added a dog and a couple gun-toting thugs to my posse, and have saved a girl from a gang of Raiders by fighting their leader in bare-handed combat (won with hardly a scratch), then went and killed all of his subordinates for kicks.GOD DAMN, it feels good to be Beowulf.

												Fallout is a fantastic game back in the day, but it is becoming pretty obvious that it did not age very well, to put it simply the gameplay and design is outdated. If you never had a knack to play ancient pc role-playing games, chances are pretty good you will not like Fallout. The control scheme is god awful compared to modern standards, and the repetitive textures are just visually boring. The gameplay is very standard for rpg game of the 90s. While Fallout may lack all the basic mechanics that makes modern games great, its storyline, environment, and sound will remain eternal. Fallout created a precedent for all great RPG’s to follow, the ability to shape the ending of the game started here. Much like its sequels, Fallout’s entire game world is flipping massive. Overall this game is in desperate need of a remake.			"

												I played enough already to tell you that this game is a masterpiece and probably every oldschool gamers will tell you the same thing.Being a dystopia of the 50's in a post-nuclear war environment flooded with radiations, mutants and survivors. Fallout is much more open in its variety of choices and possibilities than, for example, Diablo 1 which came a year before.-You can Talk to almost every NPCs with multiple dialogue choices which will grant or deny you some ways to deal with problems.-Not a talker? Kill anyone in sight if you want! Pew pew pew! Takatakatak!A large variety of weapons can be found in the wasteland.-To be (A thief) or not to be? Pick any pocket in sight to get ammo, money, etc!-7 SPECIAL abilities such as : Strengh, Intelligence, Charisma, Luck...-18 skills such as : Small/Big Guns, Lockpick, Steal, Science, Speech...-53 perks such as : Animal Friend, Flower Child, Explorer, Fortune Finder...-Choose 2 personal traits between 16 choices such as :Bloody Mess, Good Natured, Jinxed, Skilled, Kamikaze...-You can take drugs and booze to boost your SPECIAL and Skills(WARNING : May cause addiction)-You can roam the wasteland freely without any limitations but the map borders.-The gunplay and combats are turned based. I think it's perfect because it's probably the only gameplay possible to deal with the way guns works in it.A real-time f**k-fest of bullets would be insane and unplayable.The wanted realism gives a survival side and your health is a part of it.It's not like in Diablo where you can boost your life, use magic and surealist stuff.After playing more or less 1000h hours on Fallout 3, I can finaly say that Bethesda did a great job to reenact the awesomeness of the Fallout series.May the power of atom be with you wastelanders!

												Interplay at it's finest.Created by Interplay's RPG divison (later known as Black Isle Studios for all their later Fallout games), Fallout is a ginormous Post Nuclear Role-Playing Game set in the aftermath of ""the great war"", where humanity got so ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ they just bombed everyone because they ran out of natural resources.You play a hapless ♥♥♥♥ living in Vault 13. Your vault's water purification system has been damaged. It's up to you and ONLY you to wander the wasteland of California to search for a new one. Released in 1997, Fallout is one of the most intricate and highly detailed RPG's of the '90s. All of your skills all play important parts in the game, unlike beth♥♥♥♥♥das ""Charisma 4: Mass Effect Dialogue Options"". There are multiple endings depending on your actions and routes taken, and it's completely up to you what you do with your time.The original version of Fallout had a in-game time limit of 150 days to find the water chip. If you ran out, you'd get the bad ending by default. This limit was patched out in the early days.The Fallout series has remained one of the most inspiring and amazing RPG games to ever play.♥♥♥♥ Bethesda, this is the REAL masterpiece. Don't mind the ""fallout 4"" ♥♥♥♥♥♥s in the comments of this review. If you are a RPG fan, this game belongs in your library.			"

												I played the Bethesda Fallout's and was curious to see the origins of the series. Fallout 1, in my opinion, offered a more immaginative and rpg like erxpereince cmpared to 3 and NV,-You have verbose paragraphs full of description (might be a turnoff to some)-Since characters aren't animated, you have to pay attention to their diologue to get important details about their character. -Diologue is also varied. Unlike Fallout 4, here you do have to consider what you're saying. You could accidently anger the other person, or start a fight, or acidentally get contracted to kll somebody even though you just wanted to find some work becasue apparently the wasteland is an expensive place to live in.........yeah-There is no pipboy telling you where to go, you hvae the overall goal of finding the water chip, but it's up to YOU to follow up on leads and tips. People tell you rumors or somethign they over heard and you follow up on that -the wasteland truly feels dangerous, here the stats mean more than anything. You can't just walk to the right and fight a super mutant, you'll get killed. The snese of progression is real, and the scarcity of items like stimpaks and radaway make finding them feel so much better.So, I'd recommend buying this if you want a more authentic rpg expereince in the fallout world. Note that you will be reading a lot of paragraphs since only 6 or 7 characters get their own animation and voice acting and you definetly will not know where to go your first time playing (though the game does offer a starting point so no worries). Don't be ashamed to look at a guide (this is a game from the 90s)			"

												A great Role Playing Game.  There are multiple ways to play this game.  You can be a bit of a diplomat, talking your way through the game.  You can use fire power to blast away most enemies.  Or you can look for a different approach, like finding an important computer and activating the self-destruct sequence of a place and leaving.  This is an older game, so don't expect great looking character models.Characters you find and add to your group can also be a pain in the butt at times.  They may fire at an enemy behind you, only to hit you instead.  Or they may block a door way and you have to wait for them to move.I did run into some gameplay issue with the more update version of the game, causing the game to crash.  I had to load up the older version to get around this.  Thankfully, this only happened in to areas of the game and did not ruin things (I was able to load up the updated version once I was past the area where the game would crash and would save there).This game can be difficult at times, as things may look favorable for you only to see your enemy get a BS lucky shot on you and kill you.  Overall, I really like this game, especially the ending.  After years of playing Japanese Role Playing Games, I got kinda tired of seeing everyone live happily ever after endings.  This game ending is harsh.  More fitting for the world of Fallout and the landscape, the Wasteland.  If you do plan to play this game, I do hope you do NOT look up the ending on YouTube.  It would possible ruin the experience for you and the work you character does in the game.			"

												Great game, especially for fans of the newer titles. If you're a fan of Fallout 3/NV or like old-school RPGs, play the first two Fallout games. Though the functionalities of an older game such as this do take a little bit of getting used to, once you get the hang of it it becomes a rich, very fun experience that is surprisingly similar to what you get in the newer titles. It's actually surprising to see just how much Bethesda got right when translating Fallout 3 into an updated 3D version of the same universe. And although there are some (not uncommon to modern Fallout) glitchy elements which definitely got smoothened out in the second installment, the original Fallout is a fun play even to this day, with an amazing story, hours of gameplay, funny moments, and some good 'ol turn-based combat that features some of the most gruesome and entertaining death scenes I've ever seen.

I'd recommend newcomers to follow a guide to progress further in Fallout, but at the same time, it'd be way better if you play for yourself without any help. Fallout is hard which makes it really entertaining. For instance, finding out what to do next or where to travel to is all up to you. Fallout never gets old as you can make fresh new characters and witness the different outcomes that can occur in game. A true classic from the past.			"

How it All BeganThis is the original Fallout, complete with original graphics, blemishes and virtues. There is an incredible amount of depth to the world that you can inhabit. Time to go 'in depth' for my new review style. GameplayFallout 1 is an isometric RPG. It is, obviously, a little archaic. There are several different mouse pointers you must constantly alternate between to either examine, move or fight things. The combat is simple yet satisfying, with enough weapons and different combat approaches to each encounter that it can stay fresh. Moving through the desert is a harrowing, luck-based affair, with a grid-styled map that you can move through showing the world. Places of importance are highlighted in green, and random encounters stop you on your journey to keep it fresh. Overall, Fallout has impressive gameplay that stands up to the tests of time. StoryYour vault is running out of water. You are the last hope for your entire vault. This plot hook, though good, actually limits the game. A time limit is placed on you of 150 days, and if water is not obtained for your vault before the end of those 150 days, you will 'fail' the game. This places unnecessary pressure onto your shoulders, although it is incredibly effective at keeping players on the path of the main story. However, this leaves you with little opportunity to delve into other side missions or characters. Several characters will have to be made before you can experience everything. Graphics and AtmosphereQuite obviously the graphics are not going to be current-day good. Don't expect high quality graphics, and if you criticize the game for it's graphics... well then, what do you expect? It's the atmosphere that really sells the game. A broken landscape with intriguing characters and it's own, unique brand of humour really sells the unique vibe of a civilization that never got out of the 50's, and then got nuked. It's very enjoyable just to explore, even if there is no music. SummaryFallout: A Post Nuclear Role Playing Game is a game that is very much worth your time. With a low asking price and hours worth of fun, there's very little reason that you shouldn't pick up the first Fallout, especially at a time like now when the future of Fallout is coming... why not return to the past?

												One of the few games I recommend without hesitation.  Fallout 3 (a.k.a.: Oblivion 2) is total garbage, which completely lacks the mechanical equality, spirit, aesthetics and depth of its predecessors.  Fallout 3 is an open-world FPS that lacks the integral granularity to exist a an RPG, yet passes itself off as one as effectively as Steve Buscemi in drag.The REAL Fallout series represents an almost unparallelled RPG system in its complexity, balance and replayability.  Fallout is, without hyperbole, also one of the most influential games in history; it literally is the foundation for much of the modern PC (and PnP) RPG paradigm.Out of all the hundreds of RPGs I've played, Fallout 1&2 are still unquestionably in my top 5.

It's an isometric game, so not fully 3D. Little voice acting. Turn based attacks. No radio. But thats not to say it's not fun. If you take the time to actually play you WILL enjoy it. The dialogue options are way crazier than any of the bethesda or obsidian verions. TIP: if you want a REAL challenge put your character's intelligience down to 1.			"

												Newer generations typically won't appreciate the original Fallouts due to their dated graphics. There's something about Fallout 1 & 2 that Bethesda can't seem to replicate (although Obsidian did a great job with New Vegas). The grungy environment and original plot elements (instead of searching for your son/Dad) keep you constantly intrigued and/or amused with each twist and turn. Fallout 4 can't hold a candle to Fallout 1 or 2 because of one word. Replayability.The cult fanbase is well deserved, and even to this day there are total conversion mods being made for Fallout 2. Make sure to try out Fallout Resurrection and Fallout FIXT mods, or you'll be missing out.			"

												One of my favorite games. Everything about it is just fantastic, the atmosphere, the diologue and the role-playing elements make it one of those games you can always turn back too. It also has a great story (the Master is an awesome character) and I love how they don't give you any baby steps to figure out what you are suppose to do next, they just have you figure it out. That's why I love this game and everything about it. Now yes, this game will get frustrating, especially for me when I first played. But I was able to learn through many failed playthroughs and the help of friends (also the internet).

												Highly recommend, for any Fallout fan especially. But if you are not a big fan of Fallout, purchase with caution! This game has shown to be unpopular among people such as my friends. But if you're looking for a new post-apocolypse game, from a interesting old-timey prespective in the sky to play, I'd say give it a try!The game is amazing. A real great start to what would become the franchise of Fallout. There are many bugs like with any game, and in my opinion, this game is unfinished in vanilla version. With ending scripts and such not working, quests being non-avaible that break a players potentally desired choices, yadda yadda ... And I believe it was said because of time restraints. Which was sad, that they couldn't fix all this first.So because of these reasons, I point people toward looking up the mod ""Fallout Fixt"" which fixes basically all of this. A super mod that really re-added that kick in the game for me, after finishing it vanilla wise. Making it more so how it was expected to be played, and should be played. Though don't forget to play vanilla first alone, to see what I mean. Even adds a few other goodies too, which makes it all that sweeter. I consider this mod an essential part of the game when I play it now, you could say.Cough And between you and me, this may just be my favorite Fallout with the mod! "

												I played this game when it first came out on PC. Back when Nintendo and Sega were the only names in console gaming. For those who played fallout 3,  New Vegas and 4 only you might find this a boring and short adaptation of the ones you have played. But for the older gamers who still say things like ""ff7 was the best one"" and ""back in my day we were lucky to just have 32 bits"" this is the game for you. Also it may confuse the **** out of you with the insane differences in plot lines between the original fallouts and the modern ones. Worse time paradoxes than the terminator movies so try not to over think it.			"

												Tags : Isometric RPG - Post Apocalyptic*HALL OF FAME* *ALL-TIME FAVORITES*Heavily inspired by Pen and Paper. Gritty, well designed, solid dialogue, effective turn based combat. This can be a hard game, and you can seriously develop your character into a corner, or have a savegame that can no longer be salvaged and you will have to restart the game if you want to win the main mission.

It can be necessary nowadays to modify the variable for random encounters in the desert as without them you do not level your combat oriented character nearly enough while travelling, and the amount of random encounters decreases as a function of CPU power, the higher the CPU the faster you travel the less encounters you face, it is strange but that is the way it is coded. This game among with others of its kind has gotten me hooked the isometric perspective and I personally love the work that went into the animations. The character models are reused heaviliy throuought the game however, but there is a fair amount of variety in tiles for locations so you do not always run into the same kind of maps. There is no procedural generation here everything was handcrafted.A masterpiece in my humble opinion and one that sets a personal standard for what a RPG is, your character and your choices will influence the play experience quite a lot here.

												It has taken me 15 years to complete Fallout 1. Some people say it's the best RPG of ALL TIME! I have found out the truth behind this claim.It's a third person isometric game from 1997. It ran fine on my widescreen Windows 7 set up. Note you need to running a patched version where some bugs are taken out. I played the Steam version that ran fine.The game is set in the USA in a post nuclear war era where much of civilisation has broken down or turned to dust. Some people have survived the nuclear fallout out by living in specialist underground bunkers called Vaults without much knowledge about the world above. You are tasked with saving your home after the water production breaks down.Before you jump ship and begin the quest to SAVE THE WORLD by killing some rats, you need to define your character. I found there was no right or wrong way to do this. Just that each choice will affect your adventure. Choosing a low Strength attribute won't allow you to lug around all the junk that you find. Agility effects action points in combat and how many gun shots you can attempt. Luck, usually a garbage stat effects your critical chances and also your random encounters. You also have skills and traits to choose and develop.You can't have a character that does everything well so you need to make choices on your play style. Go mighty sledgehammer or become a thief and pickpocket to riches. Specialise as a sniper or as a psycho killer, destroying everything that gives you a dirty look. Mwuahhaha!Saving your vault from water starvation is a small part of the overall story. It really gets interesting later on as you explore the desert and come across large towns and even a giant cathedral. Necropolis is full of zombie like ghouls and a super mutant group are on the rampage killing all before them. Then we have Deathclaws - legendary creatures that I found extremely vexing and impossible to take down. Eventually I figured out how shoot them in the leg or eyeballs.So, read the manual and figure out how to interact with the world. There is a learning curve and at the beginning you will feel lost. Damn - where are those pointers saying go there and do that. The end story was quite interesting and I really wish I could do a third play through - but on to Fallout 2.Oh - and don't ignore the timer to complete the initial water quest. I did on my first play through and the game promptly stopped when it said it would.Oh, I came across a TARDIS in the wastelands and then an alien ship that had crashed that contained a picture of Elvis. I also found an alien blaster that was awesome.Fantastic gem of a game. 8/10 as a modern game.			"

												This game is legendarily great. The gameplay and story are compelling, but the world is the real star of the show here. That, and Harold and Dogmeat. They're stars too.Tips for companions:Dogmeat is a machine. Doesn't do much damage, but moves ridiculous distances, attacks 4 times a round, knocks enemies down all over the place so that you can 95% critical their eyes, and, most importantly, is the emotional heart of the story. I kept him alive all the way.Tycho is great. He's smart, durable, and funny. Just keep him stocked with shotgun shells and Stimpaks and he'll never let you down. Unfortunately, he died in the Cathedral.Ian is a staple for the first part of the game, but by the time you get power armor he's basically obsolete. I let him go eventually.Katja can mark the Cathedral on your map. That's about it. I made the mistake of giving her an SMG, and eventually abandoned her along with Ian. Hopefully they're fine in the middle of the desert.P.S. The gory death animations are fine, but the fact that they're used as rewards for winning makes them that much more priceless.P.P.S. I accidentally dropped Vree's holodisk moments after getting it in the Brotherhood base, later realized how important it is, went back, and, months later, it was still there. The Brotherhood really needs a janitor.			"

												10/10 - A shining pinnacle of human achievement.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------GRAPHICS --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------First off, graphics aren't everything to me. I grew up with Atari, Apple ][e, PowerMacs, NES, and so on. Fallout uses the good old 800x600 overhead isometric view, and does it quite right. The game has a fair amount of variety in the appearance of the locations, though the ""cave"" areas tend to get a bit too familiar. There is a ton of variety in the objects used, and a lot of areas are just really nice art to look at. It holds up for me, personally. Objectively, it looked great when it came out, but was kind of bashed a bit for not being a light sourced 3D game. Those were the expectations of the time.The best part about the various character models in the game is the way that they are torn apart, melted, disintegrated, exploded and otherwise ended when you discharge your fury on them. The flamethrower is good for laughs, especially. It certainly followed through on the vision of its spiritual predecessor, Wasteland, in that respect. The dialouge sequences with certain characters brings you to a great looking 3D model of the character's animated head, but other wise all characters are rather small and faceless.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------SOUND ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The music, combined with the graphics, creates a thick, perfect layer of atmosphere. The desolation and tension of this setting really is emphasized by the great music. Composer Mark Morgan totally nailed it. The various gunshots, laser beams, rockets and explosions of combat all sound great. The 10mm Handgun especially has a very satisfying ""THUD"" to it.The voice acting is frigging phenominal. Frank Welker, Ron Perlman, Tony Shalhoub, Tress MacNeille, and a bunch more take care of voicing the metric ton of dialouge that exists for all cut scenes and plot ""essential"" characters. It all sounds so good, you will want to have the sound and music turned up nice and loud while you play. Really, really good.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------GAMEPLAY -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Movement while exploring is similar to Diablo, point and click to go. When combat starts, the game switches to turn based mode. This is where how you build your skills and equip your character matters more than how fast you can click on different things. It is possible to gimp your character, and die repeatedly if you don't pay attention to some basic survival needs. Such as at least one strong combat skill, and average intelligence at the very barest of minimums. Intelligence is responsible for getting more points to put into skills when you level up. One or more of your various skills is going to determine your success in pretty much everything you can do in this game. Speech can be a path netting some extra information and reward often enough that I find it useful too. At least a smattering of everything will come in handy, but I personally wouldn't go without lockpick, medicine (for healing and for quests), and science. For combat, anything will do, but bear two things in mind. Be the best. Choose one of the various combat skills, and pump points into it every level until it is at least 75. Then keep rasing it, but it isn't so much of a priority compared to diversity at that point. Smal guns are the most widely available, but don't let that keep you from choosing your own path as they are all viable. It is possible to ""play the bad guy"" and destroy your karmaic reputation in order to steal, murder, and otherwise plunder the shambles of a society that remains on Earth. Indeed, some quests and items are most easily and quickly performed by stealing something, or locking the door and murdering someone. But, your karma follows you around in this game. At a certain point, you will be unwelcome. Then, people might want to kill you for what you have done. I find that the path of the righteous leads to far greater reward in terms of XP, in this game. There is a wide variety of weapons, armor, enemies, and locations for battle. The battles can play out rather slowly, and being turn based are not everyone's cup of whatever. The game can be rather challenging at the start if you aren't used to these sorts of games, but the difficulty can be changed at any time in game. The game is kind of equal parts combat and exploration. There is a great deal of humor in both, and I have spent plenty of time just watching random NPC's interact with each other. It all piles on to the atmosphere of the fledgling civilization struggling to survive in the harsh new hell they created, only to be found repeating the same death spiral pattern of behaviors that set them on the path in the first place.If you aren't immediately turned off by the graphics and the turn based nature of the game play, then this game might be for you. It is one of the precursors to such games as the Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale serieseses.. es. Planescape Torment. Shares team members with Knights of The Old Republic 1 and 2, Fallout New Vegas, Arcanum, and a few more greatest role playing games ever. (KOTOR 2 and Greyhawk have at least been fixed and patched to greatness on PC...) But Fallout and Fallout 2 have always been my very favorites and the most replayed. If you dig a little, you will find that there is a ton of depth and character in this rather slow paced old school game.(Never you mind what the ""hours played"" on Steam says, my Steam was mostly offline for intermittent years. When I played the game for hundreds of hours since its release, it was the CD-rom version.)			"

												This game did something only one other 90's game did for me (Half-Life). It took a genre that we know and love today, and redefines it. This game is one of the best, if not THE best RPG I've ever played.+ Amazing atmosphere+ A great amount of detail. Every place feels hand crafted, and polished+ S.P.E.C.I.A.L. is a creative way to create your character, rather than making cosmetic changes that RPG's do today+ Pure freedom is encouraged. Fallout 3 and New Vegas are good games, but I believe the first gives the most freedom.+ A few very different, creative, and even horrifying alternative endings+ Great soundtrack, accompanied by The Ink Spots, my favorite 30's-40's band!+ A large amount of enemies. From mutants, to raiders, radscorpions, rats, and tons more+ A great amount of weapons as well. Trust me though, energy weapons are your friend. Remember that while playing.+ Different ways to approach about any mission+ Great final ""Boss"" with 3 different ways to deal with him. No spoilers, sorry+ Writing is alright, surprisingly! A mix of serious and funny! ""Moo, I say!"" -Brahmin+ Although there aren't a whole ton of locations like in F3, and FNV, these locations are huge and branched out.+ You can actually join different factions, rather than sitting next to them feeling like a sidekick. In F3, you helped the Brotherhood of Steel. In F1, you straight up join them!+ Interesting characters all over the world+ Followers that can help you on your quest. Remember, their death is permanent!+ The animation in the game is surprisingly good! The cutscenes are amazing as well, especially for it's time.+ The story seems so simple. ""Go get a water chip"" is the beggining, but it eventually branches out and has a good amount of lore in it as well+ Rather than helping someone in the Crimson Caravan find love (Fallout New Vegas), you actually get to join up with the caravan and make a good amount of caps from it, too+ A good 14 Hours long from what I've played. This is the longest 90's game I've ever played that kept me entertained the whole time+/- You can accidentally shoot your partners. Although it may only happen a few times for you, it will happen a lot with your partners shooting you.- A bit of an anticlimax ""Good Ending"", which is the one I got. Again, no spoilers- A few bugs, too. I can still ask for a water purification chip even though I found it a year ago- The shown chance of hitting a target is a bit off sometimes. ""95% chance to hit this rat twice!? I got thi... I missed both times...""9.5/10 An Outstanding TitleThis is a prime example of what RPG's should be. True freedom to do just about anything, anytime. If you're getting Fallout 1 & 2, just buy the Classic Collection. You'll get Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel along with Fallout 1 & 2 (3 games for the price of 2). Well, off to Fallout 2!

												Nostalgia levels over 9000!!!This is the very first PC game I ever purchased. I still own my original disc copy, which is still in perfect condition. I recall in '97 going into my local PX and picking up the retail box from the shelf, and reading the description of the game on the back while deciding my future purchase. Had I known now how much I would come to love this series, I would have bought another copy to keep as a collector's item. Starting up my first game and hearing Ron Perlman's words; ""War. War never changes..."" still sends chills up my spine to this very day. (By the way he still does the intro narrator voice for the series.)The freedom of choosing your own way to advance in the game was different from most of which I had played at the time. The writing was witty and found my self laughing over some of the more hidden speech options. (Roll a character with a low INT, many LOLS to be had.) I found the combat enjoyable. You can target specific parts of the enemy's body, which allow you to cripple limbs and increasing critical damage. It may seem dated in appearance by today's standards, but makes up for that in quality story and plot. Now go get that water chip vault dweller. Vault 13 depends on you!TL:DR Version: Isometric view RPG with turn based tactical combat - Buy it, enjoy and support the series.			"

												I cannot play this because the graphics are too outdated for my GPU (GTX 760) so I legitimately can't see anything on the game screen unless I wave my mouse over it, and even then it's difficult to read the text as this game was clearly not made for 1920 x 1080 (60Hz) HD resolutions. The cutscenes were just a mash of 256-bit colours and were unviewable due to my GPU, and I couldn't make out what the images were.I know for a FACT that ALL Fallout games (save for New Vegas) were and are excellent games. I do recommend this because of its reputation as a solid 10/10 title. Even though I cannot see anything, it's still a good game regardless.			"

												It is the year 2161, 84 years after nuclear war reduced the planet into a barren, desolate wasteland. Much of the surviving populations live in Vaults-self sustaining bunkers built shortly before the war. You are a member of Vault 13. One day, Vault 13's water purification chip breaks, and the Overseer is forced to send you out into the wasteland to find a new water chip. Have fun!			"

												Let me begin by saying i have played every fallout game to date.Fallout is a Open World Post Nuclear Role Playing Game, Which Is Set 80 Years after the Nuclear War which nearly brought an end to mankind there were a few lucky survivors who were able to enter these giant underground Vault's on the day that the bombs dropped, you were born in Vault 13.The Main Story Plot of Fallout is that Your Vaults Water Purification Chip has Broken and that means that The Vault will run out of drinking water very soon so the Vault's Overseer Send's you the Vault Dweller out on a Quest to find a replacement Water Chip.Gameplay in Fallout centers around the game world, visiting locations and interacting with the local inhabitants. Occasionally, inhabitants will be immersed in dilemmas which the player may choose to solve in order to acquire karma and experience points. Fallout deviates from most role-playing video games in that it often allows for the player to complete tasks in multiple ways, often choosing solutions that are unconventional or even contrary to the original task, in which case the player may still be rewarded. The player's actions may ultimately dictate the ending of the game, or what future story or gameplay opportunities are available. Ultimately, players will encounter hostile opponents (if such encounters are not avoided using stealth or diplomacy), in which case they and the player will engage in combat. Non-combat portions of the game are typically played in real-time.Combat in Fallout is turn-based. The game uses an action point system wherein, each turn, multiple actions may be performed until all points in the pool have been expended. Different actions consume different numbers of points, and the maximum number of points that can be spent may be affected by such things as chems or perks. 'Melee' (hand to hand) weapons typically offer multiple attack types, such as 'Swing' and 'Thrust' for knives. Unarmed attacks offer many attack types, including 'Punch' and 'Kick'. Players may equip at most two weapons, and the player can switch between them by clicking a button. The Perception attribute determines characters' 'Sequence' number, which then determines the order of turns in combat; characters with a higher statistic in this attribute will be placed at an earlier position in the sequence of turns, and subsequently get new turns earlier. Perception also determines the maximum range of ranged weapons, and the chance to hit with them.I Would Recomend Fallout To any fan of the Series Or Newcomer.			"

												This game's a damn classic. It's easily surpassed by Fallout 2, but on its own its a pretty absorbing game. Not bad for a first installment! Lots of different ways to resolve quests, quite a few with non-violent solutions. Kiiinda buggy, though -- highly recommend grabbing a community patch or two if you install it.

												One of the best RPGs of all time.The pacing is great, the plot is gripping, the dialogue is awesome (and often hilarious). The graphics still hold up amazingly well for a now 17-year title and the sound effects are spot on. Music is subtle and atmospheric. Not memorable, but does a good job in seting the mood.But what impresses me the most about this game is that it allows for both scripted experience and emergent experiences, as every situation can be remedied through a personally-selected mix of combat, stealth, dialogue.While the game is not as much of a write-your-own as some other open-world games, it leans on the scripted content to create sequences & events that are truly awesome.Good luck in the wastes!

												ah yes, Fallout. The real deal. Playing it now i can say, even with ""everyone has his own taste"" and ""some people like this or that"", people who think Fallout 3 is better than this game can go to hell. We don't need these people. And i say this as someone who's first Fallout was Fallout 3. Yes, that FPS was my first Fallout and i came to this later on.The German version is a joke. Even the cut German CD version was better. Here on steam they just took everything out without thinking or testing. The red keycard that you HAVE TO GET in the glow is found on a burnd body. In the old german cd version of the game, the keycard was just on the ground instat. In the cut-steam version, they just took the body out with all loot on it.They took a item that you HAVE TO get out because it isn't uncut. No replacement, just give up.Game works fine on win 7 64bit, for me. Fallout 1 is better than Fallout 3. I don't care if you have a ""other opinion"", it is just nonsense. The german steam version is missing key-items for the game.			"

												This game did something only one other 90's game did for me (Half-Life). It took a genre that we know and love today, and redefines it. This game is one of the best, if not THE best RPG I've ever played.+ Amazing atmosphere+ A great amount of detail. Every place feels hand crafted, and polished+ S.P.E.C.I.A.L. is a creative way to create your character, rather than making cosmetic changes that RPG's do today+ Pure freedom is encouraged. Fallout 3 and New Vegas are good games, but I believe the first gives the most freedom.+ A few very different, creative, and even horrifying alternative endings+ Great soundtrack, accompanied by The Ink Spots, my favorite 30's-40's band!+ A large amount of enemies. From mutants, to raiders, radscorpions, rats, and tons more+ A great amount of weapons as well. Trust me though, energy weapons are your friend. Remember that while playing.+ Different ways to approach about any mission+ Great final ""Boss"" with 3 different ways to deal with him. No spoilers, sorry+ Writing is alright, surprisingly! A mix of serious and funny! ""Moo, I say!"" -Brahmin+ Although there aren't a whole ton of locations like in F3, and FNV, these locations are huge and branched out.+ You can actually join different factions, rather than sitting next to them feeling like a sidekick. In F3, you helped the Brotherhood of Steel. In F1, you straight up join them!+ Interesting characters all over the world+ Followers that can help you on your quest. Remember, their death is permanent!+ The animation in the game is surprisingly good! The cutscenes are amazing as well, especially for it's time.+ The story seems so simple. ""Go get a water chip"" is the beggining, but it eventually branches out and has a good amount of lore in it as well+ Rather than helping someone in the Crimson Caravan find love (Fallout New Vegas), you actually get to join up with the caravan and make a good amount of caps from it, too+ A good 14 Hours long from what I've played. This is the longest 90's game I've ever played that kept me entertained the whole time+/- You can accidentally shoot your partners. Although it may only happen a few times for you, it will happen a lot with your partners shooting you.- A bit of an anticlimax ""Good Ending"", which is the one I got. Again, no spoilers- A few bugs, too. I can still ask for a water purification chip even though I found it a year ago- The shown chance of hitting a target is a bit off sometimes. ""95% chance to hit this rat twice!? I got thi... I missed both times...""9.5/10 An Outstanding TitleThis is a prime example of what RPG's should be. True freedom to do just about anything, anytime. If you're getting Fallout 1 & 2, just buy the Classic Collection. You'll get Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel along with Fallout 1 & 2 (3 games for the price of 2). Well, off to Fallout 2!

												10/10 - A shining pinnacle of human achievement.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------GRAPHICS --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------First off, graphics aren't everything to me. I grew up with Atari, Apple ][e, PowerMacs, NES, and so on. Fallout uses the good old 800x600 overhead isometric view, and does it quite right. The game has a fair amount of variety in the appearance of the locations, though the ""cave"" areas tend to get a bit too familiar. There is a ton of variety in the objects used, and a lot of areas are just really nice art to look at. It holds up for me, personally. Objectively, it looked great when it came out, but was kind of bashed a bit for not being a light sourced 3D game. Those were the expectations of the time.The best part about the various character models in the game is the way that they are torn apart, melted, disintegrated, exploded and otherwise ended when you discharge your fury on them. The flamethrower is good for laughs, especially. It certainly followed through on the vision of its spiritual predecessor, Wasteland, in that respect. The dialouge sequences with certain characters brings you to a great looking 3D model of the character's animated head, but other wise all characters are rather small and faceless.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------SOUND ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The music, combined with the graphics, creates a thick, perfect layer of atmosphere. The desolation and tension of this setting really is emphasized by the great music. Composer Mark Morgan totally nailed it. The various gunshots, laser beams, rockets and explosions of combat all sound great. The 10mm Handgun especially has a very satisfying ""THUD"" to it.The voice acting is frigging phenominal. Frank Welker, Ron Perlman, Tony Shalhoub, Tress MacNeille, and a bunch more take care of voicing the metric ton of dialouge that exists for all cut scenes and plot ""essential"" characters. It all sounds so good, you will want to have the sound and music turned up nice and loud while you play. Really, really good.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------GAMEPLAY -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Movement while exploring is similar to Diablo, point and click to go. When combat starts, the game switches to turn based mode. This is where how you build your skills and equip your character matters more than how fast you can click on different things. It is possible to gimp your character, and die repeatedly if you don't pay attention to some basic survival needs. Such as at least one strong combat skill, and average intelligence at the very barest of minimums. Intelligence is responsible for getting more points to put into skills when you level up. One or more of your various skills is going to determine your success in pretty much everything you can do in this game. Speech can be a path netting some extra information and reward often enough that I find it useful too. At least a smattering of everything will come in handy, but I personally wouldn't go without lockpick, medicine (for healing and for quests), and science. For combat, anything will do, but bear two things in mind. Be the best. Choose one of the various combat skills, and pump points into it every level until it is at least 75. Then keep rasing it, but it isn't so much of a priority compared to diversity at that point. Smal guns are the most widely available, but don't let that keep you from choosing your own path as they are all viable. It is possible to ""play the bad guy"" and destroy your karmaic reputation in order to steal, murder, and otherwise plunder the shambles of a society that remains on Earth. Indeed, some quests and items are most easily and quickly performed by stealing something, or locking the door and murdering someone. But, your karma follows you around in this game. At a certain point, you will be unwelcome. Then, people might want to kill you for what you have done. I find that the path of the righteous leads to far greater reward in terms of XP, in this game. There is a wide variety of weapons, armor, enemies, and locations for battle. The battles can play out rather slowly, and being turn based are not everyone's cup of whatever. The game can be rather challenging at the start if you aren't used to these sorts of games, but the difficulty can be changed at any time in game. The game is kind of equal parts combat and exploration. There is a great deal of humor in both, and I have spent plenty of time just watching random NPC's interact with each other. It all piles on to the atmosphere of the fledgling civilization struggling to survive in the harsh new hell they created, only to be found repeating the same death spiral pattern of behaviors that set them on the path in the first place.If you aren't immediately turned off by the graphics and the turn based nature of the game play, then this game might be for you. It is one of the precursors to such games as the Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale serieseses.. es. Planescape Torment. Shares team members with Knights of The Old Republic 1 and 2, Fallout New Vegas, Arcanum, and a few more greatest role playing games ever. (KOTOR 2 and Greyhawk have at least been fixed and patched to greatness on PC...) But Fallout and Fallout 2 have always been my very favorites and the most replayed. If you dig a little, you will find that there is a ton of depth and character in this rather slow paced old school game.(Never you mind what the ""hours played"" on Steam says, my Steam was mostly offline for intermittent years. When I played the game for hundreds of hours since its release, it was the CD-rom version.)			"

												One of the best games I have ever played and was surprised to see that it didn't have 99% for positive reviews. So naturally I checked them and can confirm that roughly every negative review was from some retard who didn't so much as look at screenshots, doesn't have any patience whatsoever (I dont even know how you could need patience for this game but people said it was to slow???), and failed to try and even understand how to play the game. Example being ""I can never hit anything"" Most likely but everything into melee and tried to make eye shots with a gun completely ignoring the % chances to hit specific areas. Normally I would suggest looking at negative reviews because they can point out some huge drawbacks in the game that might make you want to rethink buying it, but in this case they are all pretty much written by ADHD children who wanted a first person shooter (again not a single look at the screenshots).  The only decent one was the top voted one that talked about how this is ""slightly"" censored and you cant kill children, which I agree is complete bull... You probably want to play with the Fixt mod for this game, basically its a giant patch, doesnt really add anything and the few things it does add are entirely optional. (psst with this you can make your companions move the ♥♥♥♥ out of the door finally). If you truly want to see the game for what it is and get a good idea watch some youtube videos of this game, it is a popular game and has many HD videos with/without clear commentary.Side note: Also dont judge the positive reviews based on time, because with that patch along with the one for fallout 2 you load the game diferently and it doesn't go through steam. Hence fewer hours being shown.			"

												Having just played and beaten this game for the very first time, I can safely say it is one of the best isometric and RPG games I have ever played. It's roleplaying elements are fantstic and fun, the gameplay is difficult but mostly fair, and it's story and character's were very enjoyable. I was worried for a long time about picking this game up as I was afraid I would not enjoy it like I enjoy New Vegas, but i'm very happy I got it, because it was fantastic despite being grapicly and mechanicly outdated. I would highly recommend trying it if you have a interest in Classic games, the Fallout series, Isometric games, or RPG's.			"

												Fallout 1 is an important game for gaming history since without this we wouldn't have to suffer through constant Pop Vinyls and cosplays of Fallout 3 and 4 to capitalise on their success. Despite eventually resulting in one of the worst fanbases of all time, Fallout 1 itself is a masterpiece that deserves to be played by everyone who loves RPGs. I have my fair share of complaints with the original entry, especially in retrospect since Fallout 2 and New Vegas improved upon the formula for the most part, but despite all this Fallout 1 still remains the best written game in the series by far with some of the most memorable locations to ever grace a Fallout game. If I wanted to be really critical I'd complain about things like how the companions have zero depth or how varied you can make the game for yourself in replaying it (in comparison to 2 and NV, 1 still has plenty of variety) but all of that melts away whenever I just sit down and play this game. Fallout 1 isn't perfect but it is so close it's like splitting hairs. If you haven't played this game you owe it to yourself to do it. This remains one of the best RPGs and even best games to this very day.			"

													It's always hard to dislike a popular game series, but Fallout just isn't for me, which is strange in some ways.  In its defense, I was not paying attention when I bought the game to notice it was a TBS game.  I had some fun in the middle of my experience once I had understood most of the mechanics, but I found it very irritating to get a hold of the controls and basic game play mechanics.  A few walkthroughs later I get further into the game, but I kept running into tedious obstacles that made me have to look up the best actions for them.	I see why people like it, but I am one who couldn't get addicted to it.  I might change my mind if I pick it up and play it in the future.  If anyone has advice on how I might better enjoy the game I am open minded about it.			"

												Fallout is possibly the first game to have a wide variety of choices and consequences. (and perks/traits.) And it shouldn't be played just because it's the first to do it, but because it does it very well.It starts with a simple premise: You live in an underground nuclear fallout shelter (aka, a Vault) 80 years after a two-hour war between China and the US basically ended up in the both countries getting wholly nuked, and the water chip that keeps a supply of water to the whole Vault was damaged, and you were the unlucky one to have to venture out into the outside world to find the closest Vault and get another chip to save everyone you know. You are expelled into a cave full of rats (the ultimate and classic RPG enemy) and have to venture out, the first of your Vault to do so.Fallout's system, SPECIAL, was made in a week (with the exception of perks), and it shows. The original goal of the team, when the game still had a license for GURPS (another system) was that no skill or stat should be useless. Well, first tip to creating a character: dump Charisma and get 4 free stat points. There are also a lot of mostly useless skills, but anyone with half a brain should distinguish the useless from the useful.Combat is nothing special, except for the gory death animations: When getting crits with different weapons, enemies (or you) will die in very elaborate deaths: getting cut in half by the sheer amount of bullet holes a burst fire of a mini-gun has gave you, for example! It's pretty fun, even though the combat itself lacks tactical depth (sure, you can aim at limbs, eyes and crotch, but you'll end up shooting eyes always - well, maybe crotch for some amusing banter :))It's not a very long game, but throughout it you venture through several settlements that have been built   by the surivivors of California. You will have several multi-pathed quests and consequences, though, sadly, most of the consequences are only showed in the slideshow at the end of the game. Still, you will feel that your choices matter. The atmosphere is great, with no small influence of the great ambient soundtrack Mark Morgan produced, and the game gets better the more you progress into it: The final two areas have the most different ways of approaching the obstacles presented, and the game ends with one of the best ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ""final bosses"" of game history, if you choose to not kill him directly: You talk him out of doing spoiler , but your speech skill won't do it alone. You'll have to find evidence that convinces him. And then, you will be shown what you could and couldn't do. On the first playthrough, unless you got lucky, you will end up having failed to save a lot of people.Well, how about a replay?			"

												It feels weird to give a thumbs up to a game I just can't seem to get through, but as always with my more contentious reviews - this is the fault of a system that doesn't allow a rating scale.I'll put it this way - if you can get over an incredibly dated interface and graphical style, and can deal with potentially looking up some information online (self-guided tutorial) you may find some fun here. The game offers a rich top-down old-school RPG experience. I would say you should watch a gameplay video, check out the screenshots, if you're not put off by anything you see it's probably for you. If you're looking for something approaching this experience from modern games, Wasteland 2 offers a similar setting in the same mechanical style but with updated graphics and features, while the new Fallout games offer similar tone and stories with differing mechanics (first person). Wary of problems from previous attempts, I am happy to report that it runs considerably better now on Windows 10 than it ever did for me on Windows 7. I've had none of the crashing or strange graphic bugs that plagued my last attempt at the game, but it is still so dated that without a nostalgic pull it's difficult for me to really get into. I am shelving it for now until I get in a real 90's mood - in which case I will come back and edit my review.			"

												+Great game, lotta fun once you figure out the combat system+Learn a lot about the Fallout universe that you wouldn't know from only playing 3 or New Vegas, such as what happened at other Vaults, the origins of things like super-mutants and Raiders+Awesome weapons+Turn-based combat is tough and always keeps you on your toes+Enemies are scarier as a result+As far as I know, you can't become an invincible god like in 3 and New Vegas which gives you a sense of humility+Which also forces you to fight cautiously, strategically and pick your battles+Random events are either positive or negative so you're hopeful, yet cautious when traveling+In-game time is important, which gives a sense of immersion+In-game time isn't too fast or too slow, it's just right+It also goes into much more vivid detail than most games, there's an in-game calendar and things happen on certain dates, most games do night/day like , occasionally you'll see a game that does time of the day or day of the week+No fast traveling like in 3 or New Vegas. Instead of pulling up your Pip Boy and selecting a place, you have to actually leave your current city, then travel to the next. You're shown a map of the whole area and once you click somewhere, your guy moves as in-game time flies by at a realistic and believable pace. You also slow down at mountains and stuff, to make it seem more like you're climbing them. Occasionally, you get a random event which stops your traveling and gives you more of a feeling like your actually adventuring-Combat system is hard to get used to-Enemies can be a bit too tough at times-If there are too many enemies, you're going to die, no matter how much skill or luck you possess-If there are enough NPCs during a battle, you have to wait forever for your turn as each NPC moves and attacks one at a time, especially during missions where you help escort the Crimson Caravan-During such battle, I bet I could walk away from my computer, make a sandwich, and come back and still be waiting for my turn-Turn based combat is annoying and confusing before you learn how it works, which is not easy because it isn't self-explanatory in any way+/- Even though it's Fallout, it has a completely different feel if you're like most Fallout players if you've only played 3 or New Vegas. I like this fact, but I can imagine that others wouldn't+/- Neurtal NPCs react to you unholstering your weapon. From a realism point of view, it makes sense, but from a gameplay point of view, it can be annoying			"

It got a lot of hidden stuff which rewards the highly curious looter. It got a lot of funny dialogues and what you will find will truly be amazing. If you like slow-paced RPG’s with highly immersive and unpredictable environment, then this is the game for you. Definitely give it a go if you are into some of Bethesda’s continuation of these games. "

												“The struggle for survival is a war without end. And war… war never changes.”Fallout is one of those rare role-playing games oozing quality from every pore – one might even say radiate. The gameplay is smooth, using action points for movement and combat. In addition it has one of the best character development systems you can wish for. The amazing story, great love for detail and high replayability make for an excellent gaming experience.Fun fact: Fallouts retro-futurism has been inspired by 1950s pulp magazines, superhero comics of Atomic Age and classic Science Fiction films such as Forbidden Planet. There are also many references to the events and the style of Wasteland (PC game from 1988) in the Fallout series, which is why Fallout is sometimes regarded as a spiritual successor to Wasteland.--My rating system consists of six categories in descending order of importance:-	Atmosphere-	Characters-	Details-	Tactical gameplay-	Story-	Combat & ControlsBased on the performance each category will receive one of the following grading: -	S-Rank: excellent-	A-Rank: very good-	B-Rank: solid-	C-Rank: satisfactory-	D-Rank: inferiorIf the S-Rank is awarded, a quote from the game or personal comment will be added as a token of my respect (in brackets).--Atmosphere: S-Rank(I am the bringer of death! Fall to your knees and beg for mercy… or give me a sandwich, I’m pretty hungry.)Characters: S-Rank (Do I have to sacrifice a puppy to join?)Details: S-Rank (To see a valley filled with my enemies’ heads mounted on spears.

												One of the best RPGs ever created, and the first game in one of the greatest game series of all time. If you're a fan of Fallout 3 or Fallout: New Vegas, you need to play Fallout & Fallout 2. If you're a fan of RPGs, you need to play Fallout, if you're a fan of original, immersive, interesting, and amusing games with interesting characters, quests, worlds, and items, you need to play Fallout. The biggest complaint I hear people give Fallout and Fallout 2 is that they're ""outdated"" and that they've aged terribly, when this simply isn't the case. And what's worse, is that I hear this from people who supposedly claim to be HUGE Fallout fans. Fallout: New Vegas is my favorite Fallout game becuase it combines the skillful writing, RPG elements, and interesting characters and places from Fallout and Fallout 2, AND the first/third-person 3D open-world that I am used to, but even then I'm still able to turn off my FPS fanboy goggles for a little while to play an Isometric turn-based RPG because I love Fallout. I just really can't understand, if you really love Fallout, how any of the supposedly ""outdated"" elements of the original two games can hinder you from enjoying them, grow a pair and play them, It's not that difficult.Compared to Fallout 2, Fallout is probably a little lacking, as Fallout 2 practically improves in every single aspect of the game, a larger game world with more quests, more people to meet and more places to explore, however, the only thing FO2 doesn't really improve upon was the somewhat ""serious"" tone in the original, as Fallout 2 makes Fallout look like Heavy Rain in comparison. Although I myself prefer Fallout 2 for the reasons listed above, the original is still one of the greatest RPGs of all time, and of course, the forerunner for the complete Fallout series, which, for good or bad, is still going strong today. Also, don't give Ian the SMG.R.I.P. Ian, died while rescuing Tandi from the Raiders.R.I.P. Tycho, died while cleansing the Deathclaws from the Warehouse.R.I.P. Dogmeat, died while eradicating the Super Mutants from the Watershed.R.I.P. Katja, died while fighting the Super Mutants in the LA Vault.PS, game can actually run on Windows 7, *cough* Fallout 3 *cough*			"

												The Fallout franchise needs no intorduction to modern gamers but many out there have only played fallout 3 onwards. The original fallout games are of a different ilk but no less playable. As it is an isometric, turn based RPG, the thought of this may put some players off but please do still give it a go. The depth of play in this original outing is incredible and different almost every time you play. There will always be something you missed or one of the many 'Weird Wasteland' easter eggs that will pop up that you may not have seen before. Although it is not a first person run and gun RPG litke it's modern day sequels this game sets the stage and has lost nothing over time. Definitely a game that will keep you coming back for one more exploration session.			"

												My introduction to the Fallout series was Fallout 3. I had never heard of the series before that, but after a few months (because I wasn't paying much attention to the community) I heard long time fans of the series were upset with how Bethesda handled the game. I wasn't completely disillusioned with Bethesda yet at this time and I hadn't started looking at things more critically, so I didn't understand the problem back then. I also had nothing else to compare it to at the time.Then Fallout: New Vegas came and it was better than FO3 in every way. Then Fallout 4 came and it was worse than about anything I could compare it to in very nearly every way. During this time I had tried to get into Fallout 1 a number of times, but never really did, farthest I had made it was to Shady Sands before quitting. Until this past week, that is. According to Steam I've played about 18 hours in the past week and I'm really loving it so far and I can see why so many long time fans have an issue with Fallout 3 and 4.			"

												For those of you who got this game after playing 3, New Vegas and/or 4, prepare for a whole different cup of tea.This game is a isometric top down RPG(in case you didnt see the screenshots) and is a game that does not hold your hand whatsoever.And this being an older Fallout game means.....1) No tutorials and you are just thrown into the game straight.2) No quest markers meaning you might bang your head trying to find the correct location.3) You have to figure things out on your own.4) You have to save frequently lest you lose progress.5) Combat is significantly different that what you are used in future Fallouts, being slow and tactical.6) Inventory management and bartering is more cumbersome.7) Movement and exploration is slow with random encounters of random difficulty.If any of those turn you off then I suggest you rethink your purchase. Other than that, the game has a compelling story, great characters and quests to take on, its pretty much what you expect from the Fallout games, you are tasked with a huge responsibility and you set out to explore the wasteland. Its a very good game for its time and if you can get over the old game tropes I listed above, you are gonna have a good time.And look.....just be safe out there...ok.			"

												Wow, where do I begin? You can probably tell by looking at my profile picture that I'm a fan of this particular franchise. Let me tell you a story about how my Fallout journey began... Back when I was a young lad, I was thumbing through a gaming mag (believe it or not, that's what we had to do before the internet exploded) and saw a page dedicated to Fallout 2, with some screenshots and synopsis, etc. 'This is interesting' I thought to myself, fresh off the high that I got from playing Metal Gear Solid and Final Fantasy VII; I was excited for more deep, mature and thought-provoking games. But then I noticed that it was a computer game, which is, sadly, rather hard to play when you don't have a computer. So I let it go. Fast forward a year or two later and there's a new PC in the den, but by then I had already forgotten about that obscure magazine article... But luckily, later that year on my 17th birthday, I was in a retail store looking for ways to waste my money. While walking toward the Playstation aisle I passed by a small section dedicated to PC games. It was a pathetic display, mostly consisting of FMV puzzle games and flight sims. But then I saw it... like a black hole pulsing with darkness and malice... Fallout 1 and 2, together, for a mere $10. I looked over my shoulder to verify that no one was watching as I picked up the M-rated game(s), one of the few I placed my hands on. There was a stigma attatched to M-rated games, back before they were making billions, and they were few and far between. The mere sight of the M was enough to make parents cringe. Thanks to Mortal Kombat and Doom, there was the notion that these games were evil and soul-stealing. So as I gazed with awe at the box art, I was thankful that my brother had driven me to the store and not my mother. I took it to the counter, and for the first and last time ever, I was asked to show my ID for the purchase. I was nervous, but I was 17, so there was nothing they could do to stop me.I waited until my parents had gone to bed before installing the game. I had an idea of what to expect, but I admit I was still trying to wrap my head around the concept of a world where the Jestons-inspired retro version of the future was true, and the cold war turned into a nuclear reality. I had never heard of such nonsense in my life, but somehow, it made perfect sense. 'War never changes'... the haunting opening entered into my mind and settled comfortably, as if my mind had already decided that this was going to be something special. And Oh, how it was, and is... Fallout is brilliant. A dark, atmospheric, violent and oddly loveable adventure into a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Taking inspiration from the Road Warrior and twisting it into something grand and absurd. I won't go into anything specific about the story and setting, because by this point, 15 years later, you may already know enough. If not, you are in for a treat. I would say that it still holds up, but that's because I got in when it was still pretty new, so my perspective is a bit skewed. What I will say is that still, to this day, even with all the amazing advancements in games, it has some things about it that have yet to be surpassed. The exceptionally well-concieved levelling system, for example, is probably the best there has ever been in a game of any kind.   I could spend another hour writing about why I love this game so much, but if you are one of those people that have yet to experience it, I think it best you go in with as little information as possible. I can not recommend this game enough; It is truly a masterpiece that every RPG fan should know by heart.			"

												One of the best RPGs ever created, and the first game in one of the greatest game series of all time. If you're a fan of Fallout 3 or Fallout: New Vegas, you need to play Fallout & Fallout 2. If you're a fan of RPGs, you need to play Fallout, if you're a fan of original, immersive, interesting, and amusing games with interesting characters, quests, worlds, and items, you need to play Fallout. The biggest complaint I hear people give Fallout and Fallout 2 is that they're ""outdated"" and that they've aged terribly, when this simply isn't the case. And what's worse, is that I hear this from people who supposedly claim to be HUGE Fallout fans. Fallout: New Vegas is my favorite Fallout game becuase it combines the skillful writing, RPG elements, and interesting characters and places from Fallout and Fallout 2, AND the first/third-person 3D open-world that I am used to, but even then I'm still able to turn off my FPS fanboy goggles for a little while to play an Isometric turn-based RPG because I love Fallout. I just really can't understand, if you really love Fallout, how any of the supposedly ""outdated"" elements of the original two games can hinder you from enjoying them, grow a pair and play them, It's not that difficult.Compared to Fallout 2, Fallout is probably a little lacking, as Fallout 2 practically improves in every single aspect of the game, a larger game world with more quests, more people to meet and more places to explore, however, the only thing FO2 doesn't really improve upon was the somewhat ""serious"" tone in the original, as Fallout 2 makes Fallout look like Heavy Rain in comparison. Although I myself prefer Fallout 2 for the reasons listed above, the original is still one of the greatest RPGs of all time, and of course, the forerunner for the complete Fallout series, which, for good or bad, is still going strong today. Also, don't give Ian the SMG.R.I.P. Ian, died while rescuing Tandi from the Raiders.R.I.P. Tycho, died while cleansing the Deathclaws from the Warehouse.R.I.P. Dogmeat, died while eradicating the Super Mutants from the Watershed.R.I.P. Katja, died while fighting the Super Mutants in the LA Vault.PS, game can actually run on Windows 7, *cough* Fallout 3 *cough*			"

												Pop some mentats, grab a Nuka-Cola and have a blast. Don't let my time on this game fool you, I have played it through at least 4 times outside Steam, if I had played it with Steam (at the time) I think would have at least 80-100h on it.Fallout, where it all started. The atmosphere, the ambient music, the amazing characters, the vast interesting world, the combat system there is nothing I can name that I do not love about Fallout. The many different playstyles you can go at this game makes each new playthrough a fresh experience. This is and always will be a game I come back to time to time like a really good book you just want to pick up and read through at least once a year. The immersion alone makes this game a treat.Definitely a masterpiece that to this day is with great looking visuals, immersive world and just plain fun gameplay.			"

												So I recently replayed this game for the first time since the 90's. Here's what I think now, without the nostalgia glasses on.Funny, slow, a bit repetitive but charming story.I probably killed the fun in this game when I figured out an exploit. I like to set my LUCK to 10 at the start of the game so I can more easily get the random event with the UFO. The UFO blast gun is hands down the most powerful gun in this game and it's the only thing you need to be successful. It's lightweight, holds tons of ammo and destroys everything you throw at it. Make sure to dump a ton of points into ENERGY weapons at the start and buy ammo from the hub. Another thing I did that I guess could be considered cheating was I boosted my gambling skill to around 60-70%. I gambled in the hub and the chance of you winning over losing is greater. I took 2 iPhones and postioned them on the keyboard to hold down 1 and 3 on the keyboard I believe. It forces the game to continue gambling rapidly. After 30 minutes I came back to discover I now have 250,000 bottlecaps!Anyways, the point I'm trying to get at is this game is pretty flexible and has some really unique elements you're not going to find anywhere else. I personally prefer this game and FO2 over the new Fallout games. I don't think Bethesda really fully grasped this franchise and how it's supposed to feel. +I'm a big fan of the SPECIAL system.+Combat is a bit lackluster but it works.+Make sure to speed up combat in options, otherwise companions will annoy the ♥♥♥♥ out of you.+Dogmeat companion.+The ending boss is hilarious and well worth the journey. Make sure to watch all of his responses on Youtube.-I wasn't a big fan of all they portrayed your vault. I think it would've been better to never have the ability to re-enter the vault 13 so your imagination can go crazy for how it should be in there.			"

												Released back in 1997, Fallout is still one of my favourite RPG's ever made. A spiritual successor to Wasteland with heavy influences from the 1981 movie Mad Max, this is a true blue, old school CRPG, no kiddies allowed. Don't expect any level of hand holding here. You're meant to explore, investigate, and actually think about what you do. Dialogue has meaning, and if you say or do the wrong thing, you might just ♥♥♥♥ someone off so bad you'll be screwed out of a quest forever. The combat is simple, yet deep enough to be engaging. Battles are turn-based, with action points determining how much you can do each turn. Most of the combat is driven by some heavy dice roll ♥♥♥♥, so expect to be screwed over by a bad critical hit and lose all of your health in a single turn, when previous attack dealt zero damage.Most of the map is empty space. Instead of walking everywhere, you travel on a world map to locations of interest, wherein the real ♥♥♥♥ happens. Ranging from small settlements to the ruined remains of ancient cities, these locations are teeming with mysteries to unravel, choices to make, people to meet, items to loot, and a bunch of people to murder, if you're feeling sadistic. Quests often involve multiple outcomes, with several offering the choice between two opposing sides. Whether you're a ruthless mercenary willing to take on any job, a generous saviour, or an evil monster, this game accommodates you, allowing you to approach the game any way you see fit.The game's SPECIAL system offers a surprising amount of depth in character creation. Will you be a gun-toting wanderer who solves problems with his guns, or a smooth-talking snake who solves problems without ever resorting to violence? How about a strongman who smashes his foes with a sledgehammer but is so stupid he can't even carry a conversation with people? Yes, you can do that. No matter which perks you pick or what skills you invest in, you're character will always end up with a different set of strengths and weaknesses. With these systems, the player is given a great deal of options that allow them to fine-tune their character, creating a vastly unique playthrough each time. The story, characters, and setting are all iconic at this point. Though much of its aesthetic is derivative in some way, Fallout carved a unique personality of its own regardless. The narrative is nothing too complicated, and yet it's well-written and impactful at the same time, leading up to one of the best endings in RPG history. There's only three quests in the main plot lines, but these are long involving journeys that will take you all across post-apocalyptic Southern California. As you go from town to town, new quests, jobs, and side activities will open up, which can ultimately serve your primary objectives as well. Know that there is a finite end to the content, however. Though there's a lot to see and do (my first playthrough clocked in at about sixty hours), the game ends once you've beaten the main quest, and outside of that, you can't explore every nook and cranny like you can in Fallout: New Vegas. There's a limit to just how much you can do, but I feel this adds more to the experience, as it lends meaning to your actions. Don't expect to get every skill to a hundred and unlock every perk in a single playthrough.As a game that came out in the late nineties, there are definitely some issues. First, there are major graphical bugs which can be fixed, but may persist nonetheless in more benign forms, which is to be expected of a game that's almost seventeen years old. Then there's some other annoying nitpicks, like unintuitive UI that feels clunky and the odd limitation like not being able to move more than 999 bottle caps at a time when bartering. The AI can be absolute garbage at times, too. Let's put it this way. There were times when I felt grateful that one of my followers was standing in a corner and not fighting, because that means he couldn't shoot me in the back. Without the ability to control your party, things can get pretty frustrating later in the game, when you're rolling with a huge posse to beat the final boss. Hint: save often, and in many slots.So, would I reccomend this game? That depends. Are you looking for an old school CRPG with deep combat and meaningful choices and character growth? If so, then I'll be damned if you can find a better game than Fallout.			"

												I played this game to completion in 2001 when it was only available on cd-rom. Since then I purchased copies on GoG.com and Steam.Fallout is the standard by which every other entry in the franchise should be judged. It is the more focused, balanced, thematically coherent Fallout experience available and the only one released with main designers Tim Cain, Leonard Boyarsky and Jason Anderson still on board.By today's standards the game still hold up well even without fan patches and resolution mods, which are still strongly recommended. The engine and interface does show its age and the sequel, Fallout 2, improves a few things here and there. But the turn-based system and top down camera are not products of their times. First person view and real time combat are not ""modern"". Changing the former for the latter doesn't constitute an improvement, but a complete change of direction.This kind of game wasn't made that way due to technical limitations. Bethesda released its first Elder Scrolls game in 1994, the year Tim Cain started working on what would become Fallout. No, the intention was to make a computer rpg that felt like playing a pen & paper role playing game. It wasn't about player skills, but player choices. The perspective is from someone playing Dongeons & Dragons, Shadowrun or (more appropriately) GURPS, seeing the world through the maps and descriptions provided by the game master and, ultimately, interpreted by the player's imagination.It isn't the most popular perspective but a legitimate one nonetheless, which suits computer rpgs like a glove. This is how Fallout was meant to be played and, frankly, that's how it should have stayed.			"

If so, then I'll be damned if you can find a better game than Fallout.			"

												This is the original Fallout. If you're not farmilar with it this game is a post-apocalyptic turn-based RPG and wildly regarded as a classic. but I'm not in love with it. I say this as someone who is fairly young and dosen't have a notalgia bias twords this game as I was growing up.To start, this game is very well made and, other than the graphics, the game has aged very well. It plays like it should and has an amazing atmosphere.You may hear about the graphics glitching out on newer systems, however this is nolonger true. Bethesda recently patched the game so it works on newer systems. If you are using an older system you still have the option to play the classic version. The new version (to my knowledge) is the same as the classic version with the exception of the graphics being fixed.All in all if you want to play the game that launched the Fallout series, are looking for a nostalgia trip, or enjoy this kind of game I highly recomend it. There are no real problems, I wouldn't say it's perfect, but it definatly does it's job. For that, I recomend this game.			"

												Art matters, and they got the fun down to every pixel. Great pixel art for everything from the character to the terrain. I had played fallout III and the modern versions and like how weapons in fallout do not need to be repaired. Also unlike the modern versions it is turn-based but does not detract at all from the feel of the game.  Inventory and skill selection are very in-depth. Recommended, hours of fun. Try out intelligence and luck at 10 for a character :)			"

												I started with Fallout 3, and immediatly fell in love. After many hours of that game, I decided to try the original. It was a pain to learn the gameplay such as combat controls at first, but they are not that bad once you get the hang of it. While it is an old game, it has a great atmosphere, and it is as fun to play as Fallout 3. This deserves to be praised. If you want more Fallout, then going back to the roots is worth a shot.			"

												The beginning of my favorite series, there are few games out there that can make every play through feel fresh. However, Fallout continues to deliver me new experiences every time I play. It is shortest of the series but the variety of role playing choices is still above and beyond most other RPG’s. With the only criticism I can think of being the limited companion control and black and white morality choices, this game stands out as a true classic.Pick it up and you won’t regret it.			"

												The Fallout series has been known for it's great exploration, looting fun, and character progression as you endure many different radioactive wastelands. But I think that Fallout 1 is by far the most immersive of them all. Although it's late 90's graphics are nothing compared to the modern graphic card melting games, this game's experience is told through reading, dialogue, scrounging for information, and plain old exploration. This game gives a more vivid and detailed image of what the reality of a open wasteland filled with murder and death feels lke than any other fallout's even come close to. That's more than enough reason to pick this game up, especially now that you can play it without uninstalling windows, thanks to Bethesda's new hi-resolution update!			"

												For those of you who got this game after playing 3, New Vegas and/or 4, prepare for a whole different cup of tea.This game is a isometric top down RPG(in case you didnt see the screenshots) and is a game that does not hold your hand whatsoever.And this being an older Fallout game means.....1) No tutorials and you are just thrown into the game straight.2) No quest markers meaning you might bang your head trying to find the correct location.3) You have to figure things out on your own.4) You have to save frequently lest you lose progress.5) Combat is significantly different that what you are used in future Fallouts, being slow and tactical.6) Inventory management and bartering is more cumbersome.7) Movement and exploration is slow with random encounters of random difficulty.If any of those turn you off then I suggest you rethink your purchase. Other than that, the game has a compelling story, great characters and quests to take on, its pretty much what you expect from the Fallout games, you are tasked with a huge responsibility and you set out to explore the wasteland. Its a very good game for its time and if you can get over the old game tropes I listed above, you are gonna have a good time.And look.....just be safe out there...ok.			"

												My introduction to the Fallout series was Fallout 3. I had never heard of the series before that, but after a few months (because I wasn't paying much attention to the community) I heard long time fans of the series were upset with how Bethesda handled the game. I wasn't completely disillusioned with Bethesda yet at this time and I hadn't started looking at things more critically, so I didn't understand the problem back then. I also had nothing else to compare it to at the time.Then Fallout: New Vegas came and it was better than FO3 in every way. Then Fallout 4 came and it was worse than about anything I could compare it to in very nearly every way. During this time I had tried to get into Fallout 1 a number of times, but never really did, farthest I had made it was to Shady Sands before quitting. Until this past week, that is. According to Steam I've played about 18 hours in the past week and I'm really loving it so far and I can see why so many long time fans have an issue with Fallout 3 and 4.			"

												The game hasn't aged well, but I could see it being big back when it was released. This is the game that started it all before Bethedsa took over the series and made Fallout 3. The gameplay mechanics thus are vastly different from the more recent titles. For one thing, you play in a top down perspective and basically attack enemies during turn based combat. However, you can move your character around freely during your turn so it's not as restricted as other turn based games. You also have various RPG elements such as stats you can improve, loot and inventory, and different outcomes based on your dialogue choices. I like the amount of freedom the game gives you since you can pretty much play the game how you want. There's a good amount of side quests that you can do if you want and the lore is there if you're interested in that stuff. What I don't like about the game is two things: the interface and the combat speed. The interface can take some getting used to because moving your character around, accessing weapons/inventory, etc. is done in an unconventional manner in my opinion. Also, the combat in this game can take forever especially if you are facing multiple enemies. This is because the characters move so slow when they walk and going through all the animations can end up making a large battle take 15-30 minutes. I wouldn't recommend this game to people who haven't played old 90s PC games before because like I said the interface and the combat mechanics can ruin the experience for you. However if you want the full Fallout experience this is where it all started.			"

												Even after Fallout 3, I still hungered for more, and considering that it was titled with a 3, I figured thre would be more of the series. I wen back even further in time to see Fallout, Fallout 2, and Fallout Tactics: BoS. And while I was immesnslly surprised at how old the series actually was, and how the gameplay was actually converted from a Top-down trunbased game (save for Fallout Tactic: BoS which was tactical combat) to a first-person open world. I looked to the original Fallout first, and was amazed at the detail that it had and how even with the way the game was in the different gameplay, I still felt like I was in the Fallout universe, and I think that Bethesda did an omaculant job at convering the game without changing the game's atmosphere and story world.

												Wow, where do I begin? You can probably tell by looking at my profile picture that I'm a fan of this particular franchise. Let me tell you a story about how my Fallout journey began... Back when I was a young lad, I was thumbing through a gaming mag (believe it or not, that's what we had to do before the internet exploded) and saw a page dedicated to Fallout 2, with some screenshots and synopsis, etc. 'This is interesting' I thought to myself, fresh off the high that I got from playing Metal Gear Solid and Final Fantasy VII; I was excited for more deep, mature and thought-provoking games. But then I noticed that it was a computer game, which is, sadly, rather hard to play when you don't have a computer. So I let it go. Fast forward a year or two later and there's a new PC in the den, but by then I had already forgotten about that obscure magazine article... But luckily, later that year on my 17th birthday, I was in a retail store looking for ways to waste my money. While walking toward the Playstation aisle I passed by a small section dedicated to PC games. It was a pathetic display, mostly consisting of FMV puzzle games and flight sims. But then I saw it... like a black hole pulsing with darkness and malice... Fallout 1 and 2, together, for a mere $10. I looked over my shoulder to verify that no one was watching as I picked up the M-rated game(s), one of the few I placed my hands on. There was a stigma attatched to M-rated games, back before they were making billions, and they were few and far between. The mere sight of the M was enough to make parents cringe. Thanks to Mortal Kombat and Doom, there was the notion that these games were evil and soul-stealing. So as I gazed with awe at the box art, I was thankful that my brother had driven me to the store and not my mother. I took it to the counter, and for the first and last time ever, I was asked to show my ID for the purchase. I was nervous, but I was 17, so there was nothing they could do to stop me.I waited until my parents had gone to bed before installing the game. I had an idea of what to expect, but I admit I was still trying to wrap my head around the concept of a world where the Jestons-inspired retro version of the future was true, and the cold war turned into a nuclear reality. I had never heard of such nonsense in my life, but somehow, it made perfect sense. 'War never changes'... the haunting opening entered into my mind and settled comfortably, as if my mind had already decided that this was going to be something special. And Oh, how it was, and is... Fallout is brilliant. A dark, atmospheric, violent and oddly loveable adventure into a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Taking inspiration from the Road Warrior and twisting it into something grand and absurd. I won't go into anything specific about the story and setting, because by this point, 15 years later, you may already know enough. If not, you are in for a treat. I would say that it still holds up, but that's because I got in when it was still pretty new, so my perspective is a bit skewed. What I will say is that still, to this day, even with all the amazing advancements in games, it has some things about it that have yet to be surpassed. The exceptionally well-concieved levelling system, for example, is probably the best there has ever been in a game of any kind.   I could spend another hour writing about why I love this game so much, but if you are one of those people that have yet to experience it, I think it best you go in with as little information as possible. I can not recommend this game enough; It is truly a masterpiece that every RPG fan should know by heart.			"

												It's Worth It, Just Be Prepared to Mod ItFallout's strengths lie in two areas: atmosphere and customization. The atmosphere of Fallout is amazing. It's one of the few games I feel that has gotten its atmosphere down right, combining a dangerous and barren post-apocalyptia with a retro 1950s undertone, and maintains a great balance between feeling ridiculous and serious. The story isn't anything to write home about, but it's an effective motivating force for the game. With that in mind, know that if you pick up Fallout, do NOT consult any walkthrough or wiki when playing it because, trust me, it'll spoil the fun. Fallout is the type of RPG that's made a whole lot better when you live with your consequences and aren't certain about where the story will take you. As for the customization, Fallout has it in plentiful supply and I'm not just refering to the moral choices available to you. Rather, it's the character customization which is some of the best. Between getting to specialize in a wide variety of weapon types to being able to having your intelligence level effect your choices in the game (Anything below an Intelligence of 4 makes you a bumbling idiot, and this is reflected in game by your dialogue options which are limited to ""me have trouble thinking"") there's a great amount of replayability to this game. However, while I recommend Fallout it does come with a bundle of bugs, some of which have the potential to be game breaking such as being trapped in a corner by an unmovable companion NPC. Because of this, I recommend you mod it. My personal recommendation is called ""Fallout FIXT"" by Sduibek. It's a great megamod which fixes a lot of problems, and is VERY customizable allowing you to choose between general bug fixes and improvements, or changing the feel of the game entirely. It's a great download. Anyway, Fallout is a fantastic (though not a perfect) game. I highly recommend it, ESPECIALLY if you can bag it for cheap!			"

												Wow.  From a game from 1997 this game is incredible.  Just from playing  it once, I already  have the urge to go and replay it again.  The different situations that are faced all require different  character builds and may cause the player want to rebuild their character,  sometimes.   Due to the system requirements, this game can be run on a potato; literally.  Because of its replayability, good story, and the fact that it can basically run on any computer; I would highly recommend this game.  Oh and btw cameplay can be a bit tough and confusing so I would highly advise figuring out how to play before you buy.			"

												This game is good but it aged really badly. Its really frustrating and imbalanced. In some moments in can be really dull but sometimes its like they were doing research for hours only to find an answer to one question only to make something smart. The game holds you in a spooky scary climate of despair, loneliness and destroyed world. Basically this game is good but it aged really badly. So unless you are ready for great frustration....

												Personal rating: 10/10Replayability: HighBudget: Worth it if you're a fan only as the game is very old and dated. If you have no knowledge of the game, don't bother throwing a cent at it. Lenght: Unknown. At least a week. Probably more. Fallout is an old classic. If you've played fallout 3 or New Vegas and taken an interest in the series and want to try this, I seriously recommend watching a few youtube vids first, as the game is very old. It's not exactly easy to adjust to a game this dated. That said, even on windows 7, it plays without error. The game will probably remind a lot of people, initially of the more recent fallout games. They seem do have done a great job of passing on the setting. Bear in mind that this is turn-based combat, and top-down view and isometric. It's truly an oldie. The game is crafted with a lot of detail in mind. Each map allows for every single item to be examined, and unlike in more recent RPG's in general, you will not be told when to use skills. There is no tutorial (to my knowledge) but the game isn't super hard to figure out, and if it becomes tricky there are guides on the internet. It's a good holiday project, but hardly a treat for a gamer who seeks a visual challenge and revolutionary gameplay. For gamers interested in gaming history or people in general who can stand playing old games, you will have a chance to experience a rolepalying game that dates to the time when people really knew how to craft a world with eye for detail. Personally I tried fallout when I was a child, having barely a clue what I was doing. I've since stumbled on it again and again with friends who time and time again referred to it as a classic. It truly is.			"

												EDITED (rewritten) : the negative mark is explained below*, but the game is original, good and fun in terms of RPG adventure and freedom of movement.WARNING : once you are aware that the saved games tend to break, you can avoid much frustration.  How: save your current game in many slots and never save in Combat mode (even if there is no actual combat, do not save in that stance or mode).On a technical level, the game is a bit painful, but you can greatly make it more player-friendly and more fun with the version called ""Fallout Fixt"" : independant programmers and modders have combined to allow a much better experience (source: nma-fallout.com ).  For example, the 'Fixt' version allows to control the companions directly (!), pressing ESC closes most windows, etc. * When you sell a game on Steam for 10 $, without giving a warning about a game breaking bug (that can be circumvented), it is not ethical nor honorable.  I am told that the original company no longer exist, but someone is making money now.  Everything can be justified with logic or reason, but I don't accept that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  The game has been improved many times back then, but the game breaking save bug remains (i.e. they could just block the possibility of saving in combat mode for example).  The game is worth it once you know that.			"

												I love Fallout 2 that game rocks and I really recommend playing it if you want to experience what Fallout games, in my opinion, are really meant to be. But Fallout 1... I just can't get into.(tl;dr at the bottom)My problem with Fallout one is the water chip an Item that forces you to go and find it in 150 days. In theory this sounds great, an object that forces you from one location to another in a certain amount of time that makes sure that you aren't straying. But the execution is horrible, I found myself with a crap ton of towns unlocked early into the game. This resulted in me traveling to a nearby one and finding out that a water chip ""apparently"" in a town that is 5 day days travel form where I currently am and resulted in me going there and finding out that there are freaking super mutants in the place in which Im searching for the water chip. So I proceed to turn around and go to the brotherhood of steel which is a 10-15 day travel from where I am as that sounds like a place where I would find a water chip. When I get there I am told to go to ""The glow"" which is 10 days there and 10 days back and retrieve and item. When I do that they let me in, and guess what they don't have a water chip. So now I am sitting at 53 days left as I also made Detours to other towns to do crap.tl;drBut enough rambling I will just get to the point. Fallout 2 was fun because it gave you more freedom and all the the time in the world, as thirteen years is enough to do everything in the game 5X over.Fallout 1 on the other hand, while smaller in scale forces you to play it's pace rather then yours and gives you a small amount of time to do everything. If Fallout one was my first old school Fallout game I would have just dropped the series entirely and never picked it up again.edit:spelling			"

												+ amazingly interesting quests+ great RPG system, perks+ unforgettable soundtrack+ dark, yet humorous+ funny and believable dialogues+ incredible atmosphere+ challenging to beat; not overly hard though+ runs perfecty on modern systems after one fan-made patch- doesn't run perfectly on modern systems without the fan-made patchThe ultimate post-nuclear experience. Forget the F3/NV; Fallout 1 (and Fallout 2) is how the post-apocalyptic world could actually look like.Harshness, seriousness and darkness of the post-apocalyptic world? It's in it.Humour, hyperbole, light tone and pop-culture references? It's in there, without diminishing the serious tone of the game.INCREDIBLE dialogues and your possibilities in it. Great music, fits the atmosphere perfectly. Decent storyline. The number of possibilities on how you could play through this game is uncountable. You can beat this game in 9 minutes 17 seconds (literally, speedrun is on youtube somewhere) or in average 20 hours without getting bored for 1 second. For me it's possibly the best RPG out there.New Fallouts were decent games but sh*t-tier Fallouts. You want to know why is Fallout considered one of the best RPG series ever? Play this (or Fallout 2) and forget the sequels for now.↑ all of this applies to Fallout 2 as well			"

												For all its weeping sores, the best PC game of the 1990s except for Homeworld, and probably the best RPG on Steam. Lots of freedom, likeable characters, an intriguing backstory, a main quest you can straight-up fail, some of the greatest endings in any game, and a gorgeous dark-ambient soundtrack.On the down side, the interface is clunky and slow, especially inventory. NPC sidekicks can be frustrating to work with and will often harm you or each other. (It's not nearly as bad as some clumsy players will tell you it is.) And a few quests can hinge on pixel hunting - not intentionally, but simply because items can be hard to spot against the dithery backgrounds.Be advised that all combat in this game is turn-based. It's fun, but it's NOT optional like you see in Fallout 3 and New Vegas. You will take turns spending action points on a hex grid, every fight. Fallout is a slow RPG. It is not by any definition an action game.Highest possible recommendation.			"

												=--------REVIEW SYNOPSIS-------------=Ah... the classic. It's ancient... very old. Despite that however, Bethesda still shows love to this timeless classic created by Fallout's original makers; Interplay. This is the one that started them all. It hasn't aged well as far as graphics and gameplay goes, but it's true to the RPG format, and one of the original US Turn-based RPGs from the 90s era. It spans the entireity of the Mojave Dersert-region... more precisely, the deserts of the California and Nevada regions. You begin as a Lone Wanderer set upon a quest to restore your Vault-Tek™ Vault's water chip; the sole thing that purifies the disease-ridden, irradiated waters of the surface world so that your vault's inhabitants will have fresh water to drink. It having broken down, you're sent out to find a new one. Along the way, you'll encounter many strange people... and many deadly enemies, not-so interesting companions... but companions none-the-less.=--------PROGRESSIVE POINTS----------=*Elder to the first US-based RPGs*Turn-based (You are free to plan your next move, it could be your last!)*Compatability/Optimized for Windows 7+ Operating Systems*Compatability/Still contains the original version for 98/XP-based Operating Systems*Brutal difficulty (Just how you remember it)=--------CONTRARY POINTS-------------=*Ancient graphical detail*Linear storyline*Limited range of weaponry/gear*Brutal difficulty (No forgiveness for mistakes)*Clunky UI (For what it was back in the day, hasn't aged well IMHO)=--------PERSONAL GAME RESULTS-------=I give this game a 8/10I give this game a [LEGENDARY™ MOLE RAT STEW]			"

												Give the first game of this series a good try - even if it's surpassed by its more than splendid sequels. If you ignore a few annyoing bugs, some unfair battles and and the obsolete inventory/item management you'll experience an ~15 hours long trip like you've seldomly seen before in any other video game. Atmosphere, music, freedom of choices and the character development system stood the test of time and already cult - and even the isometric graphics have their very own charm.A tear of joy will definitely roll down your cheek when you finally defeat the obscure «Master» at the end of the game - how you do that is completely up to you.

												Don't kid yourself, this game is OLD, almost ancient.You should probably only play this if you are a die hard Fallout fan or you're really into post apocalyptic isometric RPGs.You start off with almost no weapons from your Vault. Your mission: Find water. You only have a certain amount of ""days"" to do that (in game the time does not stand still). I don't know what happens if you fail, to be honest.You will have no one holding your hand in this game. No one. You have no quest log (as far as I can tell), you only find out what to do and where to go by talking to people (no, they do not have exclamation marks for quests). They give you missions, directions, intel, etc. These missions will have consequences. If you simply murder stuff or do shady deals and people find out, you get negative karma points and some people will be hostile. That being said, the choices you can make are rather nice, but can also screw you over. There are good walkthroughs out there if you want the optimal way to play, i.e. where to go, who to talk to and how to get the most XP and bottle caps.The latter are the game's currency. Although you do not strictly need them, because everything can be bought with everything. All items in the game have a certain value and you can simply trade them in. However, items also have a weight associated to them, so the bottle caps are definitely worth having. You can, of course, only carry so much (depends on your strength value). However, there is a trick, whereby your companion, which you can hire or not, can seemingly carry an unlimited amount of items. Of course he won't give them back to you for free, but you can steal it from them and they won't complain apparently.Your starting values and skills will be important and you can already mess up the game here. Every now and then you get a level up and can choose a new perk or upgrade one (not every levelup). You can also invest skill points into your various skills, from picking locks, to sneaking, conversation, healing or different combat traits. You can level a skill up to 100%. I would strongly suggest to invest into small arms initially, as most weapons, especially early on are in that category (from pistols to shotguns to rifles). And missing in this game can be your death.Combat is done turn based with action points and initiative. The values are often hard to gauge though. In any case you will usually have some sort of firearm and armor equipped. You can swap weapons mid combat, but it costs action points (AP). Everything costs AP. You can either fire your weapon unaimed, which costs less AP, or aimed. The latter allows you to target specific parts of your opponent. For example shooting and wounding the leg causes monsters to be slower (i.e. lose AP). Shooting the arms may cause opponents to miss more. Shooting the eyes give you a chance of blinding them. And a headshot can potentially do the most damage. Of course your hit percentage depends on your skill with a weapon type and the distance to the target. Funnily enough you can also fire your sniper rifle from point blank range. Generally speaking, the more damage a weapon does, the more AP it requires. You will also have to reload at times, which also costs AP and potentially your whole move. Some weapons also offer other modes of fire. Automatic weapons have a burst fire mode, which costs lots of AP and wastes lots of ammo and should only be used on close targets, but can kill targets quickly and also hurt other enemies nearby. Speaking of ammo. Every weapon in the game uses a different type of ammo, so try to specialise on 1 or 2 weapons, otherwise you will just be carrying around lots of additional ammo, which takes up weight.If you want to and find one you can also hire a companion...you should ♥♥♥♥ing do that. I can't imagine how to win the game without one. Tycho for example has loads of HPs and can fire almost any weapon. Be aware though that there is friendly fire in the game and the friendly AI cannot be controlled or given any orders. They will act on their own and they're ♥♥♥♥ing stupid, so don't stand in the way and try to keep them alive. It doens't help that you can't see their HPs...you can give the AI weapons and they will use whatever they deem best from their inventory.Movement and menus are a pain for modern days to be honest. Combat is ""ok"", but it just has this ""feel"" to it that makes it great somehow.Overall I like the game, though the story in general isn't very good imho. It's the individual people and missions that make this one entertaining.There is no difficulty setting I think, so I would urge you to read some guides on what to do and how to even play the game, because there is no tutorial.

The first game of the amazing series.

The story is about going out in an apocalyptic setting to find a ""water chip"" to replace in their vault.
Venturing off into the Wasteland that everyone is pretty fond of from playing the other Fallout games.
It's a very fun RPG game with the camera movement much like Diablo, although the controls are little more tedious with turn-based clicking combat.

A good game if you're a fan of older games and love Fallout.

Seems Promising, but I haven't gotten to it yet Then why are you reviewing it already??!! Haven't played it much yet, but I plan to after I finish other RPG's like Fallout NV and Star Wars KOTOR. From the little I have played, the Fallout lore is definitely there, and I expect a future playthough to really open my eyes on how ""watered down"" FO3 and NV are. Or maybe not, maybe Bethesda did a good job. Probably not though, since the jump to 3D probably required them to cut lots of content. "

												Thumbs Up!  Best Fallout Ever!  Look at those graphics.  OMGosh!  So Cool!;POk, really!  Why would anyone recommend this?  Well, for a blast from the past.  No mods!  No High Def!  Oh and some pretty tough game play (at least for me).  I picked it up simply for storyline and slight nostalgia.  Which is what I think most players picked it up for.  To complete the set and get that little bit of Lore you always wondered about.  Seriously, buy this game only if you want to experience the classics.  It's like buying Final Fantasy 1 cause you enjoyed 10 so much that you want to know the first game better.  It's a completely different beast but worth experiencing even if you never finish it. Or like playing Pac Man or Pong.  It's a classic worth trying.			"

Replay value?Oy vey!Wait, how do I play it? How do I get past this cave.Fallout 3 is better because I can play it, it's like Call of Duty so it's better. Video games are better when they're accessible, all the best art is accessible to the masses. That's why Transformers is the best movie ever made, goy.TL;DR it's one of the best games ever made are you're probably too stupid and lazy to appreciate it.			"

												This isn't a game, this Is an Experience. :DDon't buy it if you don't like reading, roleplay, using your brain, a challenge, or strategy. The combat really makes you think as opposed to just shooting randomly in big 3D open worlds where everything is a movie and holds your hand. There's no Autosave, sunshine. Welcome to the 90's. If you forget to hit that save button after defeating a horde of deathclaws and get shot a screen over by a bandit, tough Sh*t. Do it again.You'll learn to appreciate gameplay over graphics for once in your close minded life.Unlike the failure Fallout 4, (A blasphemy to the genre and series) there is more to the combat than just meets the eye.Chances are, if you're not a fan of dungeon crawlers, and whine about Nethack and the like as being ""too hard"" (Wah Wah you little baby) then go lower your IQ some more and buy the modern garbage they call video games and stop wasting your time on this classic.This game will wreck you, make you cry and then hug you and give you a cookie. It's not for the faint of heart, and neither is Real life when you think about it.If you think this review is too brutal, that's because this game twice as brutal.Fallout can change a man (but war, war never changes), I used to be as soft as a kitten before playing this harcore Sh*t.

												This fantastic RPG has been in my Steam Library for some time now, and have posessed the desire to dive into it for quite a while. But only a few fays ago did I begin to play, and I have been hooked. So hooked in fact, that even when my save corrupted and set me back a few hours, I felt inclined to redo all that I had lost. I suppose it is feels just that fantastic to obliterate a base full of supermutants with a 40 shot burst minigun. For those who do not enjoy the turn-based style game, this is still highly recommended. It is a different style of combat compared to the modern first person Fallout titles, however it feels just as awesome and immersive to roam the wastelands and destroy the enemy. 10/10 Great GameP.S. Give the controls some time, you will come to understand and enjoy them.			"

												A very immsersive experience from back in the day, Fallout is everything  a role-playing game should be. You've got tons of options in how to customize your character, and can do practically anything. Someone insult you? Give em a bullet to the brain, a verbal smackdown, or a grenade in their pants! The plot is also well told, though requires some exploring to truly understand.All of this, however, is overshadowed by one unfortunate flaw: current computers cannot properly handle it. This leads to many graphical bugs that make it nearly impossible to play. Thankfully, many people on the internet and even here on Steam have come up with solutions. Look around for a mod called Fallout FIXT on the site No Mutants Allowed, and don't  afraid to ask for help!			"

												To begin, I suppose I should say that I originally bought Fallout from Good Old Games, or GOG for short, long before buying that Fallout Anthology. With that said, I can assure you that I have more than the thirty minutes logged than Steam claims I do (at the time of writing).Now, where to begin...Fallout: A Post Nuclear Role Playing Game came out September 30, 1997. At the time of writing, it's just over 18 years old, and still /very/ playable, provided you're willing to /deal/ with outdated graphics. For me, however, graphics have never been an issue, and even today, the sprites are not overly different than some Tactical Role Playing games, or some Turn Based Strategy games.Outside of the graphics, the game is similar to Fallout 3, and Fallout New Vegas. You're SPECIAL stats, along with your Skills, largely determine how you'll play. However, the main difference will be the lack of real time play.Onto the story, this is the game that started everything. Most of the series staples were implemented in this game.The Brotherhood of Steel, New California Republic, Followers of the Apocolypse, even Super Mutants and Ghouls all originate from this game. Never once did I think it was contrived. I genuinely enjoyed this game.			"

												Things I Liked:Good StoryVery Strategy-Centric - hexagonal tiles mean that strategy is keyVariety in weaponsLore is really interestingThings I Didn't:More RTS-like than RPG, although RPG elements are thereThe graphics do not work on modern machines - many graphical glitches on my machineCombat is action point reliant - can be pretty dullGame mechanics are not very well explained - trial and errorOnce you die, you lose your character (may be a welcome challenge for some, but I am not a fan)No autosaves (adds to annoyance of above point)The Fallout series is well known by the gaming community, mainly for Fallout 3 and New Vegas but many have missed the first entry in the series, which can be picked up pretty cheaply on Steam.I had pretty low expectations for this game, being released in 1997 and all, but even so I was honestly disappointed from the get go, when I couldn't boot up the game, and when I did the opening cutscene wouldn't show without rainbows fizzing across my screen.Anyway, as I got into the game these glitches went away for the most part, and I could get onto playing the game, which was difficult without any clues on where to go or how quickly (you are given a time limit to complete the game, by the way). The storyline you follow is dull, although the background information is really interesting, with the end-of-the-world scenario that kicked it all off in pretty much every game since. be prepared though, this information is pretty much shoved in your face every time you talk to anyone. They respond to a two word question with a five hundered word essay, and you have to read it all to make sense of what's going on.The combat is what I thought the Fallout series would excel at, but I was wrong. enemies surround you far too quickly, you have to use 'action points' like a turn based strategy, in fact that's what the combat is, and I find it a hard concept to master.Overall this game is great for its story and lore but not so strong with its combat and mechanics in the modern era. Recommended if you can put up with the flaws of older titles.			"

												Just get it. It runs well and you can beat it in one evening if you really want to. Side quests are not very interesting IMO. No Fallout 2 fun here. Kill a gang, help a gang, kill deathclaws, save Tandi...  I suggest you beat this FAST and move to Fallout 2. That's where the real fun begins. Loved the part where Brohood of Steel sends you into a radioactive hole in the ground 100s of miles away for your initiation mission... just a tip, if you run around in there without RadX you will come out with about 2400 points of radiation. Rad away only removes 25 soooo yah. Brotherhood of Steel are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s =) I suggest you get their power armour and murder em all! Totally justified in my mind.Anyway buy this to marvel at how good Fallout 2 is. If you play this after playing Fallout 2 the game will seem bare bones (and it it is).			"

												The controls aren't initially too bad, especially when you finally master them. Unfortunately, Black Isle Studios didn't have the knack to implement an abundance of voice actors. Truth be told there are only a handful of them in the entire game. Everything else is good old fashion dialogue. Sure, you might here me and other people complain about this. But let's just say, for the shake of this review. I get over the fact the game only has a limited amount of voice actors until Fallout 3. The only major problem I've encountered thus far with Fallout 1 through 2 (including Fallout Tactics) is the despicable combat system. I mean this combat system sucks.. I'm talking atari style combat.. A friendly individual fires first, then a hostile target fires second. It essentially goes back and fourth until one or the other is dead. This is extremely unrealistic, and truthfully. I don't believe there was any excuse for this whatsoever. Take my word for it, I'm a huge fan of the Fallout series; but this is just ridiculous. In closing this message, I want to add the story is of course outstanding. I hope one day they'll consider doing a remastered version of both Fallout 1 and Fallout 2. Preferably with Fallout 4's new creation engine.			"

												This game is the beginning of my favourite series of games ever. I assumed that due to it's age and the companies behind it, that it would be pretty bad and boring, but I was very wrong. This game is full of a fair amount of quests that all have good story to them. The visuals are fine when the HD patch is applied. There is lack of audio in the game aside from the odd sound effect and combat related sounds such as gunshot. The game also has fairly slow paced gameplay and you'd have to be patient to deal with it at times. The game has turn-based combat using a targeting system called ""V.A.T.S."" that works on percentages. The games RPG elements are detailed with many perks and skills to train as well as using speech options that effect how the game plays out.If you're a fan of post-apocalyptic setting, don't mind the dated graphics and slow paced gameplay. This game is for you.12/15 - ""Brilliant beginning to a brilliant series"" "

												Fallout is a controversial came to me because there are many good and bad things about it. It can be genuinely fun, but you have to be willing to overlook a few problems. For one, non-violent character builds (i.e. focus on skills like sneak, speech, science, etc) are pretty much impossible to play for several reasons. A) There are random encounters in this game, which you will get constantly while fast traeveling. Unless you're really, really, lucky, you will get murdered by raiders and scorpions over and over again. B) You will miss out on XP through combat, which will make you way too low level. Secondly, most skills in this game are uneccessary or plainly useless. In order to have fun, I recomend you play the following character. Choose gifted and fast shot as traits, lockpick, science, and small guns as tag skills. Then go with 2 cha, 4 int, 4 str, 10 end, 10 agility, 10 per, and 5 luck. Trust me, just do it.It kind of feels like a let down in that you don't get a lot of freedom to do what you want. This game is very combat-oriented.  Another problem is the graphics. It personally didn't bother me, but I know it can upset some people. If that's important to you, maybe don't play it. Lastly, the game is arbitrarily hard. The first time I saw a mutant, I got blasted to bits in one hit. Make  sure to save often and I recomend playing on easy, because Fallout enemies are super unfair. However, don't let that stop you from enjoying it. There are many good things about it also. What I really enjoyed was the simple fact that no other franchise really makes post-apocalytpic RPGs. The enemies look all mad max style, how cool is that? The setting is really cool, and frankly, underused. I've always maintained that interesting settings *make* RPGs. The story of Fallout is actually pretty interesting, even if it is rather bare-bones. I was also really impressed by the goal of Fallout: you have only 150 days to get a water chip, which your vault needs. You're on your own and you have to figure out where it is quickly. It's almost like a sleuth or detective RPG. If you feel like the good outwieghs the bad, you should try it. It's not a perfect game and I probably wouldn't finish it gain, but it's a unique experience.			"

It personally didn't bother me, but I know it can upset some people. If that's important to you, maybe don't play it. Lastly, the game is arbitrarily hard. The first time I saw a mutant, I got blasted to bits in one hit. Make  sure to save often and I recomend playing on easy, because Fallout enemies are super unfair. However, don't let that stop you from enjoying it. There are many good things about it also. What I really enjoyed was the simple fact that no other franchise really makes post-apocalytpic RPGs. The enemies look all mad max style, how cool is that? The setting is really cool, and frankly, underused. I've always maintained that interesting settings *make* RPGs. The story of Fallout is actually pretty interesting, even if it is rather bare-bones. I was also really impressed by the goal of Fallout: you have only 150 days to get a water chip, which your vault needs. You're on your own and you have to figure out where it is quickly. It's almost like a sleuth or detective RPG. If you feel like the good outwieghs the bad, you should try it. It's not a perfect game and I probably wouldn't finish it gain, but it's a unique experience.			"

												This game is the beginning of my favourite series of games ever. I assumed that due to it's age and the companies behind it, that it would be pretty bad and boring, but I was very wrong. This game is full of a fair amount of quests that all have good story to them. The visuals are fine when the HD patch is applied. There is lack of audio in the game aside from the odd sound effect and combat related sounds such as gunshot. The game also has fairly slow paced gameplay and you'd have to be patient to deal with it at times. The game has turn-based combat using a targeting system called ""V.A.T.S."" that works on percentages. The games RPG elements are detailed with many perks and skills to train as well as using speech options that effect how the game plays out.If you're a fan of post-apocalyptic setting, don't mind the dated graphics and slow paced gameplay. This game is for you.12/15 - ""Brilliant beginning to a brilliant series"" "

												I would say this game is for somebody who likes only running away so far when trying to escape a fight. I like the story behind that game but the last time I played I had just gotten out of the vault's canyon and then was killed by a radscorpian. I will play it again though... Eventually.Edit: Now that I have actually been able to immerse myself in this game and finish it, I can wholeheartedly recommend it. If you aren't used to the mechanics of top-down turn-based games like this, then that may be a little offputting when you're just starting. However, once you get past that, you are in for a very good game. The story is great. Having played the modern Fallout games previous to this one, I can say I wish all of them had as many dialogue chices as this. This game is a true RPG and I believe you should give it a try.			"

												Fallout is a classic Post-Apocalyptic role-playing game that took RPGing to a place other than medieval fantasy lands. It solidified the open-world genre with its highly interactive world and demonstrates an unusual amount of self-awareness.GAMEPLAY: 9/10Fallout is a game about choice. Every decision you make is acknowledged, either by scripted events or with the in-game Karma system. This game lets you do things that no other game would let you do. You can side with the main antagonist, kill children, or even complete the game without killing anybody. It's very big on the role-playing aspect and your stats matter. For example, playing as a character with low intelligence will reduce your character to a grunting idiot. It's not one of those fake RPGs where you just do the same thing over and over until you level up. In fact, grinding is pretty much absent since there are so many unique ways to gain XP. The combat system is decent but not the game's strong point. The game is full of well-written dialogue and complex conversation trees. There are many different paths to take which give the game incredible replay value. Overall, full of great non-linear gameplay. If the thought of not always knowing exactly what to do scares you, just view an online guide and you'll be fine.PRESENTATION: 7/10Fallout's graphics have aged much better than other games of the period due to using pre-rendered graphics. However, despite this, the game is still rather low-resolution and the UI is somewhat clunky. However, the sound design is excellent with great voice actors. The head models used when conversing with important characters are detailed and look pretty realistic for an old game. This game also game has excellent death animations that accurately reflect a weapon's kill power. However if you're squeamish you can change the settings to make it less gory or eliminate blood entirely. The CGI cutscenes also look great too. The music tops it all, however, with an excellent score composed by Mark Morgan.STORY: 10/10Fallout is an excellent example of combining gameplay and story. They are essentially the same thing in this game, as every action you take makes an impact on the plot. With loads of interesting characters Fallout will please fans of quality video game narratives.Overall this game is highly reccomended if you're a fan of intelligent and mature games. You don't need to be particularly intelligent to figure the game out, but you'll find you using your brain a lot more than other video games. A lot of people say it's just nostalgia, but the game was already over ten years old when I first played it, and I loved it. Definitely reccomended if you're a classic gamer or a fan of games that give you lots of choice.			"

												[WARNING: Not a standard review, but rather a guide how to play old games when you first played newer ones, ie. Fallout 3 and New Vegas]This game came out in 1997, when I was only 2 years old. I doubt I was even self-aware back then.It won't be a surprise that I am much into newer games then. However, I like old games too, since I've been a player since I was 3 or so. However, I never had the pleasure to play any games from Fallout series until about, I guess, 2010 or 2011. The first game was Fallout 3 and the only thing that encouraged me to play this masterpiece (with flaws, bit still a masterpiece nonetheless) was the fact Bethesda Softworks made this, and I've been familiar with this company due to The Elder Scrolls. I was already a big fan of Morrowind and Oblivion back then, so I checked on (ie. downloaded it from torrents) Fallout 3, which was great, but also very black-and-white when it comes to story, moralities and taking sides.Then I checked out New Vegas. It was great, and I also noticed that it was more morally ambiguous than Fallout 3. There were much less obvious choices when it comes to what will come out of them next. I read some reviews on both games. Seemed like old veterans of Fallout series liked NV more due to it being more like previous games than Fallout 3. So I figured out that NV is somewhat like first two Fallouts, to some degree.In the meantime, while I was sucked into NV (after I bought legitimate versions of these games on Steam), I was trying to play older Fallouts (these were initially downloaded from torrents as well). Both first and second. I really tried, but couldn't do this because these games were... I don't know. Not outdated, definitely not. But definitely not as ""user-friendly"" as F3 and FNV. These newer Fallouts simply had more intuitive interfaces, prettier locations, simpler controls, beautiful and detailed environments and you could approach these games in many varying styles. Fallout is much more difficult, because you don't have autosaves, interface takes time to learn (especially exchanging equipment and trading), if you can do something, it is much less obvious, because it is a lot simpler to engage in straightforward combat rather than research how you can click on repair and/or sneak or science or whatever, and like Morrowind compared to Oblivion, much of combat isn't based on how skilled you are (ie. the player) at playing games and aiming, but on your character's skills and probability (ie. dice rolls). So it took me several approaches to both games (which took me several months) to try to figure these games out. I was constantly dying, I felt the pressure of time (150 days remaining before you can find the water chip for your Vault, jeez...). It was very hard to bear with.However, several days ago, original Fallouts were on sale. -75% off. Only 5€ for F1, F2 and FT. Would be a sin not to buy them. I bought them, despite the fact I knew it was very unlikely that I'd like them anyday soon.But you know, it's weird, because once you BUY something instead of getting it for free, you feel obliged to try it out even more. You feel like ""for ♥♥♥♥'s sake, I paid money for it, so I MUST COMPLETE THIS GAME!"".And I felt like that too. I still feel like that. It took me several months, but I ♥♥♥♥ING DID IT. I learned how to actually play this game!And I can wholeheartfully recommend it, but only if you know how it is like to play old games or if you are inhumanly persistent.			"

												This game came out in 1997 and it surprisingly holds up to this day. I was afraid I wouldn't like it because of how old it was and that I had played Fallout 3 and New Vegas first but I was completely wrong. It's basically the same as Fallout 3 and NV but isometric. The classic Fallout charm is present in this game with a main story and a few side quests. Though the game seems kinda basic in some areas a lot of the game seems a lot deeper and more indepth than a lot of Modern RPG's. At the time I can imagine this was quite revolutionary setting the standard for RPG's in general.Only once or twice I got fustrated at the game, not due to the lack of direction but due to the logic I was using to solve a problem not working even though I felt like it should. However it turned out the thing I was doing you were actually meant to do later on but I originally didn't try it again until I looked up I was doing it correctly just in the wrong area. Oh well.As I mentioned earlier, the lack of direction is a big thing in this game. The first quest is ""Find the water chip. Here is a place it MIGHT be."" and that's it. It's very satisfying to complete quests because of this as you need to ask around and gather information to solve the quests for yourself.My only complaint with the game is that the combat is unforgiving and can be fustrating at times as you can get instakilled just because of a random critical hit. The accuracy is also unforgiving at times as well especially in skills that you haven' trained as much. It's not that it's stupid it's far too unforgiving for what it is.The bottom line:If you enjoyed the other Fallout games (including 3 and NV) you will like this one.			"

												Fallout 1 is a very ♥♥♥♥ing good game. In fact, it's probably one of the best games of all time, and is definitely the best RPG ever made. Everything from the combat, which still holds up well today, to the dialogue, which is deep and satisfying with many options and even more outcomes, even to the ambient music, is perfect. Though the main allure here is the role-playing. Your stats actually matter (unlike the most recent FO games to an extent). In fact, early game your stats are the only thing that will keep you alive. If you chose wrong or without thinking, you're screwed. There are so many different outcomes to every quest and the game is very narrative-driven, but it still manages that feeling of complete player freedom that Bethesda have sacrificed so much to achieve in the newer games. Really, it's just ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. Go buy it.			"

												Very early RPG by turns.Interesting but, a tad slow and not intuitive.As the very old RPGs, it has a deep story line and not so exciting graphics.Compared to Shadowrun, this one has a complexer turns system, closer to a table game and, it's not linear but, allows you to explore the map and sites in any order.Drawback is that you loose lot of time searching for nothing.But, if you like by turns RPGs, this one was one of its kind and, brook with typical dungeons and dragons ones.

												Very early RPG by turns.Interesting but, a tad slow and not intuitive.As the very old RPGs, it has a deep story line and not so exciting graphics.Compared to Shadowrun, this one has a complexer turns system, closer to a table game and, it's not linear but, allows you to explore the map and sites in any order.Drawback is that you loose lot of time searching for nothing.But, if you like by turns RPGs, this one was one of its kind and, brook with typical dungeons and dragons ones.

												Even today, this game is great. Isometric, turn based combat which actually takes strategy and planning. Its genius is its simplicity. Only problem it faces today is it isn't 100% compatible with newer operating systems, so unless you go into the ddraw.ini file and modify one of the values, you're gonna get screwy colours.EDIT: Since the updates a while back, that last bit is no longer an issue.

												Skip Fallout 3, avoid it like the plague and cancer it is to gaming as a whole. Get Fallout 1, Fallout 2, and Fallout: New Vegas.This one is the most unforgiving of the three. You're on a time limit, certain dialogue options can completely destroy your reputation in some places, resulting in death or simply being unable to continue any further conversation. The atmosphere is great, so is the story. The writing is exceptional, but nowhere nearly as good as Fallout 2 and Fallout: New Vegas. Keep in mind that while the series has always prided itself in player choices, the game kind of feels linear at the start. In fact, the dialogue is so inconsitent that it almost feels like Skyrim. The combat system is also very comfy, just turn the combat speed up a bit so you don't have to sit there for 30 minutes and stare at some cave rat walk across the run while you're trying to run away from it.

												Not as good as the second game.  Much shorter (entire playthru doing everything except grinding random encounters for hours for most is around 20 hrs), and the whole timer thing puts a damper on things.  I play RPGs to avoid quick thinking.  I do that all day.  I like to think out my moves, and the turn based combat in this game allows that.  I like to explore.  I like to take forever to actually dent the main storyline quests.  The timer kills that quite a bit.  I get what they were doing, and that sense of dread was very real.  The writing is solid obviously, Black Isle duh.  I know what the timer was there for, and can appreciate the device it represents.  Any arguments for it are valid, but I am sure glad they took it out in FO2.  Other than that play this game.  If the graphics matter to you don't, also if you are impatient.  The UI is chunky, as it should be.  I actually like it, the whole pip boy novelty is solid.  It takes a few minutes in these games to shed off the expectation of convenience I get from the newer games today.  Not necessarily quest markers, or quest info even, but more ease of operation.  You gotta try things till they work in these games.  I like this.  Takes me  a few minutes to realize, but the wastelands are so harsh, even the game's ui fights you.  The hostility is palpable, and it is entirely worth it.  Who needs fast travel quest marker quests, banging out 5 at a time, when you could literally spend an hour pixel hunting, trying out different skills, talking to npcs, trying anything to avoid having to shoot up the place and make your life a ton harder.  All this just to get that one part you need, to trade for that other one part you need, so the guy who you are getting said part for will just give you bad information.  PLEASANTLY frustrating! :)			"

												I want so bad to give this game a good review. I really do. I like this game, for the most part. But let's be honest here, it hasn't aged well at all. There is a lack of control over your other characters that is just horrible. There's a severe lack of balance in the way damage is delt. The way you interface with the game is probably my biggest problem, it makes the game practically unplayable. Everything is slow and delayed. I'm not recommending this game, don't misunderstand my intentions here. I'm not recommending the game because it's a good game, by 1997 standards. It's a classic, and it runs like a classic, that's been horribly neglected. This game really needs a remaster. A facelift and some adjustments to the controls, some minor adjustments to how your followers interact with you and you'll have something really great. As it stands though I just can't recommend it. It will be more frustration than fun. I do love the depth of the game, it's really great. And if it's on sale grab it, you might enjoy it, otherwise I think I'd look for something else. It pains me to hit the thumbs down button here but as it stands I feel this game provides more frustration than fun. I've spent more time waiting on screens to open and close and waiting on my items to switch than I have actually playing it. Here's hoping for that remaster.			"

												A classic in all regards I must say: gameplay, presentation, and story. Also when it comes to classics, however; an obtrusive control interface and mechanics that don't work in modern times. I've been a big fan of the Fallout franchise for at least 9 years at this point, my obsession starting with Fallout 3. A game that I believe still holds up quite well, same goes with New Vegas (the sort of actual sequel to Fallout 1 and 2). Although 3 and New Vegas have their problems, with their clunky combat system and more bugs than a cabbage field that hasn't been sprayed with pesticide, are what I classify as fun. Fallout 1, is not fun. As I mentioned earlier, it's controls are garbage and hard to get a hold of today and certainly was a niche for certain people back in day (I presume at least, I was born a year after the game came out.) Maybe I'm spoiled, I probably am, but the way you go about ANYTHING in Fallout 1 isn't intuitive in the slightest. Wanna check out that body? Right click mouse over the body, hold the left click down, and then move the mouse down to examine the body. Wanna hack a computer? Click on the red button at the far right of your interface and click ""Science"" and you'll get a yellow crosshair. Mouse the crosshair over the computer and HOPE you hack it. Hacking/lockpicking/any sort of skill check is asinine. You never get any indication of how tough a skillcheck will be unless you try to bash your head against it until you break the lock, get locked out of the computer, or magically it works. Combat I'm very split on. When you don't break your gun, drop your weapon, stab yourself, or miss, combat can be decent at times. Although even in a full suit of power armor, you can magically get one shotted by super mutants because...because. Fighting in enclosed locations is a hassle as well, since sometimes you can't see what position your enemy is at so sometimes your shot may be blocked so you have to use up precious action points to get an angle on them. Companions are also a detrement in combat, since they can miss and end up shooting you, getting a critical hit, and kill you. Thanks Ian. Other times they bug out if they run out of ammo, and ditch their gun. Even after giving them extra ammo, they never reverted back to their guns and only used a knife or just never ever fought any enemies ever again. I had to make 5 characters because each time I ran out of the very stupid time limit that's forced on you at the start of the game. Oh about that, this game is an semi-open world RPG with a TIME LIMIT. You have 150 days to get a water chip for your vault or else it's instant game over. 150 days sounds like a lot, but it really isn't. You'll use up those days trying to find a god damn piece of rope you need to travel down another vault to get said water chip. At least once you get the water chip, the time limit is gone. Looting is a pain if you're running with laser weaponry too, since you end up vaporizing your enemies who drop all their goodies on the ground. You have to individually mouse over items to pick them up, and sometimes items are so small, you miss them. I had to reload a save that was hours back, just to get a item I needed to complete the game with.tl;dr/wrap upFallout 1 can be fun at times. Most times however, it isn't fun at all. It's aged poorly, has a terrible interface, and has really dumb, easy to miss plot crucial items. It's neat to see where the series started, but I'd stick with any of the newer games.			"

												This is not like Fallout 3 or New Vegas. This game is tough especially for people who are not experienced in cRPGS. With that being said, this game is enjoyable- i clocked in about 25 hours. This game has many problems - bugs, broken and cut quests, outdated graphics(even with highrez mod), not fully fledged or connecting dialogue, outdated gameplay mechanics, having to optimize this game for your comp by yourself(THANKS STEAM...) and my main gripe that this game feels to me a beta for fallout 2 which most people say is the superior between the two.I feel this game gets the classic nod, because of what it brings to the western rpg genre  - a unique rpg system with perks, special stats and skills which affect the world around you, ambigous morality, interesting setting and lore, great story line, fairly good dialogue, random encounters.AS a person who's first fallout game was New Vegas, i felt really out of place when i first dl this game. Its really difference and theirs a learning curve to it.This game is old and outdated - this is true no argument about that. So it will affect my final score.My Score system: 10/10 is a perect, 5/10 is average, and 0/10 Horrible.This game is a 7/10, a good game. It should be played if your a fallout fan and have never touched this old cRPG classic. "

												In my original review of fallout i praised the game for having many different ways to accomplish things, (which i still stand by)  and being an overall fun time, but playing the game more i felt large amounts of frustration starting to build up within me. To put it simply after the first half of the game  i started to hate it.It instantly turns into a cliche kill these bad guys because they're bad kind of story, all i could do was roam around the wastes until i found the brotherhood of steel who ask you to do a quest then seem to let any old person into their base. I then talked to someone and had to go kill super mutants at their base and they had machine guns and rocket launchers that could one shot me.So far in the game i have used one weapon as an unarmed character which are brass knuckles and i have yet to find anything better which really irritates me. I now don't actually want to play it anymore as all i do is die to overpowered weapons and have no clear indicator of where to go or what to do, ( i don't dislike games that don't hold your hand, heck i love dark souls to bits and it does not hold your hands by any means).And now i sit here, and in all honesty only buy this game if you like the fallout franchise or older RTS games, and even then you might struggle to enjoy it.

												Well, at least I can tell myself that I tried. After hearing around the whole internet that this game was definetly better than Fallout 3 and on, I decided to buy it. I was sure that the game would have some pretty bad graphics and what not, but personally I don't mind old games and bad graphix at all. What a game should have, its value. A game with a good story, a good gameplay. and a good fluidity , it's a good game. Fallout 1 only gets the story characteristic right. Yes, the story is amaing, and t gets the feeling and atmosphere right. It was amazing to get inmersed into the wasteland for the first time, but, that's about it. Honestly, even modern Fallouts get this right. The problem with this game is the gameplay, and the pacing. My god.    The gameplay is horrible. It is so slow, and ridiclous, that it makes it boring. It's basicaly a point and click battle system, with enemies that deal ridiculous damage and never miss, while you are too weak and are constantly missing.   It never made me feel good, like an RPG usually does, about getting stronger with EXP., and then tackling the stronger enemies and achieving victories. Why? cause, and this is the best part, at the beginning of the game, you have a stupid time limit. You can't go around exploring the wasteland and getting stronger at your own pace! Nope. You need to hurry and finish part of the main quest with as little moves as possible, so you don't get a game over. If you are like me and you don't like looking up things at google to solve games, then you'll probably have to start over from scratch more than once to figure out what to do to solve this problem. It's just not fun. Anybody that likes this game is because they feel nostalgia. That's it. The game itsef is garbage, quite honestly. Every single character is shallow, except for the final boss, and the side-quest are crap. If you lived in the 80's and 90's this game would've been mind blowing. Today, it's crap.			"

												This game for me is terrible , its probably because I don't really play alot of RTS games , I don't mind slow combat , but this is made bad in fallout because you ue action points which limits your attacks but it also makes opening your inventory minus action points , and also it uses turn based combat and not real time strategy combat.One thing that also bugs me is the time limit , i know they added this because it would make no sense if there was not a time limit in this situation , but it limits what you can do , like collect all the weapons and those weapons cost an arm and leg.Luckily the rest was ok good story , awesome perk system and how your choices change the game.

												I missed this in 1997.  While the story telling might have been top at the time, judging by the 9/10 scores it got back in the day, the quest system is just abysmal.  In a year that saw Postal, Age of Empires, and Total Annihilation top the charts, I just don't see how Fallout got the praise it did.  Maybe it was the customizable character advancement, which I admit might have been unique at the time.  But it just hasn't aged well.  X-COM was infinitely better and it was released 3 years prior.

												Tried hard to get into it. The gameplay is very hard to try and get compared to modern games. Sure I would of loved it when it came out but it is very hard to play nowadays.			"

												Hey, we need the water chip or we're gonna die. Sounds good, let's send out this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ scrub that can't land a single hit on anything, ever, even if it's standing directly on top of him. Sounds good			"

												The short version would be for you to get an upgraded experience from Fallout 2 and read about this one on the wikipedia or something.So this game has a lot of fan boys... This game suffers from serious gameplay drawbacks that make it more frustrating than fun. Like seriously I think a 5 year old could have designed better math models for the hit percentages in this game. Seriously, I had VATS 87% chance to hit then shoot and miss 18 times in a row. Guess what game... that's not an 87% chance. Now if this happened once or twice, ok that's one thing, but this is a constant fight the game puts you against for no reason.Next is the criticals... worst experience with them ever. After the first quarter of the game they will be the only enemy attack that will kill you. The normal attacks will hit you for 0 HP continuously, but then a mole rat will crit you for over 110 HP. The last boss is a perfect example of this. Him and his Super Mutants regular damage 0 HP lost, then a critical 200 HP lost. Your life will depend on a critical attack every turn of every encounter. Dreadul to a mathematical power of 50.Then there's a mixture of feelings when it comes to the stories and plot in the game. The NPC's are pretty deep and well planned out. They offer information on the world, and allow you to see a sort of cultural element to the Wasteland. I liked this alot, and the locations you do get to visit are unique and inspiring. Yet in the end they are far to sparse to really feel connected to. Then the map... oh god the map... You will waste most of your time traveling into areas that will never lead to anywhere. Then in a moment you will realize that 80% of the map is dead, worthless space. Thanks for wasting my time game walking through desert fighting mole rats for absolutely nothing.These combinations of bad gameplay make this a terrible game, but a great story. That's why I recommend reading on this one then moving to the second one. Nearly all of the problems in gameplay this faces are rectified in the second. Making Fallout 2 a much better choice for your money.			"

												I play original game back 1997 and entire experience was flawless. However, its not the case with the current updated version of the game. Some thing had been change, like voice add ons and extra items in order to complete mission in a different way. And of course no one test it for buggs cause game keeps on crushing time after time somewhere 5h into it. Giving me errors like ""The instruction at 0047b6ac referenced memory at 00000069 The memory could not be read from Click on OK to terminate the application""Its very unfortunate, why update something which was not broken? Why not test it to see if it actually works. And why sell defective product?			"

												Okay, no offense to people who like this game, but I can't stand Fallout 1. There are a lot of things that are just... bad. I don't like the combat, the movement system, the conversations, the artstyle, the HUD, the map system or the interaction system. Simply put, Fallout 1 may have been great for its time, and spawned a successful franchise, but it hasn't aged well. At all. Unless you knowthat you will absolutely love this game, don't buy it. Again, no offense to anyone that likes this game, but this is my take on the matter.			"
