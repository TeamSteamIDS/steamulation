												A game involved with Norse mythology, inspired by classic adventure games with a female protagonist.A greatly enjoyable story, it has kept me hooked giving me optional quests with alternative solutions.Battling monsters, solving puzzles and saving the world!You start off with choosing between 3 classes: Warrior, Sorceress and Rogue. Or have a mixture to your liking.The game contains superb music and dialogues, mostly voice acted along with nicely done character portraits. There is also another feature I quite like in the game, was the realism feel to when your character gets cold or hungry. How it effects her during the game, giving you more of a challenge whilst playing. But there is a choice to to turn down the difficulty if you didn't prefer it.This does bring me back memories when I use to play Kings Quest.Thank you to all the developers for this amazing free game!

												I really like this game a lot.  I'm a fan of the old Sierra/LucasArts games, and I loved the Quest for Glory games.  I thought this would be sort of a cheap, junky fan-based hack of Hero's Quest (the original version of the first Quest for Glory).  Boy was I wrong.  Sierra would have been proud to publish this back in the day.It is an homage to Hero's Quest, for sure, and derives its inspiration from it, but it really does interesting things with the formula, and maybe most importantly of all, it's really high-quality.  The music is great.It's free, so you have nothing to lose by giving it a try.  I thought I'd find it merely entertaining, but I actually really like it a lot.			"

												Why hello stranger. If you love the ol' Sierra, Lucasart sytle of games then you are right at home son!  Pull up a chair and let me tell you  a tale of what you might miss if you don't check Heroine's Quest out.First of all.... Are you being a skeptic? Are you natuarlly wondereing why this game is free?Well granted most greedy software publishers always have their hands out before you can play their game, well not this game, no sir.  The developers and Crystal Shard simply wish for us games to enjoy some damn fine awesome ""free"" gaming. There is no micro-transactions or DLC here, and the developers are not making a single penny for this game. The developers and Cyrstal Shard should be praised for the type of product that they delivered because this game delivers a  high quality game. This game has voice acting, and a beautiful soundtrack. So why are you still reading this? Go install it right now my friend, and taking a few minutes to give thanks to the nice people that gave us this for free.			"

												An incredibly good throwback to the old Sierra Hero's Quest aka Quest For Glory games. In many ways this game is better than any of the originals. The combat is better and the addition of extra quests gives more reason to explore the world. It's challenging and charming with great writing and luscious scenery. A very likeable production.I can't believe such a labour of love is free of charge.			"

												Heroine's Quest: The Herald Of Ragnarok is a independent roleplaying game developed by Crystal Shard and published by Screen 7. The title is set in a fantasy realm and tasks your character, a burgeoning young adventurer, with saving the world from an ancient evil bent on bringing about Ragnarok and thus ending the world as we know it. As with most classic R.P.G.'s you choose your character class, there are three to pick from in this title, and as your character levels up you gain experience points for whichever abilities you use frequently like the old saying ""the more you do something the better you get at it"". The story in this game is quite entertaining and chock full of viking lore and mythology. The gameplay and combat while simple are both quite fun and highly addictive. You'll die time and time again and scream to the heavens that you'll never play this @#$%& game again only to boot it up two hours later. There are many types of unique adversaries to battle and puzzling puzzles to solve. The dialog and voice acting is top notch. You'll converse with people and creatures which could terrify you or make you laugh your pants off with the strange and sometimes hilarious things that they say or do. The title has a great immersive feel to as it applies a timescale of morning, afternoon and evening to the questing. Your character also must feed herself, can suffer from exposure due to the harsh climate and needs sleep or rest to remain healthy just like in real life. The sound and music in this title are terrific and definitely capture the feel of the game perfectly. If you're perceptive enough you will also get a kick out of the many pop-culture references and game developement jokes humorously sprinkled about the title...some of which will make you laugh out loud. The developers certainly aren't afraid to laugh at themselves or anyone else. This game is just fantastic and I am having so much fun playing it and one really great thing is that it is free which is shocking because I would have gladly paid for this amount of entertainment. If you're a fan of old-school roleplaying games, retro-games or just crave a great adventure title then you will not be dissapointed with this wonderful independent gem. One more thing to add, many people say that this title plays like the old ""Quest For Glory"" series of games which I myself am not familiar with but I think this game plays like Skyrim...if Skyrim had come out in 1991.

												*****Winter Has Come*****Finally, this game came to Steam and I am sure many people might be puzzled why such a game with a solid manual accompanying it appeared in Steam. Is it a promo? Perhaps a conspiracy? Maybe Valve is buggy? Absolutely not! I have played the game far before it hit Steam, and I'll say it is a real deal.Ladies and gentlemen, this game is a geniune point&click adventure game in the spirit of old Quest for Glory Series. The inspiration and some mechanics will be familiar to the people who played those games...but you will see it is actually far better then those old games. Let us see what we have in the pot.First of all, you are playing a Heroine who was travelling to city of Fornsigtuna gets ambushed by an ettin (two-headed giant). But thanks to luck, they are unable to eliminate their target. And from there, your story of heroine-ism starts (of course, your first task is to find some food, naturally)! I should say, playing the game from Heroine perspective adds quite a spice to the game, signifying that the game will be quite different then Quest for Glory games we know.You can choose from three different kinds of classes with their own unique approach to both main quest and side quests. As well as by buying some cross-class skills you can spice up your game even further...but do not rely on that too much. Three classes are Fighter, Mage and Thief. I would suggest you to take a glance at the manual for the explanation of skills&such which may come in handy.The dialogues are fully voiced and there is no shortage of interesting characters...where I'd like to refrain mentioning them for the time being. But one major thing you will notice is this: When a character is at the presence of another, the dialogue lines may differ or other character can add a comment of his own...which makes the dialogue system even richer then it already is. Aside that, several minigames (wizard challenges, gambling with Fornsigtuna locals etc) add to the charm of this game. One major point is the survival. Yes, you have to eat food to survive and on top of that you have to find a way to keep yourself warm...since it is Fimbulwinter...it is more crucial then ever. Since there are several ways to skin a cat, there are several ways to survive. By the way, as you might see the game features a solid inspiration by Norse Mythology...so prepare to meet several characters and events which has a part over there.You will not regret playing this game. Ragnarok awaits you!			"

												If I could recommend this twice, I would.I grew up in the Sierra games era.  A beautiful time to be a gamer.  Truly.   This game is quite the King's Quest homage. If you enjoyed the awesomeness of Sierra's point-and-click adventures, get this game.  You will have ZERO regrets. LOVE IT.(PS:  As I was corrected, it is more a homage to the Quest for Glory series but if you enjoyed any of Sierra's point-and-click adventures, you will NOT be disappointed!)			"

												More fun than I've had with most games I've paid for in recent years (so I dropped them a donation - it's only fair!)The only downside while I was playing is that I felt cross-class solutions were not handled nearly well as in the original Hero's Quest series. You could take cross-class skills, but you most likely couldn't use them because of lacking OTHER skills, or wouldn't be allowed to solve puzzles with them. That may have changed since. I still have a lot left to explore with other playthroughs.But anyway, if you like old-school Sierra games and you haven't played this yet, WHY NOT??			"

												Wow.I am an old time player of adventure games, but just like many other games around.I must say:This game is so well made.It is much beyond Quest for Glory in many areas, while keeping its many qualities.Not only a remake, but a large improvement.All this gme is free?I can't believe it.At least I am sure the episode II will be well sold ;)- Character Creation is very interesting and opens many possiblities.- There seems to be a real adventure roleplaying engine involved ; ""Quest for Glory"" seems to be perfected.- Pixel art is very well made.- Gorgeous and epic music.- Nice scripting and storytelling ; it feels like a good game master is in the room.

												Imagine a old point-and-click game, now add equipment, stats and skills and you've basically got Heroine's Quest. It's hard not to recommend since it's FREE.EDIT 2: Just finished the game. Took me 28 hours! And I didn't do everything I could since my score was only 455 out of 500.EDIT: I've played some more so I can give a bit more indepth comments. I'm going to talk mostly about the RPG aspects since the adventure (ie: point & click) genre is pretty well known. Just think of Monkey Island or any other adventure game and add this:There are 3 classes you can choose: Warrior, Sorceress and Rogue. Each class starts with different stats (Strength, agility e.t.c.) but also different starting skills such as Sorceress starts with Herbalism and Rogue with Sneaking. By spending 25 skill points (you start with 50) you can learn a new skill at the beginning of the game or you can increase your stats. So the warrior class can start with the magic skill which enables her to cast spells. As far as I know you can only get new skills when you start the game so if you don't know herbalism when you've started you will never know it. Which adds replayability.Speaking of replayability. Different classes have different solutions to puzzles and side-quests. So while a Sorceress can save someone that is freezing to death in the middle of the forest by casting Flame aura on him a warrior or rogue have to find some other way to save him. I also believe you cannot do everything (side-quests, areas, puzzles) with just 1 playthrough. But each class can get a maximum of 500 points, you know those you get by solving puzzles in adventure games. Nothing to do with leveling up stats. So every class can do equally much although different things.The leveling up mechanics work similar to Morrowind and similar games. By using a skill or attribute you have a chance of increasing it. So if you're carrying a lot or using a melee weapon in combat you have a high chance of increasing your strength.The combat in the game is quite unique. You use the qweaf keys to attack, I am a Sorceress which means w = staff attack, e = Magic Missile, d = Flame Aura. zxc is used for dodging, z = dodge left, x = duck (uses a lot of stamina), c = dodge right. 1234 keys is used for special attacks but I don't currently have any.The actual combat is real time and while you can't move around you have to know when to dodge and when to attack. Different enemies have different attacks obviously and they can dodge your attacks as well. While you can find a couple of silver coins or mead on a bandit don't expect them on a varg (basically a evil wolf). But if you know Animal Ken (I think) and have daggers you can skin them.Unlike other RPGs / adventure games you can freeze to death, starve e.t.c. in this game. Yes, you actually have to eat and sleep! Depending on what skills you know how you get your food will be different. Don't expect to succeed at fishing if you don't know Animal Ken, likewise don't expect to find edible roots if you don't know herbalism. The game also has a day / night cycle which affects where characters are, if a shop is open or not, enemies, for instance trolls get turned to stone by sunlight so if you want to find one then wait until nightfall.Finally this is a truly free to play game. There is no microtransactions of any kind. So if this sounds like a game you would enjoy there is no reasons not to try it.			"

												This is a full-length, fully-animated, fully-voiced, fully-indie, fully-AGS, fully-awesome and fully-awarded point & click adventure game! Featuring Norse mythology, funny dialogs, funny references, funny characters, real time combat, original puzzles and multiple possibilities of getting things done. All in a wonderful 320X200 resolution screen with a glorious pixel-art style. This is a game about humor, and eventually about honor. If you are a Quest for Glory fan, you will probably ask: HOW IS ALL THIS FOR FREE? But think about it. The real question is this: Why do we pay for games? As one of the characters in this game would say: One doesn’t make a master-piece just to sell it, but because it has to be done. I feel like the makers of this game just had to do it, and it is a work of love. You won’t find anything like this for a very long time.			"

I have to say it is just a very refreshing game which brings back memories from playing D&D and older RPGs. From a design point of view it is well programmed and though out, well written and the attention to detail is wonderful! PLUS IT'S FREE!

												Why does this game exist all of the sudden? I have no idea. Why is it free? Still clueless.What I do know is that whoever made this game was very passionate. Nearly every single object in this game can be talked to, interacted with, and looked at all with humrous consequence; the game chiding your every stupid move. Not to say that this makes it a good game, but it's one of the many clear indications that the developer put a lot of time into the title and didn't want to make any action you could possibly do feel simple or redundant.Not just an adventure game, it's also a straight up Western RPG. The NPCs are deep and the fighting mechanics are simple yet refined. Given that I haven't played any other point and click rpgs in my life, (such as the Hero's quest series that the game is based off of) I don't know how it compares; but I've enjoyed what I've seen so far.

												Fans of the classic adventure games by Sierra will be right at home when playing this. Taking heavy inspiration from the Quest for Glory Series (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quest_for_Glory) that was released throughout the 90s the game doesn't fail to live up to it's high standards.The story is pretty straight forward and once again pays homage to the Quest for Glory series. Like in the older title you are a hero(ine) who is suddenly stranded in a foreign land and then forced to deal with impending doom. The story takes many twists and turns along the way and is intricately crafted to keep you on your toes.The gameplay is equally inspired. You have a choice of three character classes to chose from when you start. Each class has their own unique traits and skills. The enjoyable part is, much like the classics, each obstacle you face can usually be solved in different ways. Magic, brute strength, or sleight of hand can be used to accomplish each task differently.  Conversational options can also change the required task. This creates the chance for a varied play through and replayability. The combat is the Quest for Glory series was never it's strong point and it's not the strongest point of this game either. It does get the job done though and isn't a turn off.The music and sound effects and crisp and enjoyable and fits the atmosphere of the current screen well. The voice acting is excellent if somewhat varied in it's quality.The artwork is amazing. It represents the 90s game style perfectly. Backgrounds that look like they could have been hand painted fit together well and make the world feel well put together. The sprite work is clean and well executed. The portrait pictures for the characters are interesting and give a face to what would otherwise be a handful of pixels.All together the game is simply amazing, especially  for something that is offered for free on Steam. If you're the person who feels adventure gaming hit it's peak in the 90s and misses the feeling those games give you this one will be exactly what you want. It feels like a game that was made by Sierra in that era and simply unearthed later. If you've never played the classics then I still recommend you give this one a shot. Then after you complete this one I recommend you check out some of classics that inspired it and run through the entire Quest for Glory series.			"

												Summary: Quest for Glory in MidgardMultiplayer: NoCompletion: 16 hrsCards: Yes - must craft or receive boosters, buy from the market or trade to obtainCloud: NoThe Quest for Glory series by Sierra were basically adventure games with RPG character development and combat tacked on. Imagine King's Quest but with the ability to fight foes in actual combat instead of dying every five seconds to the environment. Heroine's Quest takes much of its inspiration from these series of games and adds a few mechanics of its own.Right away you'll notice the generous use of norse mythology, even hinted in the game's subtitle. The decision to have this set so directly in norse mythology feels somewhat odd to me. Rather than creating its own mythology that's inspired by real life mythology, this one references it directly and loosely retells those stories. It's not a bad thing - Disney does that all the time. But this one feels a tad out of place. There's some good humor here and there. The squirrel is great. I enjoyed the Tetris game over. I feel it could use a few more laughs though. Roughly 80% of the characters are intensely serious, and they don't quite gel in a world that has silly characters like Aurvandel.The art and music is fantastic. The game world feels somewhat barren, but this is more a fault of the genre, as many adventure games tend to include many screens with little interactivity. I would have liked more items sprinkled on the ground that you could pick up.The hunger/survival mechanic is strange at best. Adventure games generally reward you for exploring. Heroine's Quest instead punishes you for straying too far, or taking your time. Because of the survival gimmick, the puzzle-solving seems to take a backseat because you're always pressed for food and warmth. Thankfully you can shut this feature off, but I did try to play it as intended and did not find it increased the fun factor at all.The combat system is pretty simplistic. It's one-on-one real time combat with menu inputs, much like the QFG1-3. Nothing special, and not irritating. It's just there.Most of the game is voice acted, which is rare for indie adventure games. Huge thumbs up for that! Most voices are good, though Hervor sounds curiously tired and disinterested. I get that there's a deadly winter, and everyone is at their wits end, but I would have liked a more likeable character to wake up to first thing than her.The map is greatly appreciated! This also gets a huge thumbs up. That is definitely something missing from just about every adventure game.Perhaps the most striking feature of this game is the fact that it is free! Try it out. You've got absolutely nothing to lose but time. The sheer amount of work that must have gone into it cannot be understated. I enjoyed it enough that I believe it deserves a donation. I give this game a 8/10EDIT: Fixed card info thanks to TrickZZter			"

												First off, this game is free, so you lose nothing but time if you try it out and don't care for it.  However, if you're a fan of the old-school point-and-click games of yore, and pine for the days of Sierra like I sometimes do, this will be right up your ally.  You do need patience, as it's slow going traversing the map, but that's the nature of the beast.  Battle vargs, troll, brigands and more as either a warrior, rogue or spellcaster, and save the world from Ragnarok.The only thing I don't care for is how they've made the need for sleep and shelter function.  You can turn it off (good! I don't like bothering with those types of things), but that also puts the game in the easiest mode for all battles, too (bad, so far the fights I've encountered have been too easy on this setting.)  The solution is to play fast and loose with the difficulty setting; I have it on a more difficult setting until the game indicates I'm going to die of exposure (for crying out loud, put on more than a cloak! what is with people underdressing for the weather in games?!) or hunger, and then I turn it down and continue on with that setting until I eat, sleep or find somewhere warm to recover.Don't let that put you off, though.  It's a terrific little game and honestly, I feel like they're doing themselves a disservice by giving it away; I'd have paid for it.  In any case, give it a try. I'm thoroughly enjoying it and highly recommed it.			"

												As a long-time fan of the Quest for Glory series (and all of Sierra's adventure games)I have to say this game is outstanding. Everything about it is well-thought-out -from the skill set (which is actually meaningful), to the music, the character art and speech...Not to mention the very cool quests and puzzles, game logic, vast world lore and the story itself...and even the combat system is pretty good, even though it's not as fun as QFG2 remake's combat system.I had an amazing time playing this over and over, and I shall find myself replaying this many times more in the future.That's a sign of a great game.

												This game should be more popular!It's hard to believe this game is free. You can tell how much love has been put into everything about it, from the backgrounds and soundtrack to the humor and easter eggs. It's just phenomenal, and I feel like they could've been selling it for 15 bucks. It's also weirdly educational! Many, if not all of the characters in this game are based on characters from the Poetic Edda and the Prose Edda. I had to look up ""Andvari's ring"" (which, trust me, you will also want to look up if you ever get it) and learned more about Andvari. Then I learned more about Snorri. Then I went ""wait a minute, let me look up some more characters"" and ended up learning about Volund and Hervor, Sigurd and Brynhild, Liff and Lithrasir, etc etc, Thrivaldi, Skrymir, and even Ratatosk lol so now I know way more Norse mythology than I did before. So definitely check the game out! I highly recommend it, especially if you're into oldschool Sierra games like the Quest for Glory franchise.			"

												As someone who loved the old Sierra games of King's Quest and Quest for Glory, this was a wonderful retro romp into my childhood.  This game is lovingly created to honor these old games, and to create an all new journey and world for us to play.  I absolutely adored this game. It had me laughing and grinning all the way through at the jokes, the easter eggs, and just plain good fun that this game was made with. I recommend it to anyone who ever wanted another one of those old adventure games, or anyone who just loves a good puzzle game.  There is a lot of replayability as you can solve the puzzles in many different ways depending on what you do and what class you play.  There is just so much to enjoy in this game that I could go on for hours, and I have to my own friends. Two thumbs way up and I rather hope they create a sequel so I can play more in this world.			"

												I never played free games. In my mind, terms ""free game"" and ""piece of trash"" were equivalent to each other.I was wrong.Heroine's Quest is not perfect, there are some flaws but, despite everything, I think that it is one of the best point and click quests I had played for many years. And, first of all, I must mention that Heroine's Quest looks like direct homage to famous classic game Quest for Glory and, maybe, this is the best recommendation that I can give to this game. So, what Heroine's Quest can offer?Storyline. It is simple and does not offer unexpected twists. There are ""evil guys"" and you need to fight them, and that is all. The charm of Heroine's Quest lies in excellent, well-developed and cleverly intertwined side-quests with a lot of different ways of solving. Unlike most point and click quests, this game can be played several times, and it will be quite different experience. I can not remember a lot of point and click quests with such good replayability! Also, Heroine's Quest contains a huge amount of humor, irony and ""easter eggs"". Game tells you about saving the world, but does it with ironic smile, and I really loved this narration.Characters are excellent. They are fully voiced, each character has his schedule and moves between locations, and most importantly - depending on situation, dialogues with them may be very different. Do not expect, for example, that people will want to spread gossip about the jarl, when he walks nearby. Many dialogs contain tips and hints, so I advise you to listen carefully. Game rewards player for exploring, look around curiously, so you can find a lot of useful things and interesting information.System of skills is quite simple, but well developed. I can not say that all skills are equally useful, but they provide a good variety. Combat is an arcade mini-game, which seems not too difficult, but boss-fights can bring a lot of trouble for player, especially if you play on high difficulty. Well, and if you like mini-games, do not forget to visit tavern at evening, drink some mead and play dice with locals.Well, as I said, in my opinion there are some flaws in this game. Lets see...First of all, there are so-called ""survival elements"". It means that your character need to eat, sleep and not freeze. At first glance it seems like an interesting mechanics, player need to manage resources and plan travels. In fact, neither hunger nor cold nor need for sleep, does not add any complexity to the game. In very first hours player can get access to unlimited amount of food, and all this ""surviving"" quickly turns into tedious and boring process ""once again, travel to the city just to sleep and eat."" It is just waste of time. Of course, you can play on low difficulty, so you will not have to worry about food and sleep... but enemies also become weaker. You want to fight with strong enemies, but do not want to waste time searching for food and place for sleep? Unfortunately, this is not possible.Grind. Player can raise skills of character by using these skills, so... you can fight enemies for hours, or climb the same cliff again and again, just to raise appropriate skills. Well, grind is not necessary, but on hard difficulty it will make life easier.Fast-travel. In fact, there is fast-travel in game, but it is not available from start, and player need to find it. So, you will travel through empty locations again and again, in my opinion it is just more wasting of time.Hidden statistics. There is a parameter ""honor"", it is hidden and player can not track what actions affect this parameter. ""Honor"" can be quite important - depending on your style - and if you want to have a high level of honor, it may be very difficult to manage it.Despite all these flaws, I literally fell in love with Heroine's Quest. I had seen a lot of bad games that cost a lot of money, and it is a good game of very high quality, which is distributed for free. True miracle! If you like point and click quest in old-school style - try Heroine's Quest. Hey, in any case you will lose nothing!			"

												If you dug the old Quest for Glory / Hero's Quest series from Sierra, you should definitely take this gem for a spin.  It's got the look, it's got the lore (deliciously Norse this go 'round), it's got the feel, it's got the puns.  It's even got voice-acted speech.  It's even got a hidden game of Tetris.  It's also got what's probably my favourite combat system in a QfG game.  All told, Heroine's Quest is every bit worthy of a spot in the realms of Gloriana.Now if only that wizard were more Erasmus-like...			"

												Why is this game free? I don't know. It's not a demo. There are no F2P gimmicks either. It's truly a labor of love.So now that we got that out of the way, this is a great game. The gameplay, setting, and characters are deeply nostalgic for Quest for Glory, King's Quest, and old-school Sierra adventure game fans. The gameplay has actually taken a few modern design sensibilities to heart, adding more combat complexity and skill improvement notifications. The rich Norse setting is brought to life with colorful, interactive 2D backgrounds. While this game has a bit more text to pour through than the old Sierra games, I feel that most of the fully voice-acted characters have interesting personalities, and more conversation options are unlocked as you discover more of the world. The only thing I miss is QFG4's sardonic narrator making fun of you for trying to use a shovel on a tree--the text is there, but a voice would be more enjoyable.I would have easily paid $20-30 bucks for this well-polished game, even though I am a miserly Steam-sale-only buyer. It must be the nostalgia factor. Rest assured, however, that if you liked Skyrim or Fallout, and you too Want To Be a Hero, there is also something mysterious and playful here to discover. Check out The Heroine's Quest, then to satisfy your appetite for more, check out Quests for Glory 1-4. QFG2 was remade, and you can download it for free here: http://www.agdinteractive.com/games/qfg2/ "

If so try this ""now"".Nostalghia aside, this is a great game that the free price tag does not make it justice.It's an adventure with great puzzle & exploration elements, as well as some pretty good story in a Nordic setting.Don't be alarmed by the Pixel graphics, this is one experience that you will hardly forget after finishing it.And it also holds replay value since the 3 characters can finish the game by solving puzzles in so many different ways.Some achievements are practically impossible to get though.Recommended, especially for adventure/puzzle fans.

												Heroine's Quest is a GREAT adventure game, along the lines of the older King's Quest, and (more obviously) Quest For Glory games. HQ has some of the best features of adventure games, asking you to solve riddles, inventory puzzles, and environmental puzzles- if you're stuck, you probably haven't revisited every location available.It also has a very satisfying RPG element with skills and attributes (related to the class you choose) which directly affect how you solve problems and how your story plays out. I played this before it came out on steam, so hours played aren't accurate. You will take a fair chunk of hours to finish this (especially if you replay for the different classes)It's also a very pretty game, and it's free! Can't recommend much more :)			"

Posted: January 16, 2015
												Heroine's Quest: The Herald of Ragnarok is a classic graphical adventure game themed on Norse mythology with extensive combat and RPG mechanics in the vein of Quest for Glory. It is effectively an affectionate parody of classics such as King's Quest.Please keep in mind that although the game designers are clearly FAMILIAR with Norse mythology, this game does not simply faithfully copy it - the mythical Norse characters are noticeably different in story and/or basic design from their namesakes, which to be honest is entirely consistent with classic adventure games. For instance, it is the Heroine who goes after Fafnir at Regin's request, as opposed to Sigurd who just sits around cooking great food all day. That said, savvy players may still pick up on details ahead of time, such as with Hervor.As the dialogue in the game is fully voice-acted, you play as the nameless Heroine who must be female and who is never referred to by name. You may select one of three classes: Warrior, Mage, or Thief. Of these three, Warrior is considered easy, Mage is medium, and Thief is hard; the game will adjust the solutions to its puzzles according to which of these classes were selected. Warrior basically just muscles and fights her way through everything, you see, and is suitable for a first play until you're familiar with the general flow of the game.After picking a class, you are given points to boost your starting stats or add new skills - after this point, you are more or less unable to learn skills you don't already have, such as the ability to cast magic or gather herbs. I strongly advise that your first run through the game be with a vanilla Warrior with all points dumped into Agility (in my experience the slowest stat to raise).The game is divided into several chapters, each of which makes clear a basic story goal for the Heroine to complete such as ""save the guy you just saw fall down half-dead in the snow"". As a fair bit of warning, you may permanently miss out on sidequests if you proceed to the next chapter without doing them, so be sure that you've done all that you can do before moving on - the game has no time limit beyond keeping the Heroine from dying to starvation / sleeplessness / freezing, so you're free to grind your skills and farm silver from the various enemies.Heroine's Quest features a rudimentary real time combat system - the reason I said to spam Agility is because you will go faster and the other guy will go slower. If an enemy catches up to you, then you have to fight it. The Heroine may not only attack from several directions, but she can also change her weapon outside of combat (presuming she has more than one) - some enemies are much easier to fight with specific weapons. She can also block (Warrior) and dodge in three directions (everyone), and may learn additional special attacks over the course of the game. Mage can use some of her spells in combat, as well.The game's most frustrating feature by far has to be the hidden point values. Your Score itself will announce when you've accumulated a point, but your hero score and morality don't; the only indicator of those values to my knowledge is in an optional (but extremely useful!) bonus in the Warrior's endgame. Fortunately, the other two classes don't have access to that content anyway and therefore don't have to worry about their hidden values, but it's very frustrating for those of you who want a ""perfect"" run, especially since the game frequently updates to change what affects your hidden values.All in all, Heroine's Quest is a wonderful game, especially considering that it is entirely payment-optional. Consider chucking a few bucks their way to help ensure they produce another game of this quality!			"

												Phenomenal FREE game especially if you are a fan of the old 90's era DOS adventure games.  It's a point and click game, sometimes you can get confused on what to do but then once u figure it out you see that it was something so simple and then you continue on your quest.Highly inspired by Sierra's Quest for Glory series which was just actually put on steam as a bundle too.  Right from the start you see that as you can pick the fighter mage or Thief class.  To increase your skills in this game you just do that skill.  For a free game it is great, brings me back to the 90's.  For anyone who grew up in that era and played those style games you are in for a treat.  But if you are young and a teen I suggest trying it out just to see how this sorta style game is.  Who know's you might really enjoy it.Highly recommended, heck I have a bunch of triple A games I need to finish yet I was playing this game for hours yesterday instead and having a great time.  Funny how sometimes free and yet games so simple are better than brand new titles you pay top dollar for.			"

												I never write reviews for games, so trust me when I say: This game is the nostalgia trip I've been waiting my adult life for.Heroine's Quest is a great homage to Quest for Glory and the adventure game days of Sierra, but it really shines in it's own right. Don't worry if you've never played any similar game, you will be introduced to all of the important concepts of the genre very quickly. The QFG style multiple solutions and stat progression are very cool features I'm glad to see return to the genre. Heroine's Quest is not just a rehashing of a genre either, it adds new elements and features that fit well with the narrative. As you might expect from the title, you do get a few jabs at the Hero/Heroine expectation, but these are always done in great humor and never just to point it out.The voice acting for Thrivaldi is brilliant, for others characters, not so much. You get a few brilliant characters, but most dialogue is not delivered with personality. Still, the quirky humor of QFG is present in plenty of dialogue!			"

												A great follower of the old Quest for Glory series, and a nice reminder of times when grass was greener and adventure games were, well, adventurier. Excellent execution of the unique 'classic quest plus trainable stats' system, peculiar to the QfG games. Three classes have enough differences in walkthrough to ensure replayability. Lots of humor, easter eggs, Norse mythology references, unnecessary but fun actions and a lot more to explore.A must play for nostalgic Quest for Glory fans, and a peek at what adventure games were like in 90s for everyone else.

												Don't be fooled by the fact that it's freeware: Heroine's Quest is no small game. It'll probably take you several days to play through once, and it will probably take several more if you want to get most of the achievements (you can't snag them all in one go - even with a walkthrough). It's so good that I felt I had to donate (go to crystalshard.net if/when you want to show your appreciation).The difficulty options are good: minimum difficulty makes it mostly a retro puzzle adventure without having to manage survival aspects or master the combat system. Higher difficulty is challenging and probably will require planning (read: several deaths/attempts if you haven't played at a lower difficulty before).I have followed the game for a while before its Steam release and had no problems before, but I must admit that this review is based on prior experience. It will be a while before I can verify that the Steam port is bug-free.The puzzles run a wide range between more obvious everday logic and sneakier ones that require attention to well-hidden clues or immersive thinking. Despite the presence of mythology and magic you shouldn'tneed a wild imagination to dream up the solutions.The story is everything from serious, to comical. The lore is lovingly detailed, the soundtrack is moving, and the voice acting is mostly superb.  Nothing about this game's development seems amateurish, and it is well deserving of the donations that it receives.The only significant fault that I can find is that the controls can be confusing in certain puzzles: this is a point-and-click game mostly, so it is important for users to know exactly where they are clicking. The trouble comes in the form of the cursors, which change depending on your action, and there is no standard ""point"" common to them all. Most mouse cursors have a top-left ""point,"" but the game uses a centered white pixel in each of its cursors to represent the point where a mouse click will take effect. This small detail has caused some grief for players in a very particular point of the game (where a single wrong click causes game over). Unless some tutorial message is added to introduce this white pixel to players, I fully expect it will continue to be a source of frustration for the unknowing players out there. Regardless, I strongly recommend that you at least try this game. It's freeware, after all, so you have nothing to lose if you have time to spare.			"

												I'd fully recommend this game,why? it has a cool,Norse setting,it has a amazing sense of humor,some cool RPG things like stats and classes each which play totally diffrent,this game has a cool narrative in that sometimes NPC's have diffrent dialogue based on what characters are on screen,for instance if you have a mother and her son is in the same room she says one thing but when said son leaves the room she says something diffrent when you ask about her son, i LOVE things like that it just oozes detail and passion which i miss in so many RPG's,it mixes really well with the point and click mechanics of the game,it genuinely feels like an adventure,like you are part of the world and not just talking to mindless NPC after NPC,the game guides you through story plots sometimes with the ""you see this thing,you feel compelled to investigate"" aka ""you can't go anywhere else untill you do this thing first"" which is a little disappointing but it's not that big of a deal in my honest opinion,the game also has humorous things like the 3 sorcerers and you can ask them ""what is the outcome of the 2014 Olympics?"" which is awesome xDwhy am i so positive on this game? well for one it's awesome and second off it's completely FREE,it doesn't have microtransactions or gamebreaking cash shops or anything it's the full game for free! so even if you don't like the point and click genre(like me) you could be pleasently suprised by what Heroine's Quest has to offer			"

												Although it takes some practice to be good with the controls (lol), this game is a good to waste your time.If you enjoy King's Quest series, im sure this game will do the same. Most of the in-game parts are point and click & button press, which you should learn it before venturing further since some special places needs you to do 'special' actions..Information is precious, so, if you decide to try and play this game, dont make mistake with skipping conversations.

												Five Reasons Why You Should Play This:1. It is FREE (of course, after playing the game for about two hours and feel thoroughy impressed with it, I recommend you go to the developer's website and make a donation ;-)2. It is hugely addictive. When I first played this game, I also had three other games going. After I hit ""new game"" on Heroine's Quest, the other three games pretty much just languished in the dust pile3. You can play as Warrior, Mage, or Rogue. Each with different puzzles and pathways to progress the game. This means high replayability4. Likeable heroine and NPCs. Voice acting was top-notch5. Doom Squirrel. This game has THE DOOM SQUIRREL. Kneel in awe to the SQUIRREL OF DOOM.			"

												I really enjoyed this game.  It takes it back to adventure gaming of the 90's which I loved.  I highly recommend puting your modern day gaming on hold and taking a fun trip back in time.  This game is charming, intelligent, well made, and free!  The makers loyally made this game in the style of early Sierra games.  They really mastered the feel and the depth of a great adventure.  It's suprisingly challenging so be patient and enjoy it slowly because games like this are rare.			"

												This game is a loving homage to the old Sierra's Quest for Glory series. However it doesn't stay under its shadow for long. Heroine's quest is its own entity, the game being on par and even better than some of the best in the genre. The Norse-based world setting is convincing and fleshed out, the characters memorable and charming, the writing excellent with the humor and jokes people love so much from the adventure games of old. I'm not a very big fan of the point and click adventure genre but I still enjoyed this game immensely. It held my attention where many games could not. "

												A point&click adventure with multiple possible playstyles and puzzle solutions, some combat and RPG elements and tons of optional things to do. Upsides:-A lot of content: it took me roughly 30 hours to beat the game on my first try (though I took my time to try and deal with every optional thing I came across). Even with so much content in a free2play game (kickstarted), the overall quality of the content is quite high. The layout is mostly non-linear so you can literally go on adventures and explore new stuff as you like. There are not only multiple ways to solve a situation/quest, but the results can vary quite a bit too. -RPG elements: using a skill (any skill, not just combat-related) has a high chance to increase every time you use it. Even walking around aimlessly in the snow will boost your endurance and strength over time. There is also a hidden 'honour' value that is revealed at the end of the game. -Three playable classes which can be customized even further by picking up to 2 additional starting skills. Since it's an adventure, there are obviously big similarities on what you do overall, but how you do it can be completely different. Some optional content is also genuinely reserved for certain classes / skills. -All character dialogue is supported by voice acting. -The music in this game is great.-The setting (nordic mythology: odin, thor, loki, brunhild, fenrir, valkyries etc.) seems to have been taken quite seriously without diminishing the gameplay for the sake of it. The further you get into the game, the more fantasy elements you will come across. -Day & Night cycle without any global time limit (as far as I know) so you can explore the game at your own pace. Still, the daytime can have a significant role in certain situations. Depending on your taste:-Trivia to other games and minor pop-culture humor (as is tradition with similar games back then I guess). However, this does not really influence the feel of the game overall (e.g. there are no 'joke' characters that belong to the actualy story etc.). Think of it as having tons of little not very meaningful eastereggs. In my oppinion, the humor is not as good as in some of the great classics, but it's nice to see how much effort they put into so many little details as well. -Female protagonist who is not objectified (as in: the gender doesn't really influence the story, it just so happens that your character is a woman). I consider this a positive thing (I don't need huge boobies on my screen 24/7 as is the case with some other games) but you have no option to play a different (e.g. male) character, even when chosing a different class. Considering the vast amount of necessary art and voice-acting, this is quite understandable though. -The game is quite challenging, especially at the very beginning. There are many ways to die or otherwise screw things up (even permanently!). Thankfully you can easily save and load in 50 different slots and there is also a difficulty slider. Personally, I like starting out in a creepy, hostile world and then growing more powerful in knowledge, skill and equipment. It feels like genuine accomplishments that have to be earned. Reaching a maximum score is also very difficult (there is sooo much optional content, you will not find it all on your first playthrough) so that's another motivation to try the game over with a different class. Overall: 9/10			"

												This is a masterful entry into the long history of adventure games, using one of my favorite archetypes: the Quest for Glory RPG/Adventure hybrid.  As such, you'll get three classes to play in a fantasy Norse setting, and it's got plenty of action and humor.  If you have ever enjoyed a point and click adventure game (Think King's Quest rather than Myst), you'll really appreciate this game.  One of my favorite experiences was playing through trying to get the Scoundrel achievement, playing it as un-heroically as possible.  It really showed me how much the devs put into this, thinking of all the quite disturbing things one could do in this playground.  Well done!			"

												I LOVE THIS GAME! It's such an amazing throw back to the great Sierra classics! There is even an Easter Egg cameo from a couple QFG and KQ characters! And don't forget hilarious ways to die of course :D These days, it seems like all RPG games are being stream lined into FPSs or simulators that are hardly a challenge unless you up the difficulty which only affects combat. Everytime I walk into a game shop, my first thought is ""Where can I find a good old fashioned RPG like the Final Fantasy's and Sierra games I grew up with? Something where you can spend days on end wondering around trying to find that key item to advance the plot and really use your brain! (or GameFAQs)""Of course the absolute best part of this game is that it's FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!			"

												An AMAZING tribute to the classic Sierra ""Quest For Glory"" games, this time with a strong female protagonist and set in a world richly embroidered with Norse mythology. It revives nearly all the best features of the classic QfG 1-5, is fully voiced (to limited success, since they're clearly not professional voice-actors), and has loads of delightful Easter Eggs which also pay tribute to other Sierra games like the King's Quest series. Play it. Replay it. Love it. Remind yourself that bleeding-edge-HD-CGI graphics are completely unnecessary, and that a good story and fun game play are what really matters. And, of course, BEWARE THE DOOM SQUIRREL!!!			"

												In this fun computer game, that is a game you play on a computer to enjoy yourself, which is easy with this game since it is so fun, you play as a female heroine of the sex opposite to the male one, hence the title of this game. The female that is a hero can be named anything you like, even some names not appropriate as names. You can chose this because it is a choise and games that are about chosing and making your own adventure often contain choises for players to make as to allow for different choises to happen.An evil giant, so called because of his height and general disposition, is trying to freeze a part of the world with a freezing blizzard winter made of cold snow that freeze everything cold. This is evil and because of the evilness of his evil plan a heroine that is heroic and good and therefore opposed to evil travels from one place to the other to reach the land the giant is freezing to stop the freezing because that would be good and heroes do good things.But there are complications becoause the evil giant sends his evil troll that is almost as evil as the giant but not as large or powerfull because that would make the troll a giant troll and not just a troll compared to the giant giant to stop the heroine with an avanlance that stopps her and will freeze her too if she is not saved, just as the land will freeze if not saved.The heroine is saved however and can thus continue to save the land. She starts the game in the land she is trying to save in the largest of the two cities there. Or rather; the player starts the game playing the heroine in the land she is trying to save in the largest of the two cities there. The heroine being proficient in heroics can play as the class of her choise but the player must chose this class for her. The player can chose the classes warrior and rogue and wizard for the heroine, but not all at the same time because they are very different and change the game. And one heroine can only be one class because they are both one and need to be chosen separately. A heroine named in a certain way can however be a different class, even when the names are the same.The game is as i wrote before fun and will in a fun way give the player and the heroine the challenge of traveling the land they try to save to travel the land and save it. it must be saved through the use of magical items and using them so there will be items in the world that must be used, but they need to be found so tht they can be used. Some items need to be used to get other items to use in a similair way, but no items are used in the same way so many items are needed to win the game and saving the land from the blizzard.It is a game that looks a lot like another game, not just because both games are games but because they have very like names and have heroes that are alike those names. The game that is similar to  this game is called hero's quest and as you can see both the word hero and the word quest is similar to the words heroine's  but the word quest from this game ""heroine's quest"", the difference being that in this game the first word is heroine's and in hero's quest the first word is not heroine's but hero's.This game is very good. Not Hero's quest, that also is good, but the game I am refering to now Heroine's quest. That is the game that is being reviewed and it is quite good. It is good because it is a good point and click game with good point and click elements while also in addition to the point and click elements also having elements from another genre called ""RPG"" from which certain RPG-element are added to this game, making it good.If i would be asked to reccomend this game I would reccomend it. I would reccomend the game to both people who like the point and click genre, because there are elements of that genre in this game that would make the game enjoyable to the people who like such elements in their games. I would also in addition to reccomending the game to people who like games that contain point anc click elements reccomend it to people who enjoy good rpgs, because this game is both good and have rpg elements in it that is also quite good. Some people may also have played the aforementioned game i mentioned earlier called Hero's quest. If people that like that game is reading this and wondering if i think they would like this game as well in addition to the games they already like then my answer would be yes, they would like heroine's quest as well as the games they like because the game they want to know if they like contain elements of the game they already know they like and as such can be expected to like the game of heroine's quest as well.This has been a review of a game where I have reviewed the game Heroine's quest. In my review I can be said to review the game to be both good and fun since it has good gameplay to play and fun gameplay as a result of it being good.SincerelyThe Jarls Wizard Aurvandel, the wizard of the Jarl.

This game spoofs a few of their greatest moments (as well as other games), and it is a far longer game play then typical classic adv. rpg's.To top it off, I think it is better than most paid rpg's, AND it is free!  There should be no reason why a lover of the old adventure games doesn't try it.  (Warning: There is a slight negative that stands out similarly to some classic rpg's. If you don't save/keep saves at certain check points, you may get stuck while being unable to continue forward.)			"

												9/10  Highly reccomended. For a free game, there is a great deal of content available; more than I honestly expected. To begin; this game is truly a labor of love to Sierra point and clicks of the day, especially that of ""Quest for Glory"". You'll find a whole slew of references littering the game world; see if you can find them all. This game doesn't let itself be carried by the references though; wasting no time to introduce you to wonderful characters, all unique in their own ways. Each one helps carry the story all the way to it's end as you unravel the story behind the land of Midgard. (Except for that Wizard; hate him.) One of my favorite aspects of this story has to be the fact the main character's gender in relationship to her role is never questioned. It allows the plot to not be weighed down by pointless social baggage, and just focus on being a great story.And the gameplay is nothing to ignore either. Taking a page from the combat of Quest for Glory you are given a chance to be interactive in with your character as they come face to face with the dangers of the land. Unlike a traditional battle system; you and your foe do not take turns slapping each other but instead must outmaneuver one another with dodging and countering. Because of this, you can't just tank your way through most fights by grinding and using the occasional potion to keep you alive, but must rely on your wits as well as your stats to defeat your foes.My one complaint about this game is that it may be a bit brutal in the beginning for those who don't want to remove overworld status effects, and that some of the puzzles may be a little obtuse. Still, I would recommend this to everyone looking to have a good time of try a point and click for the first time. For free; you can't go wrong.			"

												I'll be honest - this game starts out difficult. It's a hybrid point and click with live action elements and three different classes to play. Perks? It's a retro game that'll give you a good time if you try and it comes for free. Yes, this thing is free. All the characters I've met so far have been fully voiced, but that can be turned off if it isn't your thing. I'm interested to find out more about the world and the characters, and the graphics will run on damn near anything you care to play this on.			"

												Heroine's Quest is, in a word, fantastic. For me, it really has it all. It looks, sounds, plays, and all around feels good. The story is well crafted and engaging, not to mention delightfully humorous at times and the Sierra adventure game like style is pulled off perfectly, blending the old and new together seamlessly. The voice acting is well done, as is the soundtrack. All together all of the sounds of the game blend well together, there is never any suddenly too loud or too soft parts that leave you scrabbling with your volume control.All in all if you're looking for an adventure game that has a great story, plays wonderfully, and is generally just all around good, you needn't look any further than Heroine's Quest. And if you're just looking for the great story or all around good game, well, give it a look as it won't hurt to try it out.			"

This style of game is great, you actually learn from this game, for example you can learn that using ink on your finger and putting it on a paper, will make a fingermark. Thats one of many things this game has to offer. I belive this game is based on the book ""A Crystal Shard"" by R.A. Salvatore, I have not read that book, but I sure will now.Sad ending to the game, I was kind of hoping for a second game where she would be the heroine in another place.I hope to see more of these games, when the main character is a hero, and it has some similarities to the early Quest for Glory games, I will play. These are the games I look for. So I thank you for making this game.A great game teaches.-WorkDayPegasusThis game did just that. Once again, this was the best game I've played after the Quest for Glory games, and I have played alot of modern games, and they lack this game's greatness.			"

Quest for Glory, Space Quest, King's Quest, Police Quest, etc.)It is impressive and amazing that the game is free!If you like the old classics or just want to get the feel of how it was to play those games back in the 90's then grab it and try it out! I promise you won't regret it!.After all, it's free so the only thing you can possibly lose is a few hours of your time. :) "

												I'm not very far in, but I can't help but heartily recommend this game for anyone who ever enjoyed adventure games back in Sierra's heyday. The game has a classic aesthetic that really makes me nostalgic for all the fun I had with the King's Quest games, and the liberal use of Norse mythology to frame the plot is very fun. The writing is witty and the sound design is pretty good. Basically, you have no excuse not to add this game to your library since it's available for free.Unless you hate fun. But if you hated fun, why are you even on Steam?			"

												If you've played the Heroes Quest/Quest for Glory games, then this is a loving homage made in the same style.Play as either a brawny fighter, mystical mage, or devious thief (with the option of at least partially cross-classing between them at character creation) to save a winter-locked kingdom that's facing the end of the world. Battles are fast-paced, real-time affairs, similar in style to the fighting in QfG2. Combat (especially for a brand-new heroine) can be a dangerous affair, but you get a real sense of progress when the wargs that used to cause you so much trouble when you were starting out fall to a single strike later on.The puzzles are mostly well thought out, with logical answers. Some of the real head scratchers usually just mean that you need to talk to the characters in-game to get more information. That said, getting into the Thieves' Guild and activating the standing stones were ♥♥♥♥♥es to figure out.There are a lot of throw-away gags that will be familiar to players of Quest for Glory and Kings Quest. They're just infrequent enough that they never grate.Lastly, the game is free; as in totally free. No in-game purchases, no begging for cash, no nothing. Given that my first playthrough took roughly 20+ hours, that is an infinite amount of enjoyment for my dollar.I can only think of two criticisms of the game: 1) During my playthrough as a mage, there were a couple of puzzles where I had the correct answer, but my skill in the spell was too low, and the game didn't communicate that well.2) There are cards for the game, but because the game is free, and there's no way to give the developers money, they'll never unlock.Overall:+ Play it! Even if you end up not liking it, it costs you nothing!			"

Voice acting is amazing, and it's clear that a lot of love and care went into making the game. Just completed my first playthrough of it as a warrior and looking forward to starting another one as a different class. It has replayability because the aims of the game can be reached in different ways depending what class you choose, not to mention the fact that there are plenty of parts of the game to explore as side quests that aren't necessarily required to complete the game. How long you take exploring the depths of the game is up to you. 100% recommend it, this game took me back to my childhood with its style and impressed me with its immersion.			"

												As a fan of old Sierra games like Quest for Glory & Kings Quest, this is an excellent game for those wishing for a hit of nostalgia, with a few modern tweaks.  All the same point-and-click mechanics remain, with a few extras I like, such as the use of a map and notepad, along with extra storage.  Great use of norse mythology, plenty of fun dialogue and varied options for solving puzzles.  Like all of the Sierra ""Quest"" games, there are seemingly numerous ways to die, definitely make sure you save every now and then.And it's free!  Would have happily paid for this game, so definitely visit their website.			"

												At its core, Heroine Quest is a tribute to old Quest for Glory series, exceeding it in almost every relevant way. Storywise, the game set in Norse mythology and tells a story of a upstart heroine, fighing to prevent comming of ragnarok. Writing pays great attention to detail and strikes an almost perfect balance between staying true to the source material  and presenting a fun setting for game. Overal presentation is quite solid with very greeable visuals, music and fairly consistent voice acting. Occasionally animation is on the lower end of the spectrum, but given a size and scope of this project, the quality and volume presented is quite and achievement in its own right.  Combination of point&click and RPG gameplay is carried out in a graceful way, where player is given an option to either raise or lower combat difficulty. This in effect gives everyone an option to either get more engaged in combat or tone down frequency and diffulty of encounters to the point where they're merely a distraction from adventuring part of the game. Quite contrary to the commonly low replay value of adventure games in general, Heroine's Quest often offers multiple solutions to each puzzles for each class as well as occasionally even multiple solutions when playing the same class. Moreover the game offers  a good dash of side content which is, to a large degree, class specific, offering additonal incentive to replay, Altogether the game can offer a solid 20 hours on first play, and easily another 15 hours with each of the 2 remaining classes. If you enjoy this wonderful free gem as much i have please consider supporting the team by purchasing their other releases here on steam ;-)  "

												This is a fantastic game. I did not expect it from a game I've never really heard of, but it was cheap and looked cute so I bought it on super sale. The game is a classic rpg with pixelated graphics. The game takes place in a vikingstyle world with a lot of mentioning of the norse gods and myths. You paly as either a warrior, a sorceress or a rogue and your goal is to wave the world from Ragnarok.There are really two ways to play this; making your own way around the world and exploring for yourself, or follow a guide which will lead you to the really-wont-find-it-without-a-guide 500-point 100% complete game. As these full runs are seperate for each class a realy tryhard wil have many days of playtime in this game.Sound is good, voiceacting is fine, the humour is fantastic. Really. I haven't laughed out loud this much in a game before. It's full of references, jokes, welltimed facial expressions and funny surprises.Getting all the achievements is really only for proper tryhards as some of them are extremely hard and timeconsuming to get. This is not really a con, as if you do earn them you've really earned them.The game can be as easy as you want it to be; the easiest mode lets you twoshot everyone, including bosses, so for a proper feel you should probably set it up a bit. The hardest difficulty is nearimpossible if you go for a run with a lot of fighting. The game also has a full guide on pdf from the game developer, so you should never be stuck if decide to follow it. Should you still have problems there are dedicated players and developers who all are very helpful in the steam forums.			"

												Heroine's Quest: The Herald of Ragnarok is a free adventure RPG game with a retro look.  It worked, looked ok, played ok, sounded ok.  Has english voiceovers.  You can play a Female Traveller with a choice of warrior, mage, or rogue.  Has many steam achievements.  Sort of like Siera's Hero Quest or Quest for Glory.Try it, if you like retro games.For more info:

												Very good game. Old school Quest for glory style. For those who haven't played the QFG series, its an adventure/rpg hybrid with semifreedom of choises. Each class has different playstyle and solutions to the same story so its fun to play with all classes.Similar to QGF 1 and 3 but in iceland (or something)Voice casting is preety good considering its a FTP game!If they make a Heroine's Quest 2, I will definately purchase it (of course depends on the price)			"

												Heroine's Quest is a game that harkens back to the glory days of Sierra On-Line and pays homage to the Quest for Glory series by the same company. Right down to the use of skills, combat, and puzzle solving that made those games great. Using the Norse tale of Ragnarok as a basis but making it their own, Crystal Shard proves that you don't need flashy graphics and cutting-edge controls to make a gripping game. The fact that this game is free to play and has hours of fun, not to mention replay value utilizing three vastly different classes, you can't go wrong with this one. Add to it a female protagonist that's not purely eye candy and can hold her own and has a personality that you can relate to, you've got the making of a classic title here.			"

												Keep a note that this game was made in 2012.It's a classic, story rich point and click adventure game with clunky dated game mechanics, and about game settings you can't even get 1080p resolution, vsync and solid 60fps.That is a turnoff for me and I wished a lot of game mechanics would be modernized BUT, it's 100% accurate on the nostalgic factor. All these old games we know from Lucasarts (Rest In Peace!) didn't runed smoothly, had pixalated graphics and the game mechanics was bland. I salute the admins for their wonderful effort!			"

												Heroine’s Quest sounds like a parody of Quest of Glory 1 (formerly known as Hero’s Quest) but it’s a pretty good roleplaying-adventure. As a self standing heroine (and game) HQ features a bundle of nifty ideas. One which does appeal to me is Viking saga setting. Another good idea is introduce of winter survival - one tends to get frozen out there. The game is indeed fairytale-like, lightly written and full of good humour. As far as parents are concerned the game wouldn’t rate far in age ratings. I heartfeltly recommend this game for geekgirls and -boys alike. The staying problem has been that few games provide good role models for girls. Hence the game that actually fills the Bechedel and Two XChromosomes-tests is indeed something that everyone should be aware of. I hope this game gets a sequel - the only downside is that this might not get as much attention as it deserves.			"

												Yes, yes, yes. My dreams came true when I saw that ""Heroine's Quest"" will get a steam release (now with shiny little achievements ^^).Don't let the ""Free to Play"" tag fool you, this is a loveletter to the good old days of Sierra's ""Quest for Glory"" series with beautiful VGA graphics that are just timeless and voice acting, to give the characters even more personality.A great mix of adventure and rpg gameplay mechanics that is really a gift from screen 7 to the fans of oldschool games.So forget the hidden pay2play concept of almost all ""Free to Play"" games out there and take this trip down memory lane.And hey, Valve! How about getting more free games of such superior quality on Steam.			"

I haven't experienced anything like this since QFG back in the 90's. Great writing, attention to detail in terms of getting the old school point and click genre right, and I am surprised that it's currently free. Would gladly pay for a game this great, you can tell the developers really captured the essence of the old classics in this release.			"

												A rich, refreshing take on an old (and thought to be dead) genre of gaming.A strong female protagonist is only the beginning of what sets this freeware apart from the other point-and-click adventures that dominated the 80's and 90's market. Along with more side quests, different classes to vary gameplay difficulty and puzzle-solving, appears the unique surivial feature. Making sure your herione remains warm and fed while out in the harsh winter adds not just realism, but a depth to gameplay, forcing the player to be at wit's end as they must explore, fight, and talk their ways out of danger within a time limit. For those who wish to play more casually however, the developers have been kind enough to allow an option to either lessen this difficulty (need for food and warmth), as well as increase it. Such loving detail has been put into each pixel of this game, from mechanics, to the art, to the music, and to the voice acting. The voice acting alone had me sold on these characters being alive, and the writing is clever and chalk full of humor to keep me amused and wanting to speak to each villager and monster throughly. Even at points, struggling and dying quite a few times, having to repeat conversations sometimes changed- much to my delight. One life I'll have a conversation in the tavern one on one, and then on a new life, another person appears for a card game, and more is added onto the conversation than before. The layers prove almost as deep as the Norse lore that the game is based around to impressive amounts.To all of my friends I have stressed that this is a game that is worthy to play and to sink effort into. It's one not to miss and already in my top favorites of this year.			"

So You Want to Be a HeroThis game is a love letter to the point-and-click adventure games that made Sierra a household name for us older people. Even the title of the game, Heroine's Quest, is a reference to Hero's Quest (later renamed Quest for Glory due to copyright issues with the board game HeroQuest), which is clearly the game's biggest influence. If you were a fan of Quest For Glory, King's Quest, Police Quest, Space Quest, or even Leisure Suit Larry, you owe it to yourself to install this game immediately. If not, it's free, and I still recommend it for anyone who enjoys adventure games.			"

Also, it is great to have norse mythology represented so faithfully. I just love this one. I played it when it was available over the dev's homepage and now discovered it here on Steam. I think I'll play it again.You should play this for the wonderfully pixeled art alone, but it's also a really fun adventure/RPG mix. Definitely recommended.			"

												This being my first point and click adventure I must say this game, KICKS♥♥♥♥♥ The story is good, voice acting amazing, music perfectly suites the game and it oozes charm. I came into this game wanting to not like it so in the first like 20 minutes I had nothing bad to say I was pleased to have a great damn near perfect game, for free? There is a problem, the cold kills way to quickly I mean it takes about 5 minutes before you die but really that is a small small thing. I know what you are thinking point and click come on. To witch I say play it. I give this game a 9/10.			"

												This game was excellent and seemed as if it was the next chapter and hero in the quest for glory series. But, HQ is its own game. Anyone that enjoyed the old Sierra Quest Adventure series will feel right at home here with the hand drawn backgrounds, puzzles and interesting world. The game is also free so if you are on the fence reading this review, there really is no reason not to. They also made another classic adventure game called A Tale Of Two Kingdoms which is also a free title available on their website.			"

From the jokes, to the combat, all the way to the multiple classes having different ways of solving puzzles, this game has everything a Quest for Glory fan has been wanting for years. As a matter of fact, if I didn't know better, I'd think Crystal Shard had Lori and Corey Cole stashed away somewhere in their studio! Thanks guys!			"

												It comes through as a well-written game with lots of work and love put into it, but it has a few frustrating characteristics. It's very oldschool-merciless in the sense that the player can die outside of combat without actually making any mistakes, just by opening a door and being railroaded into a death scene. I'm talking about the one where as soon as entering the thieves lair they stab me to death without a chance to fight back. My latest ragequit <3 Another time I died of starvation despite the game repeatedly telling me that I can't die of starvation on the easiest difficulty. It's also frustrating that I feel I can't play the game in my own pace, the plot keeps advancing every night without me having enough time to do all the side-quests and properly explore the area - in this sense it feels more like an adventure game than an rpg. I still recommend it, because the world is interesting and I like the ambience, but be prepared for the above-mentioned annoying things.			"

												To anyone who is a true fan of the Quest for Glory games, don't expect this game to deliver the same quality of experience.  I have played about 5 hours into it and don't know if I'll continue.  It's not a bad game at all, but it definitly doesn't live up to it's namesake.  Where Quest for Glory games basically let you roam free and figure the world out for yourself, this game constantly holds your hand and tells you what to do ""next"".  There is even a mechanic to actively discourage you from exploration.  Where Quest for Glory was your story, this game is set on telling its own story and forces you to take part in it.  That's not the Heros Quest I remember.After reading so many reviews raving about this game, I can't help but be a little annoyed.  The voice acting is ok, but the dialog feels like it's never going to end at times.  The music is not horrible, but I've actually read reviews saying it was as fitting as QFG music.  That is especially ridiculous and painful to read.  I just felt I had to say something as even though this may be a nicely made game, it is a pale shadow of the Quest for Glory series and does not deserve the loftly praise of being on par with it.

												 This game is OVERRATED; it's worth trying I suppose, but I would only reccomend this, for if you like overly-complex games. I mean, I got bored of it, and I got TOO ANNOYED, with this; I can't even SELL any items, because the game is too complicated! Would I reccomend this, to gamers wanting deep gameplay? No; this is too complicated, even for gamers like myself. Especially when the puzzles are TOO ANNOYING! Not to mention that the controls for combat are terrible, and the time-based puzzles SUCK! I myself, would rather play ANY of these games that are more underrated, than THIS:----= Sonic Heroes (Not the best game in the world, but 2-player mode DEFINITELY gave it better replay value. And at LEAST it's better than those terrible ""Sonic Boom"" video games.)= Mega Man 7 (The gameplay makes a bit more sense than this, the graphics are very good for it's time, and it was a good concept! Though it just could've been better, in my respectful opinion.)\= Fracture (A game for the Xbox 360; a Halo-like game that features the main character; a bad-as-heck hero with a terrible name that's so funny, ""Jet Brody""! XD)= Phantasy Star Universe (DOES ANYBODY PLAY THIS GAME?!? It's available, for the Xbox 360, you know!)= Golden Axe: the Duel (It appears to be a bit underrated, and at least it's better than ""Golden Axe: Beast Rider""; who needs mere over-the-top combos, when you've got simple well-balanced strategy fighting?!?)= Klonoa (THE ENTIRE FRANCHISE; has anyone forgot about this great childhood memory?!? The designs were great, the gameplay was simple yet great, and also, it's DEFINITELY worth playing! I sure hope that if they make ""Klonoa 3"", they'll make it a game that supports multiplayer co-op gameplay!)---- As you can see, a lot of these ""free-to-play"" games on Steam, are overrated...I myself, plan on GETTING A JOB. I would only recommend this, because it's FREE...and if you like to play this kind of garbage, feel free. But I must warn you; THIS GAME SUCKS! If you like free-to-play games, I would reccomend playing ""Team Fortress 2"", instead! It's funnier, it has better gameplay that MAKES SENSE, and it's totally less frustrating!			"

You ""Run"" at about 1 metre an hour, The combat is♥♥♥♥♥♥(Seriously, a brigand in the forest died even though I didn't have a clue what I was doing.), It tries to be a (S)NES RPG and fails badly. If you're going to give me stuff to do, at least give me some clue as to where exactly i'm going. I don't enjoy dicking around trying to find a part of a forest or some such just so I can find some BLOODY FOOD. Honestly, this only deserves to be F2P, it's worth nothing. DO NOT EVEN TRY THIS GAME! YOU HAVE BETTER THINGS TO TRY THAN THIS!On the other hand, the voice acting is nearly as bad as the CD-i games, and the NPCs always have some sort of mentally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ look on their face, so if you find that funny, might as well get it.

												Absolutely horrible.  Too slow paced to be a ""starve to death in 5 minutes"" type of game. Takes forever just to navigate from one screen to another.  Forget graphics, the control configuration sucks. Very clunky and no smoothness whatsoever. Cycling through commands just to avoid talking to a sword embedded in a tree is apparently not annoying enough but the attacks against the player's intelligence prove to be the only thing thats worth entertaining. Just another one of those halfass, frustrating, IBM era games stuck in the armpit of retroville with it's story around a poor woman left half dead at a doorstep with no way in hell of avoiding starvation. Some call it ""old school"". I call it old school♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												The game has way too many ""time fillers"".There are lots of dialogs that are simply way longer than they need to, characters talking useless stuff that do not bring anything to the game or the story. There are also many screens that have nothing to do and just consume even more time while once again bringing nothing to the game.Sadly all this feels artificially slow and therefore very annoying.

												Ever since my uncle introduced me to Sierra's King Quest seris (and a few of their other series and similar games made by other companies) I absolutely fell in love with Point and Click/Adventure games. I don't know what is about playing games like this that captures my attention but Heroine's Quest: The Herald of Ragnarok brings back a sense of nostalgia. With it's similar play style to the King's Quest games (and other point and click adventure games) of the nineties, polished voice acting and beautiful art work and graphics, you'll be drawn back into the early nineties/late eighties where there was no internet, or maybe the internet was so new, and you had to work together with your family and friends to figure out how to get past these extra puzzles. When you get past that infuriating puzzle, you 're reward with not only the satisfaction of having completed the puzzle, but getting a step further in the game and learning more of the storyline. Granted in early King' s Quest games, the storylines were all very simple and focused more on puzzle solving and exploration but still, Heroine's Quest will leaving you wanting more and there's a big replayability factor so that you can choose a different class to play as and each class shapes the story a bit diffrent and brings about a different playthrough while keeping the basic storyline at it's core. You play as a female adventurer, who while traversing through some snowy mountains, is caught in an avalanche and finds herself rescued by a blacksmith and his wife, who runs an Adventurer's Guild and thus begins the Heroine's tale of solving the mystery behind the eternal snowy winter in the new land. Another thing I love about this game is the combat system. Depending on your class, you can fight in different styles and defeating enemies will reward you with experience to level up your skills, food to survive in the wilderness, and on occasions, armor and equipment to better protect yourself. I think that's all I can really say about this game. The storyline is intriguing, the characters are all intertwined with the each other and mesh well with the story and the Heroine's personality is a bit flexible, meaning you can project yourself onto your (though I think she'll always remain brave and just), but still, there's so much to do in this game that you won't ever get bored.It was because of this game that I went and bought the King's Quest Collection released here on Steam. Play this game, I assure you, you won't regret playing it and figuring out the cause of the eternal winter in Midgarde. "

If you enjoyed Quest for Glory 3, or didn't have the chance to play it, play this game.  8/10 but only because of 2 minor, but annoying details.  1, the screen doesn't fit the desktop so it is easy to click off the game, onto the desktop.  2.  a lot of the dialog is sub par.  attempts to be silly pun pun funny, but it is just stupid.  Other than that, amazing.  Nearly a 10/10.			"

												Being a fan of the Hero's Quest games (which I still own) since they were coming out, I was pretty excited about this game when I found out about it, but sadly it turned out to be rather disappointing.  First of all, playing the thief, which I always liked to play best in the Sierra Online games, I've wondered around the woods, dying over and over again just trying to find some food without luck.  If I don't freeze to death, I get either killed by the boar or the bandit.  The combat system is much more complex than it should be in a game of this nature and controls face in a northern orientation when your character faces the right to fight.  Another problem is that when you move your mouse to the top of the screen to access the menu, the game does not pause, which to my memory, every Sierra Online game of this type of menu does.  Twenty years of playing Sierra Online’s games that pause like this, it makes a game that doesn’t almost unplayable for me.  Having played the Hero’s Quest series over and over again, I don’t remember ever having this amount of difficulty getting started.  I do know that you can turn off freezing and starvation in this game, but what’s the fun of that?  It is just that finding food and fighting shouldn’t be so difficult at the start of the game.On a positive note, I do think the graphics are excellent and very well portray the nature of the Sierra Online point & click adventure that this game pays tribute too.  They are very nostalgic and take me back to the golden age of point & click adventures.  Sound is very nice as well and I like that I can have voice and text together.  Being hard of hearing, I often had to go text alone back in the day since many of Sierra’s games would not allow you to have both.  Also the controls and menu system are handled very well outside of the non-pausing issue I mentioned above.Since this game is such an incredible start and well on the right track, also being a free game, I am giving  this game a thumbs up and hoping that the developers will take the issues mentioned above as constructive criticism and resolve these issues.

												Some first impressions after playing 2 hours. So far it's interesting and sometimes funny but also annoying at times. Exploring the town I suddenly drop dead from starvation. I had no food in inventory and could not get anyone in town to give me any so was not a fun way to start the game, especially having 30 minutes of exploring and dialogue wasted for nothing and having to do it again.NPC wander randomly and go to places that it makes no sense for them to be. For example, I go upstairs in castle and see a barrier, blocking me from entering the wizard's room. The bartender from tavern suddenly appears, walks through the barrier, then sits in the wizard's chair. When speaking to her she has the same dialogue as if we're still in the tavern.Talking to the wizard is a major annoyance and it's puzzling why the devs thought it would be amusing to have an npc repeat everything he says all the time. Thankfully just clicking on dialogue box allows skipping it.On the plus side, there's alot of history and there's some attention to detail when learning about the characters. The heroine is blonde, beautiful, and brave, which is standard fare for someone out to save the world(though I suppose if she were bald, ugly, and scared of her own shadow it wouldn't work quite as well). Hopefully, once leaving town will give a better impression.			"

												Heroine's Quest can be descriped as spiritual successor to Hero's Quest, a combination of point'n'click adventure with RPG system. Made by fans of such genre and released for free. It's great, giving you a world to explore as three different classes, all 'actually' having different approach, unlike other more traditional RPG games. As well as having characters with their story, many optional quest and solutions. And great music.In other words, it's like exploring the world, not grinding, and it's a crime to have this free.Hovewer, for some reason it was really hard to get into game. I had to force myself to enjoy this game until the end, pretty much, it doesn't exactly capture you. Then again, RPGs and old adventures aren't genres I get easily into.			"

												As my avatar implies, I'm a fan of the classic Quest for Glory series. I'm ashamed I didn't pick this game up earlier. It's a fantastic homage to the classics, with a great deal of love and care put into the setting and story, and I'm enjoying every minute of it. It's extremely well-polished and genuinely feels like it belongs right with the Sierra originals; the only departures it makes are beneficial changes (like adding an automap feature, and displaying stat/skill gains as they're obtained) that only enhance gameplay without spoiling anything. Its mytholical base feels right in line with the various settings of the earlier ones, and it even has the same referential humor and occasional pun that would probably be annoying in any other series but fits right in here.I simply cannot offer this one enough praise.

												Heroine's quest is a fantastic epic adventure/rpg hybrid with excellent artwork, writing, music, and voice acting. Not only that, but it is available for the amazing price of FREE, and puts lots of paid games to shame with its wealth of content and production values. There are 3 variations to your character (warrior, sorceress, rogue) which allows you to tackle obstacles and puzzles within the spectrum of full blooded violence to subtle subterfuge, providing lots of gameplay differences and replayability. You can tell a lot of dedication, hard work, and love went into this at every stage of the game. Highly recommended for any adventure or RPG fans.			"

												Were VGA and EGA adventure/RPG hyrids you very niche bag back in the day? Well this will fit in that bag very nicely. Very Quest for Glory style, but expects you to be much smarter than a lot of the QfG games. Some puzzles cannot be solved unless you pay attention to what people tell you, so don't play this and expect to not have to pay attention to the story or explore, or talk to the npcs. Also if you pick a Warrior then finding out what it means to be a Norse Warrior (by talking to people) and stick to it - yes stealing is dishonorable and unlike modern games it will count against you even if no one sees you. This is a RPG of the old style where you are expected to match your play style to your character.  This game is not for everyone, as it's a game style that has sadly gone by the wayside. By if you give it a chance, it'll pull you in and reward you.  Plus it's free so if you don't like it, you aren't really out any money are you?For fans of the old GfQ games: name your character after one of the women the Hero could marry in the last game, you will get a suprise.

												This game is a brilliant throwback to classic adventure/rpgs such as Sierra's Quest for Glory series. It has a strong female protagonist, good gameplay, and a good story line filled with Norse mythology. You choose between  3 classes, warrior/fighter (easiest to start with), mage or thief which will influence certain aspects of the game (for example how some puzzles are solved)Voice acting is mostly well done too as is the musical score. There are optional side quests and mini games, and many puzzles have more than one solution. I also like the realism, not only do you need to make sure your character eats and sleeps sufficiently and doesn't freeze to death, but characters will react differently depending on who else is in the room.  For example if you talk to Lithrasir about Hervor  while Hervor  is in the room, what she says will be different than if he isn't, if they are present the character being talked about may react to what is being said as well All in all this is a really fun adventure/rpg game that is well worth checking out, and it's free!!

												Some first impressions after playing 2 hours. So far it's interesting and sometimes funny but also annoying at times. Exploring the town I suddenly drop dead from starvation. I had no food in inventory and could not get anyone in town to give me any so was not a fun way to start the game, especially having 30 minutes of exploring and dialogue wasted for nothing and having to do it again.NPC wander randomly and go to places that it makes no sense for them to be. For example, I go upstairs in castle and see a barrier, blocking me from entering the wizard's room. The bartender from tavern suddenly appears, walks through the barrier, then sits in the wizard's chair. When speaking to her she has the same dialogue as if we're still in the tavern.Talking to the wizard is a major annoyance and it's puzzling why the devs thought it would be amusing to have an npc repeat everything he says all the time. Thankfully just clicking on dialogue box allows skipping it.On the plus side, there's alot of history and there's some attention to detail when learning about the characters. The heroine is blonde, beautiful, and brave, which is standard fare for someone out to save the world(though I suppose if she were bald, ugly, and scared of her own shadow it wouldn't work quite as well). Hopefully, once leaving town will give a better impression.			"

												This is a mix of the Sierra games of old (Space Quest, King's Quest) with the fighting mechanics of Sid Meier's Pirates & the rpg-level-system of Elder Scrolls (the more you use a specific trait/skill, the more that skill advances).A typical issue with most of these adventure games is the resorting to trial-&-error need to be clicking-on-everything to progress the story. This is never an issue with the game except for only a couple of situations. This is pretty darned amazing considering the size of the game.Writing, voice-acting, dialogues & humour are all 1st class. There is clearly a lot of research behind the study of norse folkfore to bolster the story's setting & it really shows. Characters fall into the usual tropes yet the story & story-telling is rich & vibrant with just the right amount of comical referencesThe puzzles & combat are rewarding & the music feels just right. The game gives you just the right amount of hints without removing the challenge. For the most part the thoughtful game design goes a long way toward making specific problems more easily resolved whilst still offering the possibility for multiple solutions (usually via the class specific's unique skill sets)The pixel graphics are a nice touch with each sprite, backdrop & portrait boasting talent in abundance. There was never an instance where a small item or set piece had me confused as to what it represented, I only mention this because this used to be an issue with these types of games but I can gladly state that every piece is self-evident & well representative of what it portrays itself to be.All in all I have played a lot of point n'click adventure games but this one manages to take the best aspects from the genre to make a more open experience that is sure to give the SCUMMy retro fans a fresh experience. I can easily recommend this game to fans of the genre but other gamers may get alienated by the referential humour & frustrated by the graphical throwback nature			"

												This game is pretty well made. It is inspired by norse mythology and the classic adventure genre, with a good bit of RPG mechanics (classes, stats, skills, sidequests, etc) added in for good measure. And, it all works very nicely. The characters' voice acting and faces keep the feel of classic adventure games, the battles are simplistic, yet have a depth of their own. Different ways to swing your sword, the choice to dodge, block, etc. (I've only played as the warrior so far, so my knowledge is limited to that.) The way you have to survive the world is nice, too. All these dangerous things around while the characters are being ever so active. You can die from hunger, getting hurt too much, moving when low on stamina, freezing to death, etc. And. there's a way around each of these. Such as healing potions, resting, or having warm boots that I totally didn't steal. The story is fine enough, easy to keep track of while you know there's something bad going on somewhere. Usually that two-headed troll trying to attack a character you will need to later help. Oh yeah, and every decision counts. I'm sure if I left that guy out in the snow, I wouldn't have given me that stuffed...duck I think it was? Oh, and there's the honor system is very important, yet you can't see it. Having enough honor allows you to get a flaming sword. So, be ms goody-two-shoes in this game if you want to wield a badass blade of fire.I also love how you can give your character the skills of a another class, that allows for some useful characters. I might have to make a magic-casting rogue later.Either way, I give this game a 8.3/10.  Anyone who likes adventure or roleplaying games should DEFINITELY check this one out. Good thing it's free, eh? (Which would be a total steal if we were still in the era of these kinds of games, but that's a given.)			"

Adding some spice well adjusted Nordic mythology, alas thief character doesn't have to fight AT ALL. Great music and songs.

There was never an instance where a small item or set piece had me confused as to what it represented, I only mention this because this used to be an issue with these types of games but I can gladly state that every piece is self-evident & well representative of what it portrays itself to be.All in all I have played a lot of point n'click adventure games but this one manages to take the best aspects from the genre to make a more open experience that is sure to give the SCUMMy retro fans a fresh experience. I can easily recommend this game to fans of the genre but other gamers may get alienated by the referential humour & frustrated by the graphical throwback nature			"

												I've never played the original Quest for Glory series and I'm not a big fan of the ""8-bit"" style (though I agree that it's better than badly rendered 3D or something) but this game is fun, the voice acting is good, and the puzzels make sense.			"

												Brings back the nostalgia of the 8 bit games. This is a really good RPG that has great replay value for the sole reason of different classes available in the game and how differently you use each class to do some of the quests.The combat can be a bit tricky. But there is a really detailed game guide for this.And since this game is free, it is absolutely recomended for RPG fans to try this out.			"

												This game is an excellent stroll down memory lane for lovers of the Hero's Quest / Quest for Glory series from Sierra Online. The scripting and voice acting are very good, and the  tale itself encourages creative thinking, rather than following a quest compass to an objective. I look forward to future enterprises from Crystal Shard.			"

												This is one of the best completely free games you will ever play. The amount of effort and quality hard work that went into this game is immediately obvious in its high production values.And when I say this game is free, I mean it is absolutely free. There is nothing you can buy here, no DLC no microtransactions. You get everything right away, and for nothing.The voice acting by itself is impressive enough to warrant trying the game. Every single dialoue line spoken by a character is voice acted, and with 280000+ words that is a lot of voice acting. Not many AAA games manage to have everything voice acted, but this free game does! Tell me this is not pure dedication.Heroine's Quest is at first glance an homage to the old RPG/adventure games of the late 80s, early 90's. But as soon as you spend some time with it you discover that it is so much more. It is an early 90s RPG if it were made today. And from that you get all the great things from those sort of games: great story that is also funny at times, complex and interesting quests that have different ways to approach and solve them, amazing atmosphere and great dialogue. All of this in exchange for some pixel graphics, which I am not a fan of, but it is evident they spent a lot of time creating the environments and characters in the game and then even animating all of them, which is not easy to do with pixel art.The weak side of the game is the combat which is quite simplistic and basically just pushing one button most of the time, at least at the lower difficulties. It is interesting the way combat is done in this game and it is much more involved than I expected before starting to play the game, however as I said it is lacking in complexity and would've been more fun with more combat skills. This is most evident in the first half of the game or so when you only have one combat spell (as a sorceress) and dodging left, right or back. And that is pretty much all you can do in combat for the first 5-6 hours.Some of the puzzles/quests are also annoying to accomplish because the goals that are presented are much too vague and you need to do a lot experimentation to finish them. It doesn't help that for much of the game you will have no fast travel option, so you will have to walk through the whole forrest every time you will get an idea for how to solve a certain quest, which leads to a lot of time wasted just walking back and forth.Great game if I had to pay for it. As a free game it is amazing.7 ½ / 10			"

If you enjoyed Quest for Glory 3, or didn't have the chance to play it, play this game.  8/10 but only because of 2 minor, but annoying details.  1, the screen doesn't fit the desktop so it is easy to click off the game, onto the desktop.  2.  a lot of the dialog is sub par.  attempts to be silly pun pun funny, but it is just stupid.  Other than that, amazing.  Nearly a 10/10.			"

												This game follows the 90's school of RPG games and graphic adventures.The setting is in some kind of viking mythologic world. It helps if you have some lore about Thor, Loki, Odin(Wotan) and the other northern gods, but you'll find a lot of ingame info about them.This game plays like a revisited version of old Quest for Glory series. Of course, that series being released in early 90's, this game has a lot of space to improve over those oldies. An example of those improvements is the use of voices for the NPCs of this game.Graphics are similar to the ones you got at the QfG games. You even have the same initial option of character selection, with the possibility of learning some extra skills to personalize your character. You'll improve your skills through the game by using them. The more you use them the higher they get.Combat is in real time, so you'll need to learn which key does what to really best your enemies.You are going to find several quests and puzzles through the game. Some of them can be impossible to solve without being the right character class and having the right skill or spell, so don't worry too much if you can't complete all the sidequests you find.All in all, it's a fun game. It can be seen as a game to nostalgic people like myself, but I think the story it develops can be appreciated even for new players to this old kind of gaming.			"

												Short description:A surprising underdog!Pros: - It is a free game that does not try to extort money from you and it is well made and complete!!! How often do you find one of these?! SERIOUSLY??!?!?!?! - Combat system feels great and adequate to this game; - Elaborated dialogues; - Immersive environments; - Features a culture rich world (mostly Nordic); - Memorable characters; - Fully voiced; - Re-playability through the different classes your character may assume; - Challenging.Cons: - Graphics may not please all audiences; - Walking through the map takes a lot of time (although you can speed up the game in the options menu); - The menus could be a little easier to access (but you can have hot-keys in your keyboard in order); - The initial quest in the game (where you must gather food) may be a little hard for people not used to this type of game;Long description:I must say that this game surprised me.At first, I was reluctant to play it, because it seemed to resolve around a combat system, and I just wanted a good-old-fashioned point'n click adventure.However, this game won me in the first few minutes, when the first dialogue came up fully voiced, presenting a memorable character (Thrivaldi, you arr awesome!). As for my concerns with the combat system, well... I was wrong. The game heavily resolves around pointing and clicking on the environment, and the combat system is actually FUN. It is not rare to find myself wandering the woods, looking for random encounters, so that I can play the combat mini game once more.The puzzles are challenging and fair. You will feel accomplished by completing them without relying to online sources.Although not all dialogue lines are interesting, they help to add this sense of immersion to the game.The game has it's flaws, though...Walking through the forest may be a pain... Without a warp system, you will spend a lot of time travelling from point A to B, sometimes, only to TRY to gather an item. Repeating this journey will prove to be very time consuming.The auto save feature is nice; but it would be even nicer if they added a ""before dying"" or ""before entering a dangerous area"" save, since it is something that will be happening a lot to your character.The menus try to be simple, but having sub-menus consumes more time in order to do a task. The game offers hot-keys to these actions though, so I recommend learning and using them.Final words:So, all in all, this game proved to be a great gaming experience for me. I highly recommend it!

												this game. omg.  i am a HUGE HUGE fan of the old quest for glory for the dos.  i am an old pc gamer.  i grew up on having to type everything out c:/dos/quest1/run.exe  before you can even start the game. it brings back huge memories to see this.  its so awesome.  the gameplay and style are exactly the same. poor sierra they used to make such good adventure games.  its great to see this come back. i really hope they make more.  there is one qualm i dont like about this game though.  the chill factor.   you cant explore much without getting too cold or too hungry too fast.  so you will spend alot of time grinding lower areas till your stamina and endurance can handle it. fighting is once again great for the old style. alittle confusing at first but when you get it down you find yourself scrambling back to heal till you get better.  other then that i would highly reccomend this to oldschool gamers.  these young'uns perfer graphics and blam bloom pow excitement. this is for those who enjoy a casual gaming experience and dont mind the small grind before excitemnet.  aka fallout or wasteland  the long before the storm.

It's familiar all the way from being a seasonal-based story set in a specific mythology (in this case, winter and Norse) to the corny, pun-based humour you get when you try to do something that'd otherwise be useless (attempting to talk to a chair, for instance).I love it so much, and really the only complaint I have about it is that it's free, because I wish I could pay them for having made this -- since it feels like they made it *for me*.

												Were VGA and EGA adventure/RPG hyrids you very niche bag back in the day? Well this will fit in that bag very nicely. Very Quest for Glory style, but expects you to be much smarter than a lot of the QfG games. Some puzzles cannot be solved unless you pay attention to what people tell you, so don't play this and expect to not have to pay attention to the story or explore, or talk to the npcs. Also if you pick a Warrior then finding out what it means to be a Norse Warrior (by talking to people) and stick to it - yes stealing is dishonorable and unlike modern games it will count against you even if no one sees you. This is a RPG of the old style where you are expected to match your play style to your character.  This game is not for everyone, as it's a game style that has sadly gone by the wayside. By if you give it a chance, it'll pull you in and reward you.  Plus it's free so if you don't like it, you aren't really out any money are you?For fans of the old GfQ games: name your character after one of the women the Hero could marry in the last game, you will get a suprise.

Then the game opens up and you have to save the kingdom from an ice giant and an evil troll. It is mostly a mixture of adventure game puzzles and wasd attacks on enemies. A bunch of the puzzles suffer from 80s-90s style complexity and you will need a guide. But the game itself was fun. 7/10			"

												This is one classy game. I played Quest for Glory back in the day and this is very much an homage to the form, with modern production values--it's got voiced dialogue, for one thing. Gameplay is a mix of adventure, RPG, there's a few survival elements (you have to eat occasionally and stay too long in the frozen woods and you'll freeze to death), and combat is fairly action-game--you have to dodge the right way to avoid certain enemy attacks, and recognize their tells to hit them when it's safe. The setting's extremely Norse, and while it doesn't deal -directly- with a lot of mythology, people who know their Norse will spot all sorts of little clues and call-outs. This is the best free game on Steam, only on Steam to get a wider audience. There's no pay-to-win, no currency, it's just a game made because a group felt it should be made. It costs nothing but the space it takes to fill it, and it's rewarding to play and rewarding to beat. Sometimes I'll fire it up just to wander around and check it out once more.			"

												Why this game was released free is a bit mind boggling. There's quite a lot of depth in it, especially for a point & click game. it's very clearly a labor of love! It feels a bit amateurish at times when you hear some of the voice acting/recording (not a big fan of the main protagonist voicing) or encounter some overly non-sensical puzzles (I played as a rogue, which is supposed to be less straightforward), but it still managed to pull me into the story, even though I'm not a big fan of heroic fantasy.

												Fun little retro RPG well worth the $19.99 they are not charging for it! Simplified class system that's easy for beginners to classic fantasy RPG class systems. That does not hurt the game in any way and in this games case is better I think because the game is simple to learn to play, the difficulty is in the puzzles not stats. Full of Easter eggs to find and enjoy! Witty fully voiced dialogue with some fun hamming it up voice acting. Non-gratuitous nudity bathing scene that made me laugh is an example of funny things that come up when you click on something. Music is fun and doesn't get really old really fast like some games but is still repetitive. Different areas has different music and there's the combat music that comes up so it does get varied a bit. The games aesthetics are pleasing but I think could be more varied in the wilderness, but don't let the 16 bit design fool you into thinking the devs just are not really good at first, the game is top quality and in many ways better polished than AAA titles being shoveled out the door today.Cons? Only one I can think of is adding or changing armor during the game doesn't change the protagonists look to show it like getting the chainmail armor doesn't show any changes from the leather you start with. Not much of a complaint really.			"

												This game warms my heart.It's an unquestionable love letter to Sierra's old adventure games (particularly Quest for Glory), and in many respects it is indistinguishable as being from different creators than its spiritual ancestors. It's familiar all the way from being a seasonal-based story set in a specific mythology (in this case, winter and Norse) to the corny, pun-based humour you get when you try to do something that'd otherwise be useless (attempting to talk to a chair, for instance).I love it so much, and really the only complaint I have about it is that it's free, because I wish I could pay them for having made this -- since it feels like they made it *for me*.

												Were VGA and EGA adventure/RPG hyrids you very niche bag back in the day? Well this will fit in that bag very nicely. Very Quest for Glory style, but expects you to be much smarter than a lot of the QfG games. Some puzzles cannot be solved unless you pay attention to what people tell you, so don't play this and expect to not have to pay attention to the story or explore, or talk to the npcs. Also if you pick a Warrior then finding out what it means to be a Norse Warrior (by talking to people) and stick to it - yes stealing is dishonorable and unlike modern games it will count against you even if no one sees you. This is a RPG of the old style where you are expected to match your play style to your character.  This game is not for everyone, as it's a game style that has sadly gone by the wayside. By if you give it a chance, it'll pull you in and reward you.  Plus it's free so if you don't like it, you aren't really out any money are you?For fans of the old GfQ games: name your character after one of the women the Hero could marry in the last game, you will get a suprise.

												Heroine's Quest can be descriped as spiritual successor to Hero's Quest, a combination of point'n'click adventure with RPG system. Made by fans of such genre and released for free. It's great, giving you a world to explore as three different classes, all 'actually' having different approach, unlike other more traditional RPG games. As well as having characters with their story, many optional quest and solutions. And great music.In other words, it's like exploring the world, not grinding, and it's a crime to have this free.Hovewer, for some reason it was really hard to get into game. I had to force myself to enjoy this game until the end, pretty much, it doesn't exactly capture you. Then again, RPGs and old adventures aren't genres I get easily into.			"

												As my avatar implies, I'm a fan of the classic Quest for Glory series. I'm ashamed I didn't pick this game up earlier. It's a fantastic homage to the classics, with a great deal of love and care put into the setting and story, and I'm enjoying every minute of it. It's extremely well-polished and genuinely feels like it belongs right with the Sierra originals; the only departures it makes are beneficial changes (like adding an automap feature, and displaying stat/skill gains as they're obtained) that only enhance gameplay without spoiling anything. Its mytholical base feels right in line with the various settings of the earlier ones, and it even has the same referential humor and occasional pun that would probably be annoying in any other series but fits right in here.I simply cannot offer this one enough praise.

												just like quest for glory but with a woman instead, its pretty great. i love the old sierra games so this was a throwback to the good ol days, and i think its cool they were more inclusive about a woman being the main character; a lot of those older games only gave you the option to be a dude, but i think it would have been even better if in this game they just gave you an option of being a guy or a girl, rather than having a gender forced on you. if it was an original character id understand, but if you can name a character, you should be able to choose its gender too i think.good gameplay, nice voice acting, decent replayability because the three classes have story variations and gameplay differences. its free so what do you have to lose. ;)			"
