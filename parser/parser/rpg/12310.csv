												The best adventure since Blade Runner for me. You do not use your mouse to check every pixel for that one thing you miss. Instead you have to decide how to talk to people, what to mention, what to hide, how to proceed.You don't have to find *the* right solution. You find *your* solution.I got hooked by this one.			"

												This is really a very unique adventure game, I play adventure games since the 80's and i am very amazed with this one. The game  is full of realistic dialogs and interesting characters. I am guessing over 15 hours of dialogs are in the game. Only downside is, the graphics are a bit low quality and pathing is confusing. I wish a sequel is made. I strongly advice this game to adventure gamers.			"

												""The best adventure since Blade Runner for me."" Gotta agree with this guy. This game is amazing. Great story (based on a book, if I recall correctly), nice characters, interesting puzzles, multiple endings (based on our choices). World Union (where the game takes place) reminds me a lot of  Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. As for the graphics, for a game that old I don't even think they're bad. Just a warning: see those black bars on the screenshots? Game doesn't run in widescreen. But the story is so amazing that, believe me, you won't even remember that after playing it for 30 minutesIf you're a fan of adventure games and a good, solid sci-fi story, give this game a chance. I don't think you'll regret itFor those wondering about those merely 4.4 hour of gameplay on my profile, Steam version is cut (it lacks a few sex scenes, like Fahrenheit), so I grabbed the full version elsewhere, and that's the one I've been playing			"

												One of my All-Time favorite adventure/puzzle type games. You play as World-Union Peace Officer Phoenix Wallis. It's a classic point-click adventure with plenty of puzzles to solve, but it does not stop there: The game also offers fantastic details and graphic animation for all it's many characters throughout the game. There is a lot of dialog between everyone and they all have stories to share about life in the world union as well as facts relating to your murder mystery. Some point-click adventurs are little more than just a set of puzzles, with very little actual interaction with characters and the world: This game is different! Not only will it test you with puzzles: but you'll get to have quite a large number of conversations with everyone you meet.Over all this is a VERY good game and well worth the price.			"

												Oldie but a goodie. I agree with some of the negative reviews, but over all the game is playable and entertaining for it's age.  Ten dollars is a bit much for such an old version tho and there was supposed to be a sequel for this one that never got out. Prey suffered the same fate I guess.  I give it a thumbs up for GP and I, personally, like the game and will play it again, eventhough I've ran through it quite a few times.			"

												Public Notice: I made an uncut patch for Steam (the original uncut version is no longer available for sale) which adds full subtitles, decensors the game and has bonuses, here:


Culpa Innata Uncut PatchÂ 
A Guide for Culpa Innata
By: gordonfreeman01

			This patch turns the censored Steam version of Culpa Innata to the full uncut version.		


My playtime is low even though I finished the game because I played using the uncut version executable.Now the review:Culpa Innata is a fantastic and quite unique adventure game, it does a lot of things most games don't and really deserves your time and money.Many adventure games are set in criminal investigations but none succeed in actually making you feel like an official investigator going through actual interviews non-sequentially and piecing together the evidence like Culpa Innata. You have a limited amount of time - in the game that translates to the number of people you can interview based on travel time to location - and must choose wisely whom to interview, what to ask and which leads to follow up (and report) in the game's many locations. You also have a well developed private life after the day's investigations in which some other plot threads are explored. The game is non-linear and major reveals therefore happen in a way that is specific to how you chose to advance.Another great success is the game world in which characters' scripts, motivations and way of life feel very lived-in and set in the new world order established by a subtly totalitarian regime very different from the one we live in. The main character herself sometimes says questionable things as she is an active part of the system up to a point. This does make you as the player explore this world on a deeper level than if you were controlling a detached completely-different-from-everyone protagonist meant to make you empathise with a corrupt society that cannot be accepted. The story is very interesting and while the game suitably ends the main plot there are some secret threads set up for a sequel that hopefully sees the light of day sometime.For its age, the visuals are great and the facial animation is solid. Faces having an almost photorealistic feel at times due to the way it uses film grain without being excessive. The soundtrack is nice too, fits the mood well. The voice acting is also very good. I did not encounter any game-breaking bugs or crashes when playing the game (Note: I was using the uncut version patch shared on top of this review).All in all, a fantastic adventure game I'm glad I played and highly recommend it to you all!

												This is a great first part of what should have been a series.Culpa Innata is set in the near future in a society that most of us would find very alien. The main character is an officer given the task of investigating a murder which is an event so rare in this world that everyone doen't really know how to start.The best thing about this game is the detail of the setting. 'The World Union' where the main character lives and works is a society different to any of our own. In the game you not only carry out your investigation but interact with friends and colleagues to get a proper feel of what being in such a society might be like. There's also a lot of reference to the countries not absorbed by this society and how things are different. The writers have done an excellent job of giving a richly detailed picture of this world.The main negative point of this game is that it is part 1 of 2 but part 2 never got produced. The principal aim of the game (ie solve the murder) is resolved nicely but so many more interesting questions appear on the way but never get answered. Very frustrating.Other important points:Gameplay: The game is highly non-linear. There are day cycles and you can only fit a certain number of things into each day but other than that the choice is very free. This makes the game DIFFICULT, particularly if you can't find a trigger for an event.Puzzles: A nice balance of dialogue/persuasion, logic puzzles and inventory use.Visuals: The 3D environments are well rendered but nothing very special.Voice Acting: Very good on the whole with a few terrible accents.Music: A futuristic dystopian nightmare. I turned it down when I could.			"

												This is a pretty good futuristic adventure game.  While I did play it with a general walkthrough you could definitely finish it without one.  The thing I liked most about it is that unlike the old-school adventure games (King's Quest, Space Quest, etc.) you can't really bork your game by not picking something up that you will need 5 hours later.  Definitely one that I would recommend to adventure fans, and depending on your patience, a pretty good one for others as well.			"

												At first glance it is just an ugly adventure game from some unknown Turkish developer. So why is it in my recomendation? Because of that world, which is presented. This isn't game for kids. In fact, it's really grim game full of politics and distopian visions and if you give it a chance, it can definitely surprise you...			"

												I love this game.  It's surprising that it wasn't more advertised in its time. I read that some compared it to the longest journey( which I also loved) and that culpa innate won out over it...It's got a few glitches, being an older game but the story alone is enough to keep it at the top of excellent, engrossing pure adventure games.It CAN be confusing at first and I recommend having a walkthrough handy . But it's worth sticking with and indeed playing over, as there are so many avenues available in this non linear game that it can seem like a new game upon replaying. Some of the graphics  and animations might seem dated, but one can see that much effort went into the people's faces; these are remarkable. I found myself replaying levels just to see the  amazing expressions . Similarly the voice acting is very good; especially that of  Phoenix  and her boss Dagmar Morresson. The story has at least two avenues; the first time I played, I could access the second theme, but last time , I must have missed something, as the story finished seemingly early. If you like science fiction, and murder mysteries and talking to interesting people, you will like this game. I recommend this game!			"

												I thought it would be interesting, but the ridiculous setting and conversations ruin it thoroughly. You are supposed to be solving a murder, but instead of investigating the crime scene, body, weapon, motive, etc. the main character goes around talking to everyone about their sex lives. She is also apparently only allowed to ask one or two questions per day of anyone she meets, and despite the case being confidential, she blabs about it to everyone within earshot. There is also a completely unexplained (and unconnected) subplot involving ""chaos"", which eventually leads to a meeting with a group of people living below ground that might as well be a bad trip for all the sense it makes. Wild perspective changes make it tough to get a sense of the true layout of each area, and some areas can only be found by walking to a specific unmarked location on the screen. And while the voice acting is no doubt intended to convey that in this enlightened future nobody ever raises his voice ever again, it makes the whole experience feel flat and uninvolved.			"

												There is much delicious sarcasm and humor in this game. Buy it now.too short; was expecting to read more version follows: This is science fiction at its best, but also great dramatic writing, and a well planned and executed adventure game at the most basic level. No, it's not perfect.The game studios that spend a fortune trying to be ""cinematic"" by filling a game cut scenes full of explosions, QTEs, and embarrassed A list actors should play Culpa Innata. This is a game consisting of three things: point and click adventure game exploring, interesting but not-too-difficult puzzles, and lots and lots of conversations. And it works beautifully. The game gently but inexorably pulls you forward into the next part of the plot, with just enough ""game"" to keep you involved and gentle hints presented in your diary and from friends in ways that don't feel like hints. The shocker is that the conversations are the best part. I have never been so engaged in a video game conversation. Great writing (humor! sarcasm!), strong acting, well chosen camera angles and facial expressions that (while a bit mechanical if you think too much about it) artfully telegraph believable hints, the list of things done right in the conversation scenes is getting tedious isn't it? I am occasionally reminded I am in a game, but I frequently forget as well. It's not perfect, but it works.The engine isn't perfect, but you forget that. Textures sometimes remind me of games 10 years older, the camera angles are well done but sometimes a bit jarring. The conversations have a slightly odd timing that sometimes reminds you you're playing a game, and twice I would have been stuck on puzzles without a little help from the internet. None of these things seriously get in the way of the game or my enjoyment of it, though.The game world is a Utopia; all utopia stories are really dystopia stories. This one is presented neutrally, though, and you are left to draw your own conclusions about a successful society based on an entirely selfish ideal. This creates a new context for the conversations you will be having, which are at the same time very normal and strangely alien. Sometimes I think everyone I am interviewing is lying to me. Sometimes I think everyone in this society is faking it. Sometimes I ask the right question and get an immense sense of satisfaction.Towards the end, you sometimes get railroaded along the plot without many options. Also, if you miss one of the ""things to do"", you can end up killing time in the days because of that mechanic that only lets you waste so much of a person's time per day. You can't get stuck, but you can lose, and man is it annoying to see that smug little jerk beat you to the punch after 28 hours of investigation! :)Finally, the music is great. It injects moods into different scenes. It ranges from ""this is good video game background music"" to ""must learn the name of this downtempo track so I can buy it"". I haven't yet been tempted to turn off the music and play out-of-game tunes yet.Absolutely recommended with no reservations. Many thanks to some random person in the forums whose name I have forgotten that recommended this and led to its purchase.			"

												This was a really fun and interesting game - the main character's naive dialogue and British accent makes the game. It was really fun. If you've played the Nancy Drew games from HER interactive - it's very similar to that, but it's third-person and takes place in a future. Save often and interact with your makeup kit when you're pressed for leads.There were a few annoyances, however.-clunky gameplay. While your curser usually becomes a hand when hovering over interactive items, items sometime have a small soft spot so it's hard to tell what exactly you can and can't interact with. Also, when moving between screens, sometimes you aren't in the exact spot to move so you're effectively stuck on one screen until you can get your character to activate the next screen.-while on the topic, the graphics are reminiscent of older Tomb Raider games. If you can't handle older graphics, take a pass at this game.-confusing passage of time. The game itself will tell you your location and the current time when arriving at a new destination, but you don't have a clock or anything telling you how long you're at a location - sometimes you can visit three people in a day, other times you don't have enough time. But this was a minor inconvience - at the end of the day, it doesn't really matter how long it takes you :) I ended up beating the game twenty days into the investigation. -Sometimes it is hella confusing what you're supposed to be doing. There's no small map telling you where you can go, but your character is good at being like ""nope I don't want to go there."" Diary prompts can give you some idea of what to do. Definitely glance through a UPS-Hints walkthrough to give you a better idea of what to do.-Dialogue. When asking questions, a small prompt gives you a small glimpse of what your character will say, but it can be hard to steer the conversation where you want it to go.All in all, it has a few annoyances, but a kick-butt female lead character who is charming in her own right makes the game totally worth it. I ended with a 93 HDI, Nix would be so envious ;)			"

												Seems like it might be a good game. Looks good and seems interesting. Unfrotunately it is useless and unplayable for me. It says it has Captions, There is a captions option. But the major game breaking problem is the captions are only in the cut scenes. Given the point and click style of gameplay  and no in game captions makes this very difficult.  Click  somethign and the character tells you about it. Probelm is, I am a Deaf/HOH gamer..... So, like i said, rather than simply havign in-game captions, this game speaks to tell you what you need to know... Which is completely usless for me.What a shame, looks like it could be a great game if it was playable..			"

												After finishing my first playthrough, I wanted more! Would've definitely played the sequel if there was one (for real, what a bummer it was to find out the follow up just died in production).The game has many good points, as long as your expectations are reasonable. The setting and story might seem a little lack-luster, but that's only because it was supposed to be something of a introduction into this world. Still, the plot is juicy enough to keep you invested, and the characters within quite enjoyable. Sometimes you want to interact ""incorrectly"" with them just to hear what they say next.Another plus for me was the difficulty level of the puzzles. Some of them were quite tricky, and I admit to looking up a few pointers online, but not frustrating enough to make me stop playing. There was a genuine sense of satisfaction that I got when figuring things out that triggers even more interesting facts and possible scenarios in the game. Being a detective in this quirky but cool Sci-Fi world is actually fun! Who knew?			"
