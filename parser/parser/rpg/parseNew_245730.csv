												I loved the original. I have many fond memories of it. I loved the soundtrack of the original. This game isn't even worth the effort of shovelling it on my lawn and I'm fairly certain if I did it would kill it. This game isn't necissarily bad if you've never played ""Flashback: The Quest for Identity"" but if you're seeking the nostalgia of your childhood, this game will♥♥♥♥♥♥you off very quickly. The only thing this game has in common with the original is that the levels are very slightly similar and the main character's name is Conrad. The end. The game felt very ""dumbed down"". There are popups on the hud EVERYWHERE that say, ""Go here. You can climb this. Talk to him. There's only one path you can take but we're going to tell you to take it anyway!"" Luckily, those can be turned off. I decided to play the game on medium and found out immediately that the difficulty settings were made for console♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ There's a health bar, light falling damage, enemies attempt to tickle you to death, and healing stations are closer together than Starbucks. They also tried to add an RPG aspect by allowing you to gain experience, level up, and spend points in different skills. In a few ways this is good but mostly makes me ask, ""Why the hell would anyone add RPG aspects to a Prince of Persia like?""The controls feel similar to the original but they added an extra jump button and an arc style aiming system. The controls were definitely made for dual thumbstick controllers and then (horribly) modified for pc. Aiming is done by moving the mouse up and down to adjust angle and then moving the mouse left and right to switch sides. This gets annoying when you're trying to adjust your angle and accidently move your mouse too far to one side, causing Conrad to turn around and take it in the butt. If you have a controller to use with the game then it might not be that bad but mouse and keyboard controls get frustrating.Bug time! This game contains bugs. There were a few times while aiming that the mouse would become locked in one place and I had to right click furiously to get control back. There are also times when grabing onto a platform would cause Conrad to get stuck and stand in mid air next to the platform. I only encountered this a few times and it did not deter me from the game but then again it never happened during a part where it actually mattered.Playing this game does bring back warm nostalgic memories in the sense that I want to go dig out my old SNES and play the original game. Overall I feel like someone who played through the original once when it released is attempting to remake the game on age old memories. The only consolation I have is that I purchased this game during a Steam sale and didnt pay full price.			"

												If you played old Flashback and liked it, the only thing why you can check this game, to remind storyline and watch cutscenes in 3D. All other aspects of the game will disappoint you greatly. If not, just pass, because it just ugly mutant pretending to be a good game.Don't want to compare it with old game, it's like compare Alexander the Great with bum Alexander, just because they have same names.So, just pros and cons.Pros first, not many of them, really:+ UE3 doing it's job well, so graphics there not bad+ Customisable interface+ Few cutscenes, not perfect, but may be watched onceand cons:- controls, devs tried to make hybrid between old scheme and modern, ummm, they failed- aiming, you can turn your gun only in few angles- difficulty, it's easy as hell (if do not count controls) , you can easily go face to face with 2 or more enemies and kill them all- stupid air drones-enemy placement and respawning- useless levels and skills system- Too talkative Conrad, he spam stupid phrases too often- All other cutscenes, especially ending in the Death Tower- Changes in story (lost and found girl for example)- Even empty jungle looks more alive, then futuristic ""should-be-overcrowded"" city- Level design- Awful voiceover, I tried english and russian, it's like choosing between bad and  worse- Interface, overloaded with not needed information (at least most of it can be turned off in settings)- Old version of Flashback included in the game, looks more like a joke in this arcade machine frame and without sound at all- SFX...enough?nah, add also Uplay client as 3rd party DRM. (You need to install game, install uplay, update uplay, close it and  finally run the game again)			"

												As a fan of the original game on the SNES (or Genesis, depending on your choice of console back then), I'm honestly pretty disappointed in this remake. The character's controls are completely different from the original game, which were slower and more deliberate and catered more towards platforming and careful combat, and yet the environments and enemy design did not change in order to reflect the change in controls. I found myself constantly running myself off ledges due to not being able to control my character's run speed, but I was also able to float around in mid-air and catch ledges in impossible and goofy-looking ways, so there was never any danger of dying due to fall damage. Fall damage was instant death in the original game, encouraging you to think about how to move about environments, and every stage had every jump and platform in the perfect position, and everything was exactly where it was supposed to be. In this game, all the platforms seem entirely worthless, and there is usually more than one way to reach the goal by simply hopping around randomly between platforms, and there doesn't seem to be a very intelligent path you need to follow in order to complete areas. Enemy placement also seems entirely random, especially in the first stage where annoying flying robots would shock you at incredibly inconvenient points, sometimes even during an autosave, causing you to constantly reload from death while having a stupid drone poke you in the eye. The combat is also irritating and unbalanced. Enemies are almost always attacking you, and there are few options when it comes to running away or attacking. Enemies with guns will shoot you while you try to climb up a platform to safety, as well as the flying drones shocking you and never giving you a decent opportunity for escape. It seems to me that the developers didn't realize that the slow, deliberate controls in the original also required enemies to be limited as well in order for the combat to be made fair. Even though you are given less limited movement in this game, you are downright crippled in several common situations, which makes it incredibly easy for enemies to exploit you and kill you in very cheap ways.Another grating annoyance in this game for me is the main character's dialogue and voice-actor. He constantly monologues to himself in order to give gameplay hints and witty banter, which is entirely unnecessary and really ruins the atmosphere. The dialogue in the original was simple, straightforward, and reflected the atmosphere of the game as being tense and dangerous. Having your character constantly crack annoying jokes when doing anything from using a healing station to killing an enemy really ruins the atmosphere, and I simply don't understand why they thought it was necessary to write the character in such a way. Another annoyance was having constant gameplay hints and camera pans to show you objects and enemies in order to hold your hand through the game. Game design like this is simply insulting and certainly does not follow the original game's example of clever, intelligent environment and gameplay design that encourages the player to think and experiment with the environment in order to solve problems.Besides simple design choices that I didn't enjoy, the game has a lot of dissappointing physics and gameplay glitches that make the game feel really cheap. Several times I would watch as my character moonwalks several feet after being killed by an enemy before finally falling to the floor, sometimes even walking on air off of a platform, and one glitch even made me unable to sneak up on enemies and knock them out (something you are required to do in order to complete some sneaking missions), due to the button prompt not appearing consistently.Ironically, in my case, Uplay allows you to immediately unlock and play the original game without completing any achievements, which I would prefer, simply because this game is very flawed and simply does not live up to the design of the original. Speaking of Uplay, this program succeeds in making playing Ubisoft games through Steam entirely cumbersome and annoying, which gives me one more reason not to reccommend this game.If you want a better puzzle-based platformer in the vein of Prince of Persia or Blackthorne, just play the original game, or any other game in the same genre. This game simply fails to deliver such an experience, instead trying to offer a shallow action experience with many inappropriate or broken mechanics.			"

												I was warned/told point blank not to buy this game, but being hard-headed I did anyways on the most recent sale. It was a huge mistake. There is pretty much nothing redeeming about the product. Let me break it down for you: the area design is bizarre and exploring is both frustrating and tedious. The combat is imprecise and the enemies (on Normal difficulty) rapidly become bullet sponges. The platforming is even worse. The jumping animation is downright laughable and is hard to predict. I ended up skipping the cutscenes due to the painfulness of of the story, writing and voice acting. Some of the level art is nice, but it isn't worth suffering through the rest to see it.I regret purchasing the game and I wish I had listened to the recommendation to avoid it. The demo doesn't really reveal many of the issues of the game so considered yourself warned. "

												From the publishing house responsible for publishing games that you have bought based on novel to game adaptations of a certain new york times best selling author, comes a remake of a game you probably haven't played before, because you're all like twelve, and don't know what's good.  Flashback is a remake of a much better game by french publisher 'Delphine' and it was a god damn masterpiece.  This game is still very much french, but obviously tries to capitalize on the call of duty dollars by having the character shoot all of the mans instead of solving all of the puzzles or discovering all of the mysteries.  the game is designed pretty close to the original actually, besides different item placement and much more numerous enemies to shoot with your dutycaller9000.  The story is also very much intact, though this time done through full motion video cutscenes with voice actors.  The game is still pretty nice, and besides too much shooting early on, and about the same ammount of shooting later on, it is more or less faithful to the original.  If you disagree, the original is included with this game so it's like you get that too incase you don't like this one.  If you play this game, be sure to play on hard, as easy and normal dificulties are ♥♥♥♥ing garbage.  I hope that ubisoft has plans to develop and re-release a remake of the sequel 'Fade to Black' so I can complain about that too.			"

												Good game, is not that bad, but it is bad :( , I am a fan from the original Flashback game, and I am glad to own this newest version, love the graphics and the music, but there are so many flaws, I really wish the developers could program the game better, they really missed a huge chance here. Apart from the programing flaws, there are so many control issues, specially if you play with an Xbox 360 wireless controller and there are many crashes, if you load the checkpoint several times (playing hard so you die a lot), the game crash every 4 times you load the same checkpoint, and sometimes the game just crash. There is the original flashback game that can be unlocked, but you play in a tiny screen, plus there are sound issues. An SNES emulator will do a better job.Good part is that playing and ending the game in Hard is really a challenge and can be a fun, graphics are good too, and music.			"

												Around ten minutes of gameplay and I am both impressed yet♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off by this remake which is well know for it's beautiful graphics for 16bit and 32bit consles, the puzzles were good, the difficulty was fair (Even if you put it on hard mode) and the layout of the levels were quite fine and easy to navigate.This game however pisses on some of those features while being impressive in diffirent ways. Difficulty is toned down; for example a simple elevator puzzle near the beginning; there were two triggers per floor; one to move the elevator to allow you to go up while forcing you to jump over the one between that and the elevator to set you back a little, did they really need to dumb that puzzle down? No they did not. Puzzles are dumbed down and the level design feels rushed.I like the gun aiming system (Use a mouse, not a joypad for that) but then the tasks that require you to do it do not require thought as the solution is shoved into your face thinking you are lacking a brain. Graphics are quite nice but the background could have used more work but then again, level design feels rushed but I do like how the new conrad looks.I'm going to be honest here; the game is flawed yet enjoyable, but I don't reccomend it because it's my review and I hate it when a reboot/remake dumbsdown simple puzzles and rushes level design to a mess that looks cramped as hell; leveling up is a stupid mistake seieng as the original game was intended for puzzle/survival than being combat-based; I stil lreccomendd it if you want a good platformer that feels new/original that doesn't involve mario or any indie developers at all but if you want a real challenge; go play the original.Update: The 1993 edition is god awful, it's not the original Flashback at all; just some rushed recreation of the dos game with no music/sound at all and awkwardly placed controls you can't map. To make the recreation worse; they have it look like you are playing it on an arcade machine powered on outside in the rain with an effect to make it look like an outdated arcade machine (Thank god the 1993 edition is free).

												Other than the name and the borrowed characters, the game has very little in common with the original. Hoping to get a blast from the past, or close to it, but this game never really managed to do it for me. Controls are unprecise, graphics are updated. The original game still definitely has an 'edge' compare to this one which feels very 'ordinary' at best. It is definitely a shame as knowing the game has been made by the original developers, this could have been so much more.Sometimes classics are best left as they are.A good point though; You get a copy of the original game (Although you cannot play it full screen it seems).

YouTube™ Video: Flashback video review - retro gaming evolved 

			Views: 514		

			http://cramgaming.com - a look at Ubisoft's remake of the 1992 classic game Flashback which is available now on XBLA, PSN and PC platforms.		

Flashback Video Review text version:Flashback is a cool game in looks and concept  that is ultimately let down by some awkward controls and gameplay elements that could have been better implemented. With a bit more core content, the game could have extended its presence, but as it stands, it's a short experience not likely to entice players beyond a single run through. For nostalgia's sake it's worth a punt, but some elements such as the voice acting might leave you a bit underwhelmed. The price might seem right at under £8, but in terms of value there's enough here to get your monies worth - but that will largely depend on how big a fan you are.Score 6/10 - Review by Robert Cram			"

												No idea why anyone is giving this a bad review then claiming they were ""a big fan of the original"". I suppose they were remembering it better than it actually was, kinda like when I tried to rewatch Blakes 7 a while ago. Loved it whilst it was on, but now I realise it was utter cack. Anyway, to me, this is a fitting tribute to a game I have very fond memories of. Its still fun to play and a damn site prettier than the original. Yes, there's too many signs telling you what to do, but the absence of those signs in the original was sometimes a royal pain in the colon when you were trying to figure out the next bit.I got this for two quid at sale price. Two Quid!!! You'd have to be a right po-faced♥♥♥♥♥♥to complain about a nice wee game like this for two quid. I have to recommend this game, despite it being associated with Ubisoft. Get it, and even if you only play it through once, you've got more than your money's worth! C'mon you miserable sods, let yourselves go and enjoy a bit of nostalgia!			"

												By playing Flashback I was hoping to get a nostalgia trip and a happy reunion with Conrad. After six hours I wouldn't say it's the best game I've played, not either a game I put a lot of time in, but I liked getting flashbacks to a bygone era. The steering is more action oriented than the original and the story is changed a bit. I bought the game on sale on Steam and the low price justifies the six hours of gaming fun (completed it on Normal difficulty). I don't think I'll be playing through all of the achievments in the game. However, recommended for a challenging and nostalgic gaming session.			"

												I loved Flashback back on the Amiga when I was a child. I never got through the game, but that wasn't important for me though. And when I heard that Ubisoft made a Remake of this game, I thought I might give it a shot. You can't out these two games together, though. They have the same name and nearly the same Story with a couple of little, very little differences. But, when I got to the end of this game, I was like ""Yep... Now I want to play Fade to Black once again...""I don't want to say that the Flashback-Remake is good, but it's not bad either.It can make a lot of fun, when you get a hang of all that little bugs of the game. (Yep, this game sadly is full of bugs...)When you get the game for a cheap price, I would suggest that you give it a shot!Or you can play Flashback-Classic for a little Childhood memory.			"

I had memories of the origianl, which i loved and had high hopes for this when it came out, but soon found out memories should remain in the past. This was a nightmare. Awful controls that sometimes work and sometimes dont, i use a Xbox controller for pc so i expect it should, to dreadful voice actiing and a glitchy mess that didnt allow me to load a save once i hit experience level 15. i gave up only to try again recenlty thinking maybe things have changed.They havent. All problems are still there, including not being able to load anything once i hit level 15! uninstalling now in frustration as i dont expect ubisoft will fix anything, i mean why fix a game nobody wants to play?! ths best thng they could do is remove the POS from the store to prevent others from buying it. but they wont so im tell you DONT BUY THIS.

												I like this incarnation of Flashback. It's better than the original in many ways. Better graphics and audio. Excellent cut scenes and voiceovers. Better menus and configuration options. It even includes a bunch of hints and tips that help you learn the basic mechanics of the game. You can turn the hints off in settings if you want. You can even download a copy of the original game.As the description says, it was created by the same team who created the original game. Who better? It's not intended to be a remake of the original but a reimagining. That means it's supposed to be different. Some elements of the original game are missing while new elements exist which some fans may like and some may not.I remember the original game. It was a great game overall but it wasn't perfect. The artwork and sound fx were great, the character animation was very impressive for a 2D side scroller and the story was very compelling. Level design was sometimes confusing. There are a few places where it's easy to get stuck if you can't see where to go or what to do. Simple tasks and puzzle slaving is fun but combat was frustrating. The bad guys are fast and tough and they will kill you if your movement timing isn't spot on. I must have died a thousand times before I finally finished that game. Uh!			"

												The original was one of my favorites from the Sega days, and I was very pleased with this ""re-imagining"" as they call it. It keeps the spirit of the original (and a full working copy in-game).  While I love my old games, I'm kinda tired of every game-maker thinking they have to do everything 8-bit, so the new look is refreshing. And the gameplay is close enough to the original that the title hasn't swithed genres, but new enough to be fun and interesting. Diffinitely worth the price of admission.			"

But not comparing with the old masterpiece: the graphics here is very disturbing: backgrounds are so bright that it is really difficult to concentrate on the action - it's even a pain to spot the main character sometimes. Especially in DeathTower and in Homeworld - all those lights and public or purple slime at the background are super annoying.			"

												Flashback is back. One of the coolest games from the days of Sega G is re-imagined on Steam. Complete with achievements and improved graphics (everything looks so much more real and alive). If you liked the original you will be exited by this remake. Flashback is sci fi cyberpunk at its best. Retrieve your memories, travel across space and thwart an alien invasion in a stunning futuristic setting. It is mostly the same storyline but has a few bike races that were not in the original. Also, check out the cool power ups and in game tutorial stage. Platform style shooter with futuristic devices (force fields, teleporters, glasses from the movie They Live, holocubes, (watch out for those antimatter fields), and more). Clearly an underated game.			"

												Despite a slew of negative review, my nostalgia - and a sharply discounted price - convinced me to give it a chance. And you know what, it wasn't half bad. My biggest complaint would have to be with its voice-acting, which was just awful. Otherwise I felt the game was a decent-enough remake. I think a lot of the problems other reviewers had with the title was that the original game wasn't all that great to begin with, and the remake did little to fix the original's gameplay or narrative problems. Then again, the reviewers would also have cried foul had the remake strayed too far from the original, leaving the developers in a no-win situation.Flashback HD isn't a great game, but it's a good remake of an average title. It gave me a chance to play a title of yesteryear that I semi-fondly remembered with modern graphics that worked on a modern system. Not expecting more than that, I came away pleased with my miniscule investment of time and money.			"

												I was a big fan of the original on the SNES, so I was expecting a straight up butchering of a classic. What I found though was that this game isn't as bad as a lot of people were making out. Sure, it holds your hand a LOT, but you can turn pretty much all of the assistance off.  The voice acting is absolutely horrible though and just pure cringeworthy at times - 'let's party!' when using a health restore machine. Seriously, Ubisoft? I bought it for 1.99 on sale and I'd say it definitely was worth that price. I'm only up to the first level where you return to Earth, and as stated, it's not a straight up remake, more an re-imagining of the original title. It definitely has it's issues though, like in the Death Tower levels, I couldn't use the health/grenade machines to refill, unless I moved the camera to be dead centre - if you didn't do that, pressing X did nothing.  So yeah, it has a few bugs and quirks and the voice acting is dreadful, but it's worth picking up on sale if you're a fan of the original.			"

												Aaahh, a game from the dark ages, where 640kb was more than enough RAM, the CPUran at 25(50) or 33(66) MHz depending on whether the turbo button was activated or not and the graphics had 256 different colours.This game also reminds me about the fabolus music score, originaly tracked in MOD by Audiomonster (aka Raphaël Gesqua)Flashback was originaly an old dos game, published in 1992 by Delphine Soft./US Gold. But VectorCell made a remake of it in 2013 (published by UbiSoft) So, the main genre of this old game is action. If anyone mentions the term 2D platformer from the 90's, to me immediately come to mind the following three titles: Prince of Persia, Another World and Flashback. The game is situated into the 22nd century, when a scientist Conrad B. Hart, finds strange machinations with human DNA in a IEG (former United Nations) - a company that rules the whole world. Each power is based on a herd of docile sheep that go to where it should be and whoever falls outside of this instrument becomes a little uncomfortable and the problem affected even our otherwise very sympathetic scientist, who is also the hero of this game. To fight with enemies you use your gun, but you can also use objects from the environment, such as stones, which you can use to hurt your enemies.All in all, great game, great remake, great timewaster (as all games), but i might be a bit over nostalgic about this game (it was my youth) "

												I pop a huge stiffy whenever a Delphine game is brought up.  Out of This World/Another World was a rare pinnacle of side-scrolling platformer design, the sort by which few tried to emulate because it was so outside of the ordinary.  This small French company is practically unknown outside of the greater Europe area and I am very sad by this.  They released a game called Flashback which was the ""spiritual successor"" to OotW/AW.  The game plot isn't related, but it uses practically the same kind of gameplay mechanic and rendered everything in the same visually unique roto-scoped flat-shaded polygon engine.  The game has the plot of the movie ""They Live"" merged with ""Bladerunner"" and it was amazing for its time.Fast forward to here and now.  And this is a spirtual successor to Flashback.  It's a completely 3d remake of the original game.And oh boy, does it stink.  The controls are awkward and unforgiving.  It tries to have mouse-aim gun play mixed with cardinal-direction-only D-pad control scheme of the original game.  My character can only walk left/right and change elevation at select points, but I can fire my gun in a 360 arc?  It just feels odd and isn't well thought out, particularly since some enemies can ambuse you from any angle now instead of in pre-defined locations as in the original.The voice acting is bad, the sound effects are mediocre, and the visuals are nice at points but feel very flat.  All in all, this game plays and looks like a fan-made remake that somehow got access to a bit of a budget.			"

												I was willing to give this a shot out of fondness for the original, and a hopeful feeling left after watching the trailers, but it just felt sadly lacking.Visually it has some good touches for game locked to a 2D plane, but it seems the developers mistakenly assumed that better technology/base engines make for better games. The reason why Flashback and other similar 'chunky' platform adventure games worked (like Blackthorne) was actually because of it's limitations. Because you had to be immobile to fire and could only do so from a standing or crouching point, you had a firm grasp of the basics of combat. Because you had to get a short sprint before you jumped to vault over gaps of certain sizes, or you had to be at a certain point underneith a ledge to try grab it, you could gauge the input necessary at a moment's notice. This modern remake removes the limitations and attempts for a more free-flowing experience, with full-rotating aim and more responsive controls, which sound great at first, but it removes a big part of the foundation the adventure was built on : the rules of play. Rules are what define a game's challenge, and if you make them more lax, then there has to be new challenges with a similar feeling of reward. Unfortunately, the floaty feeling from the platforming and the more fluid motion and combat just make it feel watery in comparison.This game falls into that pit between nostalgic form and new-wave revival. It achieves the strong points of neither, but seems to have accumulated some negatives from both. It's far from a terrible game and appears to be quite polished, but it just lacks any real impact or immediate enjoyment beyond ticking objective boxes.			"

  God-Awful  I have fond memories of playing the original version of Flashback back when I was a kid, and I can remember how fondly I enjoyed it (just as I enjoyed Another World for very similar reasons).These classic games are hard: there's no way around that  - In the cases of a lot of classic games, as with a few modern releases, however this does not  detract from the game still being fun too (as is ideal).Many great games that are hard, are also fun: Dark Souls for example is a series renowned for how brutally difficult it is, and that game series is famously unrelenting until the player learns to ""git gud"" and adapt to enemies by either learning fast or to die trying.Conversely,  this game  can only be described as being off-putting to the a degree/level only akin to ""a pile of w&nk stained socks once worn by a man with BO and fungi problems"".The game is far beyond broken ...   I say this with the utmost sadness, because this 'remaster' has stained a once-classic game's legacy.These issues are at the stage where the game has:  Numerous Crashes to Desktop (CTDs)  AI so bad that the developers remastering it just decided to make your gun a pea-shooter at high difficulties to emulate real challenge  Faulty (to the point where I question its inclusion) stealth mechanics  $hite checkpoint system that are almost as bad as those seen in GTA IV (one death can force the player to lose huge amounts of progress and even collectibles)  A pointless collectible system  A genuinely alienating levelling and upgrade system  Voice acting that makes me wonder if the story was genuinely more engaging in 1992I'd even go so far as to wager that Ubisoft 'relied' on CTDs for the user to quit the game, as even *that* simple feature of quitting properly fails and revers to another crash to get you back.And after all of thise, my biggest gripe with a game is still the bloody DRM!- Users should not be expected to enter a key and run the game through Uplay of all bare♥♥♥♥♥♥end software after they have bought the game through Steam's far more acceptable DRM system anyway.TL;DR  -  The existence of this insufferable remake genuinely saddens me			"

												If we pretend for a second that the original didn't exist, you're left with one of the most generic and bland platformers out there. It feels and looks dated too, like something you'd find in a bargain bin back in the mid 00s. The mechanics are run of the mill, the level design is boring at best, crude at worst, the sound design is all over the place and the dialogue is cringeworthy.It's just one of those 5/10 games, it's competent and decent, fully playable (if you can bear the somewhat awkward mousecontrol), but it does little to distinguish itself, and just blends in with the crowd instead. You might want to pick it up really cheap if you're into the theme, plus, you get the original game as a bonus, although it's somewhat awkward to play because it's done on an ingame console and there are no rebindable keys, so you might as well emulate it.Overall there are way better games out there, so if you're a person with limited sparetime, you'd be safe giving this one a pass.

												A very solid remake of a good side scroller. Good music. Good graphics. Eh story, but you can't expect much story from a side scroller from the early 90s. The only real complaint is that when using keyboard and mouse, the targetting system has a tendency to lock up so that you cannot aim. It may function better with a controller.			"

												I have just played the first level but I will give more statement later.Many do complain about the controls of the game, that's totally nonsense, don't listen to these hater noobs.The ""analog"" control is super smooth and even better than in the original, just convince yourself by playing the demo!The only thing that may be annoying is the aiming because you're not able to aim accurate enough, but that is not a reason to entirely hate the game since therefor the movement is, like said before, very accutrate and Flashback is a jump n run too afterall.

												FLASHBACK IS BACK!!!There are very few games that make me smile when I remember them. One of those is Diablo, by example, one more was Shadowrun that was recently reissued (and that I've enjoyed a lot again) and, one of the most loved was FLASHBACK.While ANOTHER WORLD (recently reissued, still not bought or played) was a frustrating experience (you were dead in a second every time), FLASHBACK memory brings to me a bag of good feelings and recalls.This time UNREAL engine (is this the new standard for great games?)  is powering the game and, game is fidel to what it was but with better graphics.Even that this is a 2D game, platform-alike, this is not the typical platform game but, a real action adventure with a solid story line.Comfortable to play and, as smooth as it was from the beginning.You can play the up-to-dated version (which just graphically improves the older version) AND the ORIGINAL 1993 FLASHBACK !!!!Just a flaw (and in my honest opinion a big one for me), there is no way to bind cursor keys for movement and, there is no way to re-assign default mouse controls.If you don't have a mouse with central button, you will be not able to finish some level.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!.If you liked the original, you will love this one, also.If you never played Flashback, are you gonna miss one of the most significative games of the history?.

												Highly recommand this game regarding of what ever other reviewer are writing. I was an early fan of the original and was still a reference as how a game should be made.  First thing people should keep in mind when playing a remake is keeping some of the original feature to link it to old memories for the hardcore fan and still plant in some new feature that will attract  new player to the franchise. The shity jump is one of the original feature and i was more than happy to see Conrad jump that way. If puting new enemy and turn it a little more toward the action genre is required to attract the young then why not, as some other as mention the story is intact and THAT is the important. The only real complain i can make and im not the only one, is the voice acting and im pretty sure a couple a guy could put a mode online to change that completely . And BTW my main language is french and i would have preffer more american style of voice acting but that is personal.In the end if you like the original you MUST buy this game and play it as a gift to your little self.You Fanboy are never happy with anything!

												Just played a few minutes into it to take a look. So far its nice and I like it.The best point so far is, it includes the original. The worst point so far, its displayed on a mini-ingame-display in mud-color. Tell me, if there is a pos to zoom it fullscreen.We will see how awefull the changes and bugs will be. However, since it has build-in thumb down (Uplay), what can I vote other than thumb down, no matter how i recommend it?! ;)			"

												When the original game from 1993 manages to have a more compelling storyline and more interesting characters, YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING WRONG.Huge fan of the original game on the Sega MegaDrive/Genesis, and I got this because I thought ""it may not be perfect, but it can't be THAT bad...""...wrong.The controls are horrible, the graphics look like every other run-of-the-mill Xbox Live arcade game, and honestly I liked the story of the original better.They changed a few things too many in my taste (Ian, Death Tower, final level).The final level was a JOKE compared to the original. If you had to fight more than one Morph at a time, you were in SERIOUS trouble. It was possible, but with a lot of dodging, moving and constantly getting a little hit in here and there. Here though? Not so much.The level up system seems tacked on.The last two stages were a repetetive chore to get through, and only because I wanted to see the disappointing ending.Anyway, this may seem like a huge rant, and...well, it is, but the game did have one or two redeeming factors. It looked ok. Conrad was ok as long as he wasn't talking smack. The hoverbike minigame was nice enough.The rest though? Mmh. No. Would not buy it again if I had the choice.			"

												If you look at pretty much any professional review of this, it's treated like it's horrible.It is however not that bad, if you keep your expectations in check (it's not got the same impact as the original), and is to a certain extent actually a fairly faithful remake. Definitely a fun game to pick up and play, although maybe not for long sittings at a time.The voice acting is terrible though, what were they thinking?! "

												I have played the original Flashback on my SNES and loved it very much. I hoped this  game was the 2016 version of that original game... but sadly it isn't. Graphics are oke, but gameplay is a little bit unresponsive and repetitive. Main storyline is very short, finished it in 4 hours.  And most important, it does not have the vibe of the original game.I bought the game in the steam sale for a few €, so won’t complain too much. Overall wouldn’t recommend to buy it for the full price. "

												I can't rate the game because I have not been able to play it so far. Forgot to check the publisher, it comes from Ubi so you need their crapware to play. I tried to give it a chance since I enjoyed the original from 20 years ago, however this time Uplay won.Created my uPlay account, the login is crappy. I have wasted too much time resetting the password because it won't allow me in.From now on I'll double check any game before purchase to make sure it's not from ubi.			"

												Bought the game and after downloading on steam, some sort of separate Ubisoft log in comes up. I have to register an account with Ubisoft to play this offline game? Tried to make an account. ""We're unable to create your account right now as a Ubisoft server is unavailable. Uh. What? So basically Ubisoft is selling a singler player game which they're forcing everyone who buys to register an account for, then not providing the means to complete registration, thus denying people who buy this game from playing it. So they're basically just ripping people off. I will never buy another Ubisoft title for the aggravation Ubisoft has given me over this simple video game. Pound Sand, Ubisoft.			"

												Flashback was one of my favourite titles on the Amiga & one of the few I actually managed to finish in my younger years.I found this remake to be an interesting reimaging of the game which I don't think takes away too much from the original but one which which may not be for everyone. I personally enjoyed very much & I am glad this actually exists. Big plus that the original game is included in this remake.My only gripe with the game is unsurprisingly Uplay but I'm not letting it come much in the way of my judgement.			"
