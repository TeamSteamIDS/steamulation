												Ring Runner follows FTL into the illusive zone of flawless indie game glory.  It is almost criminal that it took this game as long as it did to get on Steam.  Addictive gameplay with an incredibly smooth UI, and a staggering amount of flexibility, with a depth and sophistication that will continue to surprise you.  There are countless ships, with a fitting system of a quality you will be hard pressed to find outside of EVE Online.  The story and dialogue is surprisingly good, at times goofy, often trippy and surreal and almost always hilarious.  The graphics are absolutely beautiful, proof that it is not always necessary to melt your video card.One comment which might be helpful, and which is only negative depending on your preferences, is in regard to how episodic the game is.  I did not necessarily expect an ""open world"" but did expect some greater degree of openness to the campaign than I encountered.  There really is none, the campaign is very episodic.  Initially this may seem like a significant down side, but it gradually picks up and at least provides you with a little bit of choice.  A campaign and maps with significantly more ""openness"" I think would easily have pushed this onto a short list of some of the best games ever made, but as is Ring Runner is truly a jewel worth far more than the measily $10 they are asking for.

												A week ago I honestly hadn't heard of this game, I bought it on a whim, a longing for SPAZ2, and being a huge fan of RPG/Shooter type games, came together at a moment of weakness.I was completely blown away, it was the most fun I've had in a game all year, and probably my favorite shooter of all time, a title previously held by Tyrian. I just can't praise you enough, it was fun the entire way. I just finished the campaign, and I really just loved it. The ship control is a bit wonky at first, but after a few missions you should have it under control. And after a few hours you'll be amazed at some of the stuff you can pull off in speedy ships. The humor and writing style of the game might not be for everyone, but I really wouldn't let that stop you from buying the game. Remove all the words and the game is still an amazingly solid Shooter with a huge amount of customization, and balanced so that no ship type ever feels like the end all ship, I spent a solid 25 hours beating the game on Sage(normal) and will probalby put another 10-15 hours unlocking and customizing my ship.Seiously, if you liked SPAZ, Tyrian, Raptor, or any shooter game in general buy this game. You won't regret it.			"

												This is literally my favorite game ever. (Yes, I have played a ton of games from many genres.) It is so because of its unique combination of story, humor, space, RPG style, gameplay variety, strategy, and newtonian (correct) physics. The game is completely unlike anything I have ever before played or since. I have now played almost 250 hours, and it is the only game I have ever purchased twice just in case anything ever happened to steam I would not want to lose this game. I also really appreciate how clean the game is—that when my children play it I won’t have to worry about swearing or anything like that.The main story is well written and takes about 30 to 40 hours to complete. Although it is primarily space combat, the game also features circuit racing, stealth missions, tower defense, many rpg elements, zombie survival, arcade games, a plethora of cultural references, fast food, and nonlinear gameplay -- all skillfully integrated into the story. On top of that, the well done ship customization makes the game almost endlessly replayable. $10 for the best game ever.			"

												I've never seen a game where you watch the devs descend into madness (read: awesomeness) as the game progresses.I played this for a few hours, wasn't too enthusiastic, and forgot about it until a few months later.Big mistake. I'd stopped at precisely the moment the developers stopped caring about what a game was ""supposed"" to be like, and what they actually WANTED to.One minute I'm shooting space cops in a clunker spaceship. Next thing you know, I'm going back to the drawing board and building spaceships that should be IMPOSSIBLE so I can blow up a galaxy's Parent-Teacher Association and bill them for Dvorak keyboards.And it just KEEPS GOING. Forget ""characters you care about""--most of the games you hear people say that about don't HAVE characters. You know what's a REAL character? A REAL character says ""this mission has been boring, let's pretend the mission objective was to get in the arena anyway"" because THAT'S WHAT YOU WOULD DO IF YOU HAD LASERS.The game opens up the hangar and you get bogged down in minutiae because you don't know what all those numbers mean--at first. A few hours later, you're saying stuff like ""okay, I'll make this ship out of paper but it'll be REALLY FAST, and by going fast it recharges shields to cover the duct tape armor, but I'LL NEED TO ALWAYS BE FIRING so my generators don't overload because then the enemy could tap me and make me EXPLODE.""Since the ships at the beginning suck, they're not much fun to pilot under the game's Newtonian physics. It's like if all you knew about Gran Turismo was driving a 1970s Volkswagon. But after a certain point? Hotrods with lasers, baby. Hotrods with DRILLS and SPACE MACES YOU SWING AROUND. You want turrets? How does 19 TURRETS, 1 SPACESHIP sound?I'd say something trite like ""the game goes NUTS after a certain point and I love it forever, forgive the weak start"" but you know what? No. NOPE. Even at the game's worst, before the plot and ship customization gets great, it's still only as 'bad' as pretty much any game out there. I want you to sit down and ask yourself: is this other game I'm going to play gonna give me a SPACE MACE?No, no it's not. Ain't happenin'.Toss that 'other game' out the airlock. Now.			"

												Just completed the campaign and must say this is a very well done game, solid 5/5 as my complains are trivial compared to the quality of everything else.It does take a bit of investment to get into as the ships have A LOT of controls which is just plain confusing and disorienting until you get the hang of it, but the depth when you do is impressive.The story is also surprisingly deep and well thought out (and long in a good way).  The maps in each segment of the game are quite small with not a lot to do besides fight (you could say it is designed around pure tactics with no strategy) but that aspect is so well done that I wasn't bothered by it.A complaint I do have is that restarting when dying in the campaign is often annoying because it sends you through the dialogue each time.  There is an option to skip the dialogue, but it only skips a section, if there are multiple (with camera animations between), you have to wait until the next pops up to skip it, so it can take many seconds to retry (which might not sound like much but when you are on a difficult mission with lots of dying, it is quite frustrating).  On top of that, the loading of each mission is quite slow, and something as simple as returning to the hanger to switch ships for trying another approach requires waiting for the loading again despite your ship being the only thing that changed.I also experienced frustration many times with the turret deployables that cause friction as well as those that grab hold of your ship.  These can cause you to get ""stuck"" in the middle of a huge swarm of opponents, putting you at nearly hopeless odds with very little you can do, so I think the presence of these ""weapons"" does more to detract than enhance the game, though with enough experience you would probably learn whatever subtle tricks are needed to avoid them.Overall, though, very high quality, very well thought out, lots of depth, and plenty of fun to play, certainly a gem to have found.I haven't played multiplayer but I would imagine it would work very well with the design of this game.

												This is one of those incredible games that never got the attention it deserved. The customisation is very deep, and complex but intuitive once you know what you're doing. The controls may seem wacky at first, but they become second nature after a few hours of gameplay. The controls in Ringrunner allow for extremely skill based combat, and they also give space for fun abilities. Once you get used to it, movement feels very fluid and well-made. This game has more story and gameplay elements than most AAA games, and that for just €8.99. Why are you not buying this already, go buy it, right now, I know you're just looking for an excuse to buy it here anyway, I will be your excuse to buy this amazing game, and the moment you are ingame, you won't need one anymore!

												A great space flight RPG with plenty of content. Ships have basic control similar to the old ""Asteroids"" PC game (you thrust to go forwards, and turning does not stop your momentum) and have plenty of hull types,  weapons, and abilities to customise with. The game is story-driven with light humour, but has a rather slow-paced intro galaxy that may put people off (however, it can be skipped!)Missions are basically set in closed arenas where you perform the task required, so this is not a fully open space sandbox (which wouldnt even make sense with a 2D game in space anyway).The graphics are nice and tidy, and when the combat gets going you can end up with great little light shows.All in all, RR:FotS has enough to get you addicted, and very few real drawbacks considering the price it can picked up for.

												Not even sure where to start with this, there is so much good content and any feature you might want seems to be here so far. The campaign is huge I'm barely out of the tutorial 'galaxy' the starter story isn't very original... it's basically darksun 2 but the levels all present something new as you progress rather than having a pre set do A now, do B now mentality.It's got the perfect achievement tracker which let's you jump straight back into the level right from the achievement page to get any you're missing. (useful since the important bonus objectives generally grant you 10,000 spends)A full difficulty scaler, so far this just seems a direct damage/reward ratio applied to everything but I'm just starting out.Research, ships, preset ships, fully customisable ships... everything.Oh and the most important bit, Multiplayer and Co-Op modes. It's even got a fully functioning Moba/Armada Online mode.I'm a bit dissapointed I got bored of buying copies of it for a $ now, everyone should have it.			"

												Several aspects of this game alone are enough to make this game great. Nontheless, they all come together to make a fantastic experienceI'll start with combat. The game starts you out with some crappy ships and crappy weapons. This fits in line with the plot. As you get more vessels and new armaments, you start to pick favorites, and by the time you get to design your first fully customized craft, you already have a good idea of a few combinations that may become standbys for the battles to come. Fighting involves destroying, distracting, subverting, evading, tricking, stunning, outrunning and overpowering the enemies. I am very well convinced that someone could spend a year on this game and barely scratch the surface of all the amazing combinations that have yet to be discovered.The plot? Enthralling. Through gut renching losses and righteous victories, this game engrains you. Between the universe threatening drama, cheeky humor pervades the dialogue, and the characters, even minor ones, can be quite lovable. What also helps to make this story concrete is the depth of the lore. That, along with the fact that some of the Sci-Fi technology makes sense helps to make this a real feeling world.The music isn't flashy, but it is a great case study of how one can do great things with only a few tools. I heard there guys aren't even musicians. The graphics use shiny light and pretty colors to draw you in, with atmospheric backgrounds the fit right in place. Some of the cons involve the layout. It can be difficult to navigate the hangar and switch ships. Finding your favorite presets can be irksome, and there doesn't seem to be a way to test ship combinations without going into a story mission. Most of the game is fighting, with some racing and stealth in there too. This is, however, broken up by the jovial dialogue and a few puzzles.In short, this game had a lot of careful quality and love put into it. It is easily worth more that $10.			"

												I don't normally play top-down shooters, but this game is something really special. The Newtonian physics are not just a gimmick to make it stand out - they are a core element of the game and numerous mechanics are built around them. The build customization is like nothing I've ever seen before, with an extreme range and variety of viable builds - from a fast, highly lethal ship wielding only a massive photon bat, to a flying fortress deploying a field of turrets. Different configurations for the same hull can have radically different gameplay, and there are over 20 ""sidegrade"" hulls to choose as a base!The story is not tacked on at all - it is front and center, and the writing is highly enjoyable. There is a lot of great humor and very ""natural"" dialogue from characters who have no voice acting or portraits, yet are far more memorable than the cast of most games nowadays. The game's universe manages to combine a serious main plot with side adventures involving things like robbing a bank with a bunch of trash trawler rednecks or shooting pirates until they agree to buy Dvorak keyboards.The game's mechanics, immense customization and somewhat slow and lengthy (though skippable) tutorial galaxy make it hard to learn and harder to master. Once you do get into it, it's a unique experience guaranteeing crazy amounts of fun. You can feel that the developers put their heart and soul into their game, and diving into such a lovingly crafted experience made me very happy.			"

												What a hidden gem this game is. The game is a top-down space shooter with newton physics, meaning if you accelerate in one direction you will not stop until you turn around and apply thrust... or hit something, this makes the combat fun and fluid.There are a ton of ship hulls available with about 300 or so abilities and weapons available so your creativity can run riot, a good amount of them are unlocked via the campaign but you can also research them using the in-game currency to unlock them earlier should you wish.The campaign is immensely long and I loved it every bit of it, even if you try speed through the game it'll still take you about 15 hours, and that’s not even including the time for completing bonus objectives, mini-games or arcade events available.Edit: The soundtrack is also freaking awesome.10/10, would have bought at full price the day it was released if I'd have known about it then.

												This is a really amazing sci-fi top-down-shooter RPG. It features deep and complex ship costumization, literally hundreds of active and passive skills, a great storyline with a lot of variety and numerous multiplayer modes.There aren't a lot of people online at the moment though, so you won't get a lot out of the multiplayer.Still this is one of the best games I've ever played, and you should definitly pick it up if you are enjoying Starsector, SPAZ, Gimbal or anything similar, especially if these games are a bit slow for your taste, because Ring Runner's movement and combat is incredible fluid and fast, even with the heavier ships.Edit: By the way, I mainly played the drm-free version.

												The fact that this game has gone overlooked for so long is simply criminal. I recently did a second playthrough of this game, just to see if it held up as well as I remembered it the first time, and the ship customization had enough depth and I had enough money and ship parts that it was even better the second time around. Seeing the campaign again also offered new context to earlier events that foreshadowed later ones, and it was also every bit as hilarious as I remembered.The tutorial stages of the game are a bit of work, and you have to spend a few levels piloting ships that fire bits of tissue paper and handle like a cow with a firework taped to the side, but it does well to show you the wide variety of classes of ships available. Then the game opens up, gives you full freedom to modify your ships and plenty of missions to try them out in, and one central objective that leads you to tons of ridiculous adventures.At any moment in this campaign, you can find yourself assaulting a space station by summoning comets to slam into it, racing around a track using your time distortion powers to gain an advantage, riding shotgun on a transport ship being driven by the AI in your head, using a stolen bank vault tethered to your ship via tractor beam as a giant flail for smashing ships, playing pong with positive and negative particles on a quantum scale, fleeing through an asteroid field as it's being obliterated by the psychopath chasing you with a death ray, fighting off waves of drone ships outside a space graveyard that your AI insists on calling ""zombies"", or infiltrating a space city by evading scanners and timing your way between police patrols.All those are just the ones I came up with after filtering out the plot spoilers and most ridiculous scenarios that would take full paragraphs to do justice. The plot is a bit jagged due to the structure of the campaign, where the bulk of it lets you approach missions in any order, but it all makes for a great experience on the whole. The writing is a bit hit-and-miss, some jokes genuinely made me laugh, others felt a bit forced, some touching scenes worked well, and others fell flat. No deal breakers, though. The protagonist and their AI make a great duo, and other characters, while not always as distinctly defined as the two leads, do enough to give the universe its own unique feel.Enough story though, let's talk gameplay. It's sorta like a twin-stick shooter, but aside from rotating you only have forward acceleration and brakes to work with. Additionally, once moving in a direction, you continue to move until Newton says to stop. This takes some getting used to at first (and I would highly recommend a controller to pick up on it faster), but soon you'll adapt, and learn to build momentum then let off the accelerator to strafe or shoot backwards. Plus, one of the equipment slots on your ship will usually be used for an ""archetype ability"", which is mapped to flicking the right stick or mouse. This can be allocated to launching attacks in a specific direction, or repositioning a directed shield, but more often is used for movement abilities which will allow you to change directions quickly with maneuvers like teleportation or barrel rolling, allowing you to be highly agile and mobile if you want.This leads us to ship customization, which is where this game shines. There are 5 primary classes of ship, and one oddball. Fighters use powerful forward cannons and have a ton of agility for getting them aimed at enemies, and are nimble enough to compensate for their low shields. Arsenals are the exact opposite, opting for low mobility, high defenses, and lean either towards having tons of firepower, or deploying crowds of turrets and drones. Grapplers are where we start to get away from typical spaceship archetypes, using tractor beams to pull enemies close, and then throwing them into hazards or using deadly short range attacks to tear them apart yourself. Casters are well balanced, with unique abilities that focus on distorting space and time that can be built around to become very powerful. Finally, Rogues use stealth and holographic decoys for defense, letting them plant targeting beacons on enemies in order to launch very powerful attacks.Within these classes, there are countless options for tuning your build. It can seem overwhelming at first, but the tutorial should help you find a class you enjoy, and from there it's just a matter of finding components that sound interesting, trying them out, and seeing what your ship becomes. So I had this neat little caster ship, decent speed, shields, and a huge array of weapons made it ideal for fighting powerful enemies, waves of weaker ones, or assaulting giant space stations and cruisers. But it had a problem with power consumption. It'd chew through its energy supply at seemingly random points of the battle, leaving it with no weapons or movement abilities. So I swapped in a caster-specific component that could perpetually generate energy beyond the maximum capacity, but if it got too full, it would shut down my weapons and engines to discharge. This proved to be too much, since I had other energy income that would constantly overload me. I pulled out a few modules that were allowing my weapons to leech power from ships it attacks, and replaced them with ones that powered up my weapons and shields while overcharged (in between normal capacity and overloading). This was still too much, and my ship was EMPing itself every few seconds in battle. I looked at my options for replacing the power core and found one that looked specifically geared toward my ship, which could hold enormous amounts of overcharge energy. I changed out the hull with one that had fewer of the slots I didn't need, and more slots for the kind of tech I was now focusing my build on. Finally I sacrificed few unnecessary weapons for the ability to change out the batteries quickly in the heat of battle, and some more overcharge-powered shield upgrades. The ship I ended up with was immensely powerful, with a primary weapon that could one-shot most enemies at close range while tanking huge amounts of damage, and its only weakness was a very brief window every once in a while to run off and change batteries. And this is just one of the elements you can build around. I have one fighter class ship built specifically to be the fastest it can be, used to win the racing missions, but still able to put up a fight. I've been meaning to try out a grappler build focused on this one sweet weapon that scrapes off bits of enemy hulls or space junk and then launches it as torrents of shrapnel, shotgun-style, for immense amounts of damage. I had one mission with a side objective to not take any damage from a space station I was attacking, so I built a ship that could stay at a distance and sent waves of mobile gun turrets to fight it.There are a few criticisms I should mention, just to be fair. As I've said before, the early missions take a while showing you everything the game offers. I recommend using a controller rather than picking up on the more obscure mouse movements. Might also need to switch the steering style in the options. Speaking of which, the menus use a bit of a weird control system that takes some getting used to, where the mouse will snap to the buttons you move it toward. Some missions will leave you stuck with one specific ship which makes their bonus objectives really frustrating when you can't build around them. But that's all I can think of, aside from the final disappointment that there will probably never be a sequel. This game goes on sales as low as one dollar, and normally goes for five. In my opinion it's easily worth more than either of those prices. At the very least, it's definitely worth taking a risk that small for, in my opinion. A great but sad example of an overlooked gem.

												Wow!  This unassuming little gem is one of the best values out there.  It's a total steal even at full price as it's packed with an enormous amount of content and ship customization.Ring Runners is essentially an isometric space ship shooter, but boy is it brimming with goodies.  The main campaign consists of over a thousand missions and each one is set up with 30 seconds of storytelling.  The missions have quite a lot of variety to them and only last maybe 5 minutes so this game is great for short bursts. The ship customization is incredibly deep, yet quite approachable.  All other games should take notes from Ring Runners on how to build a great game with a very simple premise.This game is quite linear and even when it ""opens up"" it's still extremely linear, so know that going in.  That said, the ship customization, writing and combat are all top notch.  If you're a fan of games like Escape Velocity or Space Pirates vs Zombies, you should buy this game right now.			"

												Just finished my first playthrough of this game, I highly recommend this game. With solid graphics, a phenomenal story with plenty of suspense, surprise, laughs and sadness as well as some amazing gameplay, this game is a very great buy. Ring Runner sticks very tightly to its interesting and unique lore, immersing you even more in the story and the world you travel through. There are also various difficulty modes to suit whatever challenge you are looking for. My playthrough on just Runner difficulty alone lasted me about 18 hours, but during those 18 hours I was always looking forward to the next development in the story. Missions have all kinds of variation and difficulty scales well. Ships are customizable when it comes to performance and weapons. There are various hull types that provide different play style hybrid hulls that combine two hull types and sometimes even three.If you were like me when I found this game, a gamer craving a good and unique story that really sucks you in backed by good gameplay, pick up Ring Runner. I promise you that this game will fill the need.			"

												The dual developer brothers really pulled off a winner with this one and as far as indie games go this one takes the cake. The gameplay is split up into missions with an arcade style racing, arena, or scrolling (at your own pace or predetermined depending on the level) top down 360 degree flight combat with an emphasis on physics. That very general nonsense that you could get a better feel for after watching a gameplay video out of the way the real emphasis is on deep customization and I do mean deep.After a very long tutorial that introduces the five classes of ships you are allowed to customize your own ship of any class to continue the story and the options are staggering enough to put an armored core game to shame.There is more content in this game than in most AAA titles released and I personally can't wait to see what comes next from these developers.

												Ring Runner is a well executed top down shooter. The game feels great to play for the most part, though when using a mouse and keyboard it's sometimes difficult to accurately execute moves that require you to flick your mouse.The game's single player campaign doesn't take itself all that seriously, but knows how to handle that kind of humor. In addition there's way more lore than you would expect in this game. Details about the universe are attatched to the story mode, as well as every ship part.Speaking of ship parts, there's a ton of them. This is a good game, but ship customization is what pushes this game into being great. There's a research system and a ton of ship parts, none of which are straight upgrades without a drawback. This means that you'll spend a ton of time just sitting in the hangar making new ships and testing them out.The multiplayer seems okay. Me and my friends didn't suffer any lag or latency issues and it all ran smoothly. The multiplayer consists of a few co-op modes like arena and zombies. There's also some PvP modes but as of this moment I have no experience with them.Pick this game up, especially if it goes on sale. If you both enjoy tinkering with things and playing top down shooters then you'll love this one.			"

												The game is pretty decent, kinda like the Star Control 2: Ur Quan Masters combat system with slightly more inertia being the main gameplay core, with an okay storyline so far wrapped around it and pretty damn epic soundtrack (yeah I bought it for $5 dollars from bandcamp.)The Singleplayer seems to not run out of ideas on how to put you into a different ship with completely different mechanics, so it doesn't get old.Afterwards, you get access to scenarios and missions, single player and multiplayer alike (local and online if I know correctly, local is a bit more restricted), coop and competitive alike.Oh, and you get to obtain a whole bunch of equipment and customize the hell out of your ship for these scenarios.But more importantly, I've just spent 5 hours in the Rostrum Arcade playing a BREAK OUT minigame, after 5 hours of actually playing the main game. 10/10EDIT:YOU NEED TO BUY THIS GAME. HOLY WOW.Story is pretty neat, I liked the humor throughout, the music is AMAZING and overall this is game with a lot of value - I played more than 30 hours for the main game alone! Then there were a few hours of grinding the break-out game to unlock every ship and every item, but that's just because I have no friends to play multiplayer with #foreveralone			"

												As of writing this review the game costs 8,99€. And now after I finally finished the story I must say that I even deem that price to be lower than what could be expected when comparing it with other games. There are thousands of games out there that cost a lot more and won't even deliver a half of what this game has to offer.The gameplay is very varied and outright fun most of the times. Those few moments of frustration I had I've brought upon myself by choosing a somewhat higher difficulty. The game forces you into many different roles but constantly performs well at doing that, and even up to the last levels the gameplay occasionally gets some new twists. That's nothing I could say about many games, actually at this niveau Ring Runner is the first I've encountered.The story is... really incredible for a game with this price. It is really long, it is immersive, well thought through, interesting, awesome and at times breathtaking. It offers twists up to the very last moments and nothing ever felt out of place. The game even manages to convincingly think up a new way of faster-than-light travel, and managed to sew it perfectly into the story.If you have any remote interest in games like this, get it. There's even a Demo to try out first in case of doubt.			"

												Ring Runner is a 2d space shooter with a very interesting story, great flight and combat mechanics, and a huge number of different playstyles depending on the completely customizeable ship configuration- all packed in a very neat visual presentation. If you still have a few bucks left during the sale, and you liked SPaZ, Space Rangers or similar games- do yourself a favor and grab it!			"

												One of the best games I played ever. A perfect blend of SPAZ (which I also liked) and RPG elements makes this game amazing. I enjoyed the story alot, it was funny and well done. Customization is awesome too, their are like endless combinations you can make. The gameplay was awesome, you are able to bind your own controls with your equiped weapons and abilities. I highly recommend this game to anyone who is waiting for SPAZ 2 and people who like this game genre. (multiplayer modes included!) NOTE: Go to Ring Runner's webpage and play multiplayer for free :)Extremely underrated, needs more players.			"

												I can't believe it took me so long to discover this game... In a Steam sale at that.Personally, I'm a big fan of space shooters, but unfortunately the market is flooded with cheap ripoffs, mobile games, etc (with plenty of exceptions both new and old). Sure this is a late review, and most of my hours don't show up on here... But I've played it a-plenty offline for the year I've owned it~~~~~~Here we go for more detail~~~~~~~PROS--Graphics are pretty good; as well as the interface, menu, and settings being very thorough and informative-Story is surprisingly well-done, character development very clean and endearing, and even breathes a bit more life into the game-Gameplay is like your typical arcade shooter.... on a LOT of steroids. You've got guns, you've got missiles, you've got teleportation, special abilities.... GAHHH SO MUCH! And it's actually a dang good challenge! Took me a day or two to even get the hang of the controls, much less the combat itself... You'll be shaking, you'll be screaming, and your blood will be pumping hard in some of these battles, trust me.-Tutorial is..... I can't even figure out where to begin. It's stunning. They go through every little detail of the system, and at a very safe pace that works VERY well with the story, paces itself accordingly, but still manages to make things interesting.-Shop and customization.... It's ridiculous. Ship appearances are not capable of being customized, but things like weapons, shields, armor, engines, etc has nearly limitless possibilities. The paid research is also helpful if you're slower to gather Plex (in-game currency). Keep in mind it only stacks to 10 consecutive segments of research if you don't play for a while ;) MAKE SURE YOU WORK ON YOUR SHIP IN THE HANGER, YOU WILL OTHERWISE HAVE A HELLISH TIME!!! (also, you can create and upload ship templates to the Steam Workshop)-The ships themselves.... GLORIOUS. The design is very appealing, and there's even a class system of sorts for them. THat's right, a CLASS system. I won't spoil anything here, but let's just say its not so simple as ""fighter, bomber, stealth"", there's way more to it that is very well fleshed out-Multiplayer is pretty cool... though sadly not many play it anymore. Fortunately the bots for playing the maps yourself are pretty dang good (did I forget to mention the ASTOUNDINGLY good AI?)-Story is actually quite compelling, and overall pretty kid-friendly (if you're looking for milder sorts of things), and every level is well-tailored to each chapter. Is it repetitive? A little bit at times, but what did you expect from a space-shooter? Some things like the lore and different species could've used some more fleshing out... But it's an indie so that's forgivable. Oh, there's also plenty of good philosophical goodies hidden here and there.-Music....... brilliant. Not the best, but very fitting for the game and definitely wouldn't mind having it as ambient music, especially the chill little tune that plays in the hangar.CONS--This game's controls are..... Well they're not for the fainthearted. While well-organized and highly customizable, there's a lot to keep track of. You will really HAVE to think, strategize, and set things up according to what you think will suit you. Get used to crashing a lot in the beginning... You'll get the hang of it. (I recommend trying out using an XBox controller, it's a bit easier for some)-Multiplayer is practically a ghost town (much like Metal Drift.. another forgotten gem), and the community has gone practically dead-silent-Even on easy, and with it's gentle learning curve, this game isn't really a good choice for newbs to this type of game. That is... Unless you're very gifted at adapting to new games, because this gets REALLY hard REALLY fast near the end of the campaign.-You have to make sure you manually set a save FROM THE BEGINNING to save to the cloud. Otherwise you will lose all your progress and ships like I did when I uninstalled it for a while.-Dev team has practically abandoned the game... But its no surprise given it's an Indie (a damn good one at that)~~~~~~~~~~~~~Overall, overwhelming good points and a few bad, I give this game a 9/10 and strongly recommend it to anyone who loves this genre like I do and wants a meatier game to play in it. Or if you just want a fun and unique experience with this quirky little diamond.Hopefully this game gets a new wave of attention in the future... Here's to hoping!			"

												What a gem!  You can really tell when a game is made with heart and passion.   I was lucky enough to play Armada on dreamcast back in the day, and have looked for a similar game ever since.  This has hit that spot.  While it has done a lot of things I missed from that game. it does quite a bit more for me.  My guess is if you are here looking at a 2d shooter spaceship game, you are already looking for something very specific like I was.  Therefore, my review is more of a review on the other reviews, so if you are looking for this specific experience you will want to pick it up anyway.  Especially if it's $2 like it was when I grabbed it.  I thought it was weird reading the reviews and people saying a 2d shooter had an amazing plot.  I have a lot of forgiveness when it comes to storyline on a game.  It's not something I look for or need when I want to have a good time.  That said, while I might be playing this without it, it just wouldn't be the same.  If you are like me and will jump at any kind of a futuristic sci-fi narrative, this will quench your thirst.  A good number reviews mention the controls are clunky.  I use a controller.  Maybe that would make things different.  However I will add, you are flying around in space.  It's meant to be a little ackward.  It's part of the fun.  There are a ton of ships, too.  They don't all fly the same.  You can mod them to hell and back so you can tweek that aspect out if you find a ship you like.  That and binding controls is some of the nicest and easiest I've seen on a game.  I could see how the UI and the number of options can be daunting.  If you are a person that gets overwhelmed with that kind of thing, then this might not be for you.  I know those people are out there.  There is an insane amount of options.  However, I will say that the first half of the game is pretty much showing you all the ships and weapons one by one, all fully loaded with different weapons explaining things very well.  After that, it was easier for me to digest what I was working with.  I'm not sure what else to say.  There is plenty else but this review is long enough.  I'm very happy I picked up this title for what I was looking for.  I found so much more.  Hope you will do the same!			"

												Ship control and general graphics are better in SPAZ. But Ring Runner deserves some attention. Storyline, controls and ships, skills, dialogues, maps, everything is done with a noticeable good taste. It's also a game that will entertain you for so many hours... and, for example, uses steam workshop for sharing ships loadouts.			"

												Honestly, I didn't know what to expect when I first played this game. The one thing I wasn't expecting was a story. An original, well written, and legitimately funny story. There are few indie rpgs in which I could really become attached to the characters and events taking place around. Ring-Runner immediately draws you into, and builds upon a unique world in which even the villains of the cast have more personality then some triple-a protagonists. For that I can't praise this game enough. However the core of any game is its gameplay, and Ring-Runner doesn't disappoint. The core of the gameplay is based around navigating your ship through the empty vacuum of space. Things like inertia and thrust become important concepts to master as Newtons first law is in full effect here. This makes for interesting dog fights, especially when your enemies are armed with giant flailing maces. The game runs you through a story in which you can pilot a number of different classes of ships. Some can only attack by flinging debris and bashing opponents into obstacles. Others rely on missiles and cannons for defense, and some can only rely on stealth. Overall I found that each ship presented a distinct gameplay experience, each having their own challenges and weaknesses to overcome. To add onto all of that, later in the story you unlock sage powers. Learning to control these world bending superpowers adds another layer to an already layered cake. If you're at all a fan of the genre, you should defiantly give this a play.			"

												The most strange, chaotic, and complex combat since Magicka; and that's just if you count relatively normal ships made with only basic knowledge of the game.It'd be absolutely nuts if the multiplayer community of this game stayed active for more than a few months at a time.-January 15th, 2017Some big YouTuber found this game and there were thousands of sales overnight!They're all doing singleplayer though, except for a few people who went for multiplayer as soon as possible and are only flying tier 3 ships.-January 17thStill more sales coming in, and suddenly there's hundreds of people in the multiplayer server.

												""Welcome to the show. I'm Fred Bunglemonkey and with me in the studio today is Simon Liekzitt -""""Hello""""and Phillip Thinkzitsux""""Good evening""""Tonight's topic is Ring Runner: brilliant top down shooter or pile of monkey poo? Simon?""""Thanks, Fred. The top-down space shooter is a genre that sorely needs more entries. If you like these games, Ring Runner is the game you've been waiting for. It's fast paced and filled with lots of cool mechanics. Ships get multiple weapons, movement abilities, stealth, decoys, etc. There's so much variety that no ship plays even remotely the same. There's a lot more to this game than just pointing at the bad guy and clicking the fire button. Even moving around requires cleverness, with the newtonian physics, dodges, and cool movement abilities.""""I'm sorry, Simon, but I have to disagree. People should give this one a pass. You see it doesn't matter how cool those movement abilities are if you've got to suffer through the controls that activate them. Do you know what the default binding is for the dodge ability? FM. Go ahead, Fred. Look for the FM key on your keyboard. Can't find it? Well, I googled for it and it turns out that FM stands for 'flick mouse'. Go ahead and try it.""""It.. doesn't work.""""I know, right? That's because you need to press mouse button 4 at the same time. Oh, your mouse only has 3 buttons? Then you're SOL. Naw, just kidding. The default controls are awful, but you can rebind them.""""I... uh... well, I went into the 'bindings' menu but I can't seem to change anything""""That's because the 'bindings' menu doesn't do anything. The menu you want is called 'keybinds'.""""I see. Wow, these menus are terrible. They keep grabbing my mouse pointer or limiting what portion of the screen I can move it in, and many of these options are just a bunch of letters with no explanation. Yes, Simon?""""Okay, so the menus aren't great -""""They are the single worst thing ever programmed since the Stuxnet virus.""""-true. But once you suffer through the menus and fix the keybinds, you'll get to the core of the game which is actually a really good shooter. It even has multiplayer with a bunch of great modes including zombie survival and one that plays a lot like a MOBA.""""Cool! Let me try. I guess I click on my hanger and... wow. I guess I... need to... wow. I'm sorry, I have no idea what any of this means.""""Yeah, you should probably read the manual for the hanger first. I took the liberty of printing out a copy for you.""Simon lifts a heavy book onto the table.""May I interject?""""Oh, God yes.""""This is what I'm getting at. You're going to need to spend the next several hours figuring out what all these options in the hangar do and customizing your ship... and once you do, there will be nobody online to play it with.""""That's not really the point, Phillip. Multiplayer in this game is something you do with your friends. It's not about public servers.""""Yeah, I may stick with the single player campaign. I'm not sure I want to invest the time in figuring out the hangar interface.""""Unfortunately, you're still going to need the hangar in the single-player campaign... but it's worth it! The campaign is really good and the missions are varied and fun. Even the plot is interesting and filled with some really funny dialogue.""""You're right about that, Simon, but the game pauses every time anyone speaks. This isn't a problem the first few times but after a few hours you're going to want to put your fist through your monitor each time one of those dialog boxes pops up and interrupts your gameplay - and they interrupt it CONSTANTLY.""""Okay, they're a bit annoying but I wouldn't say they ruin the game...""""I would.""""Well we're almost out of time but the big question remains: brilliant shooter or monkey poo? Should we recommend it?""""Yes.""""No.""""Meh. I'll just click one of them randomly.""Subscribe to my curator page hereView my other reviews here "

This is a game I have been waiting for for a long time - a 2d space shooter in which skill and tactics and can be explored. The mechanics are deep - ship upgrades involve giving you new ways to exploit the best attributes of your ship rather than just giving you +3  to a state. The game features multiplayer mode and a long story driven campeign, suprisingly with good writing. Why are you still reading? Buy the game!			"

												If you like sci-fi, this game is an absolute gem.The attention to detail is maniacal, the storytelling and humour are so great that can be compared to legendary games like Monkey Island and Day of the Tentacle.The gameplay and the progression are perfect, those guys (and the gal) are game design masters; I'm at 18 hours and the quality is constant,there is so much passion here that I'm speechless, no wonder it took 5 years of development.I got this game in 2014, played 2 hours and then went to Linux single boot.Those 2 hours alone left a sign in my memory.Few days ago I tried to run it on Linux thru Wine, after messing with the components and the engine versions I was able to get it to work at 100% so if you are a Tuxer like me, check WineHQ and you'll find my instructions, let me know if you need help.

												Objectively: A top-down Space Shooter reminiscent of SPAZ, with great depth and complexity, letting you handle a single intensely customizable ship for a large number of play styles, tactics, and possibilities. The lore is rich and designed with a lot of care, the same care that has gone into the rest of the game. Dialogue is witty, though perhaps annoying to some. All in all worth its price even without a discount.Subjectively: My favorite game of all time. There is a demo. If you even remotely like spaceships and shooting stuff, why aren't you downloading the demo right now, what are you DOING?!EDIT: Be wary of dark souls levels of learning curve and skill ceiling.

Along with some references to ""popular"" culture. I write popular in that manner because some things are a bit obscure, like how many people actually remember the odds that C3-P0 gives Han Solo when entering the asteroid field?

												So this is a 2D space game, you fly around and shoot other spaceships over cool spacey looking enviroments and in space cities. There's also a butt ton of customization. You can change pretty much everything about your ship with a significant amount of variety in your choices.I feel like I've seen a bunch of games recently that could fit this description, in fact if I had a dollar for each game I've seen that looks like this one I'd have maybe 4 or 5 dollars. But this game is unique. Now, I haven't played any of the others, so I can't really say for sure that Ring Runner is unique, but I feel it.The game offer somes standard, and pretty boring, gametypes such as a horde mode and a MOBA game type. However this game really shines in it's story mode. It is kind of goofy and doesn't take itself seriously, but also has a story and world (or, galaxy I guess) that are pretty interesting.The pacing is nice and the game encourages (forces) you to play around with the different ship classes and weapons. Plus you get a job selling dvorak keyboards to space hillbillies. If that didn't sell you then nothing will.10/10 space of the year			"

												Storyline is fantastic, the dialogue is well-written and humorous (think Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy), the gameplay is fun and engaging, it has nearly limitless replayability due to the level of customization... I don't think I can say enough good things about this game.  The fact that it was made by only two people (brothers no less -- what a neat personal story that makes for Triple B), and is their first game to boot, is amazing.  Not only is the game good, but they have continued to update the game and tweak things here and there after it was released, in addition to releasing a free addon multiplayer mode reminiscent of MOBAs like LOL or DOTA.The only criticism I can think of for this game is that some of the ship types are not 100% balanced, but given the vast number of customizable elements of each ship type, I am frankly amazed that it is as balanced as it is right now.tl;dr 10/10 would buy a thousand times.Last-minute disclaimer: it says I've got .8 hours of play on record, but I played this game for hundreds of hours well before it was released on Steam.

												There came a moment in my time with Ring Runner: Flight of the Sages when I was faced with a decision. It was a choice I’d wrestled with countless times before, whether it was when I was mowing down enemies with an assault rifle or making a leap of faith. But something was different this time. The need was greater. So I told myself, “Dude, you’re going to need a gamepad for this.”It was an easy purchase.Triple B Titles‘ twin-stick space shooter is set up in such a way that countless deaths left me wanting to play more, fight harder, and eventually win. There were no ragequits or facepalms involved. It was simply a drive, a desire, to improve. The only times I found myself shutting the game down was when I had finally completed one of its many missions. It was an encouraging experience.Read more of my review: http://press2reset.com/reviews/review-ring-runner-flight-of-the-sages/ "

												A seriously underrated game.- Nice humour and storytelling- A nice length campaign with interesting missions and challenges- A truck load of game modes (multiplayer or vs bots)- Responsive controls and fun mechanics- A lot of customisation on your ship builds- Beautiful graphics and particle effectsI really don't get why this game isn't more popular than it is.This game is a rare gem, and shouldn't be missed if you enjoy space shooters and fun storytelling.

												Amazing. A hidden gem. - Tons of content and customization.- Different game modes keep things fresh.- Well-written and well-executed plot.- Single-player campaign guides player through all the different kinds of gameplay in a way that is does not feel forced.- Skills-based gameplay.- Great soundtrack.- Ship controls reminds one of Asteroids and may take a bit getting used to before one can fly smoothly. (Hint: requires the use of braking, piloting actually becomes a skillset rather than a mundane part of the game).			"

												Lately, I've been into the open space RPG genre like a fanatic. Desperately searched for games like Drox Operative and SPAZ, preferrably with coop. Now, see, I have a crappy computer so I find some of the most obscure games out there because I can't run jacksh*t. I've seen a lot of things. But this? It's on ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ steam and it took me two years to find it?ffs.The short. (TL;DR)So I got it for $0.99 during a steam sale. What a motherbeeping steal.Stop.Essay time.Starting off,The game and I had a few technical difficulties but let's ignore that because troubleshooting is my specialty.Ring Runner is extremely overwhelming upon first look. The controls are weird and the customization is immense. Crazy how science does that. Don't skip the prologue. I don't recommend it (from experience). The prologue is slow and it's hour(s) long, but it's also a tutorial. It lets you ease into the seat of the game. After a while you'll get used to it and become a professional at bumping your ship into space debris. It's worth doing, I'd say.Missions in SpaaaaceYeah, the prologue is long, but after about 35193691 hours you have access to other nodes on the map where you're free to choose from. Every node consists of a series of missions and bonus challenges. Doing these missions may unlock new equipments and hulls you can use to smash yourself into space rocks.Best parts n gears of the game, customizationI've said it earlier, the customization is insane, but it requires a lot of knowledge on what things do and what your goal is. You can go from building a comletely useless floating hunk of junk to fighters that utilize overheating and self debuffing for massive damage or even wizards that manipulate space, time, and gravity. There's a lot of things to try and worth risking for. Play like how you want to play. But if you're lacking imagination or it's just too complicated, there's prebuilt loadout ships to use, default and user-created.Explody stuffsUnlike most other space RPGs, Ring Runner has an extremely fast pacing when it comes to applying violence. Depending on your ship and loadout it's do or die. There's a lot of buttons to press and a lot of things to use. It can be difficult to use the right thing at the right time. Half the time you could forget you even have certain stuff equipped. So in terms of skill, there's a lot of potential. Otherwise, you can slam your face on every key if you're not a confident space ace.Literature gal(axy)Don't worry about the story, you're just here to blow stuff up. Jk.I like it, and that's not very common I think. It's not something I pushed aside this time. There's some humor along with a few melancholic moments like when you kill your friends, you monster. Sometimes there are choices during missions which will change up what you have to do. Although you still get the same rewards so there's no real repercussion.Hey I'm not a lonerGreat! But also not great! Closest thing to coop campaign are duo ships that is designed for two players to locally control one ship. The online multiplayer consists of multiple gamemodes, both coop and versus, that you and friends can play to showoff your OP loadouts to then unfriend them after they beat you with theirs. But that's about it sadly. Still all good and fun, just no online campaign.So what?Worth it? No the blue thumbs up is a lie.[/sarcasm]			"

												The gameplay and wild diversity in ships and customisable loadouts would be enough to be fun for a few hours, but the writing just carries it to a whole other level. Haven't even hit the half-way mark yet on the single-player campaign, and not for lack of trying - it's huge and I love it for that.			"

												This game has a ridiculously long introductory stage that doesn't serve very well as a hook.  Stick with it, though; it gets good.  The semi-serious sci-fi story is entertaining, and the twin-stick shooting gameplay is well done indeed.  Customizing ships with a variety of weaponry and power-ups adds another layer to the game, and the vast collection of challenge achievements improves the replay value.  Oh, and there's multiplayer (with AI for those who want to play alone).			"

												Awesome. The combat is pretty good, the story is really good, and the customization options are mind-bogglingly good. It's sort of like... you have classes of ships that have their own strengths and weaknesses. In addition to the typical archetypes you usually see in space games is a grappler class of ship, which does it's damage up close and personal. My definite favorite is the caster class, which has extremely varied and inventive mixes of long range attacks and abilities which do too many things to list. What's more, there are hybrid ships which are mixtures of two classes! Definitely a must-buy for anyone who likes customization!			"

												So worth the price... Why do you not own this game yet?Elaborating:The younger folks liken it to SPAZ but the old guard will recall Silent Death or SubSpace (aka Continuum).  This however features a nice, long, engaging story along with very deep play options. It does take some patience as the game is setup to ease you into the complexitiy and to be honest, it is worth your time to do so especially since you have to ""research"" hulls and equipment before you can even ""purchase"" them for use. If you feel like you're stuck behind a power curve playing the story missions, play around in some on-line games to earn more currency to buy equipment and hulls with. Ask questions on the forums here, it has people who are generally helpful.Also, the companion book is very good and I enjoyed it throughly.The multiplayer netcode is so smooth especially when you consider it is peer based with no dedicated server and it transitions very well usually, only occasionally does the migration fail and it is usually because the original host crashed or something. What really cracks me up is that RR does multi so well, and yet Bioware with all their resources has serious problems with their 4 player ME3 multiplayer. Anyways, i love this game so much, i hope more people get into playing it on multi....			"

												By far the best top-down 360* space shooter I've ever played.  Story is fantastic, graphics are fancy, and combat is very polished.  The game starts out basic and you unlock more customization and controls as you get further.The RPG-like ship customization goes above and beyond.  It's probably better than 90% of the RPGs out there.  They have enough options to allow for many different builds without making a ton of unnecessary options that have no place in any viable builds.Also, if you get to a boss fight where you can die very quickly and easily...check the rogue weapons and you just might notice something that will...turn the table on them.  I don't want to make it too obvious, but let's just say my favorite part of the game was when I got to laugh off a boss that would otherwise be very difficult.  It's nice when you look at an option in a game and think ""hey...that could be awesome, but I bet bosses are immune to it"" and then find out bosses are not immune to it.			"

Product received for free
												This game is an obscure gem - Few people have even heard of this game, but it's an amazing game, better than many triple A titles, and much cheaper!GAMEPLAY:I never get tired of the combat in this game. If you've ever played SPAZ, It's kinda like that, but you generally are up against more enemies, and have awsome game changing powers, though not at first when you play through the story. There are multiple classes of ships, each intended to have different gameplay styles. Fighters are generally good at dealing damage while avoiding damage, grapplers are good at close range combat and juggeling opponents, rouges have the potential to deal massive damage undetected, casters have all sorts of useful abilities, and arsenals can do massive damage whether they use missiles, turrets, drones, or a mixture of all three. To top this all off, there are hybrids of differnt types of ships, allowing them to combine strengths.STORY:While sometimes a bit lacking, it will often be the case that something will hold your interest in the story, and a couple of times, there will be plot twists that add a whole new layer to the game, like suddenly gaining a whole new level of power, or a lust for revenge. Though many people say they lost interest, it was never the case for me. There are some pretty fun missions, too!MULTIPLAYER & THE COMMUNITY:Wouldn't know. This game is a really obscure game, and it doesn't help that I live on the otherside of the world of most people who play this game. I do hope that you might be able to help with the lack of community?Overall, this game is a brilliant game. While someone did give this to me as a gift, I'd be willing to buy the game, full price.A true gem of a game. 10/10.			"

												I think that it is the best single player game I played for the last years.Nice lore; varied and not bothering gameplay; deep, complex and unusual game mechanics; tons of customization.Complexity of fighting-slyles is delightful: you can throw mini-blackholes, use time and space collision devices, eliminate enemies with a energy-chainsaw or push them to the asteroids (or asteroids to them). Of course, standard lasers, rockets etc are included too.Some bad things: it is too difficult to gain enough money to get the top equipment even for the one ship (you must grind  achievements or non-campaing missions), multiplayer is dead, controls will be not very friendly at the first time you will play.

I had to use a $50 temporary replacement so I played this and holy hell even after I got my 780 back from RMA I continued to play. If you enjoy more depth, customization, and story (not the most serious but still amazing) you will love this game. It's well worth $10.			"

												I didn't know if I would enjoy this game or not but it turned out to be spectacular. Definitely worth the 10 bucks, heck, with this amount of content it could even be worth more. This games comes complete, no DLC ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Puts triple A companies to shame.Full story with dialogue and characters you actually care about? Check (granted you actually read the stuff)Fully customizable ships with hundreds of unlockable equips? CheckMultiple gamemodes in single and multiplayer? CheckI think the game is a port from Xbox Live Arcade? The controls take some time to get used to but afterwards it gets better especially after unlocking ships with easier maneuverability.  The campaign starts off with a pretty long tutorial/introductory stages which introduces you to various ships, controls, and gameplay elements. But all this is part of   the story and helps you get used to the controls. The music is kinda funky in my opinion but it's nothing negative. The UI can definitely be improved some, especially the hanger interface which needs more information shown. Instead of popping open a new 'window' to view equipment descriptions, it could show when you move your mouse over or something. Something else I found kinda annoying, very minor still, is the dialogue boxes. It pops up frequently to tell the story which could be a little interruptive. It would be AWSOME if the campaign was fully voiced but that's just me asking for too much.Definitely recommend.			"

												Ring Runner: Flight of the Sages blew me away.it  had looked interesting for a long time, as if the gameplay would be different and something i could really enjoy.after trying it, boy was i right. but i got a LOT more than i bargained for, from an Indie Developer i've never heard of, and the pretty bargain bin price.this game, has downright absurd depth and attention to detail.the gameplay is very skill based, controlling your ship takes practice and mastering of Inertial forces. Gameplay is not just point and click, you will be required to think your actions out to control your ship well and survive. Controls are numerous and will take some getting used to, but i find are very rewarding to invest the effort to do so.the Story... doesn't suck. i know, that's weird, a Video Game with a story that isn't garbage.to build on this story you get from the Campaign, there is ample flavor text on just about everything - which ties into the story.and boy, the customization and variety. as you play through the Campaign, you are given the opportunity to try out many ships and get a feel for them. eventually though, you're given free Hangar customization freedom. i was already loving the game before that, and as soon as i saw the Hangar, and all of the customization available.... just wow.browsing the customization, i was instantly overwhelmed with buckets of unique parts and ships. there's a playstyle for everyone. hell, there's probably 20 playstyles for everyone, because there's just so many different ways to play.an enourmous plethora of Weapons, special Abilities, Ship classes and Hulls in each class to choose from. every single Weapon, Ability and Hull does a spectacular job of standing out from the rest, and being unique. no cookie cutter content here.Ring Runner will also run on just about anything, while still looking very nice and can be an enjoyable visual experience for both low end and high end users.the Options allow for wide customization of Video, Audio, Controls, as well as Gameplay related features and settings. if you're a power user, you will not feel left out if you prefer things a certain way.playing Ring Runner, i can feel as if i'm in a living Universe. Characters have personality, and the backstory of this Universe is more than sufficient for your mind to build the world around you.the only complaints i could possibly have, are all very minor. the Menu UI could be built a little better, and the game HUD could be easier to see against the background of the game. a couple of the colors blend in with the background of the game a little too well, and can therefore be hard to read.all in all, i am blown away by this little gem i've found. Ring Runner doesn't deserve the meager existence it has, this is a much, much better game than it appears to be. it is a shame that Ring Runner is not well known of, as this game should be much more popular than it is.a very well presented product, Triple B Titles has a very well put together game here. the name Triple B doesn't even do justice, this is a higher quality game than that.Ring Runner is now one of my favorite Space Games.if i was forced to rate Ring Runner, i would rate no lower than 90.0/100.

The campaign is over 30 hours long which I really look forward to, tons of achievements and extra features.There is also a hangar; which allows you to customize your ship and several multiplayer modes. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to link up with other players yet. For some reason this game has been overlooked even though it's one of the better space shooters.

												What you are paying for is a single player campaign that, depending on how fast you care to progress, takes about 20-25 hours to complete. The best way to describe the story is that it is a bit of a discount Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy where the characters aren't to be taken seriously, and the plot isn't to be scrutinized. The gameplay is whatever you decide to make of it, whether you care to bounce nimbly around your target while slowly picking it to bits with a rapid firing laser, slink about while under a cloak attacking from stealth, float about in a fortress whilst subjecting your targets to heavy missile salvoes, smash your opponents bridge in with a space flail, or manipulate gravity in order to dominate your opponent, this game will oblige if you put the time in to customize. Other small details such as having a good soundtrack and pretty graphics (I mean pretty in the sense that they are nice to look at, not that they require a 500 dollar graphics card to run) really make the entirety of the game a well spent 30 hours, especially so considering how it only cost me a dollar.My only two grievances with the game are that the multiplayer is dead, and that the potential for the single player to be a bit more open world isn’t utilized. All in all, I give it a solid  9/10			"

												A quirky space shooter with a deeply developed universe and a LOT of satire. A space comedy, but the plot grows surprisingly deep and involved over time. Think Hitchhiker's Guide in tone, though the execution is rather different.Gameplay is good once you get used to the controls, but there are several different control schemes, so you can find the one that is most intuitive for you. Missions are short and to the point, which works very well given the game doesn't take itself seriously (a good thing).Ships are extremely customizable, to the point of being confusing and unwieldy. To do an effective build,  you'll have to spend several hours learning about the ship types and components and how they work. Or you can just slap a bunch of random crap into a Caster and mash buttons, like I did. A great deal of potential for novel/interesting playstyles with this system, but very little hand-holding for players who just want progressively better ships to shoot at the bad guys with.Well-balanced and always remains interesting. The plot moves forward more steadily and naturally than many games I've played. Characters are loveable, though the game has a tendency of killing them off, so don't get too attached.Graphics, while nothing spectacular, stand out nicely among your usual indie games.			"

												Okay, I've played this for a few hours now, and it's probably worth the dollar I paid for it, but a lot of the design decisions that went into this game are, frankly, infuriating.  For example:Combat is constantly being interrupted with inane dialog.  It isn't even good dialog.  Seriously, Devorak keyboard salesmen?There are *literally* THREE HOURS of tutorial missions before you get to customize your ship.The research system is mind-numbingly stupid.  You can't buy new equipment, even if you have the money for it, until you spend hours of real time waiting around for it to research.  And, just to add insult to injury, the research is semi-random, so you may need to wait multiple times before you research what you want.Controls for actual combat are a little odd, but are okay once you get a hang of them.  However, the controls for the two mini-games I've experienced so far were absolutely terrible.  Also, the mini-games were awful.  They make me wish for quick-time events they are so bad.Overall, it's not the worst game I've ever played.  The combat is kinda fun, and that's most of the game.  I probably wouldn't pay more than a buck or two for it, though. "

												I was quite skeptical after reading some very positive comments but, after buying this game during a sale, I was amazed playing it for a while. Story sounds good and battles are short but meaningful, like chapters of a book. You must fine tune the mouse controls to aim correctly and get used to physics to avoid crashing on the walls, over and over. I know it can be frustrating at the beginning because you spend a lot of time trying to drive the ship and fire at the enemy at the same time but, after getting to the top of this hill, you will get only fun, learn to slide, strafe and so on. Backgrounds and effects are very nice and there is a hangar to fully customize your ships.			"

												This game is amazing.The cost of this game vs the gameplay, the story, the customization and everything else does not make any sense at all.   There are AAA titles that could take a few chapters out of the book the dev's here wrote.I run games on my desktop and laptop.  My laptop is an old asus republic of gamers laptop, so old i dont remember the specs or can be bothered to look them up.  Plus it has been through hell and some parts changed out.  I digress, this game runs real smooth on this old hunk of junk.Gameplay:  Standard old school space flying/shooting.  Tried and true, it's simple and it is fun.  What enhances the gameplay of seemingly simple functions, is the customization of ships.Ships:  Several types of ships, ie: fighters, grapplers, arsenal....etc.  These are known as hulls, and on the hulls you can pick and choose your shields, your weapons, your power hubs, auxilliary features, kinetic drives, etc.  There is so many ways to set up a ship to you play style.Story:  So far the story is very interesting, comical, suspenseful.  It gets you curious and you want to know.  It isn't text you want to just skip over, and the best part is, is that the wirting is concise.  It is the perfect amount, not short and pointless drivel, or lenghtly meaningless fluff.  It is just right, you get the right amount to keep you wanting more.Multiplayer-  Sorry haven't played it, been playing as solo game, and as solo game it rocks! Cost/Value:  They need to charge more and make more money so these devs can make more games.  If these kind of games are what you like, or you are a gamer that likes most genres, or an older gamer, odds are you will love this gem.  For the price you pay and the amount of content/replayability it is a deal and a half.  I honestly would rather play this game over alot of top end titles, it just so damn fun! and challenging10/10  One of my best purchases in a long time.			"

												Late to the party but i suppose it's never too late to praise a good game from 2013. I'll start with the biggest con and general No-no a potential buyer must be aware of: This game has a long and mean introductory curve you must endure and try to maintain your interest over. It is not like a complex learning curve per-se as handling the ship isn't rocket science but more like a prolonged introduction stage that takes way way too long. You will use hours to do the early parts where you will be slowly introduced to different hulls and equipment. Lack of cut-scene videos or art (just radio chatter in space mostly) doesn'ty really help getting into this game. As soon as the map unlocks and the hull selection becomes available for real does the game actually begin. But in the end there really isn't any kind of competition to this game now is there? Star Control 2 maybe closest? or S.P.A.Z. Even those fall short as the equipment list is ridicilously large and research happens real time so if you never even bother to open the game then you will not unlock enough stuff to make things interesting as you will need to constantly launch new research when you are in the game menus. Oh and you will need lots of currency (plex) to buy just about anything as here are many hull types which you will want to make hull designs on and you will need to use pretty much each one as none is just perfect for all mission types. And the missions really do vary in type and length as you never know what you are up against.  Races, Fights, Base assault missions, Circus areenas. Even a bank heist i have seen this far and i don't think i am that far into the game just yet. Scenarios add even more fun as there are zombie infestations, tug of war arena team fights and gladiator matches. Price is way below what the game is worth - as long as you can get over the early part. If the genre is a favorite of yours then this game is pretty much mandatory in your library.			"

												Ring Runner: Flight of the Sages is the center of an emerging story-telling universe, and is possibly the best new game I've played since VVVVVV.  If you're a fan of arcade spaceship combat set in a detailed SCI-FI universe, then Ring Runner will likely hold your interest for a while.  The story telling is well thought out and moving to the last line.The core gameplay is built around several different types of ships, from traditional shoot and scoot play ala Freelancer, to stealth tactics relying on precise timing of your abilities, to more devious physics based attacks reminiscent of Half Life's Gravity Gun.Played it through and I want more!  Help support these guys, they started from the ground up in college and finished the game out with a kickstarter campaign for funding.  Would love to see them come back with a second installment of the game detailing the Extinguishing.			"

												I am writing this review as part of the steam awards nominations. I nominated this for the ""I thought this game was cool before it won an award"", since that is the perfect description for this game. I do not know what chance caused this game to never get the popularity it deserves. The game has a variety of game modes, huge amounts of customizability, difficulty settings to match any skill level, and an interesting story that takes place in a well fleshed out and detailed universe. (If you like the story, then the book will fill in a lot more background for the universe, including many details only vaguely referenced in game by the descriptions of equipment.)I recommend using a controller for this game, since I find it easier to keep track of how my abilities are mapped, and certain directional abilities are easier to use with the second analog stick. You can choose control styles as well between a steering and aiming style, so you can use what works best for you.			"

												A quirky space shooter with a deeply developed universe and a LOT of satire. A space comedy, but the plot grows surprisingly deep and involved over time. Think Hitchhiker's Guide in tone, though the execution is rather different.Gameplay is good once you get used to the controls, but there are several different control schemes, so you can find the one that is most intuitive for you. Missions are short and to the point, which works very well given the game doesn't take itself seriously (a good thing).Ships are extremely customizable, to the point of being confusing and unwieldy. To do an effective build,  you'll have to spend several hours learning about the ship types and components and how they work. Or you can just slap a bunch of random crap into a Caster and mash buttons, like I did. A great deal of potential for novel/interesting playstyles with this system, but very little hand-holding for players who just want progressively better ships to shoot at the bad guys with.Well-balanced and always remains interesting. The plot moves forward more steadily and naturally than many games I've played. Characters are loveable, though the game has a tendency of killing them off, so don't get too attached.Graphics, while nothing spectacular, stand out nicely among your usual indie games.			"

												What you are paying for is a single player campaign that, depending on how fast you care to progress, takes about 20-25 hours to complete. The best way to describe the story is that it is a bit of a discount Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy where the characters aren't to be taken seriously, and the plot isn't to be scrutinized. The gameplay is whatever you decide to make of it, whether you care to bounce nimbly around your target while slowly picking it to bits with a rapid firing laser, slink about while under a cloak attacking from stealth, float about in a fortress whilst subjecting your targets to heavy missile salvoes, smash your opponents bridge in with a space flail, or manipulate gravity in order to dominate your opponent, this game will oblige if you put the time in to customize. Other small details such as having a good soundtrack and pretty graphics (I mean pretty in the sense that they are nice to look at, not that they require a 500 dollar graphics card to run) really make the entirety of the game a well spent 30 hours, especially so considering how it only cost me a dollar.My only two grievances with the game are that the multiplayer is dead, and that the potential for the single player to be a bit more open world isn’t utilized. All in all, I give it a solid  9/10			"

Learning curve is stable, with gradual introduction to more and more mechanics and ships as the story progresses, which is great because you don`t get everything dumped at you at once.

I play videogames to escape and relax for a while.

This is a fantastic gem and very well crafted, I wish I had a joystick to test it out better but even with the slightly clunky keyboard controls it's still a fantastic game that has me on the edge of my seat as I blast away at differently customized AI ships.

I have unresonably high expectation of every game i play, and i mean it, i want my games to get everything right and to say this one did, is really like saying a nuke is kinda loud, i hear you thinking, KINDA? a nuke literally tears you appart with how loud it is you idiot!...well i can't really hear you, i'm not senile yet.The combat is brilliant, the customization is wonderfull, daunting at first i'll admit, but wonderfull, hell the developers even did their homework, most of your weapons are subject to the fact that space is a void, so is your ship, and by extension its inertia, it might make it kinda hard to get a grip of things at first, but it's quite a nice little detail that's saved my ship from overheating more times than i care to admit.So, from a nittpicky self nammed critic, this game really did do everything right, and is more than worth its money, in fact i'd say it's worth more than that and should be bought right now!

												Just found out I never gave this game a positive review despite playing the hell out of it, way back.  The thing that got me interested in FOTS was the soundtrack, which I heard before playing the game itself, and it was dope AF. It's mostly upbeat, energetic and all awesome. It sticks with you for a while, since the graphics and art style, otherwise,  are average at best. It doesn't just kick♥♥♥♥♥ it leaves it marked for life. Next up, the gameplay. It's all top-down, very fast-paced, played with either mouse + keyboard or just keyboard. Interestingly, it borrows a bit from RPGs in that you can pick a ""ship class"", that mostly defines your playstyle and gear, from a dog-fighting, acrobatic fighter that shoots many lasers (personal favorite, maybe) to a big hulkin' missile boat THAT REQUIRES TWO PEOPLE TO FLY. WHAT ?You get to fly around the galaxy and meet people, it's pretty swell, yo. There's even a story thrown in that has you and various people, one inside your head, snarking away at the slightest nudge. Some moments are downright hilarious, which was very pleasantly surprising. It ain't all perfect though ! Most of the missions are very repetitive, either in the way of reused assets or objectives, or arena-like combat (though this particular trope/cliché/whatever is played on with a few twists) , and sometimes the game feels very rough around the edges. You don't navigate menus, you trudge through them. Outfitting ships is anything but intuitive. Escort missions are used too fookin' often, and the backstory is more plentiful on the fookin' trading cards than in-game ! What ? Other than that ? The music, man. I still listen to it, probably will for a while. It's that good. It makes the whole experience very, very much worth your while. After all, it'll stay with yo♥♥♥♥♥forever. "

												This is one of the finest top-down spaceship shooters. The controls are responsive and combat is frenetic, without sacrificing the frictionless inertia-based movement mechanics that make the subgenre special. The writing revels in absurdist mundanity, much like Tyrian or Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. After escaping the starting galaxy, you get access to ship-customization on the level of one of the better Mechwarrior games.The levels come with a variety of objectives and opponents: help keyboard manufacturers battle angry parents in a brutal deathmatch; destroy battlecruisers filled with onion rings before they cross the map; engage in a variety of races with varying levels of violence; and more.

												Very engaging singleplayer campaign, well written characters, concepts, and dialogue. Good variety of missions that can be tackled in numerous ways and won't bore you. Estimated length is 30~ hours. If the game was singleplayer only it would still be worth at least 20$ imho. Ship classes translate very well, casters, rogues, grapplers, etc all perform intuitively and if you like a certain playstyle in normal RPGs chances are you'll like them here as well. Furthermore, the ability to customize weapons, abilities, and ship handling is very in-depth without being overly complicated. All systems are rather basic but work together for a very deep experience. If you want to make a ship loadout that perfectly suits your combat style, you can. The developers certainly knew what they were doing here.Haven't really touched multiplayer, but you can do CO-OP missions or PvP using the ships you built in singleplayer. Lots of fun. Get this game for everyone you know that like games like FTL, Sunrider, or Infinite Space.			"

												It's hard to describe this game if you haven't played something like it before. The closest I can come up with is a 2.5d top down version of a chris roberts game with the insanity on the weapons turned up to 11. When you first start playing it's a bit chaotic because the weapons are so varied it's hard to understand what you're getting attacked with and with so many things happening on screen at the same time it can seem overwelming, once you gain an understanding what you're left with is a gem of a skill based tactical 2d top down space shooter that's packed with customization and replayablity.The only real downsides are the multiplayer is pretty damned dead, nobody seems to play and the game's controls with a keyboard and mouse are kind of bad if you don't have a controller to play with.

												Currently, during the Steam Summer Sale, I HIGHLY encourage you to spend the SINGLE dollar to buy this masterpiece.This is definitely one of my favorite games of all time. It might be extremely bold to put it up there with something like Half-Life, but in my book, it holds a place similar to that of the Half-Life series. Having leaned towards multiplayer games throughout my short lifetime of gaming, most singleplayer games repel me due to their inability to immerse me with realistic AI that keep me entertained. Games like Half-Life, the Elder Scrolls and Ring Runner: Flight of the Sages, have kept me enthralled with their hilarity and interesting qualities. Although these games have not pushed me to experience the entirety of the storyline, what they offered kept making me return for more. It is very important to note the brilliance of the soundtrack, the visuals and storyline within this game. They are absolutely outstanding. I absolutely adore the vibe that the personalities of characters eminate.  However, I have yet to note the gameplay. With the extremely vast availability of customization, you'll almost always find yourself facing off hordes of unique ships while piloting your own perfected ship loadout among a gorgeous backdrop of planets and stars. The only true downside I can possibly pinpoint is the lack of a community and therefore the absence of multiplayer functionality. There are NO players. Other than that, there is a lack of customization during the start of the story, which slowly opens up through gameplay, but takes some time to gain access to. As for casual gamers, there are only a handful options to bypass the customization, which is very overwhleming, hence the slow buildup. Overall, without the consideration that this was in fact TripleBTitles' FIRST game produced; their own learning experience, this game is one I do recommend. This is definitely influenced by my own tastes, but again said, this in my own book, is a masterpiece. Even if I was not sure about this game, again, during the Summer Sale, I would pay a dollar; who wouldn't?			"

After 30 hours I still test and find out new combinations!Quite many difficulty levels and multiplayer maps (there is one that reminds of MOBA) that give it some replayabilityOnly a word of advice, remember to go to shop in the main menu and clic on the lab button. Clic either research you prefer (1 for parts and 1 for money) and occasionaly check it because it will cap when it completes 10 items that you haven't checked. This research continues even when the game or your pc is closed, and is accelerated as you complete any kind of missions!			"

												The single player campaign has 144 missions and the story is well written with funny dialog and memorable characters. A lot of work went into it, some missions even recreate classic arcade games. I haven't tried the multiplayer yet.The controls are ok on mouse and keyboard, but I switched to using a gamepad. It's slightly less awkward.There are a lot of different kinds of ships, including whole classes of ships designed to fling space junk at your enemies.The fundamentals of the game are great. Equip ships with devices that stop time, teleport you instantly in various ways, and setup crazy combos involving dangeriously high levels of energy or heat.My one complaint is there's no checkpoints or mid mission saving, so if you die during a multipart mission you need to start it all over again. The missions can be very hard, especially on higher difficulty levels. It gives the game a very oldschool feel but I'd prefer to be able to save my progress in the middle of a mission so that I don't have to repeat so much while challenging myself.It might help to playthrough the game on a lower difficulty level until you have all the equipment and ships unlocked, at least past the first galaxy.I really wasn't expecting the game to be so good, absolutely get it if you like top down space shooter/rpg type things like S.P.A.Z. etc.			"

												Suddenly a very good thing, punctually corresponding to its description. I think i ain't gone very far from the beginning by now, it seems to be too easy on any other difficulty that the hardest which i'm playing on, yet takes some dedication to get used to controls, and flying and combat peculiarities, as It's a top-down 2D, while my pilot skills are all coming  from X3 Reunion and HAWX and based on the first pirson view. Yet it's quite intresting to fly and to fight in there, especially when you get better with understanding how it is handled properly.Nice graphics and tolerable-to-nice 8-bit (ore how ever it's called) soundtrack. Plot dialogues written with great talent and humour.To sum up - a good game worth a try, especially for playing in short spans of time between more useful occupations).PS Would be nice to have a 3d game based on this one, with 1st and 3d person view and comfortable controls.Неожиданно хорошая вешь, вполне соответствующая своему описанию. Далеко от начала пока зайти не удалось - слишком легкая на всех настройках сложности кроме максимальной, а на максимальной приходиться поумирать пока привыкнешь к особенностям двухмерности и вида сверху, так как у меня все навыки по летной части из X3 Reunion и HAWX и в основном с видом от первого лица. Но летать и рубиться довольно интересно, особенно когда начинаешь лучше понимать, как это правильно делать. Смотрится неплохо, саундтрэк тоже ничего, не считая того что он восьмибитный. Сюжетные диалоги хорошо написаны- талантливо и с юмором то есть. В общем в целом вполне достойная игра, особенно для коротких заходов между делом. ЗЫ. Не помешала бы и трехмерная игра на основе этой, с видом от 1 и 3 лица и хорошим управлением.			"

												This is one of the great games of 2013. Let's go in order.First of all, the gameplay. In an individual mission, the gameplay is smooth, and once you learn it, almost brilliantly intuitive. You'll be using a grand total of as many as 14 abilities at a time, some of them obvious, and at least one- The Archetype ability- implemented in a way that should've been involved before. Used in a variety of ways, either through a flick of the mouse, or holding a specific key and then flicking your mouse, this ability is, to my knowledge, entirely unique to this game, and is based around the precision- occasionally- of your mouse movement, allowing you to fire rockets, dodge, teleport, or do any number of other, exciting things to move in a given direction. It's unique, it's awesome, and it's a very fun addition, that gives you unprecedented mobility in this kind of game.On a broader scale, the gameplay is similar to most space-shooters, but innumerably more diverse. Where most shooters are content with perhaps a spread gun or a few other things, a single class from this game will allow you to summon meteors hurtling towards you, paving anything in their way over, generate mathematical fields of energy projectiles, fire gravity-altering balls of dark matter, and generate powerful waves of force impulse. There are a total of five classes, each oriented towards an entirely aspect of gameplay, from the Fighter's straightforward ace style, where maneuverability, heat management, and being the quickest-witted Valkarian in the sky is the key, to the Arsenal, a tower defense game in disguise, and the other three only get weirder from there, in all the best ways.In the metagame, you have research. New hulls and equipment are researched, and you could have a lifetime of fun with a single class of hull, since each one is capable of great variety. There are even some minigames, usually based on various old arcade games, which are fun- Though Particle Command may see you yanking your hair out- and sometimes downright thrilling. Personally, I love the Brick-Breaker game played on a subquantum scale. Research takes a while- It's intended to be a long-term investment, and it'll take you at least a couple of playthroughs to complete. There is a double-unlock system; First, you research a broad category- Like a kind of node- And then, you must purchase your researched component. Thankfully, the best way to accrue the currency of the game is either: Set your game to paid research and go to work, as the research continues while you are not playing the game, or play through campaigns, which will speed up your research and deliver the necessary plex; Either way works, really.One thing that may trouble you at first is the camera; It tends to zoom in close, so you need to learn how to tab to the map to show you the shape of the area you're moving through. When you get close to an enemy, it pulls back, exposing more of the area, but situational awareness is always tough; You'll want to practice learning how to keep the map coming up occasionally to watch your surroundings, and be aware of the shape of the battlefield.Graphics. The graphics are interesting; While they're not designed to be ultra-realistic, they are stylized in the best way. Ship hulls are distinctive; Each breed of hull tends towards the distinctive, and with a little study, you should easily be able to tell the silhouettes apart. The graphics for the backgrounds, the large structure models, and the explosive graphics are where the game shines, however. With a little practice,e very ability will be obvious, which is good, because knowing the difference between a friction-enhancing trail of glitter and a field of red glowing mines may well save your life. In the quiet moments during missions, the background graphics can give a feeling for the majesty of space, and the fantastic world in which you inhabit.Story. The story is told primarily through incidental explanations, and brief conversations. It starts off with you dealing with a pair of feuding galactic garbagemen in a small nebular galaxy, and ends with you facing off against what can only be called a god, and the best part is that it introduces this change gradually, and with great appreciation. There were moments that made me grit my teeth with anger, that filled me with a righteous fury to make things right, and then the game provided the chance to do just that. There is one character whom you meet, who you know you're going to have to kill before the end of the game, and who you know is going to be an incredible challenge. They manage to make the character fit that challenge perfectly, and provide one of the most thrilling boss fights I've ever seen in this kind of game. And then, they manage to top that. The dark hints in the backstory, at a galactic empire that has displaced humanity and has left its mark throughout the world, the gradual introduction of the nature of Anchor Drives, the nature of sages and the question of who has created them, fills the story; There is a novel series, which I have not read yet, but fully intend to. And throughout it all, the game adopts a tone of blithe comedy, in the best traditions of Terry Pratchett and Douglas Adams, where the grave stakes do not mean that people can just sit around being gloomy and serious. And in a delicious turn, at least for me, your character is openly contemptuous of the bandits that so frequently waylay characters, pleasantly explaining that they're not getting one dime before proceeding to tear said enemies apart. Never has a random encounter been so satisfying.Music: This is perhaps the most striking, for me. The music has been well-made, and is perfect space opera fare. You will learn to associate certain themes with certain feelings; I could not spoil it for you, but the music will become a companion, exhorting you to fight harder, and to savor your surroundings. There are 20 tracks on the soundtrack, and they will become dear friends to you before the end of the game. http://ecdryere.bandcamp.com/track/extinguisher is one of my personal favorites, and will serve as a reminder that you're about to fight something that has dedicated its whole life to being able to destroy you, and has no idea what it is in store for.When I first played this game, I made it partway through the first galaxy before giving it up. When I started playing again, I kept playing, and I have not stopped since. It provides that most unique of science fiction game experiences, akin to the best space opera out there, of starting with nothing, and learning of a world that defies your imagination, to face all that it has to offer, determined to find out why you are. You must push through, as the first galaxy could take as much as a solid ten hours to get through, and is largely a tutorial, but it will give you a solid versing in the play-styles of all five classes, a background of the world you're exploring, and the gameplay mechanics, and when you break free of it to the world beyond, you'll find it the most magnificent thing you've experienced in quite a while, I wager.

												The best twin-stick shooter I've played. Classic fantasy-RPG based classes for the hulls, hundreds of skills and parts to customize with. Procedural maps to blast your friends on. The single-player campaign takes quite awhile to really get going, but the story's decent and the soundtrack is pretty damn good. All-in-all, I'd say it's well worth a purchase.			"

Product received for free
												A nigh-unto untouched gem. I was given this as a gift from a friend and loved it.---Pros:- tons of references hidden in the lore and achievements- it has a soundtrack and a book- Hilarity- good, challenging gameplay reminiscent of space invaders on magical steroids(with 2 dimensions of movement).- extremely long gameplay time for the price. Occasionally you get it on sale for, like, $2 or less. get it then.---possible cons:- there is an organization in it you might take offense at the naming and portrayal of: PITA, based off of real life PETA (people for the ethical treatment of animals) but with turrets as their primary concern instead of animals.- It is based off of a book that I haven't read, so if you have read the book you might have a slightly different experience with it than I did.- if you are like me and are an achievement completionist, it is a PAIN to get all the achievements. Almost as bad as TF2 in that regard.- there are ships that require a second player to use unless I am mistaken. You don't *have* to use them, but they come in handy- co-op may be limited to local play, not sure.- controls clunky on keyboard, try xbox 360 controller			"

												This game went under the radar for the most part. If any indie game deserves the title of hidden gem it is this one. There are already a lot of reviews that go in depth with the features and aspects of this game so for this one I am going to forgo my usual analysis.I just wanted the opprotunity to let any prospective buyers to know that this game is worth far in excess of the asking price. YOU WILL get your enjoyment out of this game if you enjoy any of what this mash up of genre's have to offer.I would also suggest that if you are looking for a more free roaming experience do NOT give up on this game at first. The beginning missions are linear but that is mostly to get you aquainted with the many different great features this game has to offer. It has many to offer.For a team of two brothers this is one of the best indie projects I have experienced on steam out of just under 1200 indie games I have in my library and families libraries. I would put this in terms of solid sheer quality above a much more expensive game like The Witness. You are going to get a HECK of a lot more bang for your buck value to price wise here then you will in most other indie games on this storefront.If you are not the biggest fan of sci fi, space sim, there is a lot here for you in the plucky and well written dialogue and twin stick shooter action.If you are not the biggest fan of shallow end action without depth, there is a LOT here for you in the depths of the rpg mechanics and role building. It takes the best of both worlds and wraps it into one of the best indie packages of the last 5 years. You may not be wowwed by state of the art graphics or a bazillion hours of gameplay content. But they really put their heart in soul into this one and it shows across the board. There is far more then a satisfying amount of content here. The opening stages alone if you are not a mega fast speed runner may take you 10+ hours alone. That is before it opens up beautifully.Please if you are reticent to take risks on games, this is one you wont be sorry for pulling the trigger on. I would happily stake any small reputation I have on it.Have a great day and game on brutha.			"

												Surprisingly polished and deep, Ring Runner's gameplay draws inspiration from old school shmups like Asteroids, and Mechwarrior for ship customization, campaign and progression.The campaign is linear but varied and very long to complete (don't rely on my Steam stats), and also challenging if you decide to play in Sage difficulty or higher. I recommend playing on Sage, the game is way too easy otherwise. Most missions can be replayed with a different, fully customized ship and that, in my opinion, is one of the greatest strengths of the game.The story is engaging, has a nice touch of humor, and features many characters whose personality can be felt without ever seeing their faces. The game is backed by an original lore that justifies the way all technologies used in the game work, which adds a lot to immersion and will surely appeal to all Sci Fi fans like me.Ship customization is incredibly deep for a game with such a classy shmup gameplay. Here are some ship kinds you can fly:- A heavy gunship with thick shields that shoot rockets all over the place, or let its couple dozen turret pets do the shooting.- An agile and accurate fighter that also relies on heat to cripple its foes. Yes, there is a heat stat just like in Mechwarrior.- A ""Caster"" ship that creates gravity fields to snare its targets and wipe them out with damaging AOEs.- A melee ship that can pull others toward them to drill them or smash them with a space flail (!)- A cloaking rogue ship that creates holograms to confuse the crap out of the AI, then deal huge damage while they have their backs turned. Special attention has been given to stealth mechanics ; enemy ships will only spot you while you're cloaked if you get in front of them or fly into a radar ray.You can also combine all of the above with hybrid ships. My favorite ship is a less stealthy rogue with the agility of a fighter.Graphically and artistically, Ring Runner isn't particularly fancy, but it's polished and it will run smoothly on any PC.Another point that really surprised me: the game's soundtrack is one of the best I've heard in a long time, it's really amazing and nicely fits its atmosphere (or its lack of atmosphere - it's space after all). You can easily find it on the internet.TL;DR: If you like games with classic shmup mechanics, deep customization and an original Sci Fi story, this is the one.			"

												This level of customizability in a space shooter is a big draw for me.  It takes a surprisingly large number of story mission completions before you organically unlock the ship builder, but the game lets you bypass that if you really want to jump right into the deep end of the pool.The story is fine, serving as an adequate vehicle for the varied and entertaining missions.  Most of  my fun, however, is in the scenarios.  There's a couple different styles and they keep me trying different builds to master the vastly different difficulty levels.  I got it at full price when it first came out and haven't regretted it one bit.			"

												I really like this game. It's got a ton of customization and a great story. It's just all-around very well made, and it has humor that makes me think the makers grew up on too much Rachet and Clank. The only complaint I had was that there isn't more story. You go along for a good while, but when the final battle comes, it comes suddenly.This is, in its own way, praise. I didn't find the story lacking, but when it was over, I wanted more. I hope that there will be a sequel or a DLC storyline extension; there could be so much more development of the amazing universe they've put together here.The gameplay itself is amazing as well. Think Asteroids - but with modern graphics, objectives, and a fully customizable ship(s). I enjoyed picking a ship design and making it my own.All in all, it's a great game, and well worth $10.			"

												This is one of very few games that captures you and won't let go until you are done with it, and when you done it doesn't leave sour taste in your mouth. Story is superb, game mechanics is very deep and complex, yet simple to get a hang of (mastering it is another matter). Game is amazingly well designed, and scripted. Apart from playing it yourself, only way to describe it, is to remember that first game, you spent playing all summer brake long, fell in love with and just kept coming back for more, and when it was done, you look for more of it, either waiting for sequell, reading book it's based off or joining a forum for those that share same passion for that game, Remeber that feeling? one that you vividly remember, but can't seem to capture again? This game brought it back for me. I feel guilty for buying it while it was on sale, because it worth every penny, and then some.			"

												One of the best games I've played all year. If indie games were put into a pile this would be one of the games near the top of the pile. The music is a kind of space themed techno that really hits all the right chords and really brings in the mood. However it reminds me a lot of Pink Floyd and other progressive rock sounds, but that's the kind of music I listen to. The sound effects are top notch as well. The graphics are very good, the background is very busy and colourful, and the special effects in this game were made with blood, sweat, and tears. The best part of the game is the explosion effects. The bigger the object, the more detailed the explosion. The storyline is light hearted and smart, definitely makes me crack a smile and wows me at the same time. The difficulty in this game is true to what you set it as, which means the AI was very well crafted. The campaign is 20 hours, but there is multiplayer to boot, which means you could definitely spend hundreds of hours on this game. There are plenty of multiplayer modes to play, really different from eachother as well. I highly recommend this game.9/10			"

												How this game isn't better known, I have no idea. The quality is outstanding. The meat of it is clearly in the campaign, which is well-written and punchy, and the first 4-5 hours which could've easily been a full game in and of itself turns out to be only the first chapter, after which things start opening up and you can sink your teeth into ridiculous levels of ship customization. This is to say nothing of the multiplayer scenarios, two-person ships, and everything else I haven't even skimmed the surface of yet. I genuinely regret only getting this for a couple dollars; someone else throw their money at this for me so I don't feel bad.			"

												It's pretty good for the most part. Controls take some getting used to, and there's often so many abilities on your ship that it's hard to focus, but you can change that later. As another reviewer mentioned, the ""intro"" is ridiculously long. One major irritation is that the game is very linear. You only get to make choices every now and then, and even when you DO, the game still forces you to play a different way. For example, there are a LOT of missions where you get to choose the ship you want to play and set up all of its options, which is really cool. But then, about halfway through the mission, through one dumb plot line or another, they make you play a different ship with a vastly different play style.Another minor irritation, is that there are no ""lives"" so if you die, you have to start the mission all over again. That would be okay, IF you didn't have to play in a playstyle that you didn't want to play in.			"

												This is a great game.  The writing is brilliant, the science fiction as inventive as you can find anywhere while still making physicists like me happy.  You will find more witty one liners and past culture references than you can shake a stick at.  It has several multiplayer modes as diverse and almost as balanced as League of Legends, and I do not say that lightly.  It has a bunch of ATARI games you can play, and everything you do unlocks more of the game.  It just keeps unfolding like a great book.  The campaign introduces you gently to the many possible tactics in the game.  The setting is fantastic.  Ring Runner is clearly a labor of love; you will find it in every nook and cranny.It is the best game you will buy this year.			"

												**NOTE: This review is for the retail price of the game**Ring Runner has all the potential to be an instant classic. A space shooter set in a high concept universe where you play a space wizard, one of the titular sages. Its core is a focus on several different ship classes, and hybrids thereof, that can equip a multitude of different weapons, modules, etc.Sadly, it manages to cash in on almost none of it. The lovingly crafted 3D assets for the ships and environments are presented in an ugly, low-contrast top down view that make the ships look like oldfashioned 2D sprites. The colour grey dominates this game. Even weapon effects can be so anemic that it's hard to keep track of your own missiles. Despite saddling you with an extremely verbose AI partner who never actually does anything, the story is obscure, and the game's universe rarely explored. I learned more from the Steam trading cards than from playing the game. The writing is entirely geared towards being insufferably snarky, and the AI in your head never shuts up. Never. He's constantly talking, and you have to click through his ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dialogue. Start a new mission? Better click through 20 lines of bad writing first! Just. Shut. Up.All of it is driven by a horrible user interface. Custom building your own ship sounds fun, and to the game's credit, it does present you with a lot of choice. But it's all sequestered away in a tiny menu to the right side of your screen where you have to click some more in every single option to even find out what it does. It's in one of these screens that I learned the Earth was destroyed thousands of years ago. See, that's the sort of thing that I expect to wind its way into the main narrative. For some reason. This makes building your own ship a lot harder than it should be, and frankly fairly unrewarding as an experience. The interface continues to obfuscate the gameplay experience during the missions, where it places vital information conveniently on the edges of your screen. Where you'll subconsciously ignore it. Oh, you exploded because you overheated? Your hull was whittled away without you realizing it? All par for the course in Ring Runner. The enemies do get a handy little read-out for their four most important stats (only two of which actually matter: Shields and hull). I wish I could have had something like that.There are good sides to Ring Runner. It has a novel idea where you select technology to research, and it continues while you're away. The game rewards you for not playing it, and it's honestly quite brilliant. Ring Runner's grind is putting it down and doing something else. There's a glimmer of brilliance in its combat, and the many, many modules and weapons available to you. The controls are sluggish, but manageable.Pro's-Lots of weapon and ship variety-Complex mechanics for a space shooterCons-Horrible interface-Poor writing-Bad graphicsThe game is regularly on sale with a 90% discount. This is the only time I would advise buying it. You can't go wrong for 90 cents.One last thing: The game has a ""tutorial universe"" which, according to the progress bar, comprises about 20% of the game. If you buy it, SKIP THIS. It keeps dangling the one thing that makes the entire game, the ship building, in front of you as it ""introduces"" you to its different types and weapons by making you play hours and hours of bad story without giving you the option of deciding what to fly.

It's honestly one of the best sci-fi action RPGs I've played in a whileFrom the top:-It's a space game that follows the fighter/caster/rogue archetype. And does it well.-It's really well written. Original and funny. Reminded me a lot of the Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy.-There's a crazy amount of content in the game (especially in terms of spaceship customization and strategy)-It looks pretty damn good. The minimal aesthetic works for it.-Soundtrack is catchy as hell.-It just obviously has a lot of love and effort put into it. It's solid in basically every regard.			"

												I bought this game for one reason, duo ships for local co-op(I researched local co-op and tried to figure out how before I bought it).  What I discovered was an amazing game.  The premise of the game is awesome.  I also like the humor of the game.  For one you have a universal translator thing but it's like a real translator as it translates things literally and you have to use context clues to figure out what the real meaning behind it is. It's kind of a joke but I thought it was hilarious as someone that has attempted to learn another language.  Anyway there is such a large variety of ships and a lot of subsystems that can really add a lot of depth to the game.  For instance you can take a ship and have the worst heatsink in the world on it, but you can add a vent thing that reduces your heat by venting it out leaving a flaming trail that will hurt other ships.  You can put a stealth system and mark targets before unleashing a payload that will kill most ships.  You can lay turrets or summon assisting drone ships that you can command. The ship customization adds a huge level of depth and you can use moves creatively.  For instance you could use a turret and a tether and drag the turret with you as a side weapon, you could drop an explosive and use a kinetic push move to launch it at someone.  That's just the tip of it.  If you have any doubts try the demo and I'm sure you'll love it.			"

It has a great storyline and accompanying single-player gameplay to introduce you to the concepts, it has funny dialogue, but where this game really shines is in the customisation and multiplayer gamemodes. It's just... exceptional. The game will facilitate every conceivable desired playstyle, from the simple to the immensely complex. As a result gameplay can be -hugely- varied based on your choices. Absolutely worth a look.			"

												A truly creative mixture of Asteroids, Street Fighter and Disgaea.It takes the aesthetics and overall design choices from Asteroids in a charming manner.It takes the frantic, but still highly tactical combat from Street Fighter by making it possible to kit out a ship with a small selection of abilities that have a mind-bogglingly wide range of effects and then asking you to apply them in high-speed and close-quarters combat.It takes the extreme wide range of available content (ship classes, hulls, equipment) from Disgaea, allowing extreme customization of how the game is played.It's not for everyone and especially the controls take some time to get used to, but i'll recommend at least a look at it very highly.

												This game looked amazing playing the demo and even for the initial part of the story, but soon it becomes a mess. Unfortunatley gameplay is the main flaw, all the other aspects of the game are quite good and enjoyable, but the way it plays is confusing and chaoticthey change your ship very often so you can't get used to any particular weapon type, forcing you to restart learning the basics every 5 mission. different type of weapons are completely different from each other, so you really have to learn a new strategy/combat style every time you have a new weapon.Of course one may say that that adds variety to the game, I guess this is personal but I really felt really confused, the game does not even do a great job explaining strategies and controls. there's also a ship editor: here you're able to build your own ship with the weapons you prefer etc... it is supposed to be used in the single player campaign too (in addition to multiplayer) but I never got the chance to do that.In the end I feel I cannot recomend that, which is a shame beacause the concept looked very interesting :(			"

												This is one of the hardest reviews that I will have to write for a while. Ring Runner is a great game, but it has too much and is too much for the average gamer. Though I only have 1.2 hrs on Steam record - I have played through most of the campaign (which is significant) but have never been able to find any multiplayer matches. I'm sure that the demo has helped. (I have 15+ hours into the game before it got onto Steam).The game is complex and feels really fun to play, but it is bogged down by one of the worst interfaces I have ever seen. I do like this game, but it definitely is NOT for everyone. If you want to play an arcadey space shooter with a funny story line and don't mind looking over some of the quirks that I previously mentioned - it is worth the 10.00. Buying this game for the multiplayer would be a serious error as it may or may not go F2P soon (just a prediction).Pro'sGameplayStoryCon'sOverly-ComplexUI is horridMultiplayer is dead50/100			"

It's incredible to think such an epic in scope and scale product is the work of 3 people.There is absolutely nothing bad i can say about this game, outside of the research of new parts feeling like somewhat of an arbitrary limitation, and minor balance issues with weapons being present.There is no way i can't recommend this game, or its soundtrack.I'm eagerly waiting for the next game, this, i already have bought 5 times over, 4 copies for friends, because it's damn well worth it.Do not let my low gameplay hours here fool you, i originally bought this game off GOG and nearly finished the 38~ hour story there. Vast majority of my time is multiplayer with a single friend, sadly with great sleeper titles like this, it's very difficult to uphold a constant playerbase in multiplayer.			"

CATEGORY: Top down space shooterCompare this game with SPACE PIRATES and ZOMBIES before buying!Look at the screenshots of both games and ask yourself which one looks better?Ok, graphics are not everything, so lets compare: the control of the ships are IMO much better in SPAZ, also the game elements like different fractions which you can choose and tons of unlocks (ships, guns, laser, shields, ect.)On the other hand Ring Runner wins in the categories story telling and music. (SPAZ does not even feature a menu music) Also RR is much cheaper!

												Hmm i dont dont if i would recommend this one or not.  More or less this is a warning.  The game play is a top down game of a space ship that you can move around with a thrust and afterburner....and also shoot things.  So typical......yet the game play was a bit odd....and the movement felt lacking to me.  I felt my ship even though it was small moved like a large clunky cow with alot of drift.  As in the first part fo the game features you thrusting forward to i assume escape...whihc results in where ever you are exploding....thus you end up thrusting and using and after burner to avoid the explosion.  The UI and tutorial are good to get you started.  And it makes you think this is how the game play is going to be.  Now for the draw back.  All enemys do not suffer your same control issues.  They turn on a dime and have no issues with having to thrust or anything...thus only the player is penalyzed.  After noticing this...i was completely turned off to this game.  Not realistic or fair balanced at all.  The player is in the littlest ship and i can guess hte better bigger ships are even worse.  I have played alot of games....star trek online for example...and even star trek online started with better ship control.   Luckily i spent barely anything for this game due to the sale.   I cant not recommend or recommend....so i guess this is more a less a warning.  Look at this game....really look at it....if it really looks good to you and you have no other alternatives....then god for it.....but if there are alternatives....i would most likely go with those instead.

												I can't really tell if this game is worth playing or not cuz I cant play it too well. It seems really cool, and probably is a fun top down space shooter, but I have to play games with a controller. And therein lies my difficulty - the controller control scheme is VERY odd and unintuitive. You spin your guy with the LS, ""flick"" the RS to dodge, thrust with RT and brake with LT. The fire buttons are the face buttons, which really sucks if an enemy comes up from behind you, you have to do a complete 360 (and it only responds to LS right and LS left, you cant just point the way you want to face and your ship goes that way). In addition, having the fire/skills on face and dodge on RS isnt the greatest idea.Because of this, I careen all over the place and die instantly.But beyond that, I posted a non-trollish and polite note saying that the control scheme on a controller needs work, and it was removed by a mod. For no reason. Just cuz they want their game to look good. Devs have to take criticsm with the good. I think the game would be great if the controls werent so weird, and an alternate controls scheme would be nice or at least mappable controller buttons. That it basically what I said in my post.I probably would have written the exact same review, but clicked ""yes its worth playing"" if you can get over or dont mind the controls. But due to the idiocy of the mods, sorry. This ones getting a big red no.			"

												These are the worst controls I've ever seen for this type of game. For example, you turn your ship with 'A' and 'D' instead of your mouse, which feels absolutely terrible. Moving your mouse around does nothing. I plugged in an Xbox 360 controller and the controls are just as bad (and you can't even change them on a controller from what I can tell).. The menu controls are sooooooo terrible. It's hard to explain, but it just feels so bad. Also, borderless fullscreen mode didn't even do anything on my computer. I have better things to do than play through sh!t controls on a 50 cent game. If that sounds like your thing, then give it a shot.			"

												The majority of my time playing this game was in the demo, so I've played this longer 36 minutes in reality. After playing most of the demo which is longer than some full games, I bought the game. The first bit of the game was a wonderful abilitease where you have a quick and powerful ship that you use to fight waves of ships at one point until eventually you're defeated and escape the battle in a cloaked escape pod. After this section, you are given a ship crippled by arthritis that handles like a drunken camel. The fun I was having at this point was nothing compared to what I had had earlier. The abilitease was meant to give me an incentive to gain a good ship again by playing more, but instead it just made the following hours of gameplay seem boring. The game has interesting mechanics and a good sense of humor, but lost my interest when it made things less complicated and intense. Play the entire demo before choosing to purchase this game.			"

												In an era of gaming where procedural generation has become the hallmark of most indie game design, Ring Runner opts for a more traditional RPG style.  Unfortunately, the game design in this title feels as archaic as its graphical style.  The player is presented with a story-driven quest that has you hoping between maps of varying size, completing the objectives of said quest, and then hopping off to the next map.  Every experience you have on a map is very compartmentalized, so much so that after an hour of play, I felt like the game was still in a tutorial state.  I was waiting for the moment where the game would let you loose and explore the galaxy on your own terms, to no avail.If you are looking for a more open-ended space-themed ARPG, check out the vastly superior SPAZ.

												The game may have potential.  It is really difficult to tell because it does allow for keyboard and mouse control, though it was clearly designed with a game pad in mind.   The design is pretty poor when during the intro mission it tells you to press and hold MB4 and flick the mouse forward, when the mouse only has three buttons.   Bad design.   I am waiting for it to drop the cards and then will be uninstalling it.   I may have to try it in the future if I hook a controller up to my PC.   It probably is fine with a controller.   It looks like it could even be interesting with a controller.			"

												Update: 2017-03-05 0102 PMThree years later and the discussion attached to this review inspired me to try once again.My opinion is even more negative now. Having experienced several more games in the years since my original play through, particularly SPAZ2, From the Depths, and Path of Exile. I am even less tolerant of what amounts to a movie with twitch tests.I mean come the eff on, what kind of ARPG doesn't let you play a character you've made? You have all the freedom during the bulk of the campaign of picking a character in a fighting game.Original review was far too kind.I also gotta add this which I wrote in a comment below: (The text of the game shows the mindset of the devs. Hateful snarky sadism and libertarian pro-slave fantasy. Misanthropic masturbation with a captive audience. There is literally a kill the puppies mission. Drink that in.)Update: 2014-12-26 0823 AMGalactic Arms Race is another game attempting to be an ARPG shooter. Space pirates and zombies is also highly recommended for having an arpg/shooter set of elements and an infinitely better control system.I didn't hate this game, far from it, it just deeply disappointed me expressly because of how much I liked what was there. The story is truly excellent, the dialog text is magnificent, the music is awesome, and the graphics are unique and understated in a very stylish and pleasant way.But trying to appease players that would honestly be happier shooting each other in COD for 17 hours a day is a gargantuan strategic mistake if you assume anything other than profit is the objective.This game has a deliciously unique futuristic melancholy feel that would be astoundingly well suited to a real ARPG. But given the rigidity, this game effectively is more fighting game and APM trainer than ARPG.""Do you recommend this game?"" is a hard question. Ultimately I say no because I would rather not encourage gaming to evolve in this direction because you can't please the try hards and casual gamers at the same time and were it up to them ALL games would cater to them, which means freedom itself becomes undervalued and synonymous with ""cheap"" or ""lazy.""I feel morally obligated to oppose this trend, so I must answer no for the record. However, as a totally selfish appraisal I would at least recommend a play though on easy for the story, music, and atmosphere. But due to poor design and rails and walls everywhere, there is no meaningful replay value unless you're a try hard, in which case my opinion is totally counter to yours anyway.Update: 2014-09-06 0620 PMApparently at least one other team is trying to do it right. Search: Drox Operative for a true ARPG shooter attempt.Original Review:Ultimately there are two words which best capture this game.Squandered potential.I gave this game a very solid chance, including one complete play through, and even interacted with the devs extensively trying to get some of that wasted potential out into the world.Citation: http://ringrunner.forumotion.com/st/InnomenAtrocious controls, arbitrary and absurd technology limits, extremely rigid and linear game play, total lack of actual customization freedom, and the ever present worship of “hardcore” gamer insecurity.This game could have been truly great. All the pieces are there but the devs choose not to allow them to properly interact.My disappointment is almost too much for words.All I can hope is that what might have been inspires other developers to do it properly.

												There's a lot of polish and depth here, but the control scheme is just too clunky. There's no reason not steer with WAS and D, but for some reason they've limited us to W alone. Constant mousing to swing the glacial reticle around makes the game slow and drab. It's a shame -- I really like it otherwise.			"

												This game is a shoddy Xbox Live port.  There are unskippable loading screens.  Navigating the menus is clunky at best and and at worst, it's an infurating, unintuitive experience with auto mouse curser movement.  I eventually arrived at a part of the that is unplayable with mouse and keyboard.  A little effort on the devs part could have easily fixed this broken section, but apparently are too busy trying to get their next piece of work kickstarted.  You will be reminded of this every time you load the game thanks to the advertisement on the game's main menu.Please avoid this poorly put together game, and get something like SPAZ instead.			"

												The game is good in every aspect, beacuse it is basicly a book, but not a good book.Every point you will feel, that you want to just skip to the part where the game lets your hand off and allow you to play with the tools that he keeps teasing you with by giving you small demo sessions with them... But it never does. The story is text based story driven with excelent writing, except a good book when you read about a different sede plot you have the time to think about the main one and can't wait to go back to it to find out if you were right or the book will suprises you.Here the game never lets you off the leash. It keeps throwing itself on you that you can bearly grip it and then takes it away either too early or force you to keep it for too long to the point you just farm yourself trough it in hope somewhere in the distance you can enjoy yourself, but No.You will eventually learn that that part of the game is not the campaign and if its not the campaign you will not enjoy it.I am sorry guys.One of those games where a super small tweak could have bring it to the halls of classics but it just triped at the door and fell on its face.

												Wow, am I playing the same game as all of these positive reviews?  This is one of the most annoying games I've ever played- it constantly interrupts gameplay to present a non-interactive, text-only story.  And by constantly, I mean every 30-60 seconds or so.  Fly for a while, make a couple of shots, whups now everything pause so we can have some ""storyline"".  Now back to flying the ship for a... whups... pause for more story... ok, now back to combat... let's line up a shot and... whups... pause for more story.... let's see, what's the best way to navgate from... whups... pause for more story... ok, back to trying to figure out how to... whups... pause for more story.... ok, where was I?  Whups... pause for more story...Most games with a storyline will present the story at the beginning of a mission, at the end of a mission, and maybe at 2 or 3 points within the mission.  This is the only game I have seen that constantly interrupts the flow of the game to give you the story 4 statements at a time.  I really tried to like this game, but in the end its just too annoying to play. "

												Entertaining game with some minor flaws, mainly to do with the narration. I wish there were a way to make it passive so it didn't stop the action every 5 seconds. The levels only last so long, and the narration windows are like commercial interruptions....that you can at least skip.Only a handful of the levels give you full uninterrupted combat destroying a ton of enemies, carriers, and stations....it's absolute chaos, and I feel that's where this game shines. Fighting along with allies vs going it alone.The game runs very smoothly and looks beautiful to boot. Controls can be a little wonky at times, but it's not that big of a deal. Narration is comical, aside from the gripes about interrupting the player. Ship and weapon upgrades are immense, seemingly unlimited.			"

												I can't believe this game didn't get more publicity than it does.First off, the Soundtrack by Ecdryere (Enrique Dryere) is phenomenal, and according to him is his first major release. Secondly, the story is amazingly well done. It's actually based upon/with a set of two(?) books, in which Solipso, a guy you don't know about yet (but SHOULD, soon!), is the focus, but the books mention an un-named Sage, which gives me a giddy ""OMG"" feeling, as though this game was based off of that unimportantly-mentioned character in the book, where it branches into his legacy.At first I was a bit skeptical (besides the soundtrack, I strss again.. it's more than just a techno-y soundtrack, it feels more emotional..) about the game. In the introduction there is a basic tutorial which helps you along, but as more and more game elements are introduced, such as building your own ship, they kind of leave you to figure things out for yourself.The online play is quite nice, though not many people play it.. and I still kinda suck anyway!The showcase pictures here on Steam do this game no justice, if you're curious I urge you to watch actual gameplay video.

There are plenty of ship and weapon customization. Controls are a little hard at first and requires some time to get used to, it can be quite challenging to avoid incoming attacks while maneuvering around obstacles even playing with a gamepad. The in game UI and menu system feels a little clunky, I appreciate the lengthy tutorial that guides players through every control and ship type, it can be very intimidating for new players without it.

												Only a couple of hours in so I haven't really scratched the surface yet but had to write something as so far I am very impressed. Almost feels like a crime that I got it for less than £2.The game itself is a cool mix of 2D scrolling shoot em up, ship customisation and RPG with a great story and imaginative writing. There is a real retro feel to the game that brings back early memories of titles such as scramble and uridium. The music is funky and perfect for the game when combined with some superb space backgrounds. The game is very clever in getting you used to its controls as the story develops along with some help from your friendly onboard AI who I have started to feel a fondness for. I haven't even got to the shop and customisation unlocked stages yet so know more is to come the further I get into the game. The levels vary in size and challenge so it doesn't feel repetitive. I guess I have spent so long playing 3D space sims that I forgot about the old scrolling 2D ones.  Well this game not only brings the genre back with a bang but it breaths new life into it with some great original ideas.The developers were obviously very passionate about this project as I found the game very polished and accessible. Also its been bug free so far. Really look forward to seeing more from these guys.			"

												For an indie game, this is a masterpiece. By AAA standards, it's better and plays smoother than a lot of new titles. You can tell the developers really cared about this project.The game itself plays like an arcade classic shooter however, the RPG elements offer a lot of extra gameplay and replayability. The ability to customise your ship however you want and the large variety of hulls to choose from, including 2 player hulls (pilot and gunner) there is a lot of content here.Multiplayer is unfortunately dead however, the SDL is still fun to play, even against AI. I'm hoping that when word of this game gets out a little more that the multiplayer will pick up.If you like games like S.P.A.Z and / or are a fan of the twin-stick shooter genre then this game is deffinately worth a look at. If you're not a fan of those then the story is still very good, worth reading the companion novel for.I'd recommend this game to anyone with even a passing interest in space combat.Also, the soundtrack is amazing.

The beginning tutorial is extremely long and drawn out, the controls are idiosyncratic, the humor is, in my opinion, blatantly awful, and the graphics are mediocre. There is a good amount of depth to the starship customization and multiple ways of approaching a mission. However, no matter how many chances I gave this game, in spite of all my attempts to really like it, I just couldn't get into it.I'm not a huge fan of arcade-style space gunners like asteriods, etc., and if you are like me in this regard, then I recommend you take a pass on this game.

I had to look for over an hour to find this game as a replacement for SPAZ and was highly sceptical.

												Ring Runner: Flight of the Sages is the definition of an underrated gem- didn't even have a steam release at launch. I found it on Good Old Games a couple of years ago, having never heard of it prior to the day of its launch. A mere ten dollars, I gambled on it and it payed off in spades. It's a lovingly crafted 2D, top-down space shooter with some heavy rpg elements. At the center of the experience is a brilliantly written campaign full of twists and dry humor about a distant future. In a universe ruled by a powerful central government across many galaxies, there are beings with the power to rewrite reality at the subatomic level, known as sages. The government views these individuals as a threat, of course, and has a standing capture or kill bounty on their heads. But what does this have to do with you? You don't have a clue, as you have no memory before waking up in a creepy medical lab with a sarcastic AI named Nero stuck in your head. From the moment you escape the lab and the exploding space station it's in to the very end, Ring Runner offers a compelling, fast paced and tactically diverse gameplay experience, including about sixty different ship hulls across five distinct ship classes and grouped by power level into five tiers: Arsenals are slow and powerful, with rocket and missile weapons, deployable mines and turrets, and defensive abilities. Casters are space-wizards with gravity and space-time manipulation and specialized energy weapons, Fighters are fast and maneuverable with powerful fixed-forward laser cannons, movement abilities and build up a lot of waste heat, but they can weaponize it and cause enemy ships to overheat. Grapplers take a page from Outlaw Star, with aggressive ""jousting"" abilties, melee weapons and grapple tethers. Rogues are sneaky, using cloaking, decoys and apply ""gemini beacons"" to enemies which can be exploited for damage and crowd control effects. There are a number of hulls that are hybrids of two or even three classes, and a special set of ""Duo"" ships that allow for two player local coop, with one player steering the ship and another operating an independent turret. Each class also has passive ""veterancy"" bonuses earned in-game for getting kill streaks, but reset if you get blown up. There are hundreds of different components, allowing you to customize your loadout to an intense degree: power supply, engine, shields, heat dispersion, auxiliary drives, utility systems, weapons, and class equipment. You have twelve possible ability slots in-game, as well as a ""sage power"" ultimate slot such as slowing down time, and an extra directional ability slot that uses the mouse or right stick. However, you need not fill ALL these slots with weapons and abilities, as there are a range of passive items that multiply the power of your active abilities, but use the same slots. Early in the campaign you use a fixed setup while you learn the controls and the nuances of each ship class, but eventually you gain access to the research lab and hangar to purchase new parts and reconfigure your setup. You can also buy a number of prebuilt configurations that are all viable endgame setups and can provide inspiration for your custom ships. There's also a wide variety of cooperative and versus multiplayer modes. The former includes wave survival, a boss rush style ""gladiator"" mode, zombie mode, team-based ""attack their base and defend yours"" spire mode, and a moba-flavored ""Space Defense League"" mode that includes things like minions, neutral bosses and buffs, but without the ♥♥♥♥♥iness of a typical moba. In any game mode, including the campaign, you earn ""plex"" to spend on researching and purchasing new ship hulls and parts from the lab, which act as a sort of experience meter: reaching certain net worth milestones unlocks new prebuilt ships. Add to this a beautiful backgrounds and visual effects, fully-functional Newtonian physics, an excellent, atmospheric soundtrack, and steam workshop support so that you can share your ship setups with others, and you have a recipe for a game that is, I think, one in a million. If you enjoy space shooters or action rpgs of any kind, you cannot afford to miss Ring Runner. There's even a novel! I should get around to reading that...			"

Certainly an in depth game you got to immerse yourself into, but the story line is decant with a lot of comedic relief.			"

												If you can accept the quirks and oddities of the game, you should find this game very enjoyable and addictive. The absurd number of different modules you can fit to your ship to make it your own is brilliant. You get a lot of choice for customisation. The story is satisfyingly humurous and detailed. The game does present a good challenge, even on the standard difficulty at times. The combat is a little unorthodox but it feels great once you get used to it. I wouldn't say it's for everyone, but it very much appeals to me. The game is severely underrated if you ask me.			"

												Since I've been away on a work trip with no internet access, I bought this game to keep me occupied (hence the apparent less than 1 hour ""on record"" - it doesn't seem to track while offline).I've actually put in so far around 3-4 hours or so, and I am absolutely loving it.Right now I'm just going through the campaign, and I've only just got to the part where it introduces the galaxy... the amount of content in this game is astounding (open galaxy/ multiplayer/ campaign). Custom ships, pre-built ships, lots of loot, there is so much content in this game to keep you occupied for hours.There is a lot of reading to do though, but the text is quite funny at times... some responses you see are such responses you'd expect to hear from real people talking - it basically doesn't feel scripted. Which is pretty great.Graphics... well, it's a top down game. It's hard to judge graphics based on this, but I can say that I love the art style. It works for this game.Sound... It sounds great. One thing that I would love to see is voice acting. It would seriously make this game even more amazing.Gameplay, again I've only got a few hours, but I want to carry on playing... it hooks you in really well. It's difficult at times (I'm on Sage difficulty, which is 3rd - iirc - down the list), and other times you can go straight through... but the amount of content I've seen so far makes it worth so much more than the 80 cents I paid for this game.Overall it's pretty fantastic. I don't believe in giving scores out of 5, 10, 100, 7546 but I will say I love it. And will continue to play it!			"

												Incredible Hidden gem. If you like Top down space games with Newtonian Physics Flight model its a must have. The price is quite awesome for that amount of content that is offered and for me most aspects of the game felt quite fleshed out and polished. The story took me about 20 hours.Oh and theres a demo. Try that if the reviews arent convincing.Longer Review:Story and missions:Since its Story driven there is no open world. You have a Galaxy map to choose between Mission arcs after the Introduction. Each mission arc is a little side story in itself for example agressivle selling DOVRAK keyboard or Planning a heist.The Story is in my opionion well written and engaging. It has some memorable characters in it and it doesnt take itself too seriously. Its kinda a wacky universe but without being silly. Indruduction and tutorial is woven into the story in a beliveable way. And i got the feeling of ""just on more mission i want to see what happens next"".The missions themselves reach from very short to quite a bit longer and are really varied. Just a excerpt of what types i have encountered: gladiator style where you fight in a arena agains other ships, racing missions with weapons on a track, tower defense missions, stealth missions and the obligatory fly around and kill stuff including whole starbases missions.Besides that you have scenarios. like a dotastyle game, zombie survival, deathmatch and so on.And the rostrum acade with some minigames that will remind you of arace classicsgamepalay:Its a newtonian Style shooter. So no strafing and backwarts. Just forward turn and brakes. But youll get pretty fast used to it. But there lots of movmentbased abillitys that can fling you and/or your enemys around.The ship archetypes allow very different styles of gameplay. Rogues feel like snipers, Casters have flashy AOE abiitys, Fighters like dogfighting and so on.Besides that you have tons of different ships and lots of sidegrades at tier5 that mix up the archetypes and with tons of equipment which is unlocked via research or missions there is such room for customization and trying new things.The resrach system is quite awesome and allows to unlock up to 10 items (or get money) when youre not playing the game. And ingame money earned while playing speed the research up. Though you cant research a specific ithem directly. Its devided into different categorys which represent the equipmentnodes of the different ships.Its not a RPG in the classical sense though. Because there is no leveling. Everything is unlocked via Story, research or funds.Asthetics are fitting and feel quite unique. Because its 2.5d it is clearly visible where you can actually fly against something and where you can fly freely. The feels a bit gamey but doesnt disctract from the immersion too much.For me it is a really great game and it is sad that it had such a bad launch date and kinda slipped under the radar. This game deserves more than it actually got.			"

Soundtrack is awesome. It is joy to control the ship. There is just ridiculous amount of variety and customizations. I love the story and it's characters.

												This game surprised me. I picked it up on a sale and I was expecting something reasonably generic in terms of a spacey shooter game. In reality, it's a well thought through game with an interesting story, good soundtrack and really tight gameplay.It is a spacey shooter at it's core, but there's enough variation going on that it's not feeling samey. The customisation choices and the variation of gamestyle it offers is really high, which coupled with the alternative game modes (like racing, tower defence) it makes for a rich and interesting experience.In hindsight, I'd buy it at full price and feel happy.

It takes some time to getting used to the controls, and a gamepad is seriously recommended (at least in my opinion), but once you've managed to get used to the controls, you'll feel like you're really flying your own ship, from an insometric 2d point of view, of course.

												This game is a great value for 10 dollars.  The writing/story is pretty good for a space adventure game.  Ive beaten the ""tutorial"" which actually had a decent plot and took a good 3 hours.  A billion possible ship designs, a good number of other game modes and challenges besides the already good single-player story.  The graphics are actually quite nice to look at, dont mind that its 2d at all.  Controlling your ship is difficult especially when things get hectic, but then thats the fun of the game too......actually getting skilled with the ship you built or that the story gives you.  If you are looking for something different that you can sink your teeth into, I would strongly recommend this game especially given its price.  No ide what multiplayer is like though.			"

There are not many of them, but so far this game has been nothing but fun since I bought it.A gem lost in a sea of games, a quite fun and interesting plotline, which accomplishes it's commitment. Be stupid and serious at the same time.Simple controls don't mean the game is simple by any means, the game can be quite hard on the later levels, and I'm just playing on the 2nd skill level (out of like 8)All in all, I do suggest this buy for the fun/price ratio.

												Ring Runner is okay, but I would not recommend it to a friend. The beginning tutorial is extremely long and drawn out, the controls are idiosyncratic, the humor is, in my opinion, blatantly awful, and the graphics are mediocre. There is a good amount of depth to the starship customization and multiple ways of approaching a mission. However, no matter how many chances I gave this game, in spite of all my attempts to really like it, I just couldn't get into it.I'm not a huge fan of arcade-style space gunners like asteriods, etc., and if you are like me in this regard, then I recommend you take a pass on this game. However, if this type of game is something you really enjoy, then there is a lot here that might satisfy you.6/10			"

The gameplay is awesome, the customization of the ships is great for choosing which arsenal of weapons you like best, and the story... one of the greatest plots I have ever seen. When you are learning Sage macros, it truly feels like you are in the most sacred, mystic place on the universe, and you have full control of every single molecule. And the plot twists... the feelings are strong in some points of the game.The ending, in combination with the credits song, brought tears to my eyes.Oh, and that was only for the single player mode!

												I have no idea how this game got overlooked. The combat is incredibly tight and feels awesome with a very high skill ceiling and a ton of different ways to play, the writing is oftentimes hilarious and the characters are spot on an sympathetic. The plotline is excellent for a game, too, with a rather well-built universe to support it. The ship customization is incredibly in depth too, allowing for interesting and skillful combinations that all play differently. The campaign is really lengthy with a ton of varied mission types. Even the sage missions are different and sometimes act more like a puzzle game than the space shooter it is to give a nice break to the pacing and combat. There is jsut so much content here, Esepcially for 10$, that this one is worth way more than the asking price. There is no excuse to avoid picking this one up, and even less if it is on sale. If you're even remotely interested in a very tightly made, incredibly well polished space shooter, you need to play this. Even if you're not interested as much in the gameplay, the difficulty levels go from cheese-it easy if you jsut want to experience a bit of the gamepaly and story to 'the union', a brutal, no holds barred difficulty that puts dark souls and its ilk to shame. About the only con is that there is noone on the multiplayer. You can always set up games between or with your friends in the actually rather content rich and varied (but, due to the high skill ceiling of both play and designing your ships, possibly unbalanced) multiplayer modes or play them against bots which is still tons of fun and an easy way to spend hours of your time, but there doesn't seem to be any sort of community.

												This is one of the most ""complete"" indie games on Steam, without a doubt! It takes a fairly simple genre, top down-shooter, and does as much as it wants with it! And what's nicer is that by showing how much the game can do, it also opens up quite a lot more that can be done... Sometimes it seems like a genre has ""hit its limits"" ... and then a game like this comes and throws that all way, it's pretty great!Basically, it's a Top-down Space Shooter with physics-based movement (you need to use your thrusters rather than WASD), and quite complex ship customization with various ""classes"" that change gameplay a lot!Each class has several hulls, each with different configurations which you can customize with parts. There must be hundreds of parts, half of which I haven't even unlocked.But basically, there are active and passive abilities, each with a power ""number"". Each slot on the ship has a type and capacity, and you'll need to play with it to find a good combination of pieces for each slot.You can have a melee focused ship that grabs enemies, or one that uses flails that follow you around and do massive damage; you can be a rogue, staying invisible until you shoot ships with a very powerful laser; you can be a pyromaniac, trying to set ships on fire to overheat them; you can be an AOE focused ship, with large attacks and gravity shifting abilities... I could go on, but you get the idea. And even each of these types can have drastically different abilities, since you can fine-tune everything!The game also has quite a lot of game modes, including online (which, unfortunately, is deserted) and arcade. Using the game's mechanics, it recreates several classic arcade games like Breakout and Asteroids, for example. On the online side, you have a MOBA-like mode, as well as Horde modes, either wave based or zombie-based, where the game overwhelms you with mindless enemies... It's really fun!It also has a 20+ hours campaign, that has some interesting aspects! For example, the tutorial lasts 3hours, or more. But it's a meaningful part of the game! It's not the game simply holding your hand -- it's your character learning about the universe with you. Meeting ""veteran"" characters, and getting some lessons with them, while experiencing significant parts of the story. It's great! And I've found it a very nice way of teaching the player as much as you can, while integrating it into the overall purpose of the game.This long tutorial is also necessary, as the game can be quite overwhelming. I played this back in 2013/2014 for around 7 hours. I've done little more than the tutorial, in that time (it was much faster the this time around). Yet, when the tutorial ended, the game seemed to throw me into the wolves -- the ship customization. That's what I think it under-tutorialized, as it was overwhelming to the point of me putting the game aside for a year or two.That said, this time I tried a little harder and actually experimented with various ships, not minding a few lost missions - and it's brilliant!Any time you get stuck on a mission, try changing things around. Try a different type of ship, perhaps one more suited to the mission. Nowadays, it seems I'm too used to games being very clear and to the point, never having to experiment and try things for myself. This one is different, and it was quite daunting. But it's certainly worth it!The game also has you try different premade ships during the campaign, in some special missions. It helps, at least to give you an idea of what each type is capable of, this giving you a starting point.The game has dozens, if not hundreds, of missions. Each of those can be completed in just a couple of minutes, most of the time, never stretching over 10minutes. However, there are locations with chains of missions, if you will, to keep things significant.The cool part if that each missions has several bonus objectives, acting as challenges. Some are time-based, carnage-based, etc. It gives you a lot of room for replayability and challenge that isn't simply tied to ""how much HP/damage to enemies do"", which is always great! The only bonus challenge I didn't like was the one, present in several levels, about ""Complete the level without using a Sage ability""... Your character is a Sage. Some type of special dude in the universe and whatnot. As a Sage, you have one of various special abilities, like Time Warp. These are special in the sense that they're mostly unique, different from your enemies and ship parts. They make the game more interesting. And yet, the game often asks you not to use it... With me trying to do some bonus objectives, I got in the habit of never using it, even outside missions with such an objective. It's discouraging players from using a significant part of the game and I don't understand why anyone would want to do that. But anyway, it's not major, especially being optional! It's just a form of (dis)couragement that should be used to guide the player into exploring the mechanics, not the other way around, in my view.There's quite more to say about the game, but that's the problem, haha!The music is pretty good, and the visuals even better! Despite being very simple looking, the game makes good use of a few modern effects that certainly makes it stand-out, for me! Every object casts soft shadows from the large stars in the background, and the backgrounds are composed of several layers, each of them animated, yet not distracting. It's great!Honestly, I was overwhelmed with the game, the first time I played it. But if you can keep going after that initial wall, it has incredible depth, and definitely changes things around in an otherwise stale genre!I'd place it up there with SPAZ, regarding some of the best, recent top-down space shooters with a focus on customization.Definitely get it, especially when it's on sale!

												I had to warm up to this game at first, then it became really, really fun. There are tons of customization options, and you spend much of your time getting upgrades for that perfect ship. The game looks like something that was made with a lot of effort and dedication, and it even shows during the hangar screens while I'm designing my ship (seeing a rotating ship in the background, little details like this). The campaign is kind of boring though, but you need to play through it to get to your ships.			"

												This game is very complex and very unique. I have played games like it, but no where near this game's depth. There are so many different ways to customize your ships and different ways to play. The writing is also quite good. If you are into space combat style games I would highly recmmend this. I'm 9 hours into it and there is still plenty of content left. My main complaint is that the you have to play the campagn for quite a while (you play with each ship style and there are 6 styles) before you can begin to customize your loadout. This can really stink for the sections of campaign that your don't like the ship they give you. Also, I have'nt tried the multiplayer yet but it could be quite interesting as well.			"

Exciting gameplay, charming story-line with endearing characters, great sense of humour, and a gorgeous sountrack.This game combines fast action, skill, and reflexes in gameplay with thoughtful mental challenges in ship design.  Everything is exercised.Many gratifying tributes to the oldie games that clearly had a huge part in this games inspiration with side missions reminicsent of Asteroids, Pong, and similar games, without them pulling too far from the core game enough to be frustrating.Truely loved this game, and I hope many more people will discover it.

												This game... It's a bit hard to put it. But the experience on it is great.The gameplay takes you on, it's not hard, as long as you like shmups or anything of the kind. Ships are incredibly customizable and the Snow Leopard one... Just amazing.The history of the game is fun to go through, it gets you curious to know what will happen on the next part, holds your mind into the game wondering about the nameless sage and Algray Solipso. By far, a game that doesn't need much to hold the player until you can complete the history.And then there's the book, Ring Runner: Derelict Dreams... It was the first book i could begin reading and actually read to the last page. I'm not giving any spoilers about the book, but it surely holds you as much as the game does. 10/10, we need more games like this!			"

												I would recommend this at the advertised price 9.99 but you might wait for a sale.I love the concept of it being an RPG, but it's not.  The tutorial is kind of rpgish but very structured--few choices in customization and ship choice so they can introduce you to all the ships.The problem is that afterwards all the level 1-3 ships, most hulls and a bunch of level 5 prebuilts are all open.At that point it's not an RPG, it's a combat/shooter with a decent choice of ships and weapons.I restarted hoping for an ""RPG"" mode where you start with a single, tiny fighter hull and work your way up but no--you skip the tutoral and they just open up everything including 1-2 of each highest level prebuilt hull.I realize many people don't like RPGs and so they just want to get to the highest level with every option open and fight, but if that's the case kindly don't advertise it as an RPG.  For isntance, Diablo 3 is this way--levels 1-70 are paretty much a tutorial and then you start playing after level 70.  Stop calling these things RPGs, they are fighting games with extended tutorials--that's it.Still, not at all bad for the price.  Even has a MOBA map that's pretty cool.If an RPG mode was introduced to (optionally) replace the extended tutorial with slower advancement and less initially unlocked I'd be really happy with this game.

												Ring Runner is a top down shooter ARPG with a rather large campaign considering the genre it's in. My older brother recommended this game to me and gifted it to me on steam and it was a blast to play. I was interested in the story and I enjoyed the sense of humor in the dialogue. The combat system this game has responsive, tight controls with (Depends on the class and how you fit your engines)  bit of a twist thanks to the newtonian physics. Every key is fully rebindable in the options and you can manually bind your ships abilities in the ship creator you unlock later to fit any control scheme you desire. My only real complaint is that the game takes a bit to hook you in, as the best part is the all of the ways you can fit your ships to just about any play style and control scheme you can think of. At least try to make it to the Dvorak Galaxy! More indepth review here: http://extra-credits.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=7167&p=137145 "

												Game was really good, actually; as long as you know what you're getting into...  Lot of people complained about the controls, which is what made me a little wary before purchasing.  This is a top-down, 2d space shooter that follows space physics regarding inertia and flight in a vacuum so it might feel a little weird at first but you get used to it.  Better ships obviously feel better, maneuverability-wise, later in the game.Story's decent.  Maybe above average for originality in some points.  Some interesting scientific foundations that I'd be curious to know whether they have any basis in current theory.Graphics are good, flight and combat are both satisfying and pretty action-packed.  Overall the game was really fun, and pretty long for what it was.  If you like space combat games, or top-down scroller aerial combat (which this is strongly reminiscent of), check this out.			"

												I've never written a review before, but this game is SUPER relaxing! Great atmosphere; Controls need some customization until they are comfortable. That being said, the options are very customizable so its easy to cater to people who have very niche key bindings! Once you set up those controls though, its single player (or how much ive played so far) has a great soundtrack, witty humor in the story, and smooth physics. The particles at times can get to be a bit much as a new player, but thats because there are so many of them. Maybe I will come to like this sort of graphic. The mix between 3d and 2d is tastefull, but a little jumbled at times (although that may just be a flaw of the type itself and not this game).  I havent gotten to multiplayer yet, but I look forward to it. Overall this game is refreshing and fun! Very low maintinence on your setup. Theres nothing quite like it, and a great break from grinding soloque in League of Legends!			"

												Only a couple of hours in so I haven't really scratched the surface yet but had to write something as so far I am very impressed. Almost feels like a crime that I got it for less than £2.The game itself is a cool mix of 2D scrolling shoot em up, ship customisation and RPG with a great story and imaginative writing. There is a real retro feel to the game that brings back early memories of titles such as scramble and uridium. The music is funky and perfect for the game when combined with some superb space backgrounds. The game is very clever in getting you used to its controls as the story develops along with some help from your friendly onboard AI who I have started to feel a fondness for. I haven't even got to the shop and customisation unlocked stages yet so know more is to come the further I get into the game. The levels vary in size and challenge so it doesn't feel repetitive. I guess I have spent so long playing 3D space sims that I forgot about the old scrolling 2D ones.  Well this game not only brings the genre back with a bang but it breaths new life into it with some great original ideas.The developers were obviously very passionate about this project as I found the game very polished and accessible. Also its been bug free so far. Really look forward to seeing more from these guys.			"

												An odd critter in today's game market, echoed in the past by a few greats from the dawn of gaming.   Now that I'm done being poetic, if you are old enough to remember Asteroids or Star Control and enjoyed them then this will be a pleasant reminder of fun times past, particularly if you were a fan of the quirky Star Control storyline.   The gameplay is a bit stilted and linear, many times I felt as if I had just found a ship I liked when I was switched to a new one.   The press to have a ton of variety and customizabilty of ships (because there is a LOT of it) leaves even a gaming grognard like myself a little confused, as many of the items and upgrades are not really explained well.2/5 stars, 3 if you are an ""inertia shooter"" fan.

												Great little game. Tons of customization, decently lengthy and interesting campaign, and way more extra game features and modes than they needed to put in here to make it worth the price - including a MOBA, brick breaker, lights out puzzles, zombie survival and duo ships that can bind abilities to multiple controllers for local co-op.The physics make things fairly interesting and gives a high skill cap, but once you get into it it's pretty easy to build a ship that does ridiculous things. There are just so many abilities.. if you like spending hours sorting through parts to build stuff you will love this game. If that doesn't interest you, you also unlock good pre-built designs that guide you (and for a long time were better than what I was making).			"

Optional objectives on almost every mission and many difficulties, breathe a lot of life into the game after completing the story once, once you've enjoyed the narrative.To top it off, there's a co-op duo mode once you start being able to choose your own ship, where you have two people running one ship.

												For an indie game, this is a masterpiece. By AAA standards, it's better and plays smoother than a lot of new titles. You can tell the developers really cared about this project.The game itself plays like an arcade classic shooter however, the RPG elements offer a lot of extra gameplay and replayability. The ability to customise your ship however you want and the large variety of hulls to choose from, including 2 player hulls (pilot and gunner) there is a lot of content here.Multiplayer is unfortunately dead however, the SDL is still fun to play, even against AI. I'm hoping that when word of this game gets out a little more that the multiplayer will pick up.If you like games like S.P.A.Z and / or are a fan of the twin-stick shooter genre then this game is deffinately worth a look at. If you're not a fan of those then the story is still very good, worth reading the companion novel for.I'd recommend this game to anyone with even a passing interest in space combat.Also, the soundtrack is amazing.

												Absolute awesomeness! I like a few other people I think, stopped playing the game about 3o minutes to an hour. The two reasons I stopped playing are as follows. The first reason, and I believe others have touched on this point, that at first it seems a bit clunky, bland and all round not very interesting. The second Intel built in graphics cant really play this game. Any a few months and a laptop upgrade later, and magic happened! I was bored I looked at the game and thought ""Meh, why the hell not."" I did not regret it. 10 monutes after I started playing again the game picked up pace, the gameplay got a lot more enjoyable, and the humour rolled out! Oh did the humor roll out... The humour (yes it is spelt with a ""u"" :P ) is completely on point! It contains probably the best humor in a game (in my humble opinion) that I have seen since the two portals. Absolutely play this game! If you can look past its few flaws, you will have a great experience playing it. Last note: Dont trust people trying to sell you dvorak keyboards! :P			"

Short versionJesus christ. The game is ridiculously, overwhelmingly awesome. Longer versionCombat:Gratitious Space Battles combat was dull. SPAZ combat was fun. Reassembly combat is great. Ring Runner's combat is just outstanding. It's super dynamic, fast-paced but not chaotic: you control the pace of fight. It's like an action-RPG with a very deep skill system, where every skill is indeed unique. Most abilities have very low cooldowns, so you'll have to blink, dodge, slow time, push, pull, manage your heat, shield and energy and destroy your enemies in any way you can imagine. 10/10.Customization:No, you can not build your ship from scratch like you can in reassembly. But hell, this game's customization system is just way more advanced and balanced! Every hull has a set number of mounting points for different types of devices. Every mounting point has a capacity: the more capacity it has, the more comlex gear you may equip to it grating you passive bonuses or active abilities. You may equip multiple devices into a single mounting point if you have the capacity. It's so way better than in any other seemengly similar game like Gratitious Space Battles or SPAZ.10/10.Abilities:Basically everything including evasion and weapon autofiring is an ability in this game. And wow, varied they are. Abilities are designed to be very synergetic and they often let you turn your downsides into an advantage. For example you can grab a super-powerful engine that generates a ton of heat. Overheating is generally not the thing you want. But you can attach a freaking molten laser that dissipates all your heat in one shot if you're overheated! Or you can equip an engine with high top speed but low acceleration and get an ability that instantly accelerates you to maximum speed in any direction.Basically there are only 2 games I know that have as synergetic abilities as this: Tales of Maj'Eyal 4 and Baldur's Gate 2(wizard). Please tell me if you know another!10/10 here, no doubtGraphics:The game is developed by one family. Graphics are 3d while game mechanics are 2d. They pretty advanced, run smoothly but I personally am not a huge fan of this game's graphical content. SPAZ or Gratitious Space Battles look better if you ask me. But it's nowhere close to being game-breaking or unlikable.7/10Story:I have not completed the story yet. So far(10 hours of story) it is pretty fun and well-written. It's not a Planescape: Torment in space but there's a decent sci-fi story that utilizes some very well-though physical concepts. Like Mass Effect is based on physical phenomon called Mass Effect(some materials may change their density when electrical current is applied to them) this game has numerous concepts that I found even more interesting(physics is my major).8/10(?)Music:Game's music is atmospheric enough and fits it well though it it sometimes a little repititive. You're unlikely to listen to game's OST when you're not playing like you listen to Silent HIll's or Final Fantasy's but it is a great soundtrack and you won't end up listening to your own music instead of built-in soundtrack.7/10Controls:As I said before, most abilities have low cooldowns and you may end up equipping a lot of them. Ability management, movement, evasion and heat/energy/ammo may will be as challenging as you want them to. If you can't handle too much active abilities, equip passives instead. But I love controlling as much as my brain can handle and the game certainly gives me opportunity to equip enough active skills. My gamepad acts funny with this game(analog joystick sticks to 8 discrete directions)  but controlling with mouse + keyboard is great anyway and controlling multiple skills is more convinient with keyboard.General impression:The game is Loved by its developers. You can feel it in every aspect in every small detail. It's like the opposite to stuff you see in android market or most early access garbage that are developed to get as much money and as soon is possible. This game is so detailed, so well-though, so *lived* by it's developers I just can't help but admire it. It's very strange and disappointing to see how unknown it is and it's 75/100 metascore rating is just frustrating. Do not let AAA-crap reviwers fool you, this is a true indie game gem.			"

												Incredible Hidden gem. If you like Top down space games with Newtonian Physics Flight model its a must have. The price is quite awesome for that amount of content that is offered and for me most aspects of the game felt quite fleshed out and polished. The story took me about 20 hours.Oh and theres a demo. Try that if the reviews arent convincing.Longer Review:Story and missions:Since its Story driven there is no open world. You have a Galaxy map to choose between Mission arcs after the Introduction. Each mission arc is a little side story in itself for example agressivle selling DOVRAK keyboard or Planning a heist.The Story is in my opionion well written and engaging. It has some memorable characters in it and it doesnt take itself too seriously. Its kinda a wacky universe but without being silly. Indruduction and tutorial is woven into the story in a beliveable way. And i got the feeling of ""just on more mission i want to see what happens next"".The missions themselves reach from very short to quite a bit longer and are really varied. Just a excerpt of what types i have encountered: gladiator style where you fight in a arena agains other ships, racing missions with weapons on a track, tower defense missions, stealth missions and the obligatory fly around and kill stuff including whole starbases missions.Besides that you have scenarios. like a dotastyle game, zombie survival, deathmatch and so on.And the rostrum acade with some minigames that will remind you of arace classicsgamepalay:Its a newtonian Style shooter. So no strafing and backwarts. Just forward turn and brakes. But youll get pretty fast used to it. But there lots of movmentbased abillitys that can fling you and/or your enemys around.The ship archetypes allow very different styles of gameplay. Rogues feel like snipers, Casters have flashy AOE abiitys, Fighters like dogfighting and so on.Besides that you have tons of different ships and lots of sidegrades at tier5 that mix up the archetypes and with tons of equipment which is unlocked via research or missions there is such room for customization and trying new things.The resrach system is quite awesome and allows to unlock up to 10 items (or get money) when youre not playing the game. And ingame money earned while playing speed the research up. Though you cant research a specific ithem directly. Its devided into different categorys which represent the equipmentnodes of the different ships.Its not a RPG in the classical sense though. Because there is no leveling. Everything is unlocked via Story, research or funds.Asthetics are fitting and feel quite unique. Because its 2.5d it is clearly visible where you can actually fly against something and where you can fly freely. The feels a bit gamey but doesnt disctract from the immersion too much.For me it is a really great game and it is sad that it had such a bad launch date and kinda slipped under the radar. This game deserves more than it actually got.			"

												As of this writing I have 14.5 hours logged on this game and I am still not done with the single player campaign! I love the writing style and the story. The universe is compelling and the graphics are beautiful. I have a little experience with the multiplayer and find it very competitive. The pacing of the tutorials are good, and I find the Research system intriguing as it allows you to specialize  what items are available to you during play.			"

												This game surprised me. I picked it up on a sale and I was expecting something reasonably generic in terms of a spacey shooter game. In reality, it's a well thought through game with an interesting story, good soundtrack and really tight gameplay.It is a spacey shooter at it's core, but there's enough variation going on that it's not feeling samey. The customisation choices and the variation of gamestyle it offers is really high, which coupled with the alternative game modes (like racing, tower defence) it makes for a rich and interesting experience.In hindsight, I'd buy it at full price and feel happy.

												Since I've been away on a work trip with no internet access, I bought this game to keep me occupied (hence the apparent less than 1 hour ""on record"" - it doesn't seem to track while offline).I've actually put in so far around 3-4 hours or so, and I am absolutely loving it.Right now I'm just going through the campaign, and I've only just got to the part where it introduces the galaxy... the amount of content in this game is astounding (open galaxy/ multiplayer/ campaign). Custom ships, pre-built ships, lots of loot, there is so much content in this game to keep you occupied for hours.There is a lot of reading to do though, but the text is quite funny at times... some responses you see are such responses you'd expect to hear from real people talking - it basically doesn't feel scripted. Which is pretty great.Graphics... well, it's a top down game. It's hard to judge graphics based on this, but I can say that I love the art style. It works for this game.Sound... It sounds great. One thing that I would love to see is voice acting. It would seriously make this game even more amazing.Gameplay, again I've only got a few hours, but I want to carry on playing... it hooks you in really well. It's difficult at times (I'm on Sage difficulty, which is 3rd - iirc - down the list), and other times you can go straight through... but the amount of content I've seen so far makes it worth so much more than the 80 cents I paid for this game.Overall it's pretty fantastic. I don't believe in giving scores out of 5, 10, 100, 7546 but I will say I love it. And will continue to play it!			"

												Ring Runner is okay, but I would not recommend it to a friend. The beginning tutorial is extremely long and drawn out, the controls are idiosyncratic, the humor is, in my opinion, blatantly awful, and the graphics are mediocre. There is a good amount of depth to the starship customization and multiple ways of approaching a mission. However, no matter how many chances I gave this game, in spite of all my attempts to really like it, I just couldn't get into it.I'm not a huge fan of arcade-style space gunners like asteriods, etc., and if you are like me in this regard, then I recommend you take a pass on this game. However, if this type of game is something you really enjoy, then there is a lot here that might satisfy you.6/10			"

												I've never written a review before, but this game is SUPER relaxing! Great atmosphere; Controls need some customization until they are comfortable. That being said, the options are very customizable so its easy to cater to people who have very niche key bindings! Once you set up those controls though, its single player (or how much ive played so far) has a great soundtrack, witty humor in the story, and smooth physics. The particles at times can get to be a bit much as a new player, but thats because there are so many of them. Maybe I will come to like this sort of graphic. The mix between 3d and 2d is tastefull, but a little jumbled at times (although that may just be a flaw of the type itself and not this game).  I havent gotten to multiplayer yet, but I look forward to it. Overall this game is refreshing and fun! Very low maintinence on your setup. Theres nothing quite like it, and a great break from grinding soloque in League of Legends!			"

												Game was really good, actually; as long as you know what you're getting into...  Lot of people complained about the controls, which is what made me a little wary before purchasing.  This is a top-down, 2d space shooter that follows space physics regarding inertia and flight in a vacuum so it might feel a little weird at first but you get used to it.  Better ships obviously feel better, maneuverability-wise, later in the game.Story's decent.  Maybe above average for originality in some points.  Some interesting scientific foundations that I'd be curious to know whether they have any basis in current theory.Graphics are good, flight and combat are both satisfying and pretty action-packed.  Overall the game was really fun, and pretty long for what it was.  If you like space combat games, or top-down scroller aerial combat (which this is strongly reminiscent of), check this out.			"

When you are learning Sage macros, it truly feels like you are in the most sacred, mystic place on the universe, and you have full control of every single molecule. And the plot twists... the feelings are strong in some points of the game.The ending, in combination with the credits song, brought tears to my eyes.Oh, and that was only for the single player mode! This game has multiplayer too, which I have yet to try out!10/10, would play again to beat the campaign on a harder difficulty.﻿			"

												This is a wonderful game in many ways, it has a well-written story with tons of nice ideas about space, fun and easy-to-get-into gameplay and thrilling space combat. Honestly, what more do you need for a sci-fi game?And beside the size of this game, it has a lot of modes to enjoy, even a MOBA-like mode that offer tons of fun when playing with friends, your screen will be splatted with effect and skill shot.The game also gives you tons of equipment for you to customize your ships, and I mean ""ships"", I mean tons of ships in the game, range from small ships to battleships.Sadly, while this game has nice multiplayer mode, I rarely see another online or even a host, which means not many knows this game. And you, if you haven't tried yet and into sci-fi game with spaceships, try now. You will give me ton of thanks.A masterpiece, this game, support it!			"

												This game is very complex and very unique. I have played games like it, but no where near this game's depth. There are so many different ways to customize your ships and different ways to play. The writing is also quite good. If you are into space combat style games I would highly recmmend this. I'm 9 hours into it and there is still plenty of content left. My main complaint is that the you have to play the campagn for quite a while (you play with each ship style and there are 6 styles) before you can begin to customize your loadout. This can really stink for the sections of campaign that your don't like the ship they give you. Also, I have'nt tried the multiplayer yet but it could be quite interesting as well.			"

Short versionJesus christ. The game is ridiculously, overwhelmingly awesome. Longer versionCombat:Gratitious Space Battles combat was dull. SPAZ combat was fun. Reassembly combat is great. Ring Runner's combat is just outstanding. It's super dynamic, fast-paced but not chaotic: you control the pace of fight. It's like an action-RPG with a very deep skill system, where every skill is indeed unique. Most abilities have very low cooldowns, so you'll have to blink, dodge, slow time, push, pull, manage your heat, shield and energy and destroy your enemies in any way you can imagine. 10/10.Customization:No, you can not build your ship from scratch like you can in reassembly. But hell, this game's customization system is just way more advanced and balanced! Every hull has a set number of mounting points for different types of devices. Every mounting point has a capacity: the more capacity it has, the more comlex gear you may equip to it grating you passive bonuses or active abilities. You may equip multiple devices into a single mounting point if you have the capacity. It's so way better than in any other seemengly similar game like Gratitious Space Battles or SPAZ.10/10.Abilities:Basically everything including evasion and weapon autofiring is an ability in this game. And wow, varied they are. Abilities are designed to be very synergetic and they often let you turn your downsides into an advantage. For example you can grab a super-powerful engine that generates a ton of heat. Overheating is generally not the thing you want. But you can attach a freaking molten laser that dissipates all your heat in one shot if you're overheated! Or you can equip an engine with high top speed but low acceleration and get an ability that instantly accelerates you to maximum speed in any direction.Basically there are only 2 games I know that have as synergetic abilities as this: Tales of Maj'Eyal 4 and Baldur's Gate 2(wizard).

												For an indie game, this is a masterpiece. By AAA standards, it's better and plays smoother than a lot of new titles. You can tell the developers really cared about this project.The game itself plays like an arcade classic shooter however, the RPG elements offer a lot of extra gameplay and replayability. The ability to customise your ship however you want and the large variety of hulls to choose from, including 2 player hulls (pilot and gunner) there is a lot of content here.Multiplayer is unfortunately dead however, the SDL is still fun to play, even against AI. I'm hoping that when word of this game gets out a little more that the multiplayer will pick up.If you like games like S.P.A.Z and / or are a fan of the twin-stick shooter genre then this game is deffinately worth a look at. If you're not a fan of those then the story is still very good, worth reading the companion novel for.I'd recommend this game to anyone with even a passing interest in space combat.Also, the soundtrack is amazing.

												An odd critter in today's game market, echoed in the past by a few greats from the dawn of gaming.   Now that I'm done being poetic, if you are old enough to remember Asteroids or Star Control and enjoyed them then this will be a pleasant reminder of fun times past, particularly if you were a fan of the quirky Star Control storyline.   The gameplay is a bit stilted and linear, many times I felt as if I had just found a ship I liked when I was switched to a new one.   The press to have a ton of variety and customizabilty of ships (because there is a LOT of it) leaves even a gaming grognard like myself a little confused, as many of the items and upgrades are not really explained well.2/5 stars, 3 if you are an ""inertia shooter"" fan.

												Great little game. Tons of customization, decently lengthy and interesting campaign, and way more extra game features and modes than they needed to put in here to make it worth the price - including a MOBA, brick breaker, lights out puzzles, zombie survival and duo ships that can bind abilities to multiple controllers for local co-op.The physics make things fairly interesting and gives a high skill cap, but once you get into it it's pretty easy to build a ship that does ridiculous things. There are just so many abilities.. if you like spending hours sorting through parts to build stuff you will love this game. If that doesn't interest you, you also unlock good pre-built designs that guide you (and for a long time were better than what I was making).			"

												A great game for a variety of reasons.  Great humour, a story significantly more interesting than you'd expect from the genre, and lots of minigames/mission types synched up with the story to keep things interesting.  Optional objectives on almost every mission and many difficulties, breathe a lot of life into the game after completing the story once, once you've enjoyed the narrative.To top it off, there's a co-op duo mode once you start being able to choose your own ship, where you have two people running one ship.  My friend and I took turns running engines and gunnery, giving the evasion abilities to one person and the guns to the other.			"

												Really nice game, sadly, a hidden gem on steam that a lot of people have not even heard about.When it starts, it feels a little off and it makes you think you're not going to like it too much, at least that's how i felt, but that sensation went away real quick after 30 or 40 minutes when i started getting into the characters and understanding the mechanics of the game.It's got likeable characters, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ villains, funny factions, tons of customization, dozens of ships, multiplayer, badass weapons, challenging missions, tons of achievements, tons of challenges, yeah, it's definitely worth the full price, but if you can grab it during a sale with a nice discount, just go for it !

												I personally love this game however i will have to admit that it wasn't a love at first sight, at first the game can seem overwhelming with little explanation on how to build a good ship or how to even controll it.However once you get past that barier, this game is so much fun. Once the controlls are fully figured out and you have a ship that works well for you (personally i loved the caster ships) you start to realise how fully fleshed out the combat system is and how fun the zero-gravity spaceship flying can be.And if the gameplay portion of the gamee wasn't it enough it also has some incredibly funny moments with both encounters and Nero.As for the soundtrack of the game i wasn't really all too impressed, only a few times did it truly feel like it brought depth to the game. It also felt very reppetitive If you consider buying this game ask yourself thisDo you love sitting down tinkering and costumizing?Are you looking for a story intensive game that has comedy?Is space-combat games something you like?Are you willing to put some time into learning the mechanics of the game?If yes then this game will be perfect for you "

												It's one of those games you're never really getting bored of, kinda like those old games way back when that you'd keep coming back to because it was so much fun.The core gameplay's not immediately available, but that's just so the story can introduce you to each bit separately. The sheer amount of customization available means you can have the same ship loaded out to play multiple possible roles - implying you'd use the same ship, since there's over 25 such ships you can select, each bringing something different to the party.Do your friends a favor and send them this game, ESPECIALLY if it's on sale. It's almost impossible to get tired of the customization alone.			"

Honestly, what more do you need for a sci-fi game?And beside the size of this game, it has a lot of modes to enjoy, even a MOBA-like mode that offer tons of fun when playing with friends, your screen will be splatted with effect and skill shot.The game also gives you tons of equipment for you to customize your ships, and I mean ""ships"", I mean tons of ships in the game, range from small ships to battleships.Sadly, while this game has nice multiplayer mode, I rarely see another online or even a host, which means not many knows this game. And you, if you haven't tried yet and into sci-fi game with spaceships, try now. You will give me ton of thanks.A masterpiece, this game, support it!			"

Ships are incredibly customizable and the Snow Leopard one... Just amazing.The history of the game is fun to go through, it gets you curious to know what will happen on the next part, holds your mind into the game wondering about the nameless sage and Algray Solipso. By far, a game that doesn't need much to hold the player until you can complete the history.And then there's the book, Ring Runner: Derelict Dreams... It was the first book i could begin reading and actually read to the last page. I'm not giving any spoilers about the book, but it surely holds you as much as the game does. 10/10, we need more games like this!			"

												I have no idea how this game got overlooked. The combat is incredibly tight and feels awesome with a very high skill ceiling and a ton of different ways to play, the writing is oftentimes hilarious and the characters are spot on an sympathetic. The plotline is excellent for a game, too, with a rather well-built universe to support it. The ship customization is incredibly in depth too, allowing for interesting and skillful combinations that all play differently. The campaign is really lengthy with a ton of varied mission types. Even the sage missions are different and sometimes act more like a puzzle game than the space shooter it is to give a nice break to the pacing and combat. There is jsut so much content here, Esepcially for 10$, that this one is worth way more than the asking price. There is no excuse to avoid picking this one up, and even less if it is on sale. If you're even remotely interested in a very tightly made, incredibly well polished space shooter, you need to play this. Even if you're not interested as much in the gameplay, the difficulty levels go from cheese-it easy if you jsut want to experience a bit of the gamepaly and story to 'the union', a brutal, no holds barred difficulty that puts dark souls and its ilk to shame. About the only con is that there is noone on the multiplayer. You can always set up games between or with your friends in the actually rather content rich and varied (but, due to the high skill ceiling of both play and designing your ships, possibly unbalanced) multiplayer modes or play them against bots which is still tons of fun and an easy way to spend hours of your time, but there doesn't seem to be any sort of community.

												This is one of the most ""complete"" indie games on Steam, without a doubt! It takes a fairly simple genre, top down-shooter, and does as much as it wants with it! And what's nicer is that by showing how much the game can do, it also opens up quite a lot more that can be done... Sometimes it seems like a genre has ""hit its limits"" ... and then a game like this comes and throws that all way, it's pretty great!Basically, it's a Top-down Space Shooter with physics-based movement (you need to use your thrusters rather than WASD), and quite complex ship customization with various ""classes"" that change gameplay a lot!Each class has several hulls, each with different configurations which you can customize with parts. There must be hundreds of parts, half of which I haven't even unlocked.But basically, there are active and passive abilities, each with a power ""number"". Each slot on the ship has a type and capacity, and you'll need to play with it to find a good combination of pieces for each slot.You can have a melee focused ship that grabs enemies, or one that uses flails that follow you around and do massive damage; you can be a rogue, staying invisible until you shoot ships with a very powerful laser; you can be a pyromaniac, trying to set ships on fire to overheat them; you can be an AOE focused ship, with large attacks and gravity shifting abilities... I could go on, but you get the idea. And even each of these types can have drastically different abilities, since you can fine-tune everything!The game also has quite a lot of game modes, including online (which, unfortunately, is deserted) and arcade. Using the game's mechanics, it recreates several classic arcade games like Breakout and Asteroids, for example. On the online side, you have a MOBA-like mode, as well as Horde modes, either wave based or zombie-based, where the game overwhelms you with mindless enemies... It's really fun!It also has a 20+ hours campaign, that has some interesting aspects! For example, the tutorial lasts 3hours, or more. But it's a meaningful part of the game! It's not the game simply holding your hand -- it's your character learning about the universe with you. Meeting ""veteran"" characters, and getting some lessons with them, while experiencing significant parts of the story. It's great! And I've found it a very nice way of teaching the player as much as you can, while integrating it into the overall purpose of the game.This long tutorial is also necessary, as the game can be quite overwhelming. I played this back in 2013/2014 for around 7 hours. I've done little more than the tutorial, in that time (it was much faster the this time around). Yet, when the tutorial ended, the game seemed to throw me into the wolves -- the ship customization. That's what I think it under-tutorialized, as it was overwhelming to the point of me putting the game aside for a year or two.That said, this time I tried a little harder and actually experimented with various ships, not minding a few lost missions - and it's brilliant!Any time you get stuck on a mission, try changing things around. Try a different type of ship, perhaps one more suited to the mission. Nowadays, it seems I'm too used to games being very clear and to the point, never having to experiment and try things for myself. This one is different, and it was quite daunting. But it's certainly worth it!The game also has you try different premade ships during the campaign, in some special missions. It helps, at least to give you an idea of what each type is capable of, this giving you a starting point.The game has dozens, if not hundreds, of missions. Each of those can be completed in just a couple of minutes, most of the time, never stretching over 10minutes. However, there are locations with chains of missions, if you will, to keep things significant.The cool part if that each missions has several bonus objectives, acting as challenges. Some are time-based, carnage-based, etc. It gives you a lot of room for replayability and challenge that isn't simply tied to ""how much HP/damage to enemies do"", which is always great! The only bonus challenge I didn't like was the one, present in several levels, about ""Complete the level without using a Sage ability""... Your character is a Sage. Some type of special dude in the universe and whatnot. As a Sage, you have one of various special abilities, like Time Warp. These are special in the sense that they're mostly unique, different from your enemies and ship parts. They make the game more interesting. And yet, the game often asks you not to use it... With me trying to do some bonus objectives, I got in the habit of never using it, even outside missions with such an objective. It's discouraging players from using a significant part of the game and I don't understand why anyone would want to do that. But anyway, it's not major, especially being optional! It's just a form of (dis)couragement that should be used to guide the player into exploring the mechanics, not the other way around, in my view.There's quite more to say about the game, but that's the problem, haha!The music is pretty good, and the visuals even better! Despite being very simple looking, the game makes good use of a few modern effects that certainly makes it stand-out, for me! Every object casts soft shadows from the large stars in the background, and the backgrounds are composed of several layers, each of them animated, yet not distracting. It's great!Honestly, I was overwhelmed with the game, the first time I played it. But if you can keep going after that initial wall, it has incredible depth, and definitely changes things around in an otherwise stale genre!I'd place it up there with SPAZ, regarding some of the best, recent top-down space shooters with a focus on customization.Definitely get it, especially when it's on sale!

												One of the best top-down space shooters I have ever played.While lighter on resource management, this game trumps others of its genre in ship, loadout and mission variety.Gameplay is solid. Very rarely have I felt unjustly punished by the game, and usually a quick trip to 'the other side' (as pretty much every module your enemies use is also available to you) helped coming up with a counter. Most weapons are quite visually distinct, which really helps.Ships are divided into archetypes (basically classes), which primarily influence how many loadout slots you get for each equipment category and thus how are you going to go about engaging enemies. If 'pure' archetypes don't fill your need, hybrid archetypes are available; they won't excel in a particular field as any of the 'pure' ones, but those few loadout slots might just be the thing that makes your silly/crazy build work.Graphics are pretty good. You can tell devs tried to squeeze everything they could from the engine.Story is interesting and at times humorous. Some missions are definitely weirder than others (in a good way!). Campaign is of decent length.Some people might be turned off by a somewhat lengthy tutorial/prologue, before you actually get access to most of the ship customization, but I feel like it's very much worth it, as it also let's you try out all the archetypes, which gives you some idea of what playstyle might appeal to you.And honestly? For that price, it's a steal.			"

What I had thought to be a mediocre game turned out to be simple yet very fun! It is a bit slow in the start, but a few hours out in the game when you get to customize and kit out your own ships, the game improves vastly.Buying this game is a no-brainer if you like top-down action-RPG shooters. Get it, you won't regret it.			"

												I've pre-ordered the game shortly after the game's Kickstarter, though I hadn't actually got to play it fully until it got to Steam despite being sent alpha and beta versions. Developer kindly sent me a Steam key for the game though, just as promised. So here I am.There is something strangely... basic about this game, yet at the same time unique and entertaining. I've heard some remarks about controls being hard to grasp, but I play on keyboard&mouse and got acclimated to controlling my ship quite well.The story is also good without trying to be something over the top. It is funny, but not ridiculous. Graphics and just overall gameplay is the same. It is what it should be. A magnificent spectacle of space shooter. I can't recommend this game enough. I'm glad to have been able to observe Ring Runner come to life. In a few years, this game could be called a classic to never be forgotten.			"

												Game was really good, actually; as long as you know what you're getting into...  Lot of people complained about the controls, which is what made me a little wary before purchasing.  This is a top-down, 2d space shooter that follows space physics regarding inertia and flight in a vacuum so it might feel a little weird at first but you get used to it.  Better ships obviously feel better, maneuverability-wise, later in the game.Story's decent.  Maybe above average for originality in some points.  Some interesting scientific foundations that I'd be curious to know whether they have any basis in current theory.Graphics are good, flight and combat are both satisfying and pretty action-packed.  Overall the game was really fun, and pretty long for what it was.  If you like space combat games, or top-down scroller aerial combat (which this is strongly reminiscent of), check this out.			"

												Ring Runner ReviewI bought the game on sale for $8, which works out to be pennies an hour worth of game play.  It’s hard to tell how many hours I have put into the game because the last Steam client update wiped my hours played, but before the wipe it said about 118, and since then I have put on 54 according to the current count.  I spent about 8-10 hours perfecting three ship builds, which involved mostly sitting in the menus with a calculator doing math, add in another few hours reading mission info, setting up random ships and looking at equipment.  I figure actual playtime through the main campaign took about 40-50 hours; more then what was listed in the product description.  This is probably because on several missions it would tell me things like quickly leave the battlefield or I needed to lose the fight so it can show me what happens when I die;  instead I decided to stick around and fight for long periods.  Couple this with flying around exploring environments [when possible] and sitting back listening to an amazing sound track.  Figure 30-50 hours for the main campaign which will also vary based on your difficulty setting.The game was an impulse buy, one that was triggered by watching the trailer and hearing the amazing music tracks, watching the trippy explosions, and all out chaos of the ship battles.  I am not a fan of top down arcade style space shooters and prefer 4x stuff like the X Series or overly complicated, hard to learn and brutally unforgiving games like Eve Online.  With that said, Ring Runner had far more depth then any arcade style shooter I have tried. For a game made by a small handful of people, I was shocked at its production value.  You will have a hard time telling it’s made by a small team of people.  It’s too bad the main stream [un]professional donkie-hole full time game reviewers seem to ignore indie games, because Ring Runner has not gotten the publicity it deserves.  I can only assume because they are a small team that does not have the capital needed to bribe the broken, deceiving, lying, incompetent main stream game review websites that only exist to sell ads and ruin gaming by coddling to big corporations that are increasingly taking a crap on a plate and charging you for the “privilege” of having it shoved down your throat.  I can assure you that spending $10 on this game, like it or hate it, will not leave you with the taste of feces in your mouth that comes from spending $60 a game on the typical horse $hit you are probably used to by now coming out of corporate America.  It’s worth buying Ring Runner just on principle IMO, but as a bonus you are getting an amazing game which should lead to many hours of fun game play.The best way to describe the game is to think of it as a fantasy RPG with your typical fighter, Mage, Rogue, etc class system but with the ships you fly determining which “class” you are playing.  Just like in your typical RPG there are different item slots that hold different equipment which do different things.  Pretty standard for an RPG, not so standard for a space shooter.  The combination took me [pleasantly] by surprise when I finally figured out the game mechanics.  The dev is active on Steam and responds quickly to requests, questions, and concerns.  You can tell the game is a labor of love and a lot of time has been put into getting things right.  I have only had a small handful of black screen crashes, though they did require a forced PC reboot, overall the game is very stable, in fact looking at a lot of big title releases I would say it’s far more stable than Battlefield 4, X Rebirth, Rome 2, etc.  It’s hard to believe considering those other games have millions in production costs and far more people working on fixing problems.  The following are some negatives though I do not expect these to get fixed because IMO I have already gotten far more then I paid for and I know the dev is working on another project.  The game is already “complete” so the following is just for reference when making choices on future games.  There are some minor annoyances like AI ships picking up already scarce “plex” [money] in scenarios like death match, which will probably anger some people when trying to farm.  I noticed several AI ships flying around not shooting; rather just intentionally heading to the plex drops and picking them up before I could get over and do it myself.  This does not happen in missions, but when you are at endgame and trying to play with different builds which all cost a lot of plex, it makes things very obnoxious.  I understand AI characters picking up power-ups and would expect nothing less, but plex should not be something they can take as the AI has no need for in game money.  Post Game expect grinding for plex; a lot of grinding.  If you did the math from the first paragraph of this review you are probably wondering where the other 50+ hours went; the answer is playing [mostly] one mission over and over grinding for plex so I could buy different ships/equipment to try different builds.  The dev stated they were working on a minor fix, but it’s not hard to figure out why there are not a lot of Steam workshop builds online as its pointless to post a ship unless its set up properly which takes a lot of in game money.My last gripe is that 95% of the equipment can only be used once per build.  This makes sense with some heavy hitting guns but not other very weak ones.  It makes it very hard to create a balanced build with anything other than just a few setups.  My guess is this is also why there are very few builds up on Steam’s workshop.  Sure, you can pile 8+ different crappy weapons into a ship, each with a different cool down timer, different amounts of heat or energy, each doing a different effect, but at the end of the day you will be doing nothing but button mashing for less DPS, more heat, and more energy use then you would get out of one decent weapon.  Oh, and good luck timing those 8+ weapons to actually hit your target as the game is very fast paced with flying feeling like you are on a rubber band shooting through space.  I am not saying it’s not fun to play with different builds, but at the end of the day you will probably just stick to one or two main weapons to max out DPS with the least Heat/Energy consumption.  A lot of things may look great on paper with a calculator, but in practice you can easily break the game with a few well thought-out builds.Lastly, equipment descriptions are all over the place with some giving damage per second and others giving damage per shot, and still yet others give no description of damage leaving it to trial and error.I know I ended this on a slightly sour note, but the game is anything but sour.  It took me over a hundred hours to break things, which was a lot of fun in the process.  That works out to less than ten cents an hour which is the cheapest you will probably ever pay for a game.  I don’t expect the devs to do anything else with it as again it’s a complete game.  If you are on the fence about buying it I highly recommend spending the $10 and having some fun.  The story is not bad [better than most high budget games today] and the dialog will defiantly will put a smile on your face.  By the end I was sitting on the edge of my seat swearing at the “bad guys” and loving how I was just wrecking them for the crap they pulled earlier.  It’s not often anymore a game will pull that emotion out of you with its story.  Again, fun times.Thank you VERY much for an amazing game and I will be keeping an eye out on Kickstarter for your next release. Score: 8/10			"

												This is a great game for the price. A great application of a top-down space shooter with endless customization and other options. It also features 6 other gamemodes and has multiplayer. The graphics are not the best, but fit the type of game it is. The performance is excellent and the developers are quick to respond if you have a problem.I would definitely recommend this game to any of my friends.			"

												I dont know how much you may like isometric newtonian physics space shooters ... but this game is nice. There's space hulls you can buy that requires two pilots to run and there's a MOBA multiplayer mode too. There's a lot of polish on the game modes and ship customization as well. Bad news is the servers are either East coast or International "

												A great game that offers a lot of depth and room for improving your personal skill level and tactical insight.The storyline fits nicely with the game mechanics and introduces you nicely to the game, however the real merit of this game is in it's multiplayer modes. Consider the single player campaign a nice introduction with an enjoyable storyline.The only current downside I can see right now is that it can be difficult to find a multiplayer match. "

												A great game!  It's kept simple, the story line is very good, has well placed humor in it as well.The best part is the customization.  Many different classes of ships, with cross-breed class ships as well.  Plus the plethora of mods you can put on them to make unique builds.  I love finding those over-powered or hilarious combos and testing them out in Zombie Apocalypse mode.Well worth the money, and lots of replay value from various campaign difficulties and bonuses, unlocking hulls and mods, and testing out those builds.  Peanut butter cups included!			"

												If the phrase ""...in space"" makes everything better to you, and you appreciate clever dialogue, and tutorials so well done and subtle you don't realize what they are until it's over and the sheer depth of the game stares you in the face; get this game.  It's $10.  That's a few days of food you can go without.  Go buy now.			"

												Hard to give this a yes or a no.  It appeals to me but the controls weren't so great and the tutorial really felt constraining.  I had a lot more fun with the Drox Operative.  It was a bit fun so I'll give it a thumbs up.			"

												So many ships to choose from, so many weapons, engines, shields, etc. That awesome storyline which also acts as a walkthrough for each ship class, what else else do you need?!!In my opinion, this game is worth much more than its price, it's a very well made RPG, if you're having doubts, you should just buy it coz you're not gonna regret playing this game.Man, I wish that last level lasted forever...

												Wow, this is a really underrated little gem.  I grabbed it as part of a Humble Bundle, put it in my library, and promptly forgot about it.  I loaded it up not too long ago and was pleasantly surprised!  Ring Runners is a top-down 2D space shooter with deep ship customization elements and a lengthy story mode.   I was fondly reminded of the good 'ol days of 2D space shooters like Escape Velocity.  Between missions, you can use credits to purchase new hulls and new gear to fit in them.   There are various different hull types, each focused on maximizing some attribute or another.  Some hull types are fast and lightly armored, others are behemoths loaded for bear.  The campaign is a lot of fun, and it takes a long time to fully play out.  It's silly at times, and serious at other times.  My only complaint is that it takes a while to open up all the options and let you really fully enjoy all the possibilities.  My only other complaint is that ship customization can be a bit of a chore.  There's a lot of clicking on stuff to figure out what it does, and even with descriptions sometimes it's hard to figure out whether or not something would actually be useful to you.  The game's systems are complex enough that there's a lot of non-obvious mechanics at work.			"

												Ring Runner is a top down shooter ARPG with a rather large campaign considering the genre it's in. My older brother recommended this game to me and gifted it to me on steam and it was a blast to play. I was interested in the story and I enjoyed the sense of humor in the dialogue. The combat system this game has responsive, tight controls with (Depends on the class and how you fit your engines)  bit of a twist thanks to the newtonian physics. Every key is fully rebindable in the options and you can manually bind your ships abilities in the ship creator you unlock later to fit any control scheme you desire. My only real complaint is that the game takes a bit to hook you in, as the best part is the all of the ways you can fit your ships to just about any play style and control scheme you can think of. At least try to make it to the Dvorak Galaxy! More indepth review here: http://extra-credits.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=7167&p=137145 "

												A great game I got, especially it was on sale for this week.Singleplayer campaigns were a blast! Though I wished I took the time to actually chill and explore around, it still managed to deliver an interesting storyline. Combinations of ships are endless. There could be a dedicated ship for its simplicity to use, or a hybrid if you're the type that can't seem to make up your mind, or rather you want the benefits of either type. Either you build your own ship or buy a template, it's up to you, but the possibilities of building a unique ship is nearly endless.The content it delivers on multiplayer is limited however. It seems like no players can't be found and would always launch a game with only you playing. I also have yet to try to local co-op match.I recommend this game for players who want a decent storyline long enough to keep them preoccupied during their free time, or for those who are just plain bored.I know you are bored. You wouldn't have read the game reviews unless you were interested in the game. :) "

												What an excellent and unique game! I can honestly say I've never played a game quite like it before, and even though it takes a couple hours to fully familiarize youself with the gameplay, once you do it's nothing but exciting fast-paced action. The storyline is also very satisfying, with fun characters and impressive world-building. Add to this the tremendous amount of costumization and content available and you get a game that is worth every penny. Definitely recommended!			"

												I would recommend this at the advertised price 9.99 but you might wait for a sale.I love the concept of it being an RPG, but it's not.  The tutorial is kind of rpgish but very structured--few choices in customization and ship choice so they can introduce you to all the ships.The problem is that afterwards all the level 1-3 ships, most hulls and a bunch of level 5 prebuilts are all open.At that point it's not an RPG, it's a combat/shooter with a decent choice of ships and weapons.I restarted hoping for an ""RPG"" mode where you start with a single, tiny fighter hull and work your way up but no--you skip the tutoral and they just open up everything including 1-2 of each highest level prebuilt hull.I realize many people don't like RPGs and so they just want to get to the highest level with every option open and fight, but if that's the case kindly don't advertise it as an RPG.  For isntance, Diablo 3 is this way--levels 1-70 are paretty much a tutorial and then you start playing after level 70.  Stop calling these things RPGs, they are fighting games with extended tutorials--that's it.Still, not at all bad for the price.  Even has a MOBA map that's pretty cool.If an RPG mode was introduced to (optionally) replace the extended tutorial with slower advancement and less initially unlocked I'd be really happy with this game.
