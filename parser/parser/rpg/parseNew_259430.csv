												Picked this game up on a whim for $2.49 because I figured, ""Why the hell not?""  Let me say, I'm so glad I did!  The combat is user-controlled and terrific, the equipment altering interface is very simplified yet is made complex by the innumerable additions and expansions found throughout the game.  And if you like loot, well, this game has a TON of it.  From someone who played Eve Online and found it to be rather droll and nigh impossible to be an effective addition to the world, Zigfrak ""scratched that itch"" for me in regards to free-roam space exploration games.  I also really appreciate the physics of the game and how they are implemented to provide an engaging starfighter experience.  Definitely recommend!			"

												Imagine the look and feel of Freespace combined with the mechanics of an ARPG and you will have a good idea of what Zigfrak is all about. Years ago I was the 18th person to purchase the game and now that he has continued to pour a ton of work into the game and its now made it to Steam I hope that many of you purchase this absolutely spectacular game.  I look forward to watching Zigfrak evolve more and more and its just going to get better.  Congratulations Alex!The game has extensive options so you can tweak the game to the point where its the best for your PC and there is only one thing that I wish would be added into the game, and that would be the ability to make the ingame text size larger.  Its not crippling microfonts like some games but I wish I could bump it up a little.  That being said do not let that discourage you from buying the game--the font is clear and not too tiny.  This is a game that you will be able to get MANY hours of enjoyment out of and if you don't purchase it you will be missing out on a great experience.  The controls are wonderful and the interface is intuitive. "

												Amazing totally underrated game. I have completely no experience of playing such galaxy-freeonroam games, but I had a lot of fun.It includes brilliant OST, pretty good graphics and all that fits in less ~500 MB game size. It takes some time to learn how to play it, but it definitely worth it.Must have.			"

												Released in late 2012 and just recently on steam comes Zigfrak. With a name seemingly produced by a name generator, Zigfrak is an action RPG set in space. The game drives the player through a single player story but the player is free to roam off the beaten trail to explore or engage in side-quests. Zigfrak was a game that I wanted to like as I love space exploration action RPGs ever since Escape Velocity. Unfortunately, in my opinion suffers from some key flaws. Playing this game it's fairly obvious that this game borrows alot from MMOs such as World of Warcraft, which is not something I would necessarily want in a single player game. A lot of quests are tedious and uninteresting ""go here and click on this"" tasks. There's a lot of loot in the game to collect, which might generate some interest and motivation to play, but this mechanic feel a bit cheap. A lot of sidequests are collection questions that just involve collecting a specified amount of items and cashing them in for a reward.Since this game is inspiried by MMOs I don't think it really respects the player's time; for example at one point the player must battle a spacestation with a friendly fleet. It took me nearly 45 minutes to deplete half of it's health. Aside from this, the action is fairly average. The weapons don't have a particularly notable feel and I didn't get a sense that I was actually hitting a target. Instead I just held down the attack buttons until I saw the enemy's health bar lower.  To it's merit, when a 'hacking minigame' came up I was given the option to fight enemies instead. I aprpeciated the option to focus on the game's core gameplay instead of getting pulled off into some minigame. In terms of production value, the graphics aren't anything to write home about and many things in the game simply don't have any sort of sound effect. There is no USB controller support for this game.If you like MMOs and space exploration RPGs and you want a single player game you might find this game fun, otherwise there are better options for you.  I played this game a little over 3 hours, giving it a chance to get me interested but it failed to really inspire me to play.Score: 5/10			"

												GET THIS GAME! Unless you're Maverick. Zigfrak is a pretty awesome game. It's amazingly beautiful, but for reasons I can't begin to fathom it has never overheated my laptop. Not even when I accidentally left it running paused and the temperature in my room was in the mid-80s during the afternoon hours (my room sadly faces west). Even games that are 3D only as window dressing tend to overheat my laptop (RTS games, XCOM Enemy Unknown, and many others). This game I could probably leave running for a week.This game is what I'd term a casual space RPG. What I mean by ""casual"" is that it tends to avoid the micromanagement most RPGs entail. Unlike most casual RPGs it IS pretty and there's a very wide variety of enemies and components you can add to your ship. No really, there's TONS of things you can upgrade your guns, shields, armor, missile launchers, whatever to. Going along with the casual game theme, they're often whimsically named. Inconvenient realism tends to get glossed over in this game. You're only allowed to carry so many of each object. Once you hit that amount, it automatically converts those items into the type of credits you spend at a trade station (there's at least three forms of currency, which makes game economics all kinds of interesting).The author loves puns and references. There's an alien weapon type called ""strange."" So one of the weapons has an effect called ""When you're strange."" And given that certain of the higher-end weapon names are prepended with ""tweaked"" they put in one weapon called ""Tweaked Morrison."" The references vary between movies/sci-fi (obviously) but you can also find weapon types like Larry, Curly and Moe. I want to hope that Moe is the most effective, with Larry being the less-interesting mid-range model.It's also a fairly sandboxy game. While there's an arcing storyline, you can freely ignore it if you want, and just go about fighting, looting, crafting or whatever.The author is AMAZINGLY responsive and non-dickish (even when folks are being critical). Seems willing to take a look at your saved games in order to track down bugs (or just fix your stuck game for you). It's almost unbelievable how responsive he is given that it's a $5 game. I almost feel guilty mentioning that it's fairly easy to come by coupons for this game...The only reason I mention my friend Maverick up top, it's not his type of game. While I wouldn't call the game overly easy, it rather shamelessly lists as one of its selling points that it's a click, kill and loot game. It even describes the things you kill as ""loot pinatas."" I like the honesty there, it lets you know that this wasn't done by accident or poor design. This game is for people who like getting loot. It's a nice palate-cleanser for my Shadowclan friends *snickers*. Money is easy enough to come by (and if you putter away a few hours in certain areas you'll be absurdly comfortable). You could also avoid doing as I did to get a ""more balanced"" experience. It shouldn't be TOO hard to get the things you'd want to buy (in the unlikely event they don't drop as loot somewhere).			"

												A game this cheap has no business being this good.Despite an interface which can be a little tricky to learn, this is a solid game experience. Destroyed ships litter space with tons of loot: ammo, guns, vendor trash, crafting components, etc. So much so that it can be a bit overwhelming in the early going. I've only scratched the surface of this one, but it seems surprisingly deep.			"

Which is good for addicits because something is always coming and everything adapts/levels with you so you'll need to adapt and change. Every battle is different.I've a guide

												This game is amazing. It has big boss battles, hilarious mission lines that you have to finish because you want to know what happens next. It has a huge loot table and if you don't get loot you want you can craft your own and then add looted modifiers to it. I was put off by the graphics at first but the insane, techno light show of the first boss changed my mind. This game can be beautifully trippy at times combined with a nice, pumping soundtrack. And it's $5? Unbelieveable.			"

												A ridiculously fun game to play, the gameplay videos don't do it justice. The scripted sequences, while not the most graphically stunning, are still amazing in their own right. The whole game has this subtle humor strewn about it which makes you motivated to actually do the quests layed out for you (there's a part that the dev intended to be serious, but really you can't take it that way). While the quests aren't really reactive and I don't recall any moral choices, some of the encounters you'll run into will make you question your character's morality.  On the downside of the game, some features are really obnoxious (like the ship tractor beams, dear god), and the really slow docking (although automated). Some missions require you to dock with a ship before you obliterate the enclosed crew's only wall between them and the emptiness of space, but the cinematic nature of it makes it quite difficult while 12 of your friendlies are shooting at it.That aside, this is an very good game and it is underpriced in my opinion. Buy it now if you haven't already.Overall score: 94/100 "

												Ok About this game.  Its very Space Opera Like.  The story line starts normal and has alot of mysterious things in it.  However everything is presented to you in the old school way of massive text.  Controls for this game are mouse and keyboard.  I suppose you could use xpadder and map some keys to a controller....but you would still have to click on things.  Learning curve for this game isnt too bad but it does take getting used to.  Like not realizing you have to click on things on the right side of the screen and not from your inventory.  They do a fairly good job during the tutorial showing you things.  And you can skip it as it tells you in the text.  Again massive text to read.  Game play wise its ok and takes a bit to get used to.  Other people compare this game to descent or freespace...um no....not even close to that sort of control  This one is more simple and reminds me of games of a few years ago.  In a way this is a very nostalgic game in that way.  Music is not too bad....graphics are not the greatest but they are not too bad either.  You can tell they are hand drawn or hand painted on some.  So let me review...Good things about this game.Its a Hardcore Space operaLots of things to getNot saddled with stupd things like runing out of fuel or oxygen at least that i have seen.Simple control schemeAlot of extras including a plethora of weapons and ammo typesTypical mystery space stylelots of things to findNow for the bad things    Walls of text..yes alot of text...to find out what to do you must read.some things not clearly explained so it might take a bit to find what you have to do.control scheme is mouse and keyboard onlyVery nostaligic feel which might not be what gamers want.Not all loot goes to your ship no matter how close you are...thus you have to click on alot of stuff.Can only tractor in 1 thing at a time at least what i have found so far.Its a very long game not going to be completed in 4 or 5 hours so maybe not for the person who wants something mindlessSo in the end I recommned this game to people who like Hard Core Space Opera with mysterious alens and are not afraid to read alot of interesting things.  I dont recommond this game for people with a short attention span or people who dont like to read or people who simply want to blast everything and be spoon fed.  I hate to say this but the negative reviews I think are from some people who wanted some ""just blast things and get spoon fed"" type game with ""no effort required"" type game.I will say though....you will know if you like the game in the first few hours or not.

												((((( I HAVE PLAYED THIS GAME IN OFFLINE MODE FOR ATLEAST 40 HOURS )))))I've played a bunch of the space rpg gerne. This game has limitless potential.Sure, it's single player, but having beaten the game some time ago, I still find myself playing it 3+ hours a day.Pro's ( Simple List )- Lot's of customization, (endless loot, with random prefix's and altercations/modifications)- Loads of replayability.- As the description says, High paced combat, very addicting gameplay aswell!- 10+ Player Ships, (that I currently know about.) Considering I have just found playable ship another twenty minutes ago suggests that just because you beat this game, doesnt mean you 'Beat' this game.)P.S. I know that 'only 10ish' ships may not seem like a lot as a first impression, but in reality, considering what your ship is in this game, they are more comparable to playing styles, depending on which ship and how many slots for weapons/ drones / engines etc the ship has.-After you beat this game, there is still a plethora of content to be unlocked. ( Through Randomly generated events or Missions, aswell as weapons from special vendors/stations that can only be obtained from 'Research', or Boatloads of credits.)Free Roam!!! Not just 'free roam', I Literally mean you can travel to hundreds of different locations,  which all have very decent size btw.CONS- No Multiplayer ( possible future devolupment I Hope! )- Uhh... Aside from not having Multiplayer, there literally is basically nothing i can list as a significant 'Con'.For 5$, this game is toooooootttallly worth investing in. I would honestly pay a moderate price of 15$ considering how much fun i've had in this game thus far.To those of you whom take my review seriously, Enjoy the Game!! ( And let me know if theres any extra content you find, as in secret ships or weapons!)			"

												As a fan of more traditional ARPG's (Torchlight + Titan Quest), I was alittle sceptical of the odd mix of space combat, but I figured for the price I'd give it a shot. I'm so glad I did.The game is simple, yet has a certain complexity with the controls feeling great and surpisingly reponsive and fluid. Combat feels great, loot flies absolutely everywhere, and it being open world space gives you alot of freedom you don't always tend to see in most ARPG's. The story from what I have played so far is pretty good (and humorous at times), there are also dynamic missions and random events which is nice (although fairly limited).The loot is interesting, plentiful and the crafting is also surprisingly well done and thought out.I only have a few minor gripes. Certain things aren't explained clearly enough (like how ammo works as an item), and why armour and shields are lost permanently once destroyed (especially higher quality ones).Other then that, well recommened for ARPG fans, and for those that want to shoot stuff and love loot to explode.I also made a First Impressions video about the game awhile back, if you would like to know more you can find it here :-

If its taking you 45 minutes to defeat an enemy, get better guns. Loot is everywhere! Stop trying to do a mission that you obviously aren't ready for. The open nature of this game allows you to prepare for more difficult missions. This game is really fun and I've enjoyed every moment of it!			"

												I've played the demo quite a bit before I was able to buy it on steam, so the hour count is a bit misleading at the moment.This is a very fun space game, kinda reminds me of X3 mixed with ARPG mechanics, though the X3 part of that half is watered down. I'd say more like Diablo II or Torchlight II mixed with Galaxy of Fire or pretty much any Action game taking place in space.There's lots of loot to collect and obtain, and since I'm the type who loves collecting loads of loot, regardless of quality, and taking time to compare them to each other and what I have equipped to see whats best to equip and whats best to store, this is really my kind of game.I agree with most the other comments. The controls and interface do take some getting used to, but I wouldn't call it difficult at all. Interface, controls, loot sorting/equipping are pretty customizable in the options to. While there are graphic options, they're not as diverse as I'd like. It's pretty much windowed/fullscreen, Resolution, and overall quality. The 'Overall Quality' part I mentioned is a slider that moves between 3 different presets of Anti-Aliasing and the like. It's not a huge problem, the vast majority of players will be able to fit quite comfortably in one of those 3 presets, but it would still be nice to be able to control those options ourselves.Still, I'd recommend this game easily. Diablo/Torchlight in space, tons of loot, fairly big map to explore, etc. I'll update this review as time goes on, but I recommend this.			"

												""A shoot-and-loot action RPG in space!""Well, honestly, it is not as much RPG as I hoped. And certainly, that's not an Elite. You fly in space, that's for sure. And there could be a lot of shooting and yeah, looting. Problem is, the thing you're flying on, it's like smoothing-iron. A drag.And space... well, that's a thing where you can easily be lost. In a bad way.Being a fan of indie projects, I admire Zigfrak. I see very much effort a single man put in this game. And being a fan of open-worlds and RPG... I'm scared and depressed. Space. Such a lonely place. I will tell my kids, that being an astronaut is not such a good idea. I'd better encourage them to become firefighters.Pros:Space - check, many of loot - check, crafting - check, shooting - check. In short, that game does everything it promises. And the game is still updating! The developer is adding new stuff now and then, fixing some issues. Cool man!Contra:Controls are not perfect, but acceptable. But the fact you need to control that Thing which is called spaceship here... makes me wish to return to Darkstar. And to bring flowers on the memorial of Yuri Gagarin.Also, I repeat, space is just a vacuum, there is no life in there. And even with all abilities and challenges that game gives you... You'll probably be bored and distracted very soon.Well, maybe not. I'm just not a space sim guy, so I'm pretty biased here.Give it a shot, if you do not afraid of a slow flight in the emptyness between stars. My score is 6.7/10.			"

												This is definitly a underestimated game. The beginning seemed a bit extreme because the impact of flashes and effects tends to cause additional panic on the battlefield. But as soon as the player realizes, that it is not as critical as it seem,s it begins to make real fun. This game lives of the extremes! The missions are quite interesting and different (more than go to and rescue protect or kill XYZ). Many interesting kinds of tasks ensure that even the last missions and the engame (after campaign) are still interesting and entertaining. The graphics are unique and due its overload of effects really beautiful. The huge amount of different weapons hava LOTS of different graphics, behaviors and effects!!!!! I suggest to grind during the campaign some time outside of the missions to get the level a bit up and shorten in this way the time to the alien stuff (the way seems a bit long, but you need to get the requirement just once and not for every item and stronger weapons in later game shorten the way even more). For people, who like to loot, this game is definitly worth buying.			"

												    I'm going to keep this short. I've only sunk about 2 hours into Zigfrak, but I've already had more than enough fun with it to justify it's extremely low 5 dollar price tag. The core gameplay is the real star here; it's an A-RPG that wears its title proudly: enemies explode in crazy piles of loot which are easy enough to collect (thankfully flying by loot auto collects it), the writing is fast paced and witty, and the world is huge. It's got all the point-and-click-y fun that comes from diablo as well as slightly strategic gameplay that one might expect from a space shooter. All of which is to say, it's a great twitch gaming experience.       The game itself features a crafting system, mining resources, cloaking, hacking mini-games (which are entirely optional, the game will let you just shoot stuff instead if you prefer), and some slight inventory micro-management (you have a shield for your shield, called an overshield which can take a real beating, but once it goes down, you probably want to equip another one). If you like space games where you get to take control of a ship and use it to blow up other ships while also exploring an expansive universe, check out Zigfrak.			"

												Zigfrak is the freshman effort of a single independent developer looking to combine the space sim with the action RPG.  While the game starts out a bit confusing (there is a lot of information to process in a short time span) it quickly becomes clear that you are a stand-out pilot from the Freerunners faction that is traversing the Nautilus galaxy looking for stuff to blow up and loot.Mixing a fair share of humor and unique sci-fi, Zigfrak offers a stellar RPG experience and plenty of options in the loot department.  While the game lacks the level of ship options that you'd find in other games of the genre, it more than makes up for it in sheer content.If I had to rate this game among other space-sims, though - Zigfrak does fall a bit short.  As I said, it lacks customization options, and you never really get the feeling like you're a part of anything.  You are a lone pilot, breaking metal loot pinatas. Contributing to the health of the galaxy is not your concern, neither is its politics (save for who to shoot). Still, for those interested in breaking into the genre for the first time or folks who are fans of ARPGs, you couldn't beat Zigfrak at this price point or any other.			"

												Quite honestly the most fun I've had blowing things up in a while.I picked Zigfrak up for 2.49$ in one of the sales, and have enjoyed every minute with it.The combat is fast paced and frantic, the jokes and references are hilarious, and the loot, good lord, the loot is everywhere. If you're craving gratuitous space violence, and like over the top everything,I highly recommend Zigfrak. 5/5			"

												Zigfrak is precisely the game I need. I have neither the time, nor the inclination for the deepest of space sims, and Zigfrak happily fills that need without requiring the epic commitment of time and/or skills. It's simple without being dull, and streamlined without being featureless. Feels like it contains the depth of a space shooter, but wrapped in a package that can be consumed in 15 minute increments.			"

												I love this game, sure its not perfect but iv had a lot of fun with it.Ill start with the bad bits,Graphics are a bit on the poor side, textures are low quality, there are a few artifacts with the effect.The missions are all pretty basic, go here, get this, click that, kill them all. though some are dressed up pretty well (the one where you have to kill a station while it dances to dub step was fun :) )Combat can be a bit too simple at times, especial when taking down larger ships, they mostly just sit there while you circle strife around them till they die or simply sit behind their engines in a blind spot.There are issues with the UI, from the mouse pointer getting stuck in the center of the screen so you cant click anything to text being cut off due to the small size of the windows, that cant be resized or moved. also the font is VERY small in places making it difficult to read.The crafting system is too simple, and boils down to getting a few patterns, do a bit of mining and a couple clicks to queue up the crafting, which oddly crafts stuff while the game is paused, even then its also very quick at crafting.Limited number of pilot able ships, and there isn't much to differentiate them, there are a couple good ones which you can get in order (actually you can craft them), each outright better than the last, you can ignore the others as there isn't much need to get them. it would be nice to have more ships and have more to make them stand out so there would be a need to go back and swap out at different situations.Limited variation in stations and factions, just seems they are generic no mater where you are with few unique items/stations.Odd object cleanup/disappearing/appearing mechanic, stations pop into existence slowly after entering the sector, i assume as it loads them, asteroids pop up float for a bit then disappear, you can scan a few asteroids then turn around and there all gone, loot disappears on a timer so you have to be quick to collect it all. overall it gives it an insubstantial dream like feel.Now the good stuff, Its FUN, the combat apart from the capital ship issues is hectic and engaging, flying in a dog fight with 20 other enemy ships, missiles, drones and energy weapons firing in all directions, capital ships firing off missile barrages into the fray,   its is insane and sometimes looks very pretty :).The sheer amount of weapons, ammunition types and add ons is huge, like many loot based games you will spend a lot of time min maxing your load out to fit your situation (which thankfully you can do while paused). some of the weapon and ammo combinations can launch a MASSIVE barrage at the enemy decimating entire squadrons of ships.The story while linear is quirky, funny and entertaining, completely tong in cheek in places (dub step space station anyone?) but leads you around the galaxy and shows off what this game can do.Lots of unique and  quirky events they add some spice to the missions and story and some are REALLY off the wall (flying though the gut of an intergalactic monster) .The music is fantastic, in places the action seems to be linked to the beat too with insane effects pulsing, you will find it hard to to bob along with it while blowing the crap out of the enemy.The size of the galaxy is impressive, id guess hundreds of planets to visit (iv only seen a small portion at this point).The sectors are just plain pretty, its obvious a lot of work has been put into it, sectors can look drastically different with unique character and provides a great background to the destruction.The developer, he/she seems like a good bloke/girl, they respond ont he forums quickly and are always helpful in fixing people issues, i myself had an issue, posted on the forum and got a helpful response the same day that sorted me out.Overall, if you are looking for some quick and dirt fun, love loot, love blowing stuff up and can overlook the flaws this game is an excellent choice. and at the current price, what are you waiting for?!

												7 out of 10Note: Not for people prone to seizures.  Lots of screen flashing! A very nice space shooter.  The focus of the game is on fighting and looting.  There are mining and exploration elements in the game however these are under developed. I had quite good time playing this game.  I often pondered that all that all that is missing is some voice acting (and cut scenes). The good: 1. Many epic space battles.  So much so that it becomes common and boring after a while. 2. Great variety of equipment. The bad: 3. It can be hard to spot your currently targeted enemy especially if the action becomes hectic or the enemy is far away.  A brighter color rectangle would have helped. 4. All the areas are basically the same.  The backgrounds are flat and does not change no matter how much you move. 5. Some background space stuff would have been nice.  This would have assisted in the creating the feeling of a lifelike environment. It almost feels like your space ship stands still while everything else moves. The ugly: 6. Expect to die sometimes.  Especially around the middle of the game when the enemies become tougher and you do not have the top of line equipment yet. But you respawn.  It sort of spoils it a bit. 7. The epic space battles can be overwhelming to the point of total confusion of what is going on.			"

												My initial thought on this game is Finally.  Finally I found a outer space flying game that has a ton of potential.  The graphics are sick, the missions and story line are even interesting.    It has a RPG feel to it, so your weapon system is less linear and more crafting, salvage and various skill trees.  Gameplay is just right, not too simple and not to complicated, a common ailment of this genre.  That is not to say it is overly easy either.   Im excitted to see what more this game has to offer.  I got it with a coupon for one dollar and it was definetly a dollar well spent, @ least a 10dollar + worth.  Get it!  8.5/10. :bomb:			"

												Let me preface this review by saying i play a lot of games..... like a lot. 26 years old and i've been playing since SNES days. My collection of games played is very ecclectic and extensive, however the amount of games i've actually completed is very small. Usually games don't seem to keep my attention all the way through wether it be boring story, overused mechanics, too much simplicity, or just not adding anything new. I really can count on 2 hands (and maybe some toes) how many games i've actually beat.And This Is One Of Them!Zigfrak was such a huge diamond of a find for me. The gameplay was so fun! I loved flying through space blowing the crap out of things, the sounds of nuclear fallout and blackholes inundating my ears. The loot filled Piñatas that are your enemies burst with colorful gear to make yourself o so stronger with. And the insanely charismatic and humorous storyline kept me entertained till the very end (seriously this game could be its own meme generator). This was easily one of my favorite games of all times, and hell, its super cheap too! Not only that but the Dev is coming out with a free expansion thats going to add soooooooooo much to the game. Do yourselves a favor guys and get this game, support the awesome Dev, play something you're going to love! I know i did!			"

												I'm suprised at the price. This is a diamond in the rough.It breaks the mold of the space sim genre and crosses over into unfamiliar terrority (action/space sim/diablo like looting) ... that is a very interesting concept. It is refeshing to see someone step out of the familiar space sim comfort zone and try something new.What really caught my eye was the environmental eye candy and the attack effects. E.M.P attack scrambling your view or a explosion causing your screen to blur. I get a sense of panic as I try to orient myself on the attacker or figure out what is going on.  It really helps me as a negative reinforcement to NOT GET HIT and raise my skill level. Please note that these cool effects can be disabled.Definately worth picking up and I would say this stands well above a bunch of the titles that are marked ""Indie"". Well worth $20 ... but it is only $5. What a steal. "

												I came into this not expecting much.  I was more than a little surpised.  This game is incredible. It managed to interest me in a way that no sci fi game since Star Control 2 has.  At first I was afraid the game was going to be a twitch shooter, which do to slowed reflexes from age, I wouldn't be able to manage, but it turned out that it is more about how you have equipped your ship for each battle.  It's also great that you can continue to play the game after the completion of the campaign.The negatives:It could have had more choices.  I wish that you could make decisions that would have effects on the campaign.It wasn't always clear what the information on the weapons were.  How does force affect the amount of damage caused by the different weapons.I wish there were mysteries in the game beyond the campaign, something to reward jumping into unknown random systems. It's not really a complaint about this game, but it would be incredible if it had civilizations on the planets and you could actually get close to the worlds.  Maybe allow you to dock with bases on the planets.Positives:Everything.The gameplay is smooth and easy to learn.The graphics are great and the different color combos really make your ships stand out.The wide open exploration is fun.The different entities you meet are actually interesting.The story is great.This game is a must play for anyone who loved SC3 or anyone waiting for No Man's Sky.  It fulfills that space exploration itch that not too many games successfully manage.			"

												Amazing game for the price. The combat isn't anything special, but it's fun and satisfying in a Diablo-type way. Where the game really shines, in my opinion, is the writing. It's hilarious. Reminds me a bit of Douglas Adams, with more pop culture references. I also like it because it's a sort of no-pressure game. You can start it up, do a 10 minute mission, save and quit. Most AAA games, I feel like I have to devote hours at a time to, which is something many of us can't afford to do anymore. Easily worth the $5 price of admission. I'm just sad I didn't hear about this game sooner!			"

												Open universe ""sandbox"", essentially a FPS where your toon is a spaceship instead of a person. Movement is 3 dimensional, with enough predictable arcade-like physics to make the combat easy to navigate. If you are comfortable with a first person shooter Using WASD and a mouse then you should be able to find a mouse/keyboard mapping that makes this work well. This is a small budget release, so storylines are written, not voiced (but surprisingly in depth). Solar systems follow a few fairly predictable models. Quests are pretty much optional, the story molds like a jigsaw puzzle depending on what you do when, and there are some puzzlers, but the real beauty of this title is that it is designed so that you can enter into the fray feeling overpowered, grabbing loot and more loot, and if you aren't careful suddenly you are toast. The AI sneaks up on you really fast. Lots of hours of gameplay here, and a real 3D space shooter that handles flight well.  "

												I can't recommend Zigrafk in its current form, but it's a great idea. Why not bring the loot-filled fun of ""Torchlight"" or ""Borderlands"" to the space-sim genre? The notion is brilliant, because it can, in theory, speed up the ""go on missions, upgrade your ride"" loop to a lightning pace. (And it can also create some very zany ship loadouts.)The problem here is not the lack of a novel idea. No, the problem is the execution of the flying and fighting. Zigfrak delivers a disappointing experience on those fronts, with strange ship handling and uninspired ""dogfight"" mechanics. There's also the problem of all the HUD displays that pop onto the screen, covering a huge amount of visual real-estate with what amounts to database entries. These elements, as drivers of the wider loot mechanic, have to be a lot of fun...but they aren't yet. They feel like they didn't get very much attention.What I would love to see Entheogen do would be to mod a game that already has fun combat and flight mechanics. A specialized loot installation, modification, and crafting mechanic could be built for stations and planets, making that part of the game a focused experience all on its own.The problem with a negative critique is that you're essentially shooting down somebody's hard work. I especially hate to do that with something like this, which tries to go in a bold direction. The developers have come up with an underlying concept that I really want to play - it's just that the actual playing isn't engaging.			"

												This game looks really nice and it has a lot of nice ideas going in, however the problem is the overall execution.The game itself feels incomplete and overly ambitious. You are thrown into a ship with a series of somewhat confusing menus and objectives. While I don't particularly like games that hold your hand, this one seems to throw a ton of concepts and items at you at once and leaves you to figure it all out.With more polish and a streamlining of concepts, this could be an amazing game, there is a ton of potential here. Unfortunately, for right now the problems and not fully fleshed out concepts keep me from reccomending this.Controller support seems to be missing, and this game could benefit from a dual stick setup. Also, many sound effects seem to be missing or balanced poorly.			"

												Zigfrak is basically Elite/Privateer had a baby with DND/Rogue-like partner. Yes, you read that right. This is NOT your typical space game, but is in fact, an RPG set in space. And that's a good thing. The fact that the game uses WASD to move should tell you this is NOT a turn-and-burn game like Elite/ Privateer / X-series.  Yes, you play this game like a FPS: WASD to strafe. And you can map weapons groups, or just hit ""fire wall"" (and hold it down if you like) to fire every weapon as soon as they cycle. And the bigger your ship, the more weapon slots it would have. (Reaper-class, the largest ship you can build, has 2P+4S+2D slots)  You have four categories of weapons: primary, secondary, tertiary, and drone. Primary are the rapid-hitting weapons, like energy bolts, or ballistic cannons. Secondary are slower firing like missiles, railguns, and even ""flak"". Tertiary so far are beam weapons. And drones are basically attack robots that act like little fighters that fight alongside you (almost like pets!) Just like RPG, you will find bazillion different variations of the same weapon, as well as various secondary effects. A electro weapon can have kinetic secondary effect. In fact, you can find ""modifiers"" that can be added to some plain weapons to add the secondary effect. (i.e. gems/charms for your weapons!)   And weapons have cycle speed (attack speed!), damage, multi-strike (fires more than one shot per attack), and even reliability (heavy use and damage can destroy the item!)   You have shield, then armor or overshield. Each of which can be generic, or specialized against a particular type of damage (kinetic, thermal, nuclear, electro, strange, etc.) You jump from sector to sector, and you can do the boring stuff like mine asteroids and whatnot for minerals and energy and such in most places. However, most of the time you'll be fighting. Some enemies can be invading your sector, or you can go to an unfriendly sector. Expect to see a lot of enemies, as there's plenty of humans to fight against, AND there are more than one faction of aliens you will have to contend with. Fighting is a lot of side-strafing, but also with touch of afterburner to get away from the enemies and retrograde. What's fun about the game is a ton of loot... you'll nab ammo, weapons, other components, as well as powerups that will restore shield, restore health, triples your base damage, and so on. When you blow up a ship, stuff scatter like confetti. If you don't like the mess, disable the other ship, then dock with it to loot it. So far, this sounds simple, but then you get into templates (blueprints) for building your components, weapons, even ships, and the game makes a different turn, as you realize you can't buy the ship you want... You'll have to build them. Remember to do all the early missions so you don't miss out a lot of upgrades and such. You'll need the various upgrades. There are a lot of little features, like trading some special loot for ""chests"" that can contain surprise goodies, needing some special research to buy super-exotic weapons, finding the stations where such weapons or tempaltes are sold, and so on is a part of the fun. And the galaxy is quite big. Graphics are surprisingly good, but then drawing ""space"" and making it look good isn't that difficult During combat the screen can get extremely busy with all your weapons firing with different effects (and other specials like shield-breakers, decoys, holodecoys, and so on all firing off). Add to the flashes caused by weapon hits, and this may be almost epilepsy inducing. Beware. Sound isn't anything remarkable. There are no voiced dialogs, just text boxes. Music is sort techno-futuro beat electronica. All in all, this is a fun little game that encourages a lot of replay just for exploration, even if you manage to max out the ship. There will be a lot fo little things you have missed, and there's always something happening in the game. Definitely give it a try if you like the genre even a little. Price is right for such a fun little gem.			"

												I'm a huge space-sim fan and thought ""Shoot and loot? Yeah... why not, it's just five bucks."". Boy, was I in for a surprise.Under all those flashy explosions and shooting and looting is a beautiful, funny RPG heart. I fought with semi-gods, struggled for survival inside the stomach of an ancient beast, played a game of Blackjack with a Mafia boss, discovered beautiful stellar phenomena, lost a good friend, was drugged and brainwashed, and much more.The missions are incredibly varied, very well written and fun to play. Not a single one was boring or annoying.Reducing this game to shooting and looting is a vast understatement. Play it, I loved every minute of it.			"

So now the focus is on combat, and goddamit this game is fun. It has some odd controls but once your passed that the game becomes a blast.			"

												Game is pretty enjoyable, was a solid pickup during the $2.49 sale. I think the devs are trying to do a bit too much with the item system(weapons->expendable ammo->ammo modifiers kind of annoying) and the auto-equip is frustrating(although I saw a dev post stating they are looking at making it an option, that would be awesome). That said, the gameplay is quite good. Movement is easy even with mouse and keyboard, the interface is clean and easy to navigate once you learn some hotkeys, and the visuals are nice.I have my complaints, and the game is probably not for everyone, but I'd recommend it for people who are a fan of old space sim type games like Privateer, and obviously loot hunt games, as it seems to blend them pretty well.

The soundtrack is catchy and works very well with the gameplay, and will most likely get stuck in your head for days on end. I'd definatly recommend this game.A guy who loves to fly.			"

												First review I have done of a game here on steam is this one. This game is perfect for any sci-fi fan, there are campy references to classic sci-fi films everywhere in this game. The gameplay is great and intense, the graphics look amazing and the loot is always fun to get. The learning curve is a little steap however, with many aspects of the game requiring investigation in order to figure out what they do. This game is easily worth 20 dollars and I got it for 5 what a steal! The one thing I wish they had is more end game content, I have vistited only about a quarter of the galaxy and I really wish there was another 20 hours of high level content. Way to go you guys made an amazing product here, and I highly recomend this game to any lover of flight sims, and sci-fi.			"

May contain certain spoilers regarding plot, items and events!!Overall this was a amazing game. The start can get tedious with learning the control scheme, however the game turns out pretty easy, it isnt grind-orientated and you can get ahead of enemies just by doing quests and resource gathering(It isnt tedious or annoying at all!)The game takes a turn into a more humouristic play whereas the Judex marks ships as ""Terrorists"" ""Corrupt Commander"" and the dialouge behind it creates a pretty funny experiance. Even after the main story, there is still alot of stuff to do such as the easter egg bosses after you beat the game and the lung fu arena.The game also has a extremly large sortment of weapons, engines, shields, extra shields, armor, and amazing payloads/cargo such as nuclear devices, Disco stations that work as banks, a donkey that plays ""Ride of the Valkyres"", Potato and Marshmellow weapons. I still remember when I cashed in my credits for the weapons that gave the game away(In a good way, it shows that it turns humouristic). The sortment of weapons consist of the regular plasma cannons, hard hitting railgun sluggers, fast shooting ballistic weapons, Missiles/Rockets, Laser diode weapons, Flaks that spew out sharp objects and much more in nuclear and alien weaponry!This was a great game overall, a great timewaster if your internet decides to cut out, or you if you have some spare time on your hands. The only bad thing was the weapons not dealing a hit effect on enemy ships, but who cares about such detail(Some do), The rest of the game is darn well done for its time and author.			"

												Starts a bit slow, but eventually picks up the pace quite a bit. The crazy volumes of lootable items mean inventory management is also a big feature of the game, but finding the best possible weapons and ammunition (yes, you have to manage bullet types as well) is pretty rewarding when you see enemies that may have been difficult before get shredded.The jokes cover an enormous range of topics, and vary from simple puns (you use a ""Crap Trap"", ala Borderlands, to grab crap from space), to more satirical things, which span entire questlines.

												The go to game for a relaxing space blast'em'up with a nice sprinkling of humour.

Don't panic. It is possible (and a whole load of fun) to get the hang of it and track your enemies with the pew pew pew.Top marks to the staff on the project who I reckon are the best customer service / support team I've dealt with for years.May the duct tape be with you.

												Zigfrak is basically Elite/Privateer had a baby with DND/Rogue-like partner. Yes, you read that right. This is NOT your typical space game, but is in fact, an RPG set in space. And that's a good thing. The fact that the game uses WASD to move should tell you this is NOT a turn-and-burn game like Elite/ Privateer / X-series.  Yes, you play this game like a FPS: WASD to strafe. And you can map weapons groups, or just hit ""fire wall"" (and hold it down if you like) to fire every weapon as soon as they cycle. And the bigger your ship, the more weapon slots it would have. (Reaper-class, the largest ship you can build, has 2P+4S+2D slots)  You have four categories of weapons: primary, secondary, tertiary, and drone. Primary are the rapid-hitting weapons, like energy bolts, or ballistic cannons. Secondary are slower firing like missiles, railguns, and even ""flak"". Tertiary so far are beam weapons. And drones are basically attack robots that act like little fighters that fight alongside you (almost like pets!) Just like RPG, you will find bazillion different variations of the same weapon, as well as various secondary effects. A electro weapon can have kinetic secondary effect. In fact, you can find ""modifiers"" that can be added to some plain weapons to add the secondary effect. (i.e. gems/charms for your weapons!)

												I'd give it a 6.5.  The items and their descriptions can be hilarious.  For instance, you start out with a ""dusty cannon"" and it's got ""a colony of bunnies live inside.""  I also like the ability to thrust and slide in three dimensional space.That said, I do have a problem with the interface.For instance, the inventory menu.  I suppose the easiest way to explain it is that It's really compact.  All you have to distinguish the different weapon icons is the border.  Brown/Green/Blue/Purple...etc.  Unlike other rpg games where different items may have different icons, here you find that all cannons look the same.  All pulse cannons look the same.  Etc.  I have to mouse over each item just to see what it is.  That wouldn't be so bad...except the game sorts everything for you.  I'm a messy guy, so I subscribe to the school of controlled chaos.  I'm the type who would store the useful items on one side of the inventory and the junk go on the other.  That way, when I land, I know what leaves and what stays.Here...The junk and the good stuff are lumped together by category, and it also looks like by level.  Quite frankly, I'm not going to remember what order the cannons are in...so once I hit level 7 and then open up the inventory to equip that cannon that had a level 7 requirement, I end up having to mouse over each item just to find it.Did I mention that the inventory menu was compact?  Guess what? The item details end up being in a window like 1/5th the required size.  And that's important why?  It means you have to scroll.  And why do you have to scroll?  Because to equip an item, you have to go to the equip options that come AFTER the description.  Right clicking like in other games doesn't work, it just brought up the descriptions. That reminds me...it looks like there's a fuel and ammo system in this game.  After some poking around, it occurred to me that I can pull that information up by accessing my inventory and then checking the engine and each individual weapon.  I think that's how you do it.  Couldn't there have been some sort of HUD for this?I'll recommend it, because it truly does seem like an interesting game.  But this user interface could've been streamlined.			"

The difficulty does ramp up the further along in the story you get.  It's nice because it gets challenging and there are ton of items/features to discover. PROS:  Fun Hilarious and engaging writing Tons of new tech to discover and equip. Hours upon hours of classic spaceship battles. CONS:  I still haven't finished it lol.   I'd enjoy an elaborate crafting system No ability to start your own faction  No ability to capture territories for yourself.  No hiring wingmen to fly with you.			"

												After putting 10 hours into this, enough to complete the campaign i can easily recommend this game. It may not be for some as i would say this game does have seizure inducing visuals especially since there is quite a bit of massive battles. The controls are a bit convoluted but my recommendation is that you put your frequent use items in slots 1-5 as the game progresses. There is also MANY references to other media in the game, as such examples as a powerup called you become death, which is a reference to the detonation of the first atom bomb, A whole mission dedicated to The♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and there are others in the game. This is underrated at best.Some of my gripes is the encounter system. even if your in friendly territory you may become a target to a few different enemies that jump in and may have massive fleets in which you Will have to jump out if your not of a sufficient level and have weapons that are weak. The crafting system is a little lack lustre and resource gathering is a pain as well. But thats the most i can say. Otherwise this game has flaws that may turn people off which is a given but if you like loot, space and have enough patience to learn the controls you may enjoy it or you may not. But i do recommend trying it. 5dollars is more than enough for this.			"

												Okay here's what I think so far.  I may change this later but I really don't feel like playing it any more for now.  So far it feels like I'm being led by the nose from starbase to starbase.  I feel like I'm trying to get through these ""tutorial"" type missions to get to the real game, but now I'm afraid this is all there is.Combat seems a bit unskillful at the moment.  Press TAB, press T, press Space until enemy dies.  Repeat.  Perhaps theres more skill later on but this is how it's playing out so far.Loot - yup there's a ton of it.  You blow up an enemy ship and a bunch of stuff flys out and gets sucked up into your ship.  Wait, what did I just loot?  Spend next couple of minutes reading the combat log in the bottom left to try and work out what I picked up.  Okay I think there might be some useful stuff in there.  I go into inventory to check it out.  There's no popup comparrison to what I have already equipped so it's hard to tell.  Doesn't matter too much anyway because the game seems to automatically equip the best stuff for you.  Guess that's one less thing I have to worry about.I find an item that looks pretty decent and wonder why it didn't get equipped.  Hrmm it says I need to be level 5... what level am I?  This piece of information seems rather difficult to find.  There doesn't seem to be an XP bar either now that I think about it.That's about it for my thoughts so far.  I'll endeavor to update this if I change my mind.  Maybe I'm not playing it right.  Maybe I'm just supposed to go forth and explore, rather than following the missions laid before me.  It just seems over automated.  There seems to be not really much choice or decision making involved.Bottom line.  I'd rather play Drox Operative than this game... but I'll give it another shot some time and post my updated thoughts.			"

With the way loot drops, the variety of loot, and the humor in the references (albeit sans speech), it is a lot like Borderlands 2 in space.  If you know me - or even if you don't - you will know that I love Borderlands 2 (as evidenced by my 1000+ hours gameplay), and I love this game almost as much in just a few short hours. :DDoes it have problems? Yes, but generally they are minor and do not effect gameplay.  Such as accidentally moving a toolbar icon and not knowing where it is stored (there is no ability to lock the toolbar), the huge but unsortable inventory, or flying through another ship.  These minor problems are overshadowed by: - the sheer joy of blowing enemies to bits using one of the hundreds of weapons, - watching enemies explode - as the game description says - like loot piñatas,- a not uninteresting story mode,- very cool original music- an RPG element including crafting and gathering (skill trees are coming in a future update),- a large and easy to use DB on the Zigfrak.com site that lists ALL THE THINGS,- and an awesome price (IT'S ONLY $5 USD!).Any major problems are often quickly and directly addressed by the developers (as evidenced on their forums), and the forums - both here and on the Zigfrak site - are full of people that are knowledgeable, and information that is helpful.  My only hope is that one day we get co-op. ;)In short, if you like flight sims or space, and FPS, then this is going to be a fun investment for you.  It will provide several hours of fun and explosions, and that is just in the FREE DEMO. ;)			"

												Ok here it is. It is a good space fighting sim with witty and funny quests. It is sort of light hearted but loads of fun. Best space fighting sim I have played in many years. Privateer and Freelancer were my two favorite, so I have played them all. Loot is overwhelming at times, and when you get 30 fighters shooting at you it is hard to see your target there is so much flak and explosions, which is awesome imo. If you like space fighting, loot, and light hearted comedy, this is easily worth 5 times what the Dev is aking for it. Graphics are outstanding.			"

Their inventor system also needed some work. It was chaotic at best.For those of us looking for the next ""Action RPG"" experience, you can try this out, but I would say unless your a hardcore space fan, look elsewhere.			"

												Tedious and boring.  Essentially, you just rotate around in 3D space and click on things.  There are no people or characters in the game.  The ""story"" is told through endless text boxes.  After more than two hours of playing, I'm still in the tutorial phase -- an endless stream of tiny missions.  If you like to explore or learn on your own, then avoid this game; there's nothing here but a vast menu of ""Do this..."".The UI is overly complex and not at all intuitive.  Yeah, I guess you can customize your weapons and customize your ship in a million different ways, but what's the point?  You're just one ship fighting against a bunch of dumb AI ships.  There is no depth to this game, just an endless curve of bigger guns.			"

												I'm sorry, but I can't recommend this game. The interface is cumbersome, there are a lot of text to read that are weakly presented, there are many unfathomable icons which are difficult to recognize nor remember, and a very rigid & simplistic combat are the hurdles you'll encounter if you wish to play this game. All of these made it a chore for me to play Zigfrak. It conveyed a very unpolished and incomplete game which felt like it is still an ""early"" Early Access. Even if I got this at a low sale price, I just had to refund it.  If there was a controller/gamepad support, combat might feel a lot better. But then again without a complete overhaul of the interface and then some, it might not do so much good. I suggest the developer to also look at improving small details like how your ship responds when the forward thrusters are on. Similar games makes the ship react (and maybe even shake) and advance a little when the keypad is pressed to move forward. This, I think, adds so much to the feel of navigating a ship.Even though I said a lot of negatives, I can see potential. Maybe part 2 can be released in the future with a much better executed interface design and overall feel. Try lessening generic and unrecognizable elements in the game. Generating fun for the players should be given the top priority.			"

												A strange mix of Darkstar and Borderlands. Darkstar type gameplay with rpg style loot management. And there is A-L-O-T of loot. Crafting/building adds to the depth. I find myself micro-managing my equipment and crafting almost as much as I do questing/battling. Light-hearted humor and movie /game references are abound. As a game with such a modest price, it is surprising the amount of depth and the end result is a masterpiece easily worth much more.			"

												This Review was edited on March 14 2015 with my final thoughts on it.There was a time when I had a sudden craving for a space combat simulation game, something to replace my playing of Starfox 64 on an emulator and so when I got a discount coupon for Zigfrak, I figured ""Hey, why the hell not, let's try this out"".The product I got in the end however was nothing short of a mess in my opinion. The screen throws so much information at you before you can even handle the basics and so needless to say, the tutorial (if there even is one, I can't quite remember), was obviously lacking.I expected some pretty enjoyable space action combat but was somehow met instead with a 'stare at your target and press space for 20 minutes' type of combat. Your ship didn't handle like a ship would, it was simply a 3D model in the shape of a ship moving in a 3D environment. Nothing you did in the game felt immersive. The massive and convoluted user interface that took up 40% of your entire screen space also didn't help.Multiple times have I thought about going back into this game and giving it a second chance but those attempts have always ended up with the game making me feel bored and uninterested.Who knows, maybe this game just isn't for me but as for my final judgment, I simply think I won't be going back for this game anymore as I have better ways to spend my time and find entertainment.

												I cant in good conscious recommend this game... yet. It is incredibly well thought out in so many ways but it has some major flaws. Most of all, without going into too much depth, it lacks space combat. (there's your TL;DNR)Yes it says up front it isnt a space sim however the game seems to only include flying about space to get somewhat close (like 50-80k meters) to interact with items a-la MMO style gather quests. The combat seems to require minimal strafing and flying as far as any tactical thought goes.Its about as visually siezure inducing as Beat Hazard and unlike a lot of discussions on the game I find the sound fx one of the strong suits. The muted sounds and faded ringing of a nearby explosion with the music seamlessly playing in the background is really great. Also the fact you and other ships get ""pinched"" by nuclear warheads EMP blasts going off as larger battlecruisers duke it out is a nice touch.Overall I think there is a need to dogfight in small fighters and slug it out in capital ships so being presented with those things and then not really getting it throws you off. (to the games defense Im not sure how big of a ship you might eventually pilot, so if this game shines flying capital ships later on please forgive my quick judgement). But for now it wont satisfy anyones urge to feel like they out-piloted the enemy. No, it mostly makes you feel like your loot and spacebar holding skills are just slightly above par. I feel like a 'do a barrel roll' comment is needed, I will amend as the game develops and possibly fine tunes its combat.			"

												Just play Freelancer instead, or DarkStarOne if you have a better machine, that's my advice. Actually play both of those (right now), they are the best space sims ever, and this CLEARLY is not. Admittedly, my playtime on Zigfrak is limited so far, but I can tell this game is not going to pick up much. The saving grace for me is that I paid pennies for it in a sale, so er, that's okay. I may try and play this more at somepoint in the future, kind of ""have"" to try beat every game I start, it's my policy. So assuming I do, and it surprises me, then I'll adjust my review.			"

Combining that with the creator's refusal to fix obvious bugs like the radar-like tracking bars ignoring ship rotation and becoming useless, there is no way this can be recommended.It doesn't help that the dev ignores bugs reported as far back as december 2012.

												Decent Indie game, not really playable until it gets joystick support and a ui that doesn't look like its from windows 3.1.At this point even Skyrim's ui would be better, there are far too many confusing little windows with no clear direction as to what to do or how to do it.Good concept, needs polish.

												Looked like it might have some potential, but once I get to combat the game becomes unplayable.  The controls aren't great in the first place, but they are positively useless at 3 frames per second.  I've tried turning down all the graphics settings.  I've tried overriding all the graphics settings.  Nothing seems to help.  2.9 GHz Quad-Core AMD A8 and a brand new 1 GB Radeon HD 7850 ought to have no problem with this.			"

												A game with impossible contols to master.The gameplay is horrible with very little story.It has put me off the game compleatly and in my opinon isn't worth a penney.No thought has been put into how the player will play this and uses a lot of weird keys that wouyldn't normally be used with no way to change them. It takes a long time to kill anything and gives you the option to fly off anywhere only to be killed by higher level AI's over and over again. It had a lot of potencial but I would never buy the game after playing 5 minutes of it.			"

												You fly a ship. Sort of. Well, you pilot something, you point it vaguely at something which is trying to kill you, there's a lot of flashy graphical effects, things explode. There's loot everywhere. You scramble to collect the loot, it comes in a rainbow of colours and flavours, there's guns, oh dear god there's so many guns. You're spoilt for choice, it's practically like Borderlands all over again.Zigfrak is a space.. game... sortof.. you fly around and shoot things, lots of things, and collect a lot of loot of various sorts to pimp out your ship with, as you level up and gain experience, the things you can pimp out your ship with get ever more ridiculous until eventually you're shooting drones armed with minature nuclear warheads (which will cause all kinds of hilarious screen glitches, no, do not adjust your monitor, the designer MEANT FOR THAT TO HAPPEN!), and your shield can withstand you being in close proximity to said explosions, mostly...Over the course of the game you'll obtain a dubstep satellite that explodes with the power of nuclear wubs, an inflatable mini party station that you can dock with and resupply at (which will also pump out some most excellent dance music), you will be exposed to cerulean blue and become addicted to this gorgeous colour. You will hack satellites via minigames. You will encounter Bear Grylls in a worm, and have to construct shoelace traps. You may end up eating shoes as a result. You will work for the space equivalent of the mafia, and for the pirates, and for the police, you will do all these things and yet somehow you'll still be managing to stick to some kind of overarching story which takes place on a very interwoven backdrop.This game is the product of the mind of one man, and if this game says anything about his mind, it's that this guy probably should be in a room with nice soft padded walls, and his keyboard, monitor, and PC should be securely fastened to solid surfaces, and also coated with drool and chew resistant materials. Insanity does not even come close, yet for all the insanity, there's genius here, a rare diamond of genius that you really ought to try out for yourself.Beware the refreshing drinks though, I'm pretty sure he laced them with something dangerous. Ditto for the cookies, do not eat the cookies.			"

												The gameplay is a little wonky, like the click and drag thing gets old quick when there's enemies whizzing around your ship and you've just run out of mousepad. The tutorial doesn't explain enough (e.g. the combat training doesn't show you where your hull indicator is!) and the UI is absolutely atrocious... everything is in drop down menus, and it's hard to tell where that thing you looted from that derilct ship went.Overall, a promising proof of concept, but it falls way, WAY short of Rebel Galaxy.

												I really can not understand why anyone would think this was a great game... it would make a decent tablet game... but for a PC or console it is bad.The UI is a disaster. For example you keep targeting ships even when they are dead and the only way to know they are dead is a new word is added listing them as disabled. This makes for a real problem when you have 5 or 6 dead ships and several live ones. You keep trying to target the ones killing you but the more you kill the worse the odds of targeting a live ship.What the hell? Heck you will even target friendly ships over live enemy ships.The game is cheap as heck, but you get what you pay for.			"

												I had a big problem with this game the first time I played. If your screen is black except for the text, restart the game.Anyways, the combat is a bit flimsy and shallow, and the ship models are somewhat blocky, but the space visuals are really good. Sound design is eh, missions are usually picking up cargo, it takes ages to get anywhere, but somehow the game is still fun. Combat is pretty fast and fluid once you get down the controls. For $5 I'd say it's worth it, but a little polish wouldn't hurt.			"

												A fast-paced, easy to learn, space shooter. Kinda like Freespace meets Borderlands. Plenty of humor to keep you interested, and lots of pretty colors and techno to set the mood. Its not that in debth, but for a casual space dog fight game, its not too bad. You can't beat the price-tag for this kind of entertainment. Looking forward to this dev's future endevours.			"

												Zigfrak is a great space shooter for a generous price! Its fast peaced and fun to play. Its not a sumulation and the handling and mechanics just feel right. You have big space stations, fat battleships and massive dog fights as well. I really like the graphics and visuals. They come together with the lovely controls and serve a immersive experience in space fights. Due to fitting backgrounds and well distributed props the battlefield scenes never feel overcrowded. And the execution of the debris helps really to ""feel"" the speed and drift you have without cluttering your view (like in ""Salvation Prophecy"" where they are way to big)Downsides:------------(1) A real background story told by cutscenes and voice acting would have been an huge enrichment. (2) The GUI isn't much intuitive and is torn apart to the corners. Some more time into GUI Design would have been great. But its ok though, when you once get used to it.(3) Multiplayer Coop Missions would have been great!(4) The Universe Map ... is just ugly!
