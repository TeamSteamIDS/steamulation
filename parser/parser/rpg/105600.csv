												You can be a werewolf riding a unicorn while shooting rainbows from a gun. You can build teleporters, find a hair dresser in a spider cavern, and get a sword that shoots cats. You can take on the lord of the moon using a yoyo, summon a sharknado minion that shoots sharks at your enemies, and find sky temples where air wyverns spawn. You can buy a music box from a wizard and go record the music that you like the most so you can have it playing in your base whenever you want, and then you can go build a castle made entirely out of white marble. It would seem the only thing Minecraft has over this game is 1 dimension. Trust me, once you get used to it and start learning about the game, Terraria is simply one of the most satisfying sandbox experiences out there. It may sound rude, but compared to this, Minecraft just has no imagination.			"

IntroductionI am Tigerfrost. I would like to apologize for anything that is miss-spelled or any grammar issues. Thank you.If you'd like to skip straight to Pro's & Con's, please move to the bottom of the page. Thank you.UPDATED EDIT 7/6/2015: With the release of Update 1.3, Terraria has become three hundred times better. Update 1.3 adds in loads of new items, monsters, bosses, events, and more. The new bosses are a really big challenge and very cleverly done. The addition of achievements is addicting to any player who loves to hunt achievements, like myself. Including the new gamemode known as ""Expert Mode"" which is basically like turning the difficulty up to 'brutal'. Lots of other changes as well, like new textures and sounds, and the new addition of world stats to keep track of how many of each type of monster you kill (Which now rewards you with banners). How I Found Out About ""Terraria""I found out about Terraria the same way I use to always find games, YouTube. I randomly came across a video called ""Terraria"". I took a look, and instantly fell in love with what I saw, and knew I had to have the game for myself. It looked like a great combination of gerne' that I love to bits. Being a Minecraft fan since the beggining of Alpha, I knew I MUST have it.Unfair First ImpressionsWhen ever you ask someone about Terraria, read a review, or watch a video, 95% of the time you hear ""Minecraft clone"" or ""2D Minecraft"". Which is incorrect on so many levels. If you have heard this many times, and are thinking twice about actually playing Terraria, please read on as it is nothing like Minecraft. Review Of Terraria Terraria is a very unique game for what it does. There have been games like it in the past, but the amount of content and play ability is beyond anything I've ever seen before. Terraria is a sandbox, RPG, action, etc. 2D game. It does it's thing very well. I haven't noticed any UI bugs, or ones that I have, are fixed almost instantly after the patch is released. The gameplay it provides is not only smooth, it is addicting and fun. The combat system in the game is perfect for me, and a lot of others. There are so many enemy types in this game that are not copy paste, each one does their own thing and has their own weaknesses & strength's Example on the kind of enemies you could come across. Normal walking/running enemies, that have a soul objective to charge you until death. These may include enemies like the zombie or skeleton.As there are other enemies who will do the same thing, but in a different way (So not everything is copy/paste.). Like the slime enemy type, which come in many varieties, which will bounce towards you. Or the spider enemy type, which will walk on the ground, but can also climb on the walls to get to you quicker. Just to name a few.""Well, how do I defend myself against these enemies?""Good question. Let's get that.Items & FurnitureThis is where Terraria gets big. Even though the world's are limited, they provide so much that you could spend 800 hours of game time on a single small world and still have many things to do.In the world of Terraria, there are alternate versions of almost everything. What I mean by this is, each world you have will not be the same. For example, there is a 50/50 chance when loading a world to have the default version of something, or the alternate. Such as the music that plays, there are different tracks for the same biomes, just depends on what random one you got. Or for textures on things like, grass, and trees. Also things like ore, in a default world you would have Copper as your basic ore, but in an alternate world, you'd have Tin as your basic ore. What this does is really expands the play time someone can spend in Terraria. Allowing a single person to play the game over and over, and never have the same experience. Below the surface are loads of blocks, dirts, ores, and more. Ore like Copper, Tin, Lead, Iron, Silver, Platinum, Gold, Cobalt, etc. And blocks like normal dirt, clay, stone, mud, cobwebs, and so many more. You need these ores to make your weapons and armor. You can find treasure deep underground, that holds many valuable things. You can increase your maximum health by finding Life Crystals underground.The weapon range in this game is massive. You even have magic weapons, like spell books, and mana weapons. There are also bows, swords, pickaxes, axes, guns, lazers, cannons, familiars, and so much more.I won't get into to much detail here, but the amount of content in this game is massive, and it's still being updated. Sure, Terraria has been through some rough times with updates, but when it gets an update, the update is full of new things and changes. Pro's & Con's (Overall Rating)Overall, Terraria is a great game that you can spend hours of time in, and still be having fun in many years to come. It's a steal for the price of $9.99, and especially when there is a sale that lowers the game to $2.00 or less. This game is definitely a choice for sandbox gamers looking for an easy to slip into, addicting experience. Pro's:+Loads of content for hours of game time.+Great combat system.+Smooth gameplay, that's easy to slip into.+Provides a good challenge.+Fun and creative boss battles.+Amazing side events that you cannot resist.+Achievements are addicting to those achievement hunters.+Expert & Hardcore modes add hundreds more hours of gameplay and possibility.Con's:-No infinite world option. (Doesn't drop overall score - But can be annoying to some players)-No easy way to edit worlds before creation (Like choosing whether to have Crimson or Corruption)Overall Rating: Is about a 14.5/15 (Must Own!)Credits & DisclaimerThank you for taking the time to read my review, I hope this helped out with your decision on whether to make a purchase or not.Remember, this review is based off of opinion only. You may not think the same way as me towards something, but that's okay, because we are all human.			"

												To commemorate the beta of Steam Reviews, as well as passing 1,000 hours in Team Fortress 2, it only makes sense that I finally write a recommendation for a game that has been close to my heart since the day I was first introduced to it: Terraria.Terraria has proven to be a lot of fun to play, and has been one of my biggest video game time sinks in recent years because of it. Between lenient system requirements, a solid (albeit imbalanced, at times) combat system, a broad permittance for exploration and a wide selection of building decor, it's the type of game that strikes me as having something for everyone. Which is good, when you consider that it also has multiplayer. Even better when you get to the late game, which has a wide array of weapons, armors and tools to allow for a wide variety of specializations.Building and exploration are strong points in favor of the game, but the gameplay mechanics are something I'd like to single out for praise. For a 2D game, its combat system has a lot of spectacle, and perhaps that's part of why I find it so charming. Hurting enemies--even those who are vastly inferior to you--feels good. It's satisfying to hear the hit sound on the more squishy enemies, and watch them explode into fine little chunks when they die. Ground movement could be better, but certain late game items give you the ability to dash and fly, which really expand how you can explore and fight. And with a wide selection of weapons, every player is bound to find a roster of tools, spells and fish-related artillery that fits their playstyle.The game isn't without flaws, mind you. With the game's update history, the launch endgame now vastly differs from that of the current one. This has led to some balance and progression issues, the most glaring of which being how sluggish the early game feels. It worries me that the start of the game might dissuade some people from playing, when they might love what the late game has to offer. The game also has a bad habit of recycling mob AI with reskins, though this is averted by adjusting certain parameters and giving them unique abilities to hide the fact. Even though I have more to say about the shortcomings, there's just too much good in the game to stay mad about what effectively boils down to nitpicking.Plus, it has hats. Any game that has a selection of hats gets brownie points.Watch some trailers. Read some other reviews. If this looks like something you'd be interested in, then take it from me: give Terraria a chance. The game occasionally goes on sale for 75% off, so pick up a four pack for yourself and three friends. If I'm wrong, then I cost you a meal at Subway--not subliminal advertising--and I'm sorry. But if I'm right, then it'll be well worth the price. We're expected to pay $60 these days for a fulfilling gaming experience. This is one that'll run you $10, at most.			"

												Many people compare Terraria and Minecraft. And it's true, they are both voxel based mining games. However, Terraria tones down a lot of what Minecraft is in building and creativity, then makes up for it in the exciting combat and boss system. Don't get me wrong, you can still build interesting and exciting structures in Terraria, but the awe that some Minecraft creations can inspire is not found in Terraria. If you prefer emphasis on combat, boss battles, and equipment upgrades, but still want to be able to mine resources, create defenses, and terraform to your desire, Terraria is most certainly a good fit. There's a reason it's my most played game on Steam, and even as I write this, I have the game open on PSN to play with my friends.			"

												When I first saw my friend playing Terraria, I thought it was a 2d MineCraft. Now that I've logged over 150 hours into it, I see that Terraria is so much more than Minecraft.

Product received for free
												This review applies to Terraria 1.3.0.8 and earlier.The essence of Terraria is that it prioritizes fun! It's not a game where players must fear losing progress due to forgetting safety measures or manage breakable tools. The game knows how to bring out a sense of enjoyment and achievement. Grinding is an option, not a requirement or an excuse to drag out game time. Besides, there is much to discover and do in the game. Clocking in at 1,000+ hours, having all 88 achievements, and introducing multiple friends to the game should be indicative of that. With that being said, I'll list some pros/cons I've found memorable.Pros Customization: There is a staggering amount of customization available in-game. You not only can choose from several basic character designs but also have a plethora of armors, costumes, accessories, and pets for your character. You can also color/dye any of your equipment and get all sorts of flashy effects. Dyes aren't consumable, so you have few restrictions on perfecting your assemblage. Exploration: The Terraria world may be finite, but it is incredibly diverse. Each biome has its own personality and houses many unique elements. It takes a minimum of three worlds to discover everything, and that's only with absurd luck (see ""The Creation of the Guide"" painting). The game additionally has an impressive number of flavor. That rubble on the ground can be dug up, and a Worm might pop out from it. You can reignite the burnt-out Campfire in that small cavern. You didn't think that NPCs could fend for themselves during a Blood Moon or invasion, did you? Just when you think you've learned everything about the Terraria world, you discover something surprising. Creativity: Terraria is as much as about creating your world as it is exploring it. Blocks and furniture are not just for aesthetics, but they also introduce some neat mechanics. Players looking to engineer stuff will enjoy the contraptions possible by the wiring mechanic, and designers will love being able to paint the overworld with a wide spectrum of colors. Terraria features innovative design at its finest. Progression options: Like any good RPG, there's a great sense of progress made in a playthrough. You mine or slay enemies for the materials needed to upgrade equipment, and the world is bountiful enough that this progress never feels linear or constrained. Even the achievements flow nicely, never feeling too easy, cheap, or absurdly difficult.    You never need to rely crutch items to make progress. Rather, in my experience, my friends and I frequently had too many options and had to reluctantly store away some of our neat loot. There is always something to switch to if a playstyle becomes easy or repetitive. Balance: A game can become boring if there is a certain playstyle players fall into. Terraria manages to find the right balance so that all playstyles have a fair shot at completing the game. There is no bottleneck or singular Infinity+1 Sword needed for progress. Diversity: Terraria promotes itself as a game for any type of player, and that claim certainly has truth in it. The game has gameplay suited for battlers, explorers, and builders, and I can also tack on several options that appeal to other types of players. Collectors will balk at the quantity of items and achievements offered, and players can challenge themselves to make progress with nearly any conduct. Play with only melee/ranged/magic/summoning weapons? Sure. A yo-yo only run? That's popular! No crafting/mining? Certainly. Play the entire game upside-down? Of course--and that's bug-free! If that's not enough, you can fire up a world in Expert Mode for the extra challenge. There's something for everyone.    I've had a friend who would ask on his first playthrough 'Can I do ____ in the game?' and I could answer in the positive the majority of the time. Just for starters, you can teleport, build trap-filled dungeons, set up PVP minigames, and record the soundtrack. The game's breadth is incredible. Automation: Terraria would be daunting without any form of automation. You have thousands of items, hundreds of monsters, dozens of mechanics, and an expansive world to build on or dig through. The game offers much to ease the burden of management. Auto-select picks the right tool rather than requiring manual selection. The smart cursor allows for one-click digging. Quick-stacking is much more convenient than depositing items one-by-one, chest-by-chest. Farming is not only feasible but easy. Making measured builds is simplified with items like the Ruler. The game naturally provides the player ease-of-use tools so a playthrough can be focused on the fun stuff rather than on chores. Performance: Many games fall off a prospective player's wishlist due to system requirements. Terraria is a game that features a crazy amount of sprites, particle effects, physics, lighting, and entity interaction. Being a 2-D game only nets you that much speed before optimizations come into play *cough*Starbound*cough*. The game's requirements are reasonable and the gameplay is optimized such that it doesn't require a bulky system to run on. I was able to run it decently on a 2007 year-old desktop on Windows XP with low-end specifications. The performance of the game to medium- and some low-end systems makes it accessible to a broad demographic of players. On the other hand, if you have a high-end system, go ahead and fire up that Color lighting mode and enjoy Terraria in its full glory. Quality of life: Many games have little quirks that people have to accept to enjoy. Not only is Terraria's gameplay mainly devoid of bugs, but it also buffs out these quirks. Players are separated from worlds, allowing for easy singleplayer-to-multiplayer transfer. Characters can ascend blocks without needing to jump. Chests containing items don't explode if you try to harvest them. Keys are easily remappable for those familiar with alternate control schemes. Quick-stacking skips 'favorite' items. You can use the in-game system for taking wide screenshots for giant builds. You can set player configurations to ease the smallest of annoyances. In general, you never feel you're fighting the game's controls and interface. Continued updates: It would be very easy for Terraria, as popular as it is, to offer game expansions as paid DLC. The developers, instead, make their continued updates absolutely free to owners of the game. The developer-community relationship is superb.Cons New player friendliness: The in-game help system is stunted, and players can easily become overwhelmed by the ever-growing number of toys in Terraria's sandbox. Many people resort to a guide to help them through the game. Grinding: While the game does not require noticeable grinding to progress, several tangents in the game require patience and luck. That fancy teleportation item pretty much necessitates a farm in the Hallow. The last component of a PDA could be hundreds of monster drops or fishing quests away. At a rate of one quest per in-game day, the 200 fishing quests achievement would require 4,800 minutes (3 1/3 days) to complete without resorting to tricks. It can be frustrating to have an achievement be left incomplete as a stretch, yet Terraria is not above this issue. Moddability: Terraria is extensive enough that it doesn't need additional features, but people have been able to decode the game and develop external software and mods for a better game experience. It would be a boon if the game was open to the modding community for extended gameplay. "

												I always thought that terraria was a great game, but after 1.2 patch it became one of my personal favourites! This game is a 2D RPG-platformer in randomly generated worlds. Loot, that you can find in game is important, but not as much as your skill! Try it out, if you like challenging games with almost endless replayability!			"

And yes everyone in my friends knows what minecraft is and some are big fans of the game! but this is something that has been talked about wayy to long and needs someone to sit down and tell them the differenceIf you see anything incorrect from the latest 1.3 update please comment I read them all :)MC Offensives: 5 swords, 1 bow, 5 Armor Sets Terraria Offensives: 72 swords, 36 bows, 32 guns, 20 yoyo's, 25 Magic Staff's, 7 Spell books 56 Armor setsMC Bosses: 2, Terraria Bosses: 29 (including mobile and console bosses)MC Enemies: 21, Terraria Enemies: 402MC Items: around 300(not counted potions), Terraria Items: 3646 PC and 39 are console only.MC Potions: 13, Terraria Potions: 76And on top of all this...Minecraft price: $20.00, NEVER on sale. The last sale was in 2013 (I could be wrong on this)Terraria price: $10.00, and can be a minimum of $2.50 on sale.But hey, here's the main thing:The better sandbox is Minecraft,but the better adventure is Terraria			"

												Alright so I've been playing this game ever since 1.0.4, building stuff, killing slimes and getting freaked out by the continuous stream of horrifying yet excellent content coming, so it's about time I should actually make a review on this game. I met a lot of people and learned so many things through these friendships and communities and practically gone through what seems like the virtual equivalent to my childhood, so wow does this game have a special place in my heart.Putting my sentimental values in this game aside, content-wise this game is practically everything a fantasy-loving, retro game, sandbox, adventurous and architectually creative enthusiast could ever ask for (see if you're not a fan of any of those kind of games, then you probably might not enjoy this considering the beginning is rather.. slow). Gosh there's just so much to love in this game that I don't even know where to begin, that is, if you give this game a chance. I shall warn anyone who isn't a fan of reading guides that the game in the beginning isn't very intuitive, as it just throws you in the world with no tutorial whatsoever. However there is a Guide NPC, so if you do feel lost on what to do, you should speak to said NPC. The controls of this game is pretty basic; WASD to move, space to jump, number keys corresponding to the hotbar, click to attack, etc.But once you got all of that figured out, boy is this game one heck of a ride, especially if you haven't read any spoilers and you have absolutely no idea what will happen next in this gem of a game. You'll be quite surprised with how many things you can discover, how many things you can create and conquer; I definitely recommend you play this with friends as progression throughout the game would be so much more funner, meaning you'll get to the fun stuff faster (i.e. the events and ridiculous weapons and mounts).

												Being a Minecraft fan, I looked down upon the infamous Terraria for quite a long time, deemed its existence as a small nuisance. What's there not to overlook? The controls are obviously goggle-eyed alien in comparison to the simple 3D-roaming FPS-ness, the graphics look inappropriate for a complex game, and there is an overall feeling that the game refuses to take the ""crafting"" genre seriously. These were my first impressions.However, after 2 hours into the game, I've started to notice its sleeping greatness - the game is insanely HUGE in almost every aspect!! The worlds virtually span in 4 directions: there are your typical landscape biomes that include Forest, Jungle, Desert, Winter and a few more, each having their distinctly themed caverns underneath, which are biomes on their own, but also there is reportedly more terrain high above in the clouds (25 hours into the game, and I still haven't finished exploring the ground and below-ground level worlds!). The amount and variety of the craftable stuff is immense! There is any set of decorative, combat and building equipment imaginable: for starters, there are myriads of building brick types alone! Even the wood has different color, depending on the forest type you chose to harvest. Seriously, imagine a device, a potion or a house equipment - Terraria has it!There is also a huge variety of monsters, bosses (although the ones I've managed to fight so far have similar behavior), guarded dungeons, summoning rituals, NPCs (yes, unlike Minecraft - the game offers you to interact with unique characters that appear when you build a new room, with material and complexity of your choice, and which allow you to learn crafting recipes from them, and buy otherwise uncraftable equipment in order to bring balance into the game progression), and the sheer amount of stuff to be indulged into!Also, there are genuenly fun combat and adventure aspects - I will never forget our descent to the center of the Underground jungle - a place that changed our characters forever (also, the Queen Bee drops awesome sword!).If you have something to like about the game already, but are in doubt, or if you love Minecraft, as well as old-school graphics (represented here with MUCH more effort and finesse, than in most pixelated indie titles of today, virtually making it SNES-grade in terms of quality), my advice is - go for it, and you will inevitably love it. Just be sure to invite some friends (I play with just one, but it is already one of, if not the best, multiplayer experiences I've had in years).			"

These are the only similarities:-They both have mining and exploration-They both have zombies to fight-They both have bosses-They both have Hell (an underworld)That's all i can think of at the top of my head.

												Terraria is a sidescrolling sandbox rpg. The game uses procedurally generated maps to provide the player with a unique experience every time. While some say the game is a ripoff of Minecraft it is, imo,  rather a testement to what Minecraft could have been.  The game uses a sidescrolling pixelated style and focuses on the standard rpg fare of collecting items and then using them to explore locations and fight bosses to collect more items. The game focuses less on the creation aspect of sandbox rpg and moreso on the rpg part while Minecraft does the opposite. While the game has a variety of cosmetics and various building materials that simply isn't the point of the game. The point of the game is fighting the boss, progressing to the next level, and getting to, and beating, the inevitable hard mode.  This focus does mean that the game eventually, like all rpgs, dims out and you will find yourself unable to progress and not so willing to farm for rare items. It is an issue experienced by even MMORPGs such as World of Warcraft. Terraria sadly does not come out with enough large updates (Expansions if you wil) to warrent continous playing from update to update.  The bosses are varied and the enemies are fun to fight, the caves are fun to explore etc. Everything you would want from a sandbox rpg game but unlike Minecraft's seamingly endless tracks of land you can easily explore the entirety of your Terraria world. This is sad as some things such as Pyramids, ice caves etc are not going to spawn on every world unlike in Minecraft where it is simply walking around trying to find the right biome. This issue is actually an odd one. As all the creativity in building a house could go to waste when you find there is not teh right biome you are looking for on this world. The act of having to world hop with your character is a poor one and while it is there for a reason the fact that there is a chance you will HAVE to do it is saddening and ruins a portion of the game and breaks imersion. Another issue the game struggles with is online play. Unlike games such as Diablo where the enemies grow in strength the more players that are in a single game the mobs of Terraria do not care if as many as 8 people are in their world they will stay the same strength. This makes large parties of friends able to easily chew through a majority of the game undergeared as they may be. And while they require more resources to upgrade there are so many of them to fight and die to kill the boss that it does not neccessarily matter. This means that while playing alone can be incredibly difficult and require alot of pre-planning and execution with multiple people you just kind of gang-bang the boss until it stops moving and drops it's loot. The various classes (Magic, melee, ranged etc) are fairly balenced with Melee providing the most armor but doing the least damage  in and so on in standard RPG fashion. While the game does have issues it is still a great sandbox rpg that can provide hours of fun especially when played with a  few friends so as to keep the game challenging. Defining your character, mineing and crafting your weapons and armor, building a small village for the npcs to live in all feels good and is fun to do either alone or with friends.  I rate the game, in it's current state, a 8.3/10			"

 Terraria	Terraria is an amazingly fun to play 2D sandbox game. You start off with nothing but as you discover Terraria you notice how much is in this game. Stats	Here are some general stats about Terraria to give you an idea of how impressive this game is.Terraria contains:- 2748 Items- 401 enemies- 76 potions- 69 swords- 34 bows- 30 guns- 21 bossesAs you can see Terraria contains a massive collection of fun. Gameplay	You will start off by creating your character and creating your world. A nice feature to note is that you can have your character travel through multiple worlds while keeping their items. You will be thrust into a new world where you will have to gather resources and upgrade your arsenal. Night in Terraria is not as forgiving as Minecraft. After you survive you will continue to build up your personal collection while building a house. You will build a house so that random people can move in take up a room and rip you off with prices (jk not all prices are bad). Eventually you shall fight your first boss and bosses in Terraria will give you a run for your money so you better be prepared guys and gals.  Singleplayer/Multiplayer	Terraria is a fun game and even more fun with friends. Friends will help you out and make it easier to advance without dying.... too much :D. However if you do not feel like playing multiplayer singleplayer is just as fun. In single player you do not have to share your loot and your friends are incapable of stealing it, because it is singlepalyer.  Hardmode	Hardmode is a gamemode that Terraria automatically places you in after you beat The Wall of Flesh. In Hardmode you will meet new bosses and new enemies. You will find new materials and you will quickly realize every is much tougher and you need to quickly upgrade yourself.  Rating	 Pros	+ Smooth gameplay+ Have not felt lag as of yet+ character customization+ huge amount of weapons+ HARDCORE+ entertaining for hours + huge amount of armour sets with special abilities Cons	- a lot to grasp for a new player to Terraria (I dont think i can think of any more)  Final Thoughts	Terraria is an amazing 2D sandbox that tests you. This game has given me hours upon hours of fun and I would gladly recommend this game to anyone who has money in their wallet.  Final Rating 10/10	 "

												Before you read, Terraria is NOT a copy of Minecraft.In my opinion, Minecraft is a fun and really good game for building, but I stopped playing it of boredom a couple months after getting it. I did not play it every day. Now, Terraria is good for Building, Exploring, Fighting, Destroying, and is rewarding. Minecraft is very unforgiving; When you die you lose all your stuff and you usually can't get it back in time. In Terraria you can choose to only drop your money (It's easy to get it back.), you can choose to lose some of your items, or you can make your character die forever so you need to make a new one. I have been playing Terraria for +150 hours and I am still not bored of it the slightest bit. Also, if you still think it is a ""Stupid Rip-off of Minecraft"" I am fine with that, BUT notice Terraria has 14 bosses... in PC. Minecraft has 3. ( Thanks for telling me =-=TheDragonBorn03=-=! ) Terraria has +70 Swords And +50 Armor sets while Minecraft has less than 10 of both of those. I hope this review helped you chose wether to buy this game or not, And thank you for reading this far! So, in my opinion,Minecraft is the superior for building and has almost endless worlds horizontally.Terraria is the superior for Fighting, Exploring, And looting. It is also very addictive and it is hard to pull yourself away from it.Honestly, I get on Terraria for multiple hours a day and I get on it every day.Also, The bosses are hard, especially during Expert or Hardmode, and they give you a sense of achievment when you beat them.Just noticed that I am comparing not reviewing -_- Well, Here's a bit of a review. Terraria Is fun and when you kill a boss they drop some pretty useful Items, and there is really progress because as a beginner stuff like crimtane and shadow scales and demonite and tissue are pretty good. When you advance that stuff is considered garbage. Killing the Eye Of Cthulu is challenging... until you kill the wall of flesh or some others. Once you kill the wall of flesh for some reason... (COUGH) progress (COUGH) All non-hardmode bosses become easy.. Byyyyeeee			"

												Oddly enough, Terraria was the first game I'd bought on Steam.  I had been away from PC gaming for a fair amount of time and a good friend had discovered the game on SA and started pestering me to play.  The buy in was dirt cheap and it looked mighty weird with it's retro chic graphics, but I figured if said friend was so fired up about it, I might as well give it ago.  All of the praise I could find at the time compared it to Minecraft, so I was a bit leary.  I'd watched my kid play hours of Minecraft and it just wasn't my bag.  I'm glad I was able to push that stigma aside, because I ended up finding a gem of a game that pulled me away from my fancy consoles for a good chunk of time. We've all been kids; kids love to explore.  Exploration is the foundation of Terraria.  You start out with nothing more than a pick axe and a large map, then you're left with simply trying to figure out what's there.  Start to dig, maybe build a house and you're off and running.   There's something mentally satisfying about being able to click away at the soft earth, digging a path ever deeper.  It may seem pointless, but as you tunnel down, maybe you take a jog to your right and all of a sudden a hidden cave opens up before you.  Dig some more, perhaps you find an underground lake.  Maybe after a few hours of digging, you find something far more sinister.  Then, you spice things up by spinning up a server and letting your friends join you, and now you're working in conjunction, worming your way through the contryside with a misdrected sense of manifest destiny, coupled with the thrill of shouting 'ooh, look what I found!' and getting them to come see. Terraria's not flashy, but it doesn't need to be.  It's a relaxing good time and it'll bring you a wee bit of the childhood joy of exploring.			"

												I've barely progressed past the Wall of Flesh and into the next difficulty mode and I've stretched this game out over 1000 hours already and counting, although admittedly quite a bit of AFK farming has taken place. It's still receiving content updates, and at this specific period of time (years after release) they're rather constant. All for $2.49? Yes please. I remember buying Diablo 3 Collector's edition for $100 and later feeling ripped off at how big of a piece of ♥♥♥♥ that turned out to be and having people on forums try and tell me ""Name another game you pay less than $60-$100 for and get hundreds of hours of entertainment out of"" As if quality games that don't ♥♥♥♥ your wallet are actually hard to find, this is one of them, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s!

												This is probably one of the best Games here on Steam.I first bought this Game back in 2013 and after dying a couple of times I didnt touch it for a while. However after playing it with a friend I discovered what a gem it really is.Terraria is a 2D Adventure, Survival, Crafting Game that is just perfect in every way. It also is very optimised and recieved lots of updates making building (Thank you for the smart Cursor) & moving around the world (Thank you for the different mounts) alot easier.Terraria is so Cheap but you can spend so much time on it. It basically is never ending fun and now with the achievements it will be easy ish to get 100%. The only grinding bit will be the fishing quests you'll need to do. There is honestly so much to do and it is an absolut gem. You just have to try it out yourself and if you dont want to spend 10€ (which is already really cheap for this kind of game) then you can always wait for a sale and grab it there!Now this Game might not have the best ""graphics"" but it is lovely the way it is and it shouldn't be in any other way. I highly recommend this Game to any Minecraft, Metroidvania & 100% Achievement Fan. But even if you are not one of those, the Chances that you will dislike this Game are very low! So just give it a shot!			"

												Terraria is a small 2D adventure game. I will review the game in some paragraphs, and then I will give it 1-10 points.[Gameplay]In the beggining, your quest it's to find wood, and make a shelter to survive the first night. ""The First Night""-that was the longest nigh in Terraria for me. Then, the game starts getting harder and harder. There are zombies, slimes, skeletones, Bosses and many, many other creatures. It's very interesting game! 10/10[Crafting]Ah.The crafting system in this game is quet hard to solve.It was hard to me, I didn't know even how to make a torch.The coolest thing about the crafting system is that, you only need the items for the thing you want to craft, not like in Minecraft, where you need to put every material in some ""speacial"" position. If you're a new player, talk to the first person you see in the game. Just do it!!! 9/10 It was hard...[Bosses]This is the coolest part of the game. Beating the bosses! So, The Bosses are made on 2 difficults, Easy and Hard.If you fight on easy difficult, don't worry. The Bosses have like 2k HP to 10k HP. They can be easly beaten up with a good armor and good weapons. IF YOU ARE A NEW PLAYER DON'T START WITH THE HARDMODE! JUST DON'T!!!On Hard mode, the Bosses are very hard, and If you die, you lose the game... Ex. The Eye Of Cthulhu it's on 2,8k HP on Easy, but on Hard mode, the Eyes are two and their name is ""The Twins"" The one have 20k, the other 23k HP.Good luck! 11/10[Multiplayer]Oh my God. This is the game I can play with friends forever! It's very funny and when you and the crew get all on HardMode characters and start beating bosses, it's cool. The worstest thig is that, Terraria is made on Small, Medium and Large terrain. This is the worstest thing, not like in Minecraft, to be infinite. But it's a'ight. 8.5/10 Can be better.[Final Review]""Terraria"" is a very good game. Even better than Minecraft, lol. So BUY it, what're ya' waiting for? This is an big adventure in a small world, which can be played with friends. What more do you need? 9.5/10 - I highly recommend this game!*Sorry for my bad english!*			"

												""This game is a Minecraft clone"" -A Suck-up Minecraft Fanboy/Fangirl, May 16 2011-PresentThe only reason they claim it's a clone is because it's open world, and has a few similar weapons (which technically, a lot of games have swords, and Minecraft wasn't the first) but overall, the un-modded version of Terraria is actually better than most modded Minecraft games, in my eyes. Some people complain that this game doesn't have enough content or doesn't get updated enough, and then claim that Minecraft is better (even though Minecraft only has at most 1/4th of the amout of items Terraria contains). Minecraft has had more updates overall and is barely as complex as the coding in this game! There are only a few things I find extraordinary in Minecraft: Creepers, anything involving the Nether, anything involving the End, and anything involving the Mushroom Islands. The list is so much bigger for Terraria! There are even more than 10 bosses and countless enemies that are either semi-original or 100% original. In fact, the only thing I wish Terraria had that Minecraft had was more mod makers and map creators. This game isn't even 'endless' like Minecraft claims, and still packs more of a punch with just a few content updates over the years! I strongly reccomend this game (if you can't already tell). This game should set the standards for upcoming sandbox games: lots of items, the developers stay in touch with the community, and has so many more enemies than any other game that you will be like:0_0 WOW.

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Terraria  Original Release: 2011 Genre Tags: Open-world; 2D; Sandbox; Survival; Multiplayer My Overall Grade: A+ Estimated Playtime (Campaign): N/A Multiplayer Aspect: Optional Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Novelty seekers; Sandbox players; Casual gamers; Multiplayer gamers REVIEWTerraria is already a well-known game. There probably isn’t much I can say which hasn’t already been said. Many gamers have heard of it, and many gamers know it is considered to be generally “great,” transcending most genre preferences and prejudices. And I now count myself among those people. But the inherent quality of Terraria  isn’t necessarily that obvious when a total newcomer decides to give it a shot, as the game can be quite uninviting at first. And that is something I want to address.So I will tell you, like the thousands of others, that Terraria is an incredibly enjoyable game. It is hard to concisely describe exactly why it is so enjoyable; but it basically boils down to the fact that there is an air of quality inherent to every gameplay aspect and those aspects synergize so well that that quality is multiplied exponentially in the end result.But when I first decided to try it, I failed three times to get into it.  Each time I sat down and tried to see what all the fuss was about, but each time I wound up extremely bored and confused as to why I couldn’t see what was supposed to be so fun about it.  The lack of any clear purpose and direction at the start of the game had me running around with no real incentives, and it ended up feeling unrewarding. Then I played with some new friends online who could offer a bit of direction. We started a new world together and the next thing I knew hours had flown by and I realized that I was finally enlightened.It was difficult to get over the initial hump of a learning curve and having a starter character.  There is no tutorial, there are no objectives; simply moving around is tedious at first, the digging is slow, and the building options are minimal… and it can all feel rather boring. But when you finally start making progress into the game, all the upgrades and item-tiers you climb through feel so gratifying. And I think having that initial slow-climbing grind at the start is a major part of what makes the game so satisfying once you finally delve into the heart of it.Once you reach this point of enlightenment, you will be eager to explore all that Terraria has to offer.  Hunt down exotic loot.  Fight epic boss battles.  Build giant castles with thousands of items. Make new friends and enjoy the enormous replayability of playing online. Maybe even try a role-play server. There are many hours of fun to be had.Perhaps the only negative aspects worth noting are the simplistic graphics and the lack of any clear story-mode. But due to the great gameplay and nature of the game, both of these things are easily dismissed as a non-issue by most. That said, if you really like story-driven experiences and/or gorgeous, current-gen graphics, you definitely won’t find those here.So in short, Terraria is something that can be easily enjoyed by almost any gamer. If you haven’t yet given it a go, you should probably consider it. It is a pretty safe bet for all but the most extremely discerning gamers. Just don’t forget that it may feel boring at first, but it is worth fighting past it; and playing with some people online can make it significantly more fun, especially when you are new.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

												I NEVER expected this game to be as complex as it is!At first I checked it out and was like ""Yeah, this looks kinda like Minecraft in 2D"" and I got into exploring the world, finding items and quickly realized there is WAY MORE than I expected. In the beginning, farming wood and my first ore the game felt kinda slow, but once I looted some chests in the underground bioms and got some movement items for faster running or double jumps I was hooked for it.I built myself a base, gathered more npcs, crafted better weapons, armor and fought the first bosses. I died a lot but kept on going because it was so much fun. I convinced a friend to buy the game and we explored the world together, progressed further into the bioms and found new gear everytime. Do I recommend this game?Yes! Absolutely! If you don't mind the slow beginning and love exploring and experimenting with new stuff this game is for you!PS: There are some pretty amazing items inthe game, if you get far enough! :D			"

												Terraria is a 2D Sandbox Adventure game that's all about building and fighting giant monsters. Sounds like another popular game, right? I assure you, it's nothing like it.In Terraria, you are the player. A custom created character that has the sole goal of defeating the final boss and restoring the world to peace. Not to say that the game doesn't have it's fair share of building, aswell.The combat is sort of simple, yet charming. I always love going on expert mode with my end-game character and fighting a bunch of bosses. It's always good fun.And while I may not be the best at building, I enjoy it too.Terraria has to be my favorite game of all-time. Period.Just throw 10$ USD at the screen to get it, seriously. It's dirt cheap.If i missed anything in this review, don't tell me. Go make your own review. I'm sure you can make something that's much better than what i can do...What's that? You already own the game? Well what the hell are you doing here, go play it!			"

												The most used comparison for this game is Terraria/Minecraft. I shall explain the difference between Minecraft and Terraria (edit: terraria is better)Exploration-Minecraft- 3D world, practically limitless, several biomes, intresting underground areas.Terraria- 2D world, you can control the size, several biomes, deeper underground areas. Underground hosts greater and cooler enemies, treasures, cave systems, etc.Building-Minecraft- Limited supply of blocks, blocks take up lots of space, the few interesting blocks are impossible to get easily.Terraria- Hundreds and hundreds of blocks, blocks stack into higher quantities (M=64, T=999), blocks are easier to get.Combat-Minecraft- 3 bosses, 5 swords, and a bow. 5 types of armor. Not much variety for pvp, it comes down to whoever has a stronger weapon.Terraria- 29 bosses, Swords ranging from shortswords to nyan-cat projectile swords, ranged weapons, magic, summoner weapons, etc. Pvp comes down to who has the most manuverability.So Terraria has more good points then bad, when compared to MInecraft. So there. Shut up about this game being a rip off, you Minecraft-F-N-A-F-fanboys-who-will-rise-to-protect-""the-best-games-of-all-time"".			"

												I Myself enjoy building, mining and open ended games. This is something different though. It combines the adventurous feeling of ""path of exile"" and the 2D yet amazing type of art of ""starbound"" and ""edge of space"". This came as a gift from my brother. He noticed that I was getting kinda left out because a few of my friends could play it and I didn't have it, so he spent his own money, or steam credit, to buy me this game. It is worth the cost and will bring you a lot of enjoyment. Thanks bro.Many people would call this ""2D Minecraft"" and ""pointless, silly and plain rubbish"". I however disagree, as this game has more enemies, bosses, items, biomes and many more. This game is out on many platforms and I simply love this game. 9.5/10. I would like to give my thanks to re-logic and the rest of the group for this game. It is astoundingly beautiful.I shall now talk about the gameplay. You may customize your character's original look, and can have extra items in your accessories bar to increase strentgh, allow double jump, save you from from injuries by dodging, etc. You also have a vanity bar to put on cloths over your armour, therefore letting you have a nice amount of defense without clamping down on your style. You have a bigger inventory and hotbar than minecraft and better items, too. You can be wearing a big bulky helmet made of toughened mushroom while also wearing a rainbow coloured bowler hat. I personally collect hats as a hobby, so I could wear a turquoise fez or boater while also have on a high end helm. The multiplayer allows pvp, and it's own version of ctf (capture the gem). It also has teams, allowing you to play pvp in a group if your friends without killing each other. This game has a wide range of NPCs, ranging from an arms dealer to a party girl. The nurse can be a bit rude though... But I don't care. She gets the job done. You can build a condo by the ocean, or a mansion in the roots of a tree. You can hollow out hell, or reside in the clouds. You could even build a secret hideout hidden in a lava pool. The crafting is fun, you can make potions easier than in minecraft, and the traders don't go ""HMMM"". That is an automatic upgrade.I just love this game, and if anybody says that it is bad, then I have a tear run down my cheek. Just joking.I would like to thank: Redigit, D-town, Cenx, Crowno, Will, Aaron, Jim, and anybody else who helped make this game. I have changed my rating from earlier: 10/10. Terraria has a lot of potential, yet is still a FANTASTIC game. Anyway you look at it, it is full of colour and beauty. Thanks. This is a true game.			"

												I sometimes find myself envying people who sit down to play an outstanding video game for the first time. It's like a Christmas morning: putting the toy back under the tree and tearing opening the box all over again will never quite replicate the excitement of seeing it for the first time. Terraria is this sort of game. Starting a new world with a new character still feels like an exciting adventure, but the experience of stepping into that bright two-dimensional world for the first time, and discovering piece-by-piece all that it has hidden, is worth the asking price all by itself. Subsequent playthroughs only add to the value, and how! And if it's on sale - it is, often - I can only advise you not to hesitate.Terraria is a very versatile game. You can play for hours at a time, clocking up days' worth of play, and still have a 'to-do' list as long as a Bone Serpent. Alternatively, you can casually dip in and out when the mood suits you, building a little here, digging a little there, working on some great artifice a bit at a time. You can challenge gods and monsters with the finest weaponry crafted from the rarest metals, or simply make a treehouse for all your NPC friends with matching furniture sets and mood lighting. Become an arctic explorer! Go fishing! Drain the ocean into the dungeon! (I have actually done this, it was hard work but good fun.) Go to hell - literally! You can try to be bored, but it will take a lot of effort.One of the advantages Terraria has over so many other games is the involvement of a dedicated development team. When updates come  - and they may not come forever - they add great stores of content to the game, with new NPCs, items, mechanics, enemies and locations, not to mention all the tweaks and fixes which aim at keeping everything balanced, no small feat given that every change has to keep Terraria accessible to new players, whilst offering bigger and better challenges to existing players whose kingdoms span from ocean to ocean. This is all done remarkably well: the devs maintain a good community, and there is always the sense that the players are being listened to when new content arrives, without ever compromising the creative vision behind it. In an age of cowboy developers, corporate spin and micro-transactions on every street corner, Terraria is a welcome example of good practice in video games, and if I needed to buy it again, I would quite happily pay the full price - although, as I said, sales do happen.Of course, nothing is perfect, and nothing is for everyone. When it comes to armour and weapons, and things forged out of fantastically rare ores, it can be very 'grindy' (if that's a word). Building anything of any real size takes time, as does the collection of large quantities of wood and stone and whatever else you may be using to put together your palace. Boss fights can take a lot of preparation, and the later-stage bosses can feel genuinely punishing when attempted repeatedly. As a rule, I find that Terraria is very good at compensating for these issues, (a quick trip to collect wood for house-building can turn into a hectic race through zombie-infested tundra, or an expedition to recover unknown loot from the bottom of some murky chasm,) but not everyone will want to give it their time. A mere two dimensions may be a deal-breaker for some, not to mention the rather old-school, pixel-y art style. But even if this sounds like you, I recommend giving it a try. For me, Terraria worked where Minecraft didn't, and I still feel that the former deserves some of the credit that is typically heaped upon the latter. So give it a go, walk around that forest for the first time, dig a little below the surface and see if the spirit of adventure takes you. If it does, keep digging - after one year and 262 hours of play, I still haven't stopped.			"

												Terraria, the best sandbox game on Steam. Well, that is obviously my opinion and to me, it holds true. The first thing you should realise about Terraria is that there is no real ""story"" to the game. Besides collecting resources, building a base and most of battling the fierce monsters that Terraria has to offer. And oh BOY does it have monsters. I think the best place to start this review would be talking about what I love about the game and what I sometimes wish was worked on a little bit.Firstly, what I really love about this game is the sense of accomplishment. And I don't mean accomplishment as in ""congrats, you killed a single enemy here's 100 great items and 20 achievements"". I mean accomplishment as in you fight your hardest and kill a boss which you've been grinding for (will expand on this point later), which gives you a good item. Now, once again, when I say a good item I in no way mean game winning or game breaking items. I mean items that should carry you through until the next boss and the cycle continues.Now, as I said earlier about grinding. Yes, this game does have grinding in it. However I deem it necessary to explain how grinding i this game differs to grinding in an RPG. First and foremost, yes this game will require a bit of grinding just to get something new and helpful in your quest. However you must not worry. If you choose to grind alot, which I know most people will choose to do, you will get better gear. However if you just run in and collect all ores that you see and kill everything that wants to do harm towards you, you'll still get good stuff; stuff that will help you defeat the next boss. So, to sum that up let me put it like this; This game doesn't require you to grind, just to dig and collect everything that you need for that next big battle.Speaking of bosses, this game has multiple (14, to be exact!), all of which are unique. I'm going to talk about 3 of the main bosses that you'll be seeing early on in the game. Those 3 bosses are Eye of Cthulu, The Eater of Worlds (The Brain of Cthulu on Crimson worlds!) and Skeletron. Each of these bosses are VERY unique. Now, whilst I don't want to spoil these bosses, I think the best way to describe them is like this:- Eye of Cthulu is a giant eye boss which charges you down and enters rage mode after a certain amount of damage is dealt.- The Eater of Worlds is a giant worm which will home in on you as you destroys it's segments, each dropping loot.- The Brain of Cthulu is a giant brain (suprisingly!). It spawns eyes which have to be defeated before attacking the actual brain itself.- And finally, Skeletron. Skeletron is a monstrous skeleton, with 2 hands which can be destroyed to make the fight easier. What I really love about these bosses is how different they all are from each other. End game bosses are equally amazing, but may require a giant WALL to be passed. Could cause a lot of FLESH wounds, if you catch my drift. End/Hardmode bosses are amazingly well done and should honestly is one of the most well done things in this game.Enough about the bosses, let's talk about weaponry. There's a multitude of weapon TYPES to choose from. Melee, Ranged, Mage and Summoner. And the amount of weapons within each catagory is well.. It's insane to be quite honest with you. If you're not enjoy swords, why don't you switch up to a staff which spews magical balls of damage to your foes? This game has a wide selection of weapons to choose from, and with that you also get the different armour types to help you. Once again, armour comes in a multitude range; Melee, Ranged, Mage and Summoner. Now, some people may not exactly understand what the classes are so let me help you understand what they are.- Melee is predominantly swords and some other weapons like maces and things like that- Ranged is mostly bows, guns and all the things like that.- Mage is staffs, books of magic and guff like that.- Now summoner, is where people probably don't understand what it is. Summoner allows you to summon minions to help you fight, like Slimes, Ravens and Pygmys.Finally, where this game kinda falls short. I mean, it's nothing 100% game ruining. Achievements. OKAY, OKAY, LOWER THE PITCHFORKS, ALLOW ME TO EXPLAIN MYSELF! I love the achievements in this game, they're fun, rewarding and allow me to play a different way in the game. But some of them are just so damn grindy. I mean, I think if you've played this game you understand where I'm going with this; the God damn Angler missons. I don't want to spend my time fishing when I could be fighting badass bosses and having a ball of a time. I don't want to fish. It's not as if it's just 5 or 10 times. It's 250 times. I don't want to fish for that long. Look, this game is damn near perfect and there's no way I can deny that. The constant work the devs put in is astounding and I must say that it's amazing the time and dedication they put into it. And, well, it paid off. This review is simply a slither of what the game is. And with that, I bid you all goodbye and farewell. I hope you have an amazing day or night dependant on your timezone!Enjoy the review? Please consider checking out my curator! I recommend many games similar to this one. http://steamcommunity.com/groups/JacksGamesOfChoice#curation "

Product received for free
												Holy hell. What a ride this has been. I first recieved this game when I was selected as the winner of a giveaway. I thought, ""Whatever, I've played Minecraft. This game is probably the exact same as it."" After all, there are certain similarities between both games. Find yourself stranded in the wilderness, mine ores and create some bland weapons and kill a generic boss and win.But the similarities end exactly there.Now, this game, in the starting phase, is actually quite bland, and I nearly quit because of it at first, but with the help of some friends, I stuck with it. It was pretty generic stuff. Mine some boring ores, build a boring house, feel the occasional rush of excitement of succesfully spelunking a cave and escaping unscathed with a new weapon, or dying and dropping your money. You'll die quite a bit as well, but don't let that discourage you. The moment I realized the exact depth of the game (and realized Iactually loved this game) was the moment my friends and I summoned what is to be considered the first boss, the Eye of Cthulu. The intensity of the battle, especially with our underprepared selves and crappy armor (hint: armor is your best friend!) made victory all the more satisfying. The adrenaline rushes as a boss attack leaves you at low health and your struggle to survive easily surpasses Minecraft in it's entertainment value. Yet I believed that was all the game had to offer, that one bit of awesomeness.WRONG! Excluding event bosses, there are over 14 different and unique bosses of Terraria, each with their own unique powers, and in Expert mode, their strength is vastly increased and each boss gains a lethal special attack, from the Eye of Cthulu's blinding fast rushes to the Skeletron's deadly skull spin. No two bosses are the same, nor can they be approached in the same way. Nearly every boss requires meticulous planning and building. But that's not all. because you know what's better than killing a boss?Sweet, sweet loot. Emerging victorious from a boss fight is definitely cause for celebration, but emerging victorious with a new weapon is even better. From shields that allow for bash-like charging, to a scarf that reduces damage by 17%, every boss kill is new and gratifying with the loot.Now, about now is where you can pick your specialization, especially if you're playing with friends. Will you be the hulking tank, absorbing all of the damage to protect your teammates? Or the looming mage, casting deadly spells from behind, or an archer, raining down death from above? It doesn't matter. After all, in Terraria, you're free to do what you want.And right when you think things are getting bland again, hardmode hits you. All of your weapons and armor's effectiveness is quartered. Enemies are a challenge again. Venturing out at night is a near death sentence. New enemies will spawn, and new loot along with it. But again, don't be discouraged. You'll die quite a bit, after all. Build your strength up again, and go kick some ♥♥♥. "

												For those that say this game is merely minecraft 2D, allow me to explain how wrong you are.Yes, this shares some key components with minecraft, but it also has a flavor of its own that minecfraft will likely never have.tons of weapons, enemies, bosses, and player progression namely.this game isn't for builders.This game isn't for fighters.It's for the players that don't want to stick to one way of life, and enjoy a change of pace as time goes on.farm, build, fight, and enjoy yourself. if you can't get into this game, so be it. but i must say that this games well worth a second try.

Introduction:Terraria is a 2D sandbox game with elements of action, mystery and adventure set in a beautifully pixelated world of flying eyeballs and various biomes like hell. With the choice to build, mine, fish, explore, fight and ride unicorns, how you play the game is really up to you.Pros:-Customisable characters with cloud support. -Dozens of weapons, armour, equipment, tools and consumables to choose from.-Various mounts and pets to choose from.-Multiple biomes with their own unique inhabitants, resource and behaviour.-Over ten bosses that provide a challenge for combat lovers.-Interesting NPCs who appreciate your horrible houses.-More than one way to play the game (such as fishing, mining and dying).-Hundreds of craft-able items and dozens of blocks.Cons:-Very time-consuming (although some see this as a good thing).Overall:Terraria is not a rip-off of Minecraft, but is actually a phenomenal game packed  with fun and a lot of content. It is definitely worth its price and twice the fun when played with a friend. Even after beating the final boss, there are still lots to explore, discover and achieve in this wonderfully made game. I personally rate this game a 9/10. :)			"

												*EDIT* 6/30/2015 Steam Multiplayer has now been added!When I first saw this game, I thought of it as another Minecraft clone. Now that I played about 100 hours on record, I now know it isn't a clone of Minecraft, it is better than Minecraft in my opinion. Its a 2D adventure game, with alot of bosses and crafting. One thing I don't like about it, the Steam multiplayer. In most games, Steam allows you to play with other people using Steam, in Terraria you have to host your own server. At the end of the day, Terraria is a great game, and I recommend it.10/10			"

												Terraria is easily capable of providing hours of entertainment. My impression prior to buying it was that it was a 2D minecraft clone, but after playing it, I prefer it to minecraft. But comparing to minecraft, as is often done, doesn't seem very fair to me, because they are two very different experiences. Terraria can be played in many different ways, and I'd expect that most people can find a way to enjoy it. Whether you prefer to take it slowly and cautiously, farming herbs and brewing potions, or prefer to role the dice, diving through caves and looting randomly generated structures, Terraria can be about exploration, collection, boss fighting, base defending, and much more. You start out by creating a character. The customization is limited, but not too limited. You can have multiple characters, and you can skip this by randomizing or choosing the default skin, but it doesn't take very long. You can then create a world (or multiple), choosing between normal and expert mode (as its name suggests, expert mode is not forgiving to newer players). The world has many different regions to explore, each with their own dangers and treasures. Between islands in the sky, a bug-infested jungle, a terrifying evil (which begins to spread later, there are two variants), and much more, you probably won't be bored by it for some time.The game has many mechanics to make it interesting. You can start a town of NPCs and complete quests for them or buy goods from them. You can fish up a meal or some treasure. You can acquire tools which you can use to wire up traps or farms. There are many events the player can defend against of varying difficulties throughout the game, and even more bosses to fight. There are literally thousands of different items and accessories to customize your playstyle; although there are only four main classes to choose from for the majority of the game, these being mage, ranged weaponist, mele fighter, and summoner (although summoner items are usually more difficult to obtain).I personally have put in almost a thousand hours, but I don't believe you need to put in even ten hours to get your money's worth. If you're having any difficulties while playing, the game has a massively helpful wiki, and a friendly community.			"

												What is Terraria? Terraria was a game that, often mistaken as a ""Minecraft clone"" and often seen as ""2D Minecraft"". Even after all that nonsense, Terraria was still a unique and a very young 2D adventure game that dragged many players into its world. After 1.2 update, Terraria became even larger, selling millions of copies, but then just after 1.2.1, it began to slowly die off. Fans were crying for it... Not until something wonderful happened. Terraria was released on consoles, slightly extending its life, and then, there were rumors about a big update for Terraria on PC. The 1.3 update was litteraly an explosion of new content, and yes, its true, +1000 items were added into game. This has to be one of the largest updates ever made for one game in gaming history. Free updates are still coming, adding more and more content, together with bug fixing and tweaking to make game more enjoyable and fun.If isn't obvious by now, Terraria is much better than Minecraft in all aspects. Don't get me wrong, Minecraft and modding is a wonderful thing too, but Minecraft alone will be never as good as Terraria currently is. So, what does Terraira feature that makes it such a great game? Let's start from what you can do in Terraira:FIGHT!From smacking slimes with your copper sword you start with, to annihilating the most powerful creatures of universe, you will learn (in a hard way) how dangerous the lands of Terraira really are. You are nowhere safe, not even inside your own home, as during certain events, swarms of enemies will break into your house, attempting to turn you and your fellow NPCs into a pile of mangled corpses. Hell, even bosses will come after you to punish your cowardness (if you haven't defeated them yet). Even if you own a good equipment to fend off enemies, your world is still in danger. There are biomes, seen as ""evil"", that will spread out and eventually corrupt your entire world. You are only one who can prevent this, so you better get a move on!You will come across thousands of enemies, as well as thousands of weapons to use aganist them. There are so many weapons to choose from, that everytime you start from beggining, you will find different set of weapons and armor to use. This is what makes replayability in Terraria great. From weapons, you have: swords that are ten times larger than your character, swords that shoot swords, bow that makes arrows rain from sky, large variety of machineguns, launchers, pistols, laser weaponary, craziest magical items you'll ever see, lots and lots of ammo types, and much, much more... Once you got yourself a good gear, its time to challenge most powerful and badass bosses that you will have hard time defeating. Gain their loot, and progress deeper in world of Terraria, eventually unlocking the ""Hardmode"" in your world, where real adventure begins and where only real heroes (your characters) shall become champions of Terraria!BUILD!Hundreds and hundreds of blocks to choose from, Terraira offers greatest choice of decorations and blocks for all creative minds out there! Most of blocks have their own theme (e.g. Marble represents acient Greeks), as well as their own set of furniture, such as bathtubs, tables, bookshelfs, lamps, etc. Some require for you to own special crafting stations and tools in order to use them for building, meaning that you will need to explore and fight in order to earn those items. Once you got everything you need, its up to you what you want to build. A house made entirely out of bones? Slime? Glass? Honey? Or make it steampunk themed, alien themed, have golden toilets, garden full of large glowing mushrooms, color shitfting blocks, beds made out of flesh... I can go forever like this, the options, are truly endless! You can even shape blocks with hammers and/or color them, build traps with wiring system, wall tappets, decorations, paintings... Remember, you world... Is your canvas! You can get NPCs to live inside your marvelious creations, and they will sell you many things that you will find very useful.Oh, and also, you can craft single colored blocks with gems you find underground. These blocks are made for pixel art!EXPLORE!A small world of Terraira contains everything you need, but just imagine what large worlds offers. All you have to do is explore them! You will find large variety of awesome loot, accesories and weapons for your character to use, statues to collect, and most importantly, ores used for crafting and crystal hearts that extend your maximum health. But beware, as I said, nowhere is safe. Underground is full of deadly traps and mobs that you are probably too weak to fight aganist, as well as other hazards such as water that you can easily drown in and lava that incrinates everything that touches.If you have hard time exploring the underground, try fishing! With fishing, you a can get seriosuly good loot that can help you face the dangers of underground. All you need here is bait, good fishing rod, patience and with enough luck, you will be swinging fish-swords and shark-pickaxes at your foes!COLLECT!Collecting virtual pixel sprites was never been so fun. Being able to own everything that exists in Terraria is satifaction at its best! If you like collecting stuff, you will probably relate to struggles of having filled up inventory with statues and paintings, hurrying back to your spawn so you can see what traveling merchant has for sale and defeating one boss over and over again, just to get that one item that you don't own, only to leave it inside a chest and never use it again. Or a throphy to decorate your walls with. Ah, lovely!CUSTOMIZE!In order to customize your character in a way you really want, it needs a lot of effort. You will need to fight and explore a lot, as well as get NPCs to live with you so you can buy vanity items from them. Terraria also features ""social slots"". With these slots, you can wear both armor and vanity clothes without losing defense points that armor gives. In-case you find one armor likeable, but you don't want to wear it because you already own a better armor, just put it in social slot and you will look like you are wearing it, and your actual, better armor, will still provide you its perks and abilities. Social slots are made for cosmetic purposes. You can also use dyes to paint yourself and your vanity and armor in different colors, as well as using hair dyes for hair. There's an impressive amount of dye combinations that you can craft, as well as rare dyes that glow, have animations, reflect light and other kinds of wacky colors and effects.Should you buy this game? Why, of course! Its worth every single copper coin. And has multiplayer too, which makes plenty hours of fun if you have a buddy/buddies to play with. It has holiday events during halloween and christmass, where you can get rad loot if you play during those special events.I gurantee this game will bring you at least thousand hours of fun, as long as you prove yourself worthy and prevail over frustation and dangers that Terraria can offer. Well, will you?			"

												I remember.Started to play a bit more games than just CS:S and CS 1.6. My brother had found this new awesome game that could be a potential minecraft, but for slower pcs, and with a hell lot more content. Back in 2011, you had to hammer crystals. You had to use a wooden axe to cut wood blocks, not a pickaxe.  You couldn't get past a 1-block tile withouth jumping. Background was ugly, so was the sun. Rocket boots needed mana. Liquids were buggy, so were walls, there was no expert mode. The Twins were awfully hard, so was the destroyer. Star Cannon was OP. Making a bridge to fight WoF was tedious. I had pirated this game, i'll admit that, but even then, even with those annoying things, even with the sluggish gameplay it had, it was one of my best times of my childhood and the most fun i've ever had with a game, so beautiful seeing it develop like a great Indie Game deserves.Thank you Redigit.

												Probably best 2D sandbox ever made. The amount of items you can craft or get and enemies you can defeat (including bosses) is just sometimes overwhelming.The game has 2 stages :1) Pre-hardmode - basically a longer ""tutorial"" where you learn basics such as crafting, fighting monsters and exploring biomes, this stage ends when you kill certain boss in the underground called wall of flesh.2) Hardmode - the real game begins here, monsters are stronger and new biomes appear, a lot of game content unlocks only in this mode. This stage remains forever (or you can count defeating the last boss as a end of it).There are a lot of decorative items and furniture so builders won't be dissapointed though I was focused more on exploring and fighting rather than building.Highly recommend this game but be careful - its addictive :)			"

												""2D Minecraft"" - It is a thought almost everyone has had (and anyone claiming otherwise are lying to themselves), but Terraria is much more than just that, and here is why I recommend it.Terraria's world is literally designed as a Terrarium, you start somewhere towards the middle of your world, and whether you go left or right - you will eventually stumble into an ""ocean"" with an invisible wall a little ways out. You have a couple options, build a base, and start exploring the surface, or you start mining and spelunking through the cave systems. Terraria's surface contains a little less than a dozen different biomes for you to explore and utilize as grounds for your home base (or outpost), and you will stumble into various enemies throughout them, and even sometimes fight the biome itself (Cure the corruption/crimson, or heck even help it spread!). Be sure to build shelter for the night as monsters are prone to hunt you down. Additionally there is also the chance of events happening, such as the goblin invasion.Throughout its underground system (which can be around 2000 blocks deep) you will find mini-dungeons, deep cavern systems and even bosses at times. And of course, we have a hell-ish biome at the very bottom filled with lava and demonic creatures.And when you think you have done it all? Defeat the boss in the hell-biome and start a NewGame+ esque event that makes everything in your world harder - even the bosses.So is Terraria recommended? Hell yes. For $10 (it's been on sale as low as $2 if you're on a budget) you will literally get days (or weeks!) worth of gameplay, and even more so if you have friends to play with! (Co-op always makes games better).			"

												Well I think it's about time to review this gem.Terraria is one of the best value-per-dollar games you can buy on steam. Period. Obviously some of the free-to-play games can match that value (because you spend nothing) but the amount of content in this game is just ridiculous!Ever since 1.0, there have been 3 absolutely game-changing updates, for completely free. The game was already worth it just at 1.0, apart from bugs, but then they litterally quadrupuled or quintupled every aspect of the game. 1.0 got the basics right; satisfying combat, fun exploration, lots of sandboxy things to do, but as I just said, it's sandboxy; there's a lack of an appropriate ending besides ""get the most powerful stuff."" 1.3 gave us the Moon Lord which is the equivilant of the Ender Dragon from Minecraft; it doesn't end your game after you defeat it but it's something tough even with the gear you get from him, so it feels like a climactic end.You'll start off small with your copper shortsword, or maybe you build the wooden broadsword to replace it. After many hours you'll have slowly went through the arsenal of weapons and armor the game provides you, from bows to guns to MAGIC, and from simple ""take less damage"" armor to armor that has really unique effects such as allowing you to reflect damage and draw aggro from enemies for your friends.On top of the weaponry you have all of the things to do with blockbuilding. There's so many pieces of furnature and different materials you can use to make something that looks amazing, and then you can customize it further by changing shapes with a hammer or recoloring blocks through the paint gun. On top of those cosmetic things you also have the (as of a recent update) fairly extensive wiring system that can allow you to create some pretty cool traps or other mechanisms such as spawning enemies or opening/closing doors.And on top of THAT you have the massive variety of enemies to fight, some of which will completely obliterate you and you'll enjoy every minute of it. All of the bosses have their unique elements and you'll definitely be surprised the first time a signature move comes out (like the first time that the Corruption boss comes out of the ground).AND ON TOP OF THAT you have a thriving modding community if the base game doesn't have enough content. Whether you just want more content or complete overhauls, the modding community's got you covered in user-friendly mod managers and easy mod installation.So basically I'm saying the game's pretty good and you should buy it if you haven't already with how often it goes on 50% and 75% sales.EDIT: Also you guys should totally nominate this game for the ""Test of Time"" reward because the game has always been great and it just keeps getting better and it's one of those games that pretty much every person on Steam has enjoyed at one point and returned to it at another when updates come out.

												Massive creative time sink. Dig like a boss.This is one of, if not THE best values on Steam for the amount of time you can play it vs. the money you will spend. Terraria has had two massive updates for free already, as well as both a Halloween and a Christmas update that added many more items, enemies, events, and bosses as well. The game caters to most gamers in that it has several ways to enjoy the game.Exploration, mining, and item collecting is a big part of the game. With the 2 major updates, and the two season ones the game has hundreds of items to find, get from bosses, and simply craft. For the item collectors out there you can spend a good 50-100 hours searching for all of these alone. You can find and craft armors, melee weapons, ranged weapons, and magic weapons. You will be able to find and craft dozens of accessories that can be improved and combined with others. You can plant gardens for potion ingretients, find special keys to unlock more chests, banners, paintings, statues, etc. for decoration. You can even craft dyes to allow you to change the color of your gear and paints to change the color of your blocks.Boss fights are for the more action orientated players. The game has 2 modes. You start in the normal, or ""easymode"" we all call it with just a handful of bosses that shouldn't be too difficult for you once you learn the mechanics and have upgraded your weapons, armors, and accessories. After defeating a certain boss in this mode the game will enter into HArdmode. This is where the more challenging enemies and bosses appear. You also will get access to much higher level gear and you will have much much more to find.The real longevity of the game, however comes in the crafting and building aspects of Terraria. AFter you have dominated all the bosses and mined all your ores, found your gears, etc. you can still spend hundreds of hours designing and building massive towns and structures. The game even has a bunch of wires and mechanical items that you can set up to do things such as teleport! The building aspect is most certainly my favorite part of the game.Not only can you do ALL of this alone in single player, but Terraria has CO-OP/Multiplayer! You can do everything you can in the single player mode, but with friends! Share and trade items with others, go and fight bosses together, or join together and create a massive art project, or city. Look around the net for Terraria artwork. There are truly some pehnomenal art designs by the Terraria players out there. Terraria is one of my favorite games I have on Steam and is one that every STeam gmaer should own. The game goes oon sale regularly at 75% off so you can get it for $2.50 regularly. It's a steal even at full price. Also, don't forget to check out Terraria Online for the wiki and the modding community. This game has a very nice and active mod community. So even after all of this you can still get mods too!The game also has trading cards.			"

												Terraria, Terraria, Terraria. Old old Terraria.I used to play this game with my sister and my friend on my server, it appears I played almost 140 (138) hours of this game and it was pretty darn good.Terraria is a sandbox sidescrolling indie RPG with a lot of crafting needing to be done but it is NOT a Minecraft copy in any stretch of the imagination, no no no. To some, it could even be better.Terraria features a huge amount of enemies, items and bosses all of which are incredibly designed. It also features funky 16 bit style music which is pretty awesome.First off and perhaps my favourite feature and the reason I love the game are the amounts of items, there are so many magical items almost all doing something unique and different such as a harp which sends out musical notes to attack your enemies or a wand which shoots out a beam which you control with your mouse. Let's just say the designers are very creative fellows indeed. Next off and my second favourite thing are the incredible amounts of bosses! From a giant worm to Cthulu's old eye, there is no limit to the amount of randomness and awesomeness you can find in this game.However, Terraria still has it's flaws. And one flaw is very big and slightly game ruining to me and why I don't play anymore.There is a large amount of grinding involved. Certain enemies drop certain items (Skeletons and Piranhas used to/still do drop hooks, but only Skeletons and Piranhas) and some have very low drop rates. Again, this might have been fixed. However, that was merely one floor amongst many positives.Back to the positives: One thing I forgot to mention was the housing system. Whenever you make a compatible house (You can't just make a random crevasse and expect it to work, you need to create a proper actual house) an NPC will move in, but only after you complete the achievement which will earn the NPCs respect, such as kill a boss which I think you needed for the Dryad. There are many, many NPCs for you to get and they all sell different things and say funny things, especially the Nurse who seems to have a crush on the Gunslinger, but again nothing is done with that. Don't expect cute Guide X Dryad crap to happen, sorry shippers. That'd be cool, if couples could actually happen or you could spy on the conversations between two or more NPC's. There is a huge amount of enemies to battle from flying eyes to unicorns, they're all unique and it'll take you a lot of hours to get bored and want new enemies, and not to mention the amount of hours you can put into this game is INSANE. It'll take estimated 200 hours and over (Don't quote me on that) to see every little tiny bit of content, if not 300 hours. But once you're done with that I'm not sure if you'd want to come back to it.And finally... The combat system. It's very basic, especially melee wise. But once you get late into the game you'll find all kinds of unique swords and magic items that'll mix everything up.And the final verdict for Terraria is... 6.5 out of 10. I feel bad for not ranking it higher, but the grinding (and the fact that it's not really my kind of game altogether) causes it to be a 6.5/10, which is a 'great game!' to me. Until next review :) Bye!			"

												You start the game and be like ""What am i even doing?"" so you dig and build and explore like it was Mincraft or something like that. Then, after you find a huge pile of junk and some hearts, you'll get a Message  ""You feel an evil presence watching you...,"" and your Pants might feel warm because you already know that Terraria loves to kill you. Boss spawns and you might die. Or you're able to kill him!After that you'll look at the Wiki and realize ""Holy mother of Slimes this game has content!""And THAT is where your jorney truly begins!Gear up! Fight Bosses! Gear up again! Fight more Bosses! Get killed! Try again! Build stuff! Survive Events! Die to random traps! Fight MOAR BOSSES! Dig to Hell and back! Get OP! Build on! Slay random stuff for your amusement! Farm stuff you don't even need anymore! Watch all your fellow NPCs get slain by the next Boss! Catch Fish! Catch a bigger Fish! Get killed by that bigger fish!

												ALRIGHT, SERIOUS REVIEW HERE:If you are looking for an addicting, time consuming (oops, those meant the same thing kinda) and amazing game, then you have come to the right place. To have an honest review here, Terraria is pretty boring when you first play it. Right? I'm sure everyone would agree with that one. BUT, as you play it more, it starts to get more addicting to you because you realize the wide variety of opportunities you can do inside the game. MEANING, you can do things like spawn more than 1 boss and fight them all at the same time, (The bosses are pretty beast btw) you can get a lot more loot (Swords, spears, yo-yo's, summoners, magic, guns!?) and even build really nice buildings to show off! You can also change the color of your character with different dyes for your armor. The dyes aren't just normal colors though, most of them have very unique mixtures that can make your armor look VERY impressive (around 30 unique and exclusive dyes, not just generic plain colors.) I myself have spent the first 2 weeks on this game ONLY. (Fitting in about...100 hours those weeks) so it's pretty obvious that to ME it was such an amazing game, with so much amazing loot and bosses. And there's a lot more where that came from. The game also has an excellent soundtrack, the music gets even better the farther you get in the game.  Anyway, thanks for reading the review, hopefully maybe I changed your mind about the game, (If I didn't it's completely fine.) but I strongly recommend it. Just remember, you will not regret buying this game if you AT LEAST make it into hardmode. Honest Rating: 9.5/10			"

												After putting hundreds and hundreds of hours into this game, A review:The basic game has been developed a lot through it's lifetime, and is very solid. There are a few overpowered things here and there (such as the very early obtained gem grappling hooks with massive range) but it's a very solid balance over all. Lots of objects you will find will already be useless because you've found better, but each time you play through the game, who knows, you might just happen upon an item earlier than usual. What you'll want to play this game for is the multiplayer. Playing alone is all well and good, but playing with friends, building projects with them, that's what can't be beaten. The bosses are incredibly difficult to beat alone anyway, so it'll make your life a lot easier to work with others. I seem to always manage to get a lot more hours from this game every time someone new decides they'll play it with me.Finally, a suggestion. 1. Get this game. 2. Play on a LARGE world. Small worlds run out of space to explore quickly, and it'll mean anything you build isn't kept, because when you finish exploring a world, you'll want to go to another.  Sky islands will be more difficult to find, and you'll have to build outposts close to the dungeon and the jungle so you don't keep having to run from your original spawn, but it's worth it. It'll also mean the corruption won't spread over your house as quickly once you get into hardmode.			"

Product received for free
												Alright, this game is probably one of the best games that i have ever played. At first, when my friend was talking about a 2D game that was kinda like minecraft where you could build whatever you wanted and fight monsters at night, i was thinking that you might aswell go play minecraft. But my friend constantly bugged me saying that this is a must play game. After about 2 months of harrasment a sale happend that brought this game down to two bucks.          Once that happend within 30 seconds of the sale my friend had bought a copy of the game for me. As you can see from the amount of hours i have on this game it wasn't for nothing. We have ""beaten"" the game about 5 times, first on softcore easy world (at this point there wasn't any hard world option) then we tried to only stick two one class throught a whole playthrough getting to the end (at this point the end was Duke Fishron) after a couple months of not playing the game we came back and found that there was a massive update to the game and a Boss called the Moonlord was a thing. At this point there wasn't any knowlage of the moonlord, like how to spawn him, how hard he is, what he drops. We kept it a mystery until we would eventually kill him ourselves.          We started an easy world with softcore characters and started on a journey that brought back memories. Once we had killed the Eye of Cthulu, and as usual my friend and i fought over who got the loot from him, we had heard some talk about a new game mode called Hardmode. So we packed up all our stuff and moved onto a hardmode world. Now that slimes could basically two hit us ♥♥♥♥ started to get heated. With multiple cases of raging to trying to get our money that we had lost back, to basically anything that wasnt planned jumping right on our asses. After a very long month or so of playing about 5 times a week we had seen these wierd looking ""Cultists"" at our doungeon. Seeing as we don't like people just taking over them we tried to kill them, thus resulting on an epic battle of things flying everywhere and the lead cultist splitting into aobut 20 different holograms of himself we realized that this fright wasn't even a challenge. Once he was dead a weird looking orange sun poped up in the background, it took about five seconds of us admiring the ""moon set"" until a massive fire worm came and one shot both of us. After many trial and errors trying to defeat the different colours that we still didn't understand we had killed the last pillar that led to the fastest death you could imagine.           Now that the last pillar had been taken down, we set our in search of the one thing that would spawn the moon lord that we had been hearing so much about. Once we saw the words on our screen and seeing it getting all fuzzy we were wondering what was going on until we saw a massive moon looking man come and one shot both of us with a huge lazer that decimated everything that it touched. After all that time and enerygy we realized that we could craft some pretty decent stuff from the little sould that the pillars dropped. Now equipping some of the best gear in the game we had rtied about 4 more times with the pillars and finally defeated the moon lord. Once all of that was done we had taked a much longer break. Now we have stared to play again and this time we are playing medium core characters.          Just some advice, if you have even made it this far in my journey of Terraria, dont try and play a medium core for your first character. you will not play this game again. ill try and finish the mediumcore play through and then maybe evern a hardcore one.

												This is my most played game on Steam...about 303 hours at the time of this posting. And the first game I ever bought on this platform. That was about 2 years ago.While it might be tempting to dismiss Terraria as a simple 2D Minecraft knockoff, its heavy focus on sidescrolling combat, boss fights, and crazy weaponry reveals just as large a debt to classics like Metroid and Castlevania. It clearly rests on the shoulders of giants, but is this enough to render Terraria a satisfying experience in its own right?As with Minecraft, you start your adventure by exploring a randomly generated landscape where you gather resources and build shelters in order to protect yourself from the hostile creatures that come out at night. Don't expect much in the way of a tutorial--while you can pick up some random tips from an NPC that follows you around, you're essentially left to figure out how to play the game on your own. Once you do, however, you'll find that you can build fortresses and craft weapons and other items with ease, and you'll even attract helpful NPCs such as merchants and nurses if you build homes for them.Yet Terraria is less about assembling monumental structures and more about crafting gear and fighting monsters. And the monsters are everywhere. During the day, you'll be hounded by lightweight slimes whose persistence makes building even the simplest structures a challenge, and during the night, you'll have to endure hordes of relentless zombies and floating eyeballs that batter your fortress.But the real challenges lie deep below in the underworld, where you'll dig tunnels to battle giant worms, skeletons and other horrors that drop the rare materials needed for the best upgrades. Gather enough materials, and you'll be able to craft a surprisingly eclectic arsenal that includes grappling hooks, lightsabers, and boomerangs--all of which will come in handy when summoning and battling the game's bosses. And if you find that it's a little too dangerous to go alone, you can always play with your friends in multiplayer.In the end, Terraria presents an experience similar to Minecraft, but it manages to distinguish itself with a heavy dose of breakneck fun that Minecraft often lacks. There's something for everyone here, and a host of free updates, a polished retro presentation, and a reasonable $10 price tag make this sandbox more than worth digging into.Highly Recommended "

												Nice sandbox, nice survival game- You'll always have something to do here- The game is huge if you like to get all the achievements, kill all the bosses and play all the classes. - Awesome multiplayer game- Kind of hard at the beginning because everything is hard to get and everyone can kill you easily but it's worth- You can ""share"" your singleplayer worlds and it's amazing. - You can play with all your characters in all your worlds so it's nice because if you get something cool for another character can just let it in a chest, switch characters and get it. :D Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

												I can't recommend it enough. I have 55 friends who own this game and I don't know a single one who's regretted it. It's more than enough fun in singleplayer, but having a group makes this game even better. Multiplayer is super easy to just set up and go.			"

												I love this game! What I love about it is that it is fairly easy and low-key when you first start, so you can learn how to play the game and find stuff without being overwelmed, but is still challenging. I played this game with a friend and he gave me a basic rundown of what you do in the game, but if you come into the game completely new, it can be confusing to know what you are actually suppose to do. You have to explore your world to gain any stuff, and as you gain more stuff you also risk finding bad creatures and eventually a boss. As your character gets stronger the game gets harder, but it still never feels impossible to complete. I also like that you can play this game over and over and still find new things to do, it never really feels completed to me. I have over 400 hrs in this game and I still haven't completed Duke Fishtron or Moon Lord on hardmode. I really like building towns and castles, you can make farms and machines, completely explore your map, dig tunnels and elevators to get around quickly, and you can build battle towers and test them by summoning events like the Blood/Frost/Pumpkin moon. Once you have your character built up as much as you can you can also do hardmode and expert, both are very challenging and fun. It is kind of funny how quickly you defeat the low level bosses like the Eye of Cthulhu once you are really strong. If you have a really powerful summoner active, sometimes they can kill the small bosses before they even appear in your field of vision.You can play with/against friends too, but getting the game actually set up and able to play multi-player is kind of a hastle, but once you have it figured out is is a lot of fun. The game also has a cheeky sense of sarcasim and adult humor that never gets old.Overall I love the game, it is easily one of my favorites!			"

												I have been playing Terraria ever since 2013 or so, and I honestly love it. The game has improved ever since it has started, and what was first a so-called ""2D Minecraft Rip-Off"" has become a fantastic game. Here are some pros and cons:ProsA ton of weapons, armor, and accessories that all have fun ways to useImproved multiplayer (If you have played the game as long as me, you know what I mean)A variety of NPCs to help you advance through the gameAmazing designs for... pretty much everythingBosses that are always fun to defeat with your friends or even by yourselfAn extremely active community of other playersAchievements that are fun to getConsWithout the use of the internet, the game can be extremely confusing for beginnersYounger players will have a hard time spelling the actual name of the gameUpdates take a long time to put into the game, so if there is a bug in the game it will take a while to fixThe game has been hacked by annoying players countless timesSo, overall, I would give this game a 9/10. This game is well worth buying, even if it is a little expensive.			"

												10/10. One of my favorite games. Its fun to play on your own, however, i would recommend having a music playlist playing in the background while you play on your own. Its also very easy to play with friends through steam. Also the game isn't very expensive, definitely worth the $10, especially if you have friends to play it with. However, only downside is that it can become a little repetitive over time. But after all, i guess that can be said for a lot of games. Sometimes its good to take a break for a little bit and come back to it.I currently have 434 hours played on this game, all but 6 achievements, and have beat every boss (that has been currently added). Theres a lot you can do in this game to keep yourself entertained.			"

 Pros:  Beautiful/stellar music, esp The Hallowed and Space Charming graphics/very colourful (makes you sit in awe of the world) Patch 1.3 added 800+ new items Good item tier and crafting system Allows for a lot of creativity High replay value 3 map size settings/huge top to bottom maps Variety of biomes Imaginative bosses (14-16 in total), invasions, and special events, e.g. Halloween and Christmas (which you can get early on if you manually alter your computer's time and date) Developers are a decent bunch of ducks, so support this [great] game! Welcoming community  Now supports Steam servers  Cons:  Starting game can be somewhat slow Several achievements are bugged, e.g. heart breaker in multiplayer. May require a new world after a patch to recognise the achievements properly Switching between items [1-0] can be infuriating and often unresponsive Previous versions won't work well on newer patches, e.g. 1.2 worlds won't respond well to a 1.3 patch There's a lot of information to remember in this game, so you may have to refer to the Wiki a lot (can be - depending on the person) Conclusion: I would definitely recommend this game, especially considering the £/$ per enjoyable hour model. It's also a game you can come back to over and over again, and one that's truly timeless, and can be played by all kinds of gamers. Related games:  Starbound Minecraft "

												If you think its just a clone of MINECRAFT, then something is very wrong with you, and you clearly haven't played it. (in MC you throw ender eyes as a sense of direction to dungeon to get to the end, Terraria you did to hell).It is strongly based on adventure instead of just digging a hole in the ground. Think of it more as an adventure RPG than a digging game.Has many references to other things (such as Legend of Zelda, Mario, Tobuscus, and more).EXTREMELY fun with a friend or multiple.Would recomend twice.

												10/10 one of the best games ever. it has nearly no limits, you can do nearly everything in it. building, fighting, fishing, exploring, digging , collect stuff (for ppl who like to collect every in game item) make pvp fights (or play pvp games like capture the gem) the only thing some ppl may not like is that terraria is 2d , i personaly like it but some people need it 3d to build stuff. and to everyone who calls terraria a 2d minecraft: PLS DON'T EVER say terraria is a 2d minecraft,  terraria is way more focused on the crafting and fighting. you have different classes, tons of items more. and grind... ofc you have to farm for your stuff. thats the main aspect of the game TO GO DIGGING UNDERGROUND, exploring finding stuff and mining your ores. and if you had the strong stuff in a few minutes then you would complain that you are to fast done with everything lol. notice terraria OFFERS you that you build alot stuff and that ♥♥♥♥. but the main aspect is the mining and grinding for items in this game. the only thing minecraft has over terraria is that mc is 3d. if you just want to build stuff in 3d play minecraft. but thats the only thing mc has. mc is extremly limited and has way less items then terraria and even if terraria is 2d you can still build tons of awesome stuff			"

 Price For only 10 USD, this game provides a ton of content that is well worth more than the price of 10 USD Specs./PC Requirements Requires very minimal power until you have to defeat the final boss.I personnay run this on 45 fps and I have defeated the final boss Content It has the basic priniples of Minecraft, gather resources, survive, and defeat the bosses, but Terraria has something that makes it a very well known title. Terraria has thousands of accessories, has a crap ton of armor to choose from and a very wide variety of resources you can use for various uses. Don't like singleplayer? Well, you don't have to be alone. This game offers multiplayers so you can have friends join in and do whatever you want. From mods and glitches that can't get you Vac'd, I don't see why you don't have this game.Updates are rare but are big ones if they are released. The community has a great positive mood, I personally haven't experienced any trolls and negative players. Conclusion Just buy the game and be creative!			"

												The main thing you should know about this game is soundtrack 12/10,  its so amazing, even when you will be full of this game you still will play it because of soundtrack :D. By the way, don't be too mean and buy it(about 3-4$)Music is beautiful and changes depending on which biome/area we are in. Yeah! it has lots of music :)Lets go to the point body :It is a wide-open sandbox style game; we can edit the terrain and go anywhere we want to.The game starts in a randomly computer generated world. We start with three basic tools: a pickaxe for mining, a shortsword for combat, and an axe for woodcutting. Many resources, notably ores, can be found while mining or exploring underground caves. The player starts off with 100 health, which can eventually be increased up to 500 by finding special items (life hearts and fruit ones)underground. Some resources and most items may only be found in certain areas of the map, stored in common and rare containers, or dropped by certain enemies. The player uses resources to craft new items and equipment at an appropriate crafting station for that recipe. For example, tables or other items can be crafted at a work bench and bars can be smelted from ore at a furnace. Several advanced items in Terraria require multiple crafting operations where the product of one recipe is used as the ingredient for another.You can encounter many different enemies in Terraria such as simple slimes, zombies, demon eyes, and various region-specific enemies. The occurrence of certain enemies depends on several factors including time, location, random events, and player interactions. We can fight against enemies with swords, bows, guns, magic spells, and other weapons. Each map will have several zones with unique items and unusual enemies.To sum everything up: gameplay and musical design is so great. You will be an idiot if u had some money to spend and and didn't buy it.50/10 worth playing.			"

												Terraria Is really one of the best games I’ve played, Some people might thinks it’s a waste of time, But if you think about it, every game is a waste of time- But let’s not get into that. Its starts of really slow, but after a while its gets quite fun. And the graphics? Oh com'mon dont be so subbern to the point of judging a game by its graphics.But let’s actually talk about the game. Some people think that this game is a knock off of Minecraft, but its totally different. They may have some similarities but Terraria is more of a RPG. More bosses,   Weapons, Ores. I really loved this game; I would defiantly put this in my top 10 favorite games.Oh and the music, I ABSOULUTALY LOVE the music. Different themes for different biomes, And even a theme music  for that biome underground. Kudos for whoever made the soundtracks. The music play every second of the game, so I really like that.You don’t think you can make a good house in a 2d game? Wrong. Therese tons- TONS of decretive blocks for building. You can actually get trophies and banners from killing bosses & mobs. I’d suggest this to creative & survivor gamers.			"

												Terraria is a legend. It's a 2D crafting/survival game with simple graphics, thousands of craftables and tons of bosses (26 on PC, to be precise) to beat.You want a challenge? You come at the right place - to beat certain opponents you need skill... or wide knowledge and very very long stage preparations ^^'You seek fun? There is a multiplayer and lots of ways to have fun and/or prank your friends ;)And if you like building - you're NEVER going to get bored ^^ Build your very own Floating Gardens, underground dungeon(s) or any type of functional electronic circuit. In 1.3.1 patch they added logic gates, sensors and lots of tools to help you with wiring.There are 3 types of character-based difficulity and 2 types of world-based difficulity. You beat every boss? Nice! Now try it on Expert Mode world - and don't get surprised :DAlso, after defeating certain boss, world enters Hardmode. Difficulity spike is real ^^Sometimes to spice things up an event occurs - during which event-only enemies swarm you in hordes :)Of course, there are bugs. Sometimes randomly generated world is unintentionally difficult (especially for newly creater characters). But... that's about it. Other type of issues are extremely rare (I didn't encouter any in 200+ hours of gameplay) ^^			"

""The best 2D sandbox game out there. Like minecraft as a sidescroller""In this amazing sandbox game you will loose several hours. It's always fun, when you dig through caves, build houses for NPCs or farm some raw materials like mushrooms, wood and plants. There are neverending possibilities to combine items, ores and materials. That keeps it everytime interesting. It's a sidescroller but that doesn't mean, it's not exciting. Survive the night with walking zombies and flying demon eyes. Fight enemies and deny traps and use them for yourself. Be ready for well prepared dungeons. Fight incredible bosses and goblin armies. Dig down through hell or build up the eiffeltower with stonebricks. At least there is the hardmode which opens another bunch of items and possibilities. It's too much to discover, so that there is even a wiki out there: http://terraria.gamepedia.com/Terraria_WikiThe game is fully worth its price. If you play with your friends together in the same world the fun is more than doubled.Update: The new 88 achievements in the 1.3 version make it even more challenging to tryout the hardmode and rise up the complete  techtree. A new boss has been added: the Moon Lord.Just grinding were those fishing achievements ...			"

												After 130 hours on this game, I have to say this is a really good game.-Not a ripoff of MC, not even NEAR MC, stfu fanboys.-Really fun, worth the money, I got this for 3 dollars from the sale, heck, I would pay full price-A little boring at the start, but after you look on the wiki and learn some things, then it gets real!-Really fun to play with friends-Although its 2D, I think it is better than some other games that are 3D9.99/10 because I don't believe in perfect scores			"

Terraria has revealed itself as a very complete game. The idea of a 2D minecraft has not pushed me into the game initially, but eventually I gave it a try to play in Co-op with friends, and in a reasonable amount of hours and I was very impressed with the ton of content that this game has.Gigantic maps to dig, events to do, tons of different mobs, great bosses, amazing content for crafting, NPCs, skills and abilities. Go to the sky, go to Hell. Start chopping some trees at the beggining, end up litterally flying with laser guns, ridding unicorns, being a werewolf, and so on. The game also has some boring times, a bunch of time spent on research to know what to do next, what to craft, where to go, but in the end it will be worth it. The game was a pleasant surprise to me.OVERALL 9.1/10Amazingly Co-op fun! "

 Terratastic! I have been playing this since the very first release, keeping up with the updates and I must mention, the developers are really passionate about their game and have updated it always with loads and loads of content. I've never had so much fun in a sandbox. It has so many hours of exploration, that it's the best experience ever. Gameplay You start off with your guide in a fully unexplored land, ready to be plundered off it's resources. The guide explains few basics of the game and gives few tips that can help you out but he can also be a gentleman and open the door to your house to fellow zombies, because, let's not be rude to the guests shall we and let them have a fair meal of brains.In Terraria, exploration is the key. Chests and a multitude of other nice loot lay down underneath the layers of dirt and stone, which is completely wonderful. But not only that... the most amazing feature... POTS. YOU CAN SMASH POTS. The dream of smashing all the pots in your way has come true, they come in all variations! Pots, so many pots to break! But not only that- they hold rope, coins and more, something else really nice. Rope is useful when exploring caves at the very beginning, since you don't have a grappling hook of any sort and the wood platforms and others just don't do it. Rope is your ally. Then comes the most important objective- mining of the ores. You'll need them to start crafting better gear for a better protection and damage, so you don't get destroyed by powerful creatures and advance to the corruption where you'll have even more business to attend there. It's up to you to explore, Terrarian! Graphics Another feable comparrison to Minecraft is the pixelated art style. However, I have to disagree. Minecraft's visual aesthetics are based upon blocks just like Terraria. Though, Terraria has a lot more dynamic designs and aesthetics, and a much more vast colour pallet to boot. The art style is simple, yet very eye catching and has its own identity. Most sprite games try to base their style on games like Mega Man or Mario. Terarria, however, has its own style that is unique to itself. When you see the art and sprites, you don't think Mega Man or Mario. You think Terarria. Terarria also boosts a lot more visually stunning and diverse environments. The world also seems just so much more alive. Since this game is a sidescroller, the designers don't have to worry about Z axis. Because of this, Terarria has a lot more intricate world and level design and is a lot more vertical than its Mojang-created counterpart. Terarria also features a lot more enemies and NPCs than Minecraft. This game just feels alive and there's always something interesting on the screen, whether you're in the forests or deep underground. This game is just a joy to the eyes. OST & SFX Professionally done sound effects so you can get the most out of your gameplay, and awesome chiptune tracks to keep you going with the mood! Absolutely love the tunes and I look forward to buying the official soundtrack, it's that awesome! The rain and snow biome tracks are the best in my opinion, check both of them out on YouTube.Terraria OST RainTerraria OST Snow Should you buy it? Yes, you so should buy it! It's worth the full price for all the content it has to offer and fact is- it will offer even more on the plate soon enough.

												If a boulder falls on top of you, you die, and if you try to run from it, it chases you and you still die. If you fall into lava, you die. If you drop a voodoo doll into the lava, by complete accident....you. are. screwed.  If you're mining sand, and it starts falling on you, you suffocate. If you're looking for hearts in the underground to max out your life, you'll get stuck in a cobweb, and a dart trap will kill you. So you go back, and you see a gold chest. Right as you are about to loot it, you forget to look up and a boulder smashes you. If you forget to bring glowsticks and are stuck underwater, you won't be able to breathe and you'll drown. If you're just exploring the world from left to right, you suddenly realize that everything turns red. You keep going, only to be surrounded by a barrage of face monsters, crimeas, and blood crawlers. You only have 10 defense and a copper broadsword to defend yourself, and you realize that you are a prick. If you're building a massive building or trying to get to a floating island, you see a wyvern. It kills you, or it knocks you back and you end up where you started at ground level. In a tombstone.Eye of Cthulthu will come out of nowhere, and kill you when night falls. You'll learn to love Terraria. You will. 60-65 hours was when I finally started to know the in and outs of the game, and up to then, it was just a constant frustrating experience of dying. But that is part of the experience and now, it is one of my all time favorite games. This 2D RPG, sandbox adventure game is a must have for anyone who enjoys exploring, creating, destroying, and killing things. It may be a slight challenge in the beginning, but basically anything that you want to obtain in the game, involves mining or exploring. The more you mine, the deeper you go.The deeper you go, the more unique resources you obtain.The more unique resources you obtain, the more successful you become in the game. Mine, mine, mine. Some tips for beginners! Having auto-pause on helps sometimes.Mine, mine, mine.Start out small, and work your way up. Trees need grass.Mine, mine, mine.			"

												If you're a fan of adventure platforms like Metriod and Castlevania, but you always felt they could be a little more sandbox, Terraria is a must have.Though on the surface it looks like just another ""me too"" indie game seeking to ride the coattails of Minecraft's success, Terraria expands on the familiar sandbox gameplay with a greater emphasis on combat and adventure that proves very satisfying.You stick your nose under your first sod and there you are – in another world. Terraria is not much of a Minecraft 2D rip-off, it's an addictive pursuit of perfection that entertains; even though it stinks of a sweat from the adits.Terraria is a game, where you've got to make most of the fun yourself - a giant world to explore, tons of craftable items and currently three challenging bosses make this an easy task though. You'll find all materials really quick and every new item as well as every found crate or new area make you want to explore more of this lovely 8bit universe.The magical world of Terraria is bursting with terrific content and surprises to keep you invested for a long time.

 Terraria, A game about you, trying to survive the world of? Terraria, build and fight your way up to the end, you just start off as a person, only carrying nothing but the basic tools, and there you are. Deciding what your first step will be, will you go collect wood? Or immediately dive into the horrors below! It's all your choice in terraria.  There's a lot to do. What will be your first step? What will you do to become the Lord of Terraria? Well, the distance between  you and that tittle, is... let's say, pretty big, you got lots of things to do before you're done, and that is what keeps you playing.   Amazing gameplay. This is not just your average game, you got to use tactics, in fact, this game and its playstyle will keep building up. Though it can be frustrating sometimes, but aren't a lot of games like that? Hours and hours of never ending exploration. Oh? You're done finding what you wanted? There's always something else, waiting to be obtained. Maybe it's a rare drop? Maybe it's just an easy-to-get item that you badly want. However, you're never done trying to find whatever your heart desires.  Amazing boss fights.   Now, how can you be the 'Lord of Terraria' without proving it? You can't. That's why there are these strong foes that will challange you, all you have to do is defeat them. Sounds simple you may think? Well, it gets harder, but when it does, you'll find much better weapons and accessories. Some of these bosses are pretty challenging and require a good strategy.   Wonderful soundtracks. Not only is the environment of this game beautiful, but the soundtracks just finish it off. You're in a nice green forest, and what is the first thing you want to hear? Something peaceful. The soundtracks have all, their own special message, rather you're fighting a boss, exploring the caves or just wandering around at night. They all have their way of saying: ""This is where you are."" Challenging dungeons and caves.  If exploring the surface became boring, and you got bored? Then digging your way underground will have you exploring a lot longer! Mining these precious ores to craft materials or maybe some armor and weaponry to protect yourself. But, are you able to survive what's waiting for you down here?  Awesome weapons and items.  In this game, you have to be able to defend yourself. But how? With weapons of course! Do you like to slash your opponents with a mighty sword? Then crafting a good sword is the first step! Oh? You prefer to stay a safe distance away from your opponent? Well, that is possible! A bit later in the game you can own yourself a gun! But? What if you love to use magic? Is that even in the game? Well, it is! Either you can be a mage or a summoner! Wait, what's the difference you ask? Well, a Mage uses magic to fight and defend himself, a summoner on the other hand, summons creatures that will fight for him. However, magic items aren't quickly obtainable when you first start. But the time will come won't it?   An epic final boss.  Finally! You've defeated every boss! But... what is that? You feel a strong presence around you, as the final battle is about to come... you know... that you are not finished yet, for yet, to become to Lord of Terraria, you have to defeat the one who is... and that... is.......Something you'll find out on your own, spoiling it now would be rather pointless now wouldn't it? But what I can tell is, the items that this Lord will drop are very strong, and with these items, you can call yourself, The Lord of Terraria! Now, that was it. I hope you liked my little story.Personally, I just love this game. And I highly recommend it for those who love exploration and survival games. I hope this helped you a bit to see what Terraria is about and what it has to offer. Until then, I hope you'll have a good time playing and becoming, The Lord of Terraria! Have fun!			"

Personal Rating : ""Worth every seconds played""Traditional Rating : 9.5/10At the first glance, who will give a look for 2D sidescrolling with pixelized graphics, right?Terraria answer that doubtness with perfect gameplay and mechanic.I always try to explain this game to others as simple as this;""It's like Minecraft, but it's 2D, but it have the one that minecraft lack, goals for playing itself. Terraria have the RPG feel on it, there's character progression, bosses & challangeing enemies,  and the most important things-that minecraft said to be building & crafting game-; terraria give you thousands of crafting possibilities, no lie.""The achievements are well made (since 1.3.0.1), and it marks your progression through the game.Some rare items are almost impossible to obtain, but it's worth it when you finally get it.Multiplayers works flawlessly through Steam Integration, and you can even play with your friends that use ""pirated copy"" via IP connection.Thousands of dedicated server around the worldThousands mod you can try, if you still can't get enough with the vanilla ver.Developer are continuosly hearing, take ideas & critics from players, made this game is player-built-game, figuratively every things inside the game come from every corners of any Terraria forums.TL;DRThis game will feed your 300hours of loneliness for not having a GF, careful of addiction lad!

												Can't believe I haven't made a review till now.Before achievements, I couldn't get into the game. I just felt bored right off the bat with no clear goal of what to do next. I barely played it back then.After achievements, I was getting into the grove of things. Face boss after boss, victory after every defeat, and discovered a lot of new things I never noticed or came across before. Granted there was a massive update when they added in the achievements.I find it more fun than Minecraft as it gives you challengs to do when you explore and the difficulty rises the more you go, while Minecraft there's not much to do after awhile but build creative things. Minecraft is more for multiplayer while Terraria is good for both Single and Multiplayer. (I'm talking about vanilla).One down side is that you can sorta cheat your way with some of the bosses using the game mechancis to your advantage, but can be viewed as strategy for a few bosses. Another is when you're building something and an event starts by chance, you have to defend yourself or shelter away till it's over. You never know when they'll happen, just know how long it'll take. Sometimes events will happen one after another (blood moon and solar eclipse for example).The soundtrack is okay, but after awhile you'll just want to have it off throughout... it just feels a bit out of place to me and I don't know why.There are adventure maps you can download and play from the terraria forums (outside of steam) if you want to try something new or see what other people have made.Good luck doing 200 fishing quests. That'll most likely be your last achievement to get.			"

												This is, literally, the best use of 10 of your dollars that has ever, or will ever, present itself to you.This game should not be compared to Minecraft, as that game (and all games) = soggy, undercooked ravioli compared to this masterful work. In fact, Lamborghinis, stuffed-crust pizza, making love to Emma Watson, eating ice cream while sky-diving, and sharks riding jet-ski's are all garbage compared to this game. Leonardo Da Vinci, Abraham Lincoln, and Bill Murray once fused together, Dragon Ball Z style, and the mighty black hole of sheer awesomeness that was created from this fusion, had to stop, and bow down, humbled by the majesty of Terraria. Do yourself a favor: don't wait until a sale to pick this one up, as the devs really do deserve not only the $10 that this game costs, but also the extra hundreds of dollars that you will inevitably take from your or your child's college fund and send them when you realize they have created the closest thing we mere humans can get to digitized perfection.

												Words can’t describe how fun this game is. It just becomes more enjoyable each hour... and with each boss killed. Even if you finish the game multiple times, I’m sure anyone would still find something new to do. The first few hours may be boring (I think it’s boring, personally) but after some time you realize how great it is. The developers did a great job on keeping the game alive with new content every few months. It really does have a lot of content and they are now working on Terraria: Otherworld.   If you have friends to play with it’s even more fun. Also you can speed up the progress by playing with them, which is always good. The 1.1, 1.2 and the 1.3 updates were the biggest updates to the game. If you played the game before ATLEAST the 1.3 update, you know how much content they add to the game. Even if you started playing the game after the 1.3 release, you will notice the huge amount of content.   I had lots of fun playing this game and the hours put into it was well worth it. I might not play it ever again but since I have lots of other games to play I just don’t have time for it.  At the end, it’s great and I’m SURE 90% of the people on steam has this masterpiece in their library. If you don’t own it, what are you waiting for?! It’s really cheap and well worth every penny.10/10

												I built a suspiciously phallic base as a joke. The NPCs decided it was a good place to live, and I extended it into a suspiciously phallic hotel. A very successful suspiciously phallic hotel, at that. If you can't tell already, the game is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome and if you don't agree, you suck.Seriously though. Terraria is one of the best games that I've ever played, and for ten dollars, it's impossible to go wrong. Buy it, learn the ropes and then play with some friends. You will not regret it, especially if you like creating things and/or looting everything in sight/stealing from your friends/destroying hordes of enemies/spelunking around caves/pulling invasive weeds that want to kill you/exploring.(Please do not let the sidescrolling element deter you. In my opinion, it's what makes this game great. Imagine mixing Super Mario and Metroid together to bake a cake, and then adding Minecraft on top as the icing. Delicious.)			"

												Probably one of the first sandbox-crafting-building games, that made me skip sleeping at night for several days. The possibilities are nearly endless here, I’ve started the game over for like 15 or 20 times, and every time I’ve had a different experience. Good thing is, every new world you generate, differs drastically from the last one. You’re getting randomly generated dungeons, biomes, deserts (with pyramids!), jungle, the hell, and all the world objects. There are thousands (literally) crafting recipes, and it will take tens of hours to explore them. Single player is pretty good, and you will enjoy exploring the world, building castles (or dirt houses) and digging deeper into the ground. Multiplayer, however, is absolutely amazing - it really makes the game shine. But try to play with your friends, not with just random people - communicate via Skype, TeamSpeak or whatnot, it will make your experience of dirt digging a lot richer. Trust me.I’d rate this game 9.0 / 10.0			"

												This game is AWESOME. Best 10 dollars I EVER spent.It's a game about you start out in a world, and your main goal is to defeat bosses. Each boss will help you defeat the next one, and eventually a boss called the Wall Of Flesh will be defeated. Once you defeat this boss, your world will enter Hardmode, which will make everything harder. You have to push through a bunch more bosses, and do a bunch more grinding. Then you will find a cult at your dungeon, and..... I can't tell you all in this cramped space.Most weapons and armor and potions are really balanced, and there are 4 classes- Melee, Ranged, Magic, and Summoner.  I can't spoil too much more, otherwise it won't be as much fun. Go play Terraria now!			"

Buy this game.Don't wait for a sale or for it to go down in price. It is by far the single best game I have bought for $10.The 2D pixel graphics are beautiful, the shadows and lighting are excellent. The sounds and music tracks go together very well and provide a rich atmosphere. The game play allows for both pure sandbox play and “questing”. Combat is self explanatory, there's very little learning curve in using weapons and items, though mastering their use may take some time. The materials in the game have a clear path down a wide tech tree, and the questing progress leads you through progressively more advanced mobs which are surprisingly well balanced, in my opinion.The total “questing” game play can last as little as 8 hours if you're rushing (and good), but more often will take closer to 40 or so for a newer player. Add in time you'll spend customizing your houses and world and you can easily get lost in a single world for litterally weeks (hundreds of hours).The only negative I can see is that the game does get a bit grindy at times, but if your like me, you can easily get lost in the grind as you test out new weapons and ammos on the various foes.A final word, if you liked Minecraft or Starbound you will, in all likelihood, like this title as well. There are enough common elements to all three titles to leave me confident enough to say this. However, I must stress, Terraria is not just 2D Minecraft, or just Starbound re-skined. It is a world of it's own, with it's own unique quarks and rules. In fact, I can see someone likeing, even loving Terraria and hating both Minecraft and Starbound. On a personal note, as much as I love Minecraft and Starbound, I would rank Terraria just above both in terms of polish and overall game play. The fact that the developer is still releasing updates for this fantastic title has made me a fan of not only the game but the company as well.OverviewPros:Excellent 2D GraphicsCompelling Game PlayClear Progression PathWell Priced (i.e. Cheap for what it Offers)Cons:Can Get Grindy at Times "

												For anybody thinking that it is a Minecraft copy, you are absolutely wrong. This game is much better than Minecraft and is completely different. Also, before you play 5 minutes and give up because you do not know what you are doing, look at some of the guides on steam and look at some youtube videos to familiarize yourself with the game and the mechanics of how it works.

												Boy, I remember buying this game when the 1.1 update came out. At that point I thought it was a well-done game, but when 1.2 was released, this game became one of my all time favourites. To get things out of the way, this game is definitely inspired by Minecraft. It takes its elements such as mining, exploring, fighting monters at night, and crafting (along with others), but turns to dial to 11. The part of the game that feels the most ""Minecraft-y"" is when you start off in your world, but after that point the games true colours will start to show through. For clarification, I'm not here to compare this to Minecraft (which I still think is a great game), or even bash it. I'm here to tell you why you should buy Terraria, so let's get to that.First off, here's a few questions: Do you like sandbox games? Do you like games that have a retro 2D twist to them? Do you like playing with friends or by yourself? If your answers were yes, or in the the case of the last one either of the answers, then you might as well have just already bought the game. Not convinced? Ok then.In Terraria, you start off in a forest, with measly copper tools. It's your job to build a shelter before night comes, to build better equipment, and to start mining. As I said earlier, this is where the game feels the most like a 2D Minecraft, but stick with me. Later on you'll gain NPC's which all provide unique services (such as a merchant, or a nurse), and realize how expansive the game really is. Thought that forest you started in was too cliché? Well, wait until you encounter the fiery depths of the Underworld, the blood-curling Crimson, the barran Desert's, or the monster infested Dungeon. These all have their own unique identity in terms of both looks, monsters, and geometry. Think zombies, slimes, and demon eyes are all pathetic losers? Well, wait until you fight an army of Goblin's, a horde of Demon's, and even a legion of blood-thirsty Snowmen. Hate your dinky copper equipment? Wait until you rock a full suit of Shroomite armour, weaponized with a sniper rifle and a rocket launcher. Where you end up in this game is amazing, the journey even more so. I could NEVER give the game justice when it comes to describing how much content and variety exists, so go take a look at the Terraria Wiki. Actually, experience it for yourself.In terms of sound, each monster may have a growl or roar or whatever, but to be honest it's not something you'll really notice. The music though, it's quite amazing. Each envirnment has its own track, which creates an atmosphere you would expect out of a boss battle, a desert, or a snow forest. As for the graphics themself, the game has a very nice retro appeal to it, which is very charming and nice to look at.Progressing however is where the games structure, and even some of its faults start to show up. Progressing through the game involves you killing bosses, which are all unique challenges by the way. You evetually reach Hardmode, where your world transforms with more equipment to get, more monsters to kill, and more bosses and events to fight. However, once you kill a boss called Plantera the games main problem shows up: You need to grind. Now, to be fair their currently isn't a whole lot more progressing at this point, but getting the best equipment can take you a while. Actually, it could take you a shorter amount of time, or even a longer amount of time. That's another problem here: The RNG. There's only a certain chance some items will drop from slain monsters, which is also another issue with the game. Luckily, developer Re-logic is currently working on some more balencing changes, which should be helpful when the endgame update comes out.Oh yes, the developer. Re-logic is amazing when it comes to making Terraria. They listen to their community and regularily keeps in touch with them, and all the post-laucnh content for the game is FREE. No DLC. No micro-transactions. All FREE content. And even though the main dev at Re-logic wont be working on the game anymore after the next update, the game will still be developed for however long it will be.So, in short, Terraria is an excellent game. This review itself does NOT give the game enough justice for just how great it is. For $10, Terraria is a grab. Even the problems I listed above shouldn't minimze your enjoyment of the game, as you'll still have fun throughout your journey. Not every game needs a AAA budget, or a great story to be amazing. And that's Terraria. A 9.5/10 from me, in it's current state (v. 1.2.4.1). When 1.3 releases I'll be sure to edit this review as well.			"

												Well, I've been playing this for over 150 hours, so I guess it's about time for a review. Simply put, this is quite possibly the best ten dollars I have ever spent on a game. Terraria has an unbelievable amount of content, and the exploration value never runs out. I've been playing this for several months and I'm  still  not bored with it. There's always something to do. Want to have a quiet evening building your house? Forget about it. There's zombies, demon eyeballs, slimes, classic movie monsters, and a flying Terminator head with four arms and a chainsaw that would have you do otherwise. Do you like pop culture references? So far, I've seen nods to Mario, Legend of Zelda, Pink Floyd, Portal, Christmas Story, Alien, Dark Souls, Final Fantasy, Kingdom Hearts, Star Wars, Ice Climbers, Minecraft, Spiderman, and God-knows-how-many more popular titles and franchises. Do you like strange and creative concepts? How would you like to fight off a Martian invasion as a bee-riding werewolf, or kill demons with a yoyo? Does that sound cool to you? Then get this game. I will warn you that starting off can be slow for inexperienced players, but it gets very rewarding later on, especially if you do it with friends.Like my review? Check out my  Curator  page!			"

												This game is amazing, I must say. It was hard to get into at first, but once I figured out you need to talk to the guide to figure out the basics I had an addiction for a while, to say the least. This may seem wierd, but it's like everytime I get on Terraria, it feels like there's ALWAYS something more to do. From FIghting, to farming, to building, to fishing, to mechanics and wiring, to exploring etc. This game ceases to amaze me. And not to mention they're still updating it and adding stuff! My personal favorite game, by far. DEFINATELY worth a purchase.			"

												Tl:dr at the end.Ok, you probably went here to the Negetive side to see down sides of the game however most of the negetive reviewes are either:A go back to the positve side or,B gets boring fast.So here is an actual review that will show the downsides of the game but, know that i did really enjoy the game, its one of my favorite games but here is just the downside.Bad instructions for beginners. Its pretty hard to get into when your new. Having a friend showing you the basics helps. But you will spend alot of time looking at wikis to figure out what to do. Some people may like it since you get to explore. However you will probably miss huge chunks of the games content.It also has alot of useful items only obtainable threw RNG. *cough* cellphone *cough*One slighly more minor thing is that somtimes. Your world or characters may get corrupted. This usually never happens but if it does there is no way to recover them. However this rarely happens. I have only gotten a character lost once without mods.One thing if you do get the game. DONT GET ITEMS FROM OTHER PEOPLE. It does severly ruins the game. If you play multiplayer, make sure you either play with another new player. Or somone who is willing to start over. This game is about the journey not the destination.People who do say this game gets boring fast have gotten items from other people.TL:DR I LOVE THIS GAME. HOWEVER HERE ARE JUST FLAWS AND I PUT IT IN NEGETIVE TO SHOW DOWNSIDES. ODDS ARE YOU WILL LOVE THIS STILL.1. RNG2. BAD INSTRUCTIONS3. SOMTIMES CORRUPTS WORLDS AND CHARACTERS			"

At that point I went all in again and here I am. "

												I have not yet reviewed this game, but I have the feeling that I should. Having +-150 hours into terraria, I can gladly say my money was well spent as I bought it on a sale for just $2,50. The game costs $10 (or 10 euros for me) at full price and I feel that even at $20-$30 this game would still be very much worth it.This game has, since the beginning, been promoted as a 2d minecraft. To be honest, I actually believed that...Until I played the game myself to find out that it is nothing like MC. In minecraft, it is all about being creative and building, whilst in terraria it's more about exploring, getting resources and upgrading equipment to fight epic bosses (to get more epic gear).GAMEPLAY: the gameplay is very enjoyable. The game starts out a bit slowly, as you have NOTHING at all, except for a sword, an axe and a pickaxe. With those tools your adventure starts to find resources, to explore vast caves and to build a (relative) safe shelter/house/castle/whatever :p. There is a lot of progression to be found in this game and I find it very rewarding. Having finally found enough ores to upgrade your equipment, you can fight tougher bosses. You don't need to go through all the equipments though, if you just want good gear rightaway, good luck fighting your first boss without any armour and (with a bit of luck) a few bombs/shurikens ;). There are also accessoiries to be found in this game (like wings, hermes' boots - aka speed boots...) that really increase the fun! After your beat the WOF (wall of flesh), hardmode starts and difficulty increases. You'll find new bosses, new equipment, new ores etc. Be careful though - when hardmode is triggered, there is no way back!YOUR WORLD ""LIVES"": You may be aware of it or not, but when you enter your world, you automatically have to deal with the crimson/the corruption. On normal mode, this is easy controllable, but on hardmode, things can get wild. So better keep your shelter(s) safe from it, because otherwise your NPC's will despawn.NPC's: this game has a lot of NPC's that spawn under certain conditions. You'll need a shelter/house for them in order to enjoy all the goods they sell (seriously, some of them sell amazing things that you absolutely want to have!)MUSIC: this game has some good soundtracks. They change according to where you are (each biome has its own track), or whether it's day or night, you're fighting a boss etc. Even after all those hours I still did not get bored of these enjoyable soundtracks.GRAPHICS: some enjoy them, others don't. I personally think they fit the game really well.So, again, I HIGHLY recommend this game. It offers great fun for countless hours. With friends it becomes even more enjoyable, but singleplayer is amazing too. The only negative point about this game is the ""lack"" of things to do. With this I don't mean there's not enough content, but you'll have to set your own goals. There's no questsystem whatsoever so you'll just have to explore the game yourself and see which hidden treasures you can find.If I had to rate this game, I'd give it an 8.5/10PS. make use of the wiki sometimes, it can provide important information! :)			"

Terraria is an amazing action-adventure platformer with a beautifully generated enviroment. There are tons of different biomes and areas to explore, with unique mobs and loot in them.Weapons are for four different ""classes"" (warrior, ranger, mage and summoner.) Certain items give you bonuses for specific classes, so specializing yourself as one of them will give you a ton more of damage on the chosen weapon style.There is also a wide variety of different accessories and items based on mobility to spice up the regular gameplay. (e.g. double jumps, grappling hooks and even wings.) The list keeps going and going.However there is no particular system for character progression in Terraria. (leveling, skillpoints etc.) But you will be gaining health crystals throughout exploring caves, which increase your maximum HP. Same goes for gathering Fallen stars for increasing maximum mana as mage.In my own opinion, Terraria is one of the best games to play through with your friends. It is almost too addictive, and keeps me grinding for the rare drops no matter how lucky or unlucky I could be.If you're not willing to buy it at full price, make sure to give it a try when it's on sale. (as you're still reading this.) Pros:Huge variety of different weapons and items.Randomly generated world. (every world is different.)Still stuff being added. (updates)Extremely fun with others. (co-op.)Cons:Some might dislike the voxel-based graphics. (personally actually quite like the graphical design.)Some bosses may be really difficult to kill alone. "

												Terraria is the game you play when you are bored and like your girls how you like your game dimensions. the joke is 2D but you got it only if you're a F A G like meTerraria devs are people who really listen to their community and add constantly huge stuff into the game (Mega Update coming 30th June 1.3 hype!!!).I can list a few pros and cons for here and there because this game feels like getting them. It's really awesome but not perfect:Pros:+Tons of things you can spend your lifetime doing for (searching for extremely rare drops or collecting all boss trophies like me)+With friends this game is just perfect because of the epic boss fights and actually making tactics against bosses (hell bridges for WoF and stuff like this)+graphics are pixels that have been done very well with a lovely simple style+Game is really easy to mod. You just create your own sprites or just recolor olds and copy/paste their .ini files in a mod folder. (It sounds hard here but this game has literally one of the easiest modding there is)+Tons of potential to become more awesome+Never lacks content+Boss fights are something beautiful+Has funny items (example: Christmas Tree Sword, Sand Cannon, Swordfish) but also epic items, and even beautiful items+Hundreds of hours of gameplay time+Softcore for people who hate in Minecraft that you lose all your gear if you die. You just drop half of your money you carry on that moment+Able to recall to your spawn point with appropriate item/items (Magic Mirror, Recall Potion)+Tons of roles you can get into like in RPG (Healer, Tank, Warrior, Ranger, Mage, Summoner)Something that's pros and cons at the same time:+/-Is fun in singleplayer but it lacks the fun multiplayer brings+/-Some mobs do damage like ♥♥♥♥ even though they aren't bosses+/-Playing with a lot of friends is a struggle to find resources sometimesAnd now the cons (God I hate this part):-Even large world is really small for exploring (approx 13,000 Ft from end to end)-Mid-phase in game is really REALLY hard, but lategame with proper items is just too plain easy (i.e. you don't even need to avoid boss hits)-Never finding Magic Mirror-Some enemies resist KB (knockback) like ♥♥♥♥ and thus makes early-game Warrior extremel difficult.-You need to git gud in this game before you actually can survive to endgame.My overall opinion is that I love this game way too hard. I have modded the game and I have played the game from 2012 (cracked version I admit pls dont hit me). This game never lacks fun and something to do unless you really have done everything in the game which takes hundreds and hundreds of hours to do. I have played this game for over 300+ hours (if cracked version is added up too) and I still miss a lot from the game. Terraria most fun when you grab your 1-3 friends and go full ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥pree over who makes houses and who does what and who does that. The game is only 10€ and it's really cheap considering the game has hundreds of hours of content.TL;DR: 9.8/10 me and my friend lose a boss fight because we forgot PvP on and he 1-shotted me and boss 1-shotted my friend. Children never forget PvP on in a boss fight. "

												This is by far the best game I've ever played.  It has different classes and hundreds of weapons that can offer different play styles, but only become prominent until the second phase of the game, as to not complicate things early on in the game.  The two-phase approach to the game is a brilliant idea, changing the world to add new enemies, biomes, ores and more to make sure the player doesn't become overpowered until the late-game, to keep the player on their toes.  There are over a dozen bosses, and lots of other minibosses and events to do as well.  Killing the bosses feels satisfying, because something will happen, or you'll get cool loot.  As well as that, the various NPCs that can be collected throughout the game add a community feel to the game, and keeps you from feeling alone while playing singleplayer.  All the NPCs have unique personalities, and some have...  interesting relations with each other *Cough* Nurse *Cough* Arms Dealer *Cough*.  Even in the postgame, there are still things to do, structures to build, and with a responsive and active dev team that actually takes people's comments to heart (Orange torch).   Overall, I can say that without a doubt, this game belongs on your steam library, there's a nice little spot there, just waiting...  waiting to be purchased and played.  (Warning, the game starts off fairly slow, don't give up, it gets going around the second boss, which is when you can really start exploring)			"

												A lot of friends suggested to me that this is a good game and i should play it. I wasn't impressed of it before i started playing, because it is a 2D game and I'm not a fan of them (when i say im not a fan of them i mean i hate the graphis of these types of games), so you can conclude that this has to be a very special game to impress me so much and make me write a review about it. What I like a lot about this game is that it is so simple to learn, yet so challenging, especially when you have to beat bosses.  Starting out At first you have to create your own character and island. You can customize your character, but the game gets to choose wheather you will have one of the following types of island - infected with corruption or with crimson. Crimson and Corruption  The crimson and corruption are types of bioms which everybody will have on their island. You can have only one of them. The two contain similar hazards, though each has its own unique enemies, items, and blocks. The tools, weapons, and armor obtained via Corruption materials are slightly less powerful than those obtained via Crimson materials, and Corruption enemies are also slightly less powerful.The corruption is purple colloured and the crimson is red colloured. This infection spreads with the time you spend playing on your island. Although some players don't mind it and even let it grow, I personally would advise all new players to make sure that this infection doesn't spread on your island. It infects trees, blocks, even the creatures are different and the music is kinda creepy and really annoying. So at the very beggining of your game find the infected part of your island and try to dig around it - maybe - 4,5 blocks around every infected part. One more thing this infection can spread even underground, so is very important to dig fastly, so you don't have more work later. In the end you will have something like an underground tunell. You can put lights so that it is easier to dig. If you feel lazy to dig, keep in mind that while you dig underground, you can stumble on to different furnitures (yes there are a lot of furnitures, decorated small rooms undrerground which you can take and decorate your house with it). So that can motivate you to dig more. When your tunell is ready, you island is now safe and can't get get infected anymore.  NPC An NPC is an non-player character. This is a friendly automated character that provides different services to players. You just need to stand close to them and you will be able to buy the items they provide. They will generally walk around during the day, they can talk to each other, or to the player. Why it is good to have more NPC in your house? The more rooms your house has, the more NPC will move in and the wider choice of bying items you will have. Also town NPCs that have moved into Houses reduce enemy spawn rates in the area, an effect that increases when more of them move in your house. Equipable items  While digging underground you can find weapons too. Keep in mind that you can equip those weapons and make your character stronger. Also when you beat a boss, you earn even more powerfull weapons. You can equip wings, so that you move faster, different kinds of items which boost your atack speed, health regeneration and e.t.c.  Character and world modes There are 3 types of character modes - softcore, mediumcore and hardcore mode. And there are 2 types of world modes - normal and expert mode. Bosses Defeating bosses makes you advance in the game in some way. Each boss has its own particular way of being summoned, and warning messages appear whenever one is about to appear. There are pre - hard mode bosses, hadmode bosses and event bosses. When defeating a boss, he can drop and item or a weapon (or nothing xD). Stronger bosses drop stronger weapons. Health Health is the character's life count, they look like heart icons and you can find them at the top-right of your screen. Each red heart is equal to 20 health. Taking a lot of damage causes health to drop. Your health will regenerate when you stop taking damage. Regeneration can also be boosted using various equippable items. Also when you dig undreground, you can find  Life Fruit to increase your health. With 15 Life Crystals and 20 Life Fruits used, a character can reach 20 yellow hearts, which equals 500 maximum health.  Multiplayer  The most enjoyable part of this game. If you want to progress faster, you will deffinetelly need friends to play with. The more people, the easier to beat bosses and creatures, find materials and build different kinds of buildings or just explore your island. Summary In conculstion, you can continue playing this game hours and hours before you are able to stop. There is a countless number of materials which you use to make  weapons, armor and a whole bunch of cool stuff you can find exploring your island. You can construct different buildings using the materials you have found and decorate them, you just have to have a big imagination. I absolutelly love the co - op part and it is really fun when you play with someone else. There are bosses which you have to take down and they become harder to kill with higher difficulties, so it is essential to have a buddy to help you out. There is just simply so much to learn about this game that it can never make you bored. Overall 11/10 one of my best choices so far ^^Warning: It is also very important that you  back up your files. It is done when you open the game, before entering your island. You will see a little cloud icon under your character. That is steam cloud and I strongly advise everybody to move their character and world to it.  Overall this is one of the best games I have played so far and there are not many games which are near to give you that joy of playing them.			"

												Terraria is essentially a 2-D side scroller letting you live your 2-D life. Build a house, have some prick move into your house without your say-so, build another house for said prick, wait for nightfall to see how the torches light up your new prick-free home, discover there are monsters such as zombies, flying eye balls, and more just waiting to literally tear your arms off. Yeah, even if they are eye balls with no limbs or anything...They will tear you limb from limb.   So you decide to dig down into the dark abyss of the ground for minerals that you can craft into weapons and armor to fight monsters that tear you limb from limb and then you discover there are even more powerful monsters that you must destroy to help clear the land so you can enjoy peace and quiet. So you collect loot and build your tiny prick-free home into usually a giant prick-free home filled with all kinds of gear you collected or crafted and are prepared for any monsters or demons. Then it turns out, there is a Giant Flesh monster thing in the very bottom pit of the world that you must destroy. And so the story cycles into a amazing game that is very fun and relaxing and I highly recommend it to any type of game player...........Of course it's all happy 8-bit music and bunnies until you discover while you are away destroying said giant flesh monster thing a prick nurse, prick merchant, and a bunch of other prick NPCs move into your giant supposedly prick-free home.

												Alright, let ne start off by saying the game is one of the most amazing games to play. That said, most people do have a challenge trying to survive in it due to the difficuly and some cluttered controls. Personally i enjoy every aspect of the game and find it to be hours of fun with trying to build different houses for the NPC's and fighting the bosses. If your looking for a fun sandbox game with hours of fun then you came to the right place.			"

												Dig, Fight, Explore, Build! Many people think that Terraria and Minecraft are a similar character and it's true, they are both voxel based mining games. However Terraria tones down a lot of what Minecraft is in building and creativity. Some people may perfer Minecraft others Terraria, TBH I actsually perfer this. Over my playtime of this (245.3HRS) currently, I had quite some fun on this game. To start off; NPCS can be floating around, you can bassicly explore anywhere, even acquire some of the most CRAZY items that i cant even explain. And did i even mention the bosses? there are so much enemies and things to fight it's not even funny... aswell randomly generated worlds so the fun never stops. Let's not forget about 1.2! when 1.2 released i was amazed at how many items were produced Not only did it add more items, it actsually changed the game. The only let down was the mutiplayer; the IP join thing i diden't really like, i would have liked to seen some kind of server browser or something, but ay you cant go wrong with this game.and oh yeah... get this while it's on sale, $2.49 is a must for this extraordinary game, even $9.99 is a steal.Recommended			"

												Terraria is one of those games where it's fun until you literally have everything and done everything then it's not fun anymore..Unless of course one of your friends got another friend to get into Terraria, and you both proceed to watch your friend absolutely suck at the game; struggling to build a house, 10 second reaction time, dying by slims, zombies and fall damage,  then of course I recommend it. Especially if you plan to start fresh on a new world.But no really, 380 hours into this, it's a pretty good sandbox game, really deep, but it starts out slow so be forgiving.			"

												I spent a summer with a friend playing this game everyday for around 10-12 hours a day until we beat the Moon Lord, then we grinded until we had our respective End-Game armors Vortex for him, and Nebula for me. We built a few really nice things, and had alot of fun with the game 300+ hours later, the game has alot of replay value to me, trying out the different classes, making potions, hardcore mode, and hours of grinding. This game is not a 2D minecraft, it's a work of art. (Not saying minecraft isn't.) Overall it's a great game for solo and multiplayer with friends.			"

Terraria.This game.Oh lord, where do I start?I think I'll start off with the fact that this game is more addicting that drugs.In the distant eye of an onlooker, Terraria would most likely be described as a ""2-D Version of Minecraft"". In reality, it's so much more than that. Terraria provides a large world the explore, tons of monsters to defeat, NPC's to befriend, loot to gather, a constant stream of upgrades, loot, and progress.There is always something to do in this game, and it'll most likely benifit your progress in some way or another.The soundtrack is amazing, the graphics are very charming and gives the game a ""SNES"" style to it.If you bring some friends along for the ride, it's even better! The boss fights are amazing, and well designed. Teamwork will play a huge key if you're playing with your mates.Doesn't matter if you're going solo or have assembled a band of merry heroes, Terraria will have something in store for you from the Eye of Cthulhu to the Moon Lord (Even after that).

												This is honestly one of the most addicting games I have ever come across. Never have I ever had a game that has captured this much of my attention. (Side note about myself: I get bored with games VERY VERY QUICKLY yet I played this wonderful game for so long)*cough* Back to the actual review :DTerraria is much more than just a ""2D Minecraft"", it is a gigantic adventure in which the player takes part in. There is so much to do, so many places to visit and ever so many items to craft! The 2D graphics are superb and welcoming, it gives some sense of nostalgia when you play.With different world sizes and character death settings, anyone can easily pick up the game and start playing.The bosses are a blast to fight and preparing for the battle is almost as fun as the actual fight itself! One of the biggest aspects of this game is the multiplayer: This game is so much more intereting when you rally up a group of friends and quest together!...If the multiplayer actually worked (x.x )I highly recommend this game to anyone who has $10! It is a true bang for the buck.I will end my review there since I do not want to make people avoid my review due to its length			"

												Need A Reason To Still Play This Game?You beat the final boss and now you thing you're done with Terraria? Well think again. There are plenty of mods that can breath new life into this classic game. You want more bosses? You got it. You want more weapons. Easy. Also most important thing of all. It's MUCH better with friends.PS: I Personally recommend Thorium, Prefixes for Enemies, and Calamity Mod. There are many more however these are the ones I am the most familiar with that bring the most change.			"

												Terraria is a pretty interesting hybrid between a metroidvania style adventure and a Minecraft style sandbox/building game. Once you start the game, you're immediately dumped into a huge randomly generated world with no idea what to do or how to do it. You really have to explore and figure out how things work on your own, which gives it a really oldschool and immersive feeling at the cost of being a bit time consuming and difficult (unless you look things up in a strategy guide, as many older players had to for certain rpgs, ha ha).Progressing through the game requires the player to explore all the various aspects of the game. From building a base, managing items, and fighting enemies, you'll have to do a little of each to reach each of the games bosses, which will award you with the tools to further explore the hidden reaches of the game world such as the fiery underworld or hidden fairy tale land. Each of these elements is fairly well executed, with combat and platforming being an eon above Minecraft and its ilk even if it's still somewhat clunky by most 2d standards. The rpg, building, and sandbox elements are also well done, allowing you a lot of options in building and a host of ways to customize your character and world in the long run.The game also has co op and PVP. With the huge assortment of weapons and bases to build, there's definitely some interesting potential for pvp tomfoolery. Having multiple friends all building, exploring, and cooperating in such a massive world can also be immense fun.Terraria is very much do-it-yourself type of game. Whether you want to completely teraform your world, build it for multiplayer, or simply make it to the end and defeat the final boss, you'll have to be pretty self motivated in your goals since nothing is really pushing you forward to do any one of these. As a Metroidvania/Sandbox hybrid rpg, it makes for an interesting breed of old school roleplaying. Some players seeking excitement and progress may ultimately grow bored once they've seen all there is to see, but working your way up to that point is definitely an interesting, if time consuming journey.

												This is a story about how Terraria got me into Steam.""You should get steam."" said my friend to me a long time ago, ""Get this game called Terraria, it's like Minecraft but with working multiplayer."". Being a younger me, and following the crowd of minecraft fanatics who were no good at it and had to look up tutorials just to figure out how the hell redstone works, I really liked the sound of this ""Terraria"" thing. At first I was reluctant to use Steam. But once I got into Terraria, many games followed in its footsteps and ended up in my gaming library. To this day, Terraria holds a special place in my heart. Reserving a seat for a possible sequel that is hopefully the gift that I want it to be. That's a nice story, but it doesn't say anything about the game. Let me get to that right now. This is a game that is quite a lot like Minecraft. Only slightly better. ""Better?"" I hear some of you say, ""But it is an ugly 2d piece of poopy that could not compare to the perfection that is Minecraft!"". Aha, but that is where you are wrong, because what it lacks in third dimensions, it makes up for in so many ways. There are more features in this game for you to poke your sword at than Minecraft can propose. Minecraft hands you nothing but your fists and a world to explore. This is a wonderful feeling, building up your home, expanding, killing your first monster, and cooking some meat to keep yourself alive. But the problem with that game, is that once you have the best gear, that's it. You win. You defeat the boss, and it's done. You basically have no reason to play anymore. While with Terraria, once you get the best gear, go beat the boss, you think you beat it. But then you realise that you have unleashed a whole new hell on your self and your awesome armor is now mere paper compared to the new enemies that you will face. Time to upgrade your gear, and reinforce your home, you're in for a bumpy ride. This happens about 3 times. Bring friends along to make it even more fun.The only thing that Terraria fails in is the Survival aspect. If you enjoy having to worry about your food, water, and fatigue, then you may be disappointed. Death is not a worry, all you lose is some money. The loss of which is easily prevented via use of a convenient piggy bank. Food in this game gives buffs to make you fight better, but it isn't necessary to your survival. The only liquids you will drink are ones that will heal you or give you more mystical energy, and sleeping is a foreign concept to the people of Terraria, beds only serve their purpose as a resurrection point for the common folk. This game is a fun game to play by your self, or with friends. However harder on your own. But more rewarding. Another bad thing is that this game has a lot of good loot that you may just have to have for yourself, which will require you to farm certain enemies many times to get them to drop one. I do recommend that you get this game and give it a good run. It's only 10 USD, but it gives so much more than your 10 dollars worth.			"

												Terraria is a platformer action-adventure sandbox game, almost like minecraft except this is side scrolling and has classic 2D graphics.In Terarria, you start in a randomly generated world, then you start gathering resources by chopping down trees, mining stones, clearing dirts or use them instead, and then you're going have to build houses or anything for a shelter, then you need to make weapons, tools, everything you need to survive from those monsters, especially in the night. Then you can explore the world and find many things interesting. There's also many boss enemies you have to fight here so be ready. This is a good game to waste your time, especially with friends.

												A very fun and in-depth building/exploration game. The early game is pretty bland and boring but after a few hours of playtime the game gets very interesting. Getting your first mount, making a cool outfit for your character, crafting that epic armor set you've been mining/grinding for, catching a super rare loot drop while fishing, getting that item drop you've been farming the boss/mobs for hours to get. All these will be one of the most satisfying things you've ever experienced.14 different bosses with unique mechanics and loot drops. There's also expert mode which adds new boss mechanics and a new loot drop for every single boss.And much more! All this for 10 euros, with the game frequently going on -75% sales. Just buy it already, and watch the hours fly by.			"

												Note: to see this review in its true form go to http://wildwoodgeek2.blogspot.com/2014/03/game-terraria.htmlTerraria, This game is one of my TOP games of all time. first i want to compare the game to the uber-famous Minecraft. i know, i know they aren't the same but a lot of people seem to think they are.First you need to realize what kind of game Terraria is. it is NOT a game where you build epic cities (well,some people do) its more based on combat,crafting,exploring, and fighting epic bosses. Terraria seems to do a lot of the stuff Minecraft does but better. Combat is way more fun and there are at least 50 weapons in the game. from Shark-powered guns to spear and TNT sticks. There is Magic with all kinds of spells. you can get special ammo for you guns, like one that tracks your target. and there are ROCKET launcher! need i say more? Combat in Terraria is fast and fluid (and a little bit gory). Players can fight PVP or PVE.  and one of the best parts in Terraria, Bosses. These large hostiles range from rather easily to insanely hard, making Co-op and almost must to finish the biggest Boss. and even when you defeat the most powerful enemy in your wold, The Wall of flesh, you aren't done. on the Walls death your world is overcome with even more powerful enemy and several new tougher bosses. needless to say this will keep you busy for a while.Now, Exploring in Terraria is better to me than Minecraft. i can't really explain but Terraria's underworld and caves feel more random and different than Mincraft Caves. also with some many different biomes there really is a lot to discover, like a mushroom biome or a jungle or a giant bee hive. Terraria has a simple feature that makes exploring easier and more fun, and that is real-time torches/lighting. by this i mean that you can just hold out a torch without placing it and it will light the way. (it makes me feel like Indiana Jones). later in the game you can get a miners helmet that lets you use your weapons/gear without having to place lighting. the liquid in Terraria is more life-like, because liquids don't spawn an infinite source they can and will drain away if you make a hole or pump it all out.Terraria has a lot of neat little features like gear, you can get wings,jetpacks,measure tools, and more. one of my favorite items is the ivory whip. this allows you to cling to walls making it a lot easier to climb and build. another fun thing in Terraria are the NPCs. these guys/gals will move into Empty homes that meet the requirements, and then sell you items like weapons,ammo,gear,blocks,wires(more on that later), and even Party items.another epic feature in Terraria is the wire system. it is what it sounds like. a red-stone like system that allows you to control pumps,lighting,traps, and doors. The Wire system in Terraria has some better features that Minecraft. you can put the wires anywhere and they are not visible unless you are holding a wrench.And even with all these features and with a second gaming be made the Devs still update and fix bugs in Terraria. Terraria is well worth your $15.			"

												Amazing game that I cannot recommend enough. The game has so much content in it, and the developers are very generous. They have not added a bit of paid DLC, and instead added new content through updates, which is the way it should be. The game contains over 3000 in-game items and around 350 different kinds of enemies. The game is also only $9.99 and goes on sale for around $2.49. For the price the developers are asking it is a steal. Terraria is just a great game and I recommmend it to anyone.			"

The combination of exploration, combat, and crafting, gives the player a sense of purpose in this game. The variety of bosses, ample amount of items, and prolong hours of gameplay, work to gether to form an extraordinary game. Wouln't trade it for any other game. 10/10			"

The good Plenty of stuff to do.  On a straight playthrough, there is probably 10-20 hours of content to get to the endgame for a normal player.  There is plenty of other stuff to explore and build Sandbox game Graphics are well-though out and simple, with a relatively clean feel that I like in this style of games Multiplayer is fun if you can find people to play with Relatively simple fighting mechanics, but enough variability in weapons and playstyles to keep the game interesting Simple systems in the game (wiring, sloped blocks) are easy to learn but have interesting mechanics if you prod at them a lotThe bad Early game is slow Endgame is either difficult or slow if you aren't playing with friends Item management is a mess No steam integration (will change with 1.3 update) Gets boring if you don't have a specific goalVerdictBuy if you like sandbox games and have friends to play with.  Terraria goes on sale frequently for 50-75% off.  Don't buy if you need a story to appreciate a game or can't stand grinding for the first hour or so in game.			"

												If you haven't heard of Terraria I don't know where you've been. it's easily one of the best games in it's genre. With an incredible amount of content plus having been supported by countless free updates. It's more fun then you could ever imagine a 2D procedurally generated world to be.			"

												Since there are more owners of Terraria on my friends list than there are owners of Portal or Portal 2, this is probably the ultimate gratuitous review. Chances are you’re already familiar with the game and you already have deep-seated opinions about it. Even so, I’m going to write out this review to provide some closure and articulation to my own thoughts.Before trying it, I assumed Terraria was 2D Minecraft. I was wrong. Although many game elements are clearly inspired by Minecraft, and comparisons between the two games are inevitable, they are very different games. Terraria is less of a sandbox game, and more of an action-RPG with destructible terrain. The focus is placed on questing, combat, and underground exploration. In Minecraft, you can have the ultimate equipment after a sufficiently lucky 30-minute cave exploration, but in Terraria it can take 40 hours or more to conquer all the quests and the bosses. Minecraft is largely a survival and engineering game – success comes through careful planning and calculated risks. Unlike Minecraft, Terraria’s building aspect is severely downplayed. There’s no survival element at all since you’re given unlimited, (almost) consequence-free respawns.Terraria is tricky to criticize; all of its greatest strengths are simultaneously also its deepest, most irreparable flaws. These are elements you can’t remove from the game – removing them would destroy what makes it uniquely Terraria – but they cause so many problems in the grander scope that they hinder and ultimately destroy its longevity. First issue: items are tied to the character rather than the world. If you load up your character’s inventory with loot, you can simply hop into another server and it all goes with you. On the surface, this is a fantastic idea that allows you to grow attached to a character and continue their adventure across multiple servers. The big problem comes with multiplayer. This system absolutely does not work with mismatched character levels. At all. Power creep is massive in this game, and so is “bored god syndrome."" A maxed character can plough through all the game’s events in about a half hour, whereas it takes a good 20-40 hours to do everything from scratch. Underleveled characters won’t be able to keep up. Powerful characters don't like waiting around for them. This is especially problematic playing with newbies who don't know the game’s basic progression. If a newbie is on a server with high-level characters, they won't learn how to summon the Eye of Cthulhu, or what demon altars do, or what the Pwnhammer is, and so much more. They’ll be given some spare items without getting to learn where they came from and how they were made. Worst of all, the weak characters will know that they aren’t contributing anything to the server since they can’t do anything that the overleveled characters can’t do with fifty times more efficiency. And since there's no server option to force a blank character, there is no way to prevent this from happening. Having been on both sides of this coin, I can honestly say that it’s depressing to see or to be a weak character playing on a server with strong characters.Another issue is that the game has far, far too many items. Compared to Minecraft’s 5 sword tiers, There are over 75 different swords alone in the game. Multiply that by the types of bows, pickaxes, armors… and that’s not even counting the block types, potions, fish, accessories, plants… We're talking over 3,500 different types of items.It’s great because it adds a deeper sense of diversity to the game. Unlike Minecraft, you can actually choose a pseudo-class in Terraria, specializing in any kind of combat. You can then collect and manage the items that are beneficial to that class. It’s satisfying being something other than a standard diamond-armored archer like in Minecraft. And it keeps exploration fun: the game can always surprise you with rare drops and new discoveries at every turn. But at the same time, the staggering number of items in Terraria just goes to show how smart Minecraft was for limiting them. Storage and categorization of items is an utter nightmare. Now, Terraria includes many conveniences to help you manage your items, including auto-sorting your inventory into nearby chests, ability to use color-coded and named chests, the complete bypassing of the crafting grid by simply listing all the crafting recipes for you, and even a garbage can built into the inventory screen itself. Yet, even with all these great inventory tweaks, it still isn’t nearly enough to keep the sheer number of items from overwhelming you, stuffing your inventory full. Item sorting is so time-consuming that I always gave up on keeping an organized storage room, and just started dumping my items in the nearest open space. The times when I decided to tackle the organization, I’d give up after an hour and not even be halfway done. It’s probably the most unfun part of the game.Furthermore, many of these items are useless because game progression happens a bit too fast. You’ll make a full set of Iron armor, then get Demonite ten minutes later, Meteorite thirty minutes after that, and so on… repeated for about 20 tiers of items. You’ll constantly be throwing away tools you may have only used for a few minutes before making something better. If you want to fully appreciate any one tier, you’ve got to intentionally slow down your play and pace yourself. It’s awesome that the game is self-paced… if you’ve got the patience for it.And finally: the longevity problem. You know how some RPGs hide the best sword in the final dungeon where it’s useless because there’s nothing left to use it on? That’s Terraria’s endgame in a nutshell. It’s so bad that there’s been two huge updates which have basically doubled the length of the game progression, one adding a “hard mode” that adds several more quests, and another adding an “expert mode” that serves as a “new game plus” for your overleveled character to conquer. But it still just prolongs the inevitable for a few dozen hours. Worlds are fixed size and are not infinite, and there’s no sense of risk and reward because deaths mean nothing and you can always use your trusty Magic Mirror to panic out of a bad situation. The core of the gameplay is the long, progressive struggle for power; once you have the power, there’s no gameplay left unless you want to start all over again. Unlike a Minecraft server which is infinitely large and immersive, a Terraria server will “end” and ultimately be used up completely, unable to offer anything new. Clinging to your character and taking your loot to a new server will just make the same thing happen, but faster. The only way to keep the game alive is to let go and start over – but after all the work it took to become a god, will you really want to do that?Despite any complaints, I loved the game. Those 100+ hours were incredible while they lasted. I laughed, I cried, I raged, I geeked out over stats, I soared through the sky on beetle wings. I discovered mystery and celebrated victory alongside my friends, and I made some memories I might never forget. The questionable design choices I complained about were deliberate risks which made the game into exactly what it is. They may have caused game balance to ultimately crash into a wall due to the ridiculous power creep involved, but the ride itself was completely worth it. I’ll give Terraria a 7 / 10. It may not last forever like some other sandbox games, but there’s too much here to discover and enjoy. If you haven’t played this game the way it is best played – with everyone starting from scratch at once, without overpowered friends doing everything for you – you’re missing out. Terraria is about the journey, not the destination.			"

												Classic story time, yippee skippy. Terraria is a classic veteran of my library that was originally given to me as a gift. Being the tasteless, unrefined scrublord that I was back in the day, I didn't understand the controls and the fact that ""E"" was not universally the use button. I then dismissed it and left it alone for 3 months before picking it up again. It was the best decision I had ever processed through my hormone-riddled child mind. Terraria is a beautifully crafted game that only aged well (so far, but in a game like this it's hard to mess up), like cheese to wine.PROS:+ Mother of Jesus I can have all this content and you're telling me I DON'T have to purchase DLC for it? You're telling me there is NO in-game purchases for self-entitled whiny brats? Oh Re-Logic, you lovable scamps you. Seriously marry me I have the ring in my back pocket and my front pockets and my trachea + Better than Minecraft in many different regards, and you don't even NEED to mod this game or be in 3D to experience it! Sure, lack of depth. Lack of environtment or whatever. Hope the sheer amount of gear and lack of the ""we sold this game to Microsoft"" smell compared to unmodded Minecraft doesn't mean jack to you.+ Virtually no bugs! Unless you go about searching them to report 'em and be a buzzkill/sincerely good person, playing the game normally shouldn't really cause any problems. Hey Skyrim, look at THIS game and tell me that it needs Unofficial Patches, eh?+ Customization is just oh. Gimme some'a dat. More costume items then you have chests for. Dyes in all colors of the rainbow (including rainbow). A recently-added feature that allows your trinkets to be shown visually on the player. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUY ANY OF IT.  Stop complaining TF2, Spiral Knights and Fashionogi, you got burned so hard dry ice is backing away in fear.CONS:- The griefing can be a real pain. This all depends on the moderation and quality of the server, however. Walking into a server, you can expect to see either a beautiful metropolis with almost all the real estate taken up, or a barren wasteland devoid of all asthetic wonders besides for dirt walls floating in the sky and some torches. Maybe a table. - Adding on to the whole griefing con, TNT and explosives in general. These simple blocks (and two ammo types) and throwable projectiles can WRECK near anything in the environment, which includes your house. Fortunately for you, most good servers come with some form of protection so that your house isn't raided and destroyed after 3 hours away. Or you could, y'know, share a house with someone else.In conclusion, Terraria is good. No, I'm serious. You read any of my reviews? This is normally a paragraph in itself. But whatever, TERRARIA IS GOOD. IT JUST IS OK TRUST ME I KNOW WHAT I'M KNOWING JESUS CHRI			"

												I don't feel like writing a big review, yet, I feel the need of reviewing it.PS: I am also a Minecraft player, but these two are way more different than you think! It is not Minecraft 2D!Terraria is a sandbox, crafting based, metroidvania, rpg, surviving, exploration game. You actually have to do something, a sort of ""campaign"".It's not only about surviving, because there isn't a hunger system, you could just build a small house and stay there forever.You want to be the best, you want to rule the world, you want to thrive.This is all about crafting and gather resources. The last one isn't easy, there are mobs waiting for you in caverns.The world is finite, and filled with danger. It is split in 2 parts (pre-mode and hardmode), both fun, different and with lots of things to do, to craft and to kill.Content: This game is now 5 years old! The developers are still updating the game with huge, FREE content patches, they never made us pay for a DLC, never once.PROS+ Vast amount of stuff, items, weapons, ores and enemies (near 3800 different items if I'm not mistaken)+ Amazingly balanced difficulty (you can do everything individually, no friends needed)+ Fun, hell yeah+ Multiplayer, bring your friends, if you have any+ Repeatability - I've started over again more times than I should+ Sandbox - It really is sandbox+ Addictive+ Free massive content updates!CONS- Dying can be frustating- You may give up early- The game might be too long and time consuming- Retro-style isn't for everyoneGreat game overall, I wish there was more games that hook me this much.

												Where can I begin. I first saw terraria when at a friends house. This was back before there was even hardmode in the game. I imideately fell in love. When I got home however, I soon forgot about terraria. Almost a full year passed and I one day I thought about it again. I decided to try to convince my parents to buy it for me. Terraria was on sale for 5 dollars at the time and was kind of a no brainer. BEST DECISION OF MY LIFE. Despite being on a potato system, I played the absolute ♥♥♥♥ out of this game. Fast foreward to 2016, I realized that I never wrote a review for this gameI rate 10,000 out of 10.Seriously just buy it. If i was told I needed to rebuy terraria, but it now cost 150 dollars I would still get it. This game is worth it.For less then 20, its a ♥♥♥♥ing steal			"

												Just when you think you have discovered everything, you realise you have only just started.... This game blows minecraft out of the water in my opinion. The music is well composed and is always changing depending on which biome you are in, unlike minecraft  the map is finite, yes... but the amount of content crammed into that island is just amazing. The weaponry and magic items are created with incredible imagination and a bit of twisted, demonic humour ( my favorite sword being named "" The demonic blood butcherer"") I even came across an enemy by the name of tim, a dark caster in a cavern. After a bit of research i confirmed my suspicions to tim being a reference to ""Tim the enchanter"" from Monty python and the holy grail. This game is an absolute 10/10, Great gameplay, Great music, and a fun twist of sadism. BEWARE THE FIRST BLOODMOON!!!!			"

												Oh gosh.Terraria. Ter-freaking-raria.Where do I begin?Well first off, I wish to write this because I LOVE this game. I also want to write this because I come across a lot of people who are like ""u r dum, minceraft iz bettr."" I even had a friend who, whenever I said the word Terraria, would correct me by saying ""You mean, 2D Minecraft."" Those are the people who probably haven't gotten past the spawning point. Yes, the basics of Terraria are rather comparable to Minecraft; you break trees, make a crafting station, build or dig a house, and go mining. Simple, right?That is, until you reach further into the game.This game gives you a reason to explore each biome. There's a massive variety of enemies, most of which drop specific items needed to make specific things. On that note, Terraria has over a hundred different enemies, while Minecraft only has a small handful. Most of Minecraft's mobs don't quite belong in a number of biomes either. I can understand spiders in jungles and forests, but not skeletons. Those belong in the desert (or underground where Terraria's skeletons spawn). When creating a home in Minecraft, the only thing that influences your opinion is your favorite biome. I tend to make homes in deserts because it's a lot easier to see and traverse. However, in Terraria it's a lot more than that. Each biome has its own unique music, as well as their own set of hazards. Here, I make my home in the basic forest biome because it has the easiest set of enemies. And, the trees are in the background and don't obnoxiously block your way or obscure your vision like Minecraft does. (If possible, in Minecraft I'd prefer to live on a mushroom island, which doesn't spawn hostile mobs and actually has a uniquely-spawning creature, Mooshrooms. But even those are so rare to find I don't even bother.)There's a ton of unique loot with each biome too. I know what you're thinking; Minecraft has jungle temples and desert pyramids as well. True, but I'm in no mood to trudge over vast lands just to find a jungle or desert that doesn't even have a darn temple because they're ridiculously rare. And even if I did find one, what's the point of looting nothing but bones and rotten flesh? The chance of finding gold, diamonds or emeralds in these chests is beyond incredible. Terraria's naturally-generated structures are guaranteed to spawn within the world, with the exception of the desert pyramid (but even that got an increase in spawn rate with a recent patch).I get it, Minecraft is full of dungeons and other things. I'll also admit that the loot you can find in dungeons and mineshafts is well-varied and has a good amount of surprise factor. I don't have a problem with mob spawners either. But it doesn't come close to the variety of Terraria's dungeons. Most biomes have an underground extension of themselves as well, each with their own different kinds of loot. Yes, a lot of items will generically spawn in any chest, like torches and coins. But each chest is guaranteed to have something of peculiar value; this could be an accessory, a new weapon, or potions (which are so ridiculously tedious to brew in Minecraft that my brewing stand is collecting dust). Furthermore, these special items also vary depending on the biome. Makes sense that I'd find an Ice Blade in the underground arctic. So like I said, while it's possible to get almost every good item in Minecraft while staying in a single biome, you need to explore almost every inch of Terraria's world to get the full adventure.Speaking of which: Terraria's sense of adventure is awesome. Each place you explore is always different from the last, with accompanying music to only add to the effect. One time, during my first playthrough in Terraria, as soon as I fell into the underground layer, out in the distance I could see the purple glow of Demonite through the darkness. As I stared at it, thinking ""what the heck is that...?"" the underground music started to play. In the trace-like part of the first few seconds of that music, a shiver went down my spine. I knew that this was going to be an awesome adventure. And let me tell you, it was. Exploring the cavern layer, raiding the Dungeon while fighting various angry skeletons, discovering shrines in the jungle and dying like a noob while trying to fly over the lava oceans in the underworld.The Dungeon has a huge sense of history. It has different walls, and different banners to indicate different legions that once inhabited the Dungeon. Only, there are still the average Angry Bones and Dungeon Slimes. Only after you defeat Plantera in Hardmode, a message will appear saying ""Screams echo from the Dungeon..."" Upon revisiting the Dungeon, there's a whole swarm of new enemies. As you learn, only specific types of enemies correspond to their different legions, only spawning within the walls of the legion they belong to. So basically, these centuries-old beings reappear because their angered souls are unable to be put to rest, causing them to haunt the Dungeon and attack you. And even after all this time of being undead, they still remain loyal to the legion they were a part of so long ago.Gulp, gulp... hold on, I'm drinking in all this atmosphere.You know what else I love about this game? The combat system. Yes, you start off with a really lame copper shortsword that does nothing but poke things. That's nothing compared to Minecraft's wooden sword, as the shortsword has an extremely limited range, and you can't really aim where to hit. You can also make a bow, just like in Minecraft. I will admit that Minecraft's bow makes more sense in the way that you have to charge it first before firing the arrow, while Terraria's bow can  fire every half second as long as you keep clicking. But Minecraft's combat just about stops there.I understand, even Terraria has simple upgrades of swords depending on what they're made of. However, many swords are different, such as the Muramasa and the Night's Edge. I'll also admit that most swords have the same functon; swinging around your character at varying speeds depending on the sword. But some of them have different effects. The Fiery Greatsword sets things on fire and glows brightly, helping to illuminate caves when you're out of torches. And others like the Enchanted Sword can fire a beam-like projectile, which can help if you're out of ammo on bows or guns.Oh yeah, that's right. This game has guns, by the way, and a multitude of different bullets, more of which are available the further you progress through the game. The same goes for arrows, because there's also a whole lot more than just a wooden bow. Once you make a repeater, which is a sharp upgrade to the standard bows, it makes sense to hold the mouse button and constantly fire arrows; because it's a machine, not a normal bow. Just as well, Terraria has a large amount of magic weapons, which are my personal favorite (Edit: Nope, Summoner weapons).Another thing, this game has so many challenging bosses. I know, Minecraft has some of its own as well. But the Wither is completely optional and nearly impossible to summon, and the Ender Dragon can only be fought by finding a Stronghold, which each world can only spawn three of, making it impossible to find. Terraria's bosses are usually in a set order as you progress, and they usually drop epic weapons... or items used to craft epic weapons.I just realized there's a character limit, so I'm gonna wrap this up now. Terraria is one of my favorite games ever, and it has succeeded where Minecraft has failed. I say it is certainly worth your money, especially since it's less than half of Minecraft's price. Some might say these games are too different from each other to be comparable. I've played Minecraft in its entirety as well. But if I had to choose, it'd be Terraria all the way.Why do I have to keep writing these walls of text?Just freaking buy it already. "

												This game is 2d side scroller meets minecraft meets rpg meets sandbox to say the least.But it is so much more.Instead of describing every little thing its best to just generalize the gameTheres basically 2 parts, pre-hardmode and hardmodepre-hardmode is the 1st part of the game consisting of semi-hard mobs, events, and bosses.hardmode is the 2nd part that you unlock after beating the 1st part. It contains alot tougher mobs, events, and bosses.Theres alot of different biomes, both above ground and underground. Each changes as you switch from one mode to the other.This game is pretty cool in both visuals and replay value.If anything, the 2-d aspect of this side scroller game gives it its unique and abstract appeal. This game is only as fun as your imagination allows you.The community is pretty decent too compared to other games.Theres a PC, Console, and Mobile version of the game, each with varying small details and unique mobs/bosses.PC obviously has the most content due to PC's handling more graphics and having more storage space and programs.Whoever, the mobile and console versions are just as good and i would highly recommend trying those out as well (i have all 3 versions)The fun isn't limited to just solo, playing it with friends is also an option, and is alot more fun. This game is pretty much done with updates (at least thats what i thought until they made the newest wire and mechanics update). Still, theres always the possiblity that they can add more content later on down the line. Still, with the current content its still pretty fun.***** 5/5 stars no question			"

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			"

												Terraria is the first and by far most polished game in 2D sandbox exploration/building genre.Aside from expected core concept of mining for resources and building your house or settlement, Terraria puts stronger emphasis on combat – particularly epic boss battles – than most other games of this genre. There are a lot of challenging bosses to fight, each with their own fighting style that requires specific tactical approach. And depending on how well you are equipped, regular enemies can pose a constant threat, especially in the areas that are meant to be hard. There is also a huge selection of weapons and magic spells (that act just like weapons, but require mana for each use) available to the player, most different from the others not just in damage they do, but in how they work in general. So the combat mechanics is very good when it comes to both enemies and the player.When it comes to environment, Terraria has a fair amount of different biomes, each of which is very well-designed with unique enemies, treasures and atmosphere. Terraria also has very interesting Corruption/Crimson/Hallow mechanics that is currently unique among the games of this genre. Corruption, Crimson and Hallow are biomes that spread over time, consuming other biomes, and keeping them contained (if you make it your goal) can be a real challenge in the Hardmode, where few things can halt these biomes’ growth.If you enjoy 2D sandbox exploration/building genre and somehow missed Terraria, you should most definitely give it a try! And if you haven’t played the games of this genre yet, Terraria is a solid choice to get familiar with it.			"

												So after 600+ hours, I figured I knew enough about the game, and I will say that it is a great game. It was a great experience learning new things for me and getting overpowered quick. The only thing that I really didn't like however, was that npc housing is very ""glitchy"" to say the least, but the game is incredibly creative for 2d, but I really don't like how certain methods of doing things can leave a very broken gameplay to say the least. Like certain weapons should be nerfed massively. I also tried the game out with several mods and enjoyed that as well.Overral GREAT game: so worth $10 spent.If you like sandbox and exploration games THIS GAME IS FOR YOU.10/10			"

												Terraria is one of my favorite games of all time!Graphics look very good. Every biome is colorful, looks different and overall looks very nice. And before you say it's pixelated i am not talking about resolution, i am talking about how it looks and is pleasing to the eye.Gameplay is more in a straight line. In Minecraft, you do what you want, but you follow a set path, iron, diamonds, nether.... In Terraria this is expanded even more, because of bosses, hard mode, and new ores.Controls are very good. This is a game that was meant to be played on PC, and it feels like it, which means playing with a controler is not recommended. Anyways, everything feels smooth, and the control will work in more peacefull situations, like building a house, and in boss fights and other times where fighting is a must.Another amazing thing about Terraria are the classes. If you play alone, you can use what you want, but you can adapt to one of the classes - melee, gunner or mage. This comes very helpfull in multiplayer, when in other games everyone wants the best weapons, here everyone plays with only weapons and armor of his class.There are also some bad things in Terraria. One thing is you can't have an infinite world. Don't get me wrong, if you select large world it is pretty large, but even then you can run out off chests, or you may not get that pyramid in your world which isn't very good. Luckily you can play with your character on other worlds, but you have to leave all of your structures from the other world.Another thing that can be stressfull is mining for ores, especially the end-game ores. To craft armor, you need around 50 ingots, and for every ingot you need 3-7 ores. This can take a long time, especially if you're playing multiplayer and everyone wants armor, but someone has to do other things than mining.The last bad thing is that items you can buy are very expensive, so you must make a gold farm, or sell all of your freshly mined ores to buy them.Overall, Terraria is a fantastic game and if you have time to play it, there shouldn't be many problems. And if you become bored of the random worlds, different biomes and play styles, there is also a ton of mods, or custom maps to try.TLDR:Terraria is a really well made 2D Sandbox game.If you like sandbox games, there is plenty of stuff to do, like building and decorating.If not, you can still go through the game, keep progressing, getting better equipement and defeating bosses.If you are interested in both of these, then Terraria is a game for you!

I have played every game in Terraria's genre and nothing comes close to being as good as Terraria. There is a reason it's the most rated game on Steam. Terraria is perfect for people that want to have a lot to do, but also is great for people that just want to express their creativity with building random stuff.Terraria Otherworld hasn't been announced for steam yet, so if you read this you should post on their forums for a steam release.

												While some people would call it a 2D version of minecraft. The fact that you mine ressources to fight some boss is where their similarities mainly end.While miencraft has much mor eemphasis on building large sculptures, structures and machines. Terraria focuses more on an RPG-esque style. With different fighting styles, armors and weapons to acommodate different playstyles as you go through thte game.With friends this game is really entertaining. You can sink hours into mining in the underground, building a haven and craft all sorts of items and weapons and gear to helpy ou on your adventure.The map is large, and the underground is massive with lots to explore. Unique locations and enemies specific to biomes and locations in the game.The game has so many things you can do that you can easily sink up to 100 hours into it as it stands. And even then coming back to it and do it all again with a new character with more friends, new ideas on how to play or even challenges can make the game even more fun as well.That being sad the game is not flawless. The crafting system is simplified compared to minecraft since you only need the materials and crafting station to make items. But there are so many recipes that it is easy to get lost.It is hard to tackle the game without using a wiki at the side, which can ruin the experience for some people, The expert mode is incredibly hard and sees you dying a lot so if you don't like that either the game is not for you either.The game's style is pixelart and feels a bit retro, which can turn people of as well. The soundtrack is relaxing and and shares a somewhat retro feel to it.The bosses are fun to fight against and provide challenges to overcome and preparing for them can be tedious while for some it adds more excitement to it.Finally playing with friends means that some of you will be undergeared throughout your playthrough which can be annyoign for those who aren't well geared. The only way to work around is too cheat (not condoned) or farm ressources for a very long time.Overall I'd say the game is worth your time. it is cheap and if you can play with friends it becomes an enjoyable experience. I personalyl feel like playing it in single player really makes you miss out on the fun. But it is relatively cheap so I say get it if you have a weekend to spend with your friends.			"

												Terraria is a sandbox, RPG, action, etc. 2D game. It does it's thing very well. I haven't noticed any UI bugs, or ones that I have, are fixed almost instantly after the patch is released. The gameplay it provides is not only smooth, it is addicting and fun. The combat system in the game is perfect for me, and a lot of others. There are so many enemy types in this game that are not copy paste, each one does their own thing and has their own weaknesses & strength's Example on the kind of enemies you could come across. Normal walking/running enemies, that have a soul objective to charge you until death. These may include enemies like the zombie or skeleton.As there are other enemies who will do the same thing, but in a different way (So not everything is copy/paste.). Like the slime enemy type, which come in many varieties, which will bounce towards you. Or the spider enemy type, which will walk on the ground, but can also climb on the walls to get to you quicker. Just to name a few.In the world of Terraria, there are alternate versions of almost everything. What I mean by this is, each world you have will not be the same. For example, there is a 50/50 chance when loading a world to have the default version of something, or the alternate. Such as the music that plays, there are different tracks for the same biomes, just depends on what random one you got. Or for textures on things like, grass, and trees. Also things like ore, in a default world you would have Copper as your basic ore, but in an alternate world, you'd have Tin as your basic ore. What this does is really expands the play time someone can spend in Terraria. Allowing a single person to play the game over and over, and never have the same experience. Below the surface are loads of blocks, dirts, ores, and more. Ore like Copper, Tin, Lead, Iron, Silver, Platinum, Gold, Cobalt, etc. And blocks like normal dirt, clay, stone, mud, cobwebs, and so many more. You need these ores to make your weapons and armor. You can find treasure deep underground, that holds many valuable things. You can increase your maximum health by finding Life Crystals underground.The weapon range in this game is massive. You even have magic weapons, like spell books, and mana weapons. There are also bows, swords, pickaxes, axes, guns, lazers, cannons, familiars, and so much more.PROS+Loads of content for hours of game time.+Great combat system.+Smooth gameplay, that's easy to slip into.+Provides a good challenge.+Fun and creative boss battles.+Amazing side events that you cannot resist.CONS-No infinite world option.-Still no easy way to download mods/texture packs.Overall rating: Is about a 14.5/15 (Must Own!)

												Terraria; the simple 2D sandbox game. Before you say it, this is NOT another Minecraft clone. There are 100s even 1000s of differences between the two games. If you're down for more than just building then Terraria is the game for you. Not only is it a sandbox mode game but it's filled with adventure. You start off by building your world and then you're slapped into this beautiful 2D world filled with flowers, trees, bunnies and more. You need to not only build a house to survive in but you need to build a house for NPCs to come to your world so that you can buy guns, bombs, get heals, etc. As you get more and more geared up you keep taking on more and more bosses. With the addition of the 1.3 patch a lot more content got added to Terraria so there's more to explore and more bosses to kill. You can even up the difficulty if you're up for a real challenge. If you love to be creative and have an amazing time adventureing then Terraria is the game for you. Terraria is a must have for ANY Steam user so why not buy the game for not only yourself but your friends. You won't regret it. You'll spend countless hours farming, building and adventuring all while you're in the good company of your friends- Insane amount of content- Great combat- Challenging bosses- Beautiful Soundtrack- Huge updates- Amazing art- Events (Pirates, Solar Eclipses, Slime Rain, etc)Final Verdict;10/10			"

More like 2D World of WarcraftTerraria offers many opportunities, if you are looking for a Hack and Slash type of game. The game is about getting better equipment, fighting monsters and beating bosses. This is nothing like Minecraft don't be mistaken, just in 2D building bases and other constructions looses its meaning. Terraria remind me of 2D World of Warcraft much more than Minecraft. There is a big potential in crafting system, but it is very confusing for new players, too many types of material and a huge scale of items that you don't even know what to do first, but luckily you don't need most of it - just give it enough time and you might more than like it. 6.5 /10 "

												Love this game so much. I bought it while it was on sale for $2.50 which is like less than the cost of a meal nowadays, but, as one can probably see, gave me many more hours of enjoyment than any meal could have. The amount of content and hours of enjoyment in this game make me feel it's worth well more than the full $9.99. There's something in here for everyone. If you like fighting, there's a large variety of weapons to choose from to defeat your enemies. Or you can be more like me and build systems of traps and summon minions to do all the killing for you. If you like creating stuff, there's tons of different building blocks and decorations and paint to make your creations beautiful. If you like destroying the world, EXPLOSIVES. If you like collecting pets, the bug catchers net will let you collect all the little critters in the game. And so on. Oh and there's Multiplayer for people that like that too, I don't really touch that much because I'm forever alone, but it's there!10/10			"

												This game has officially taken over my life. Solo or not, this game is awesome.If you like ""sandbox"" games, pixel graphic, dungeon exploration with rpg elements, you should try terraria.At first glance, Terraria seems to be a lackluster indie game with a clunky, confusing interface and a list of crafting options a mile wide.There is a lot to learn, that is for sure, but the game is so much fun. Once you've learned basics like what to do and what not to do and have found a few useful items to help you properly maneuver through the worlds of Terraria, you will likely find something that peaks your interest. Don't forget you are not bound to the ground!!I find something new in this game literally every day! Terraria never fails to amuse and surprise me, I highly recommend this game to anyone interested in building, landscaping, exploring dungeons, multi & single-player boss fights/mob fights, zombie survival, open-world sandbox!!

												This is one of the best 2D games I've played. Is it worth the money? Of course! I've had it for years and still enjoying it. This game has one of the best developers and the most awesome community, positive people and... well, if you get this game you'll see it yourself. Updates happen really often and all of them are really awesome.In Terraria you start off with barely any items and you have to progress into the game and make your way to the last boss, but it doesn't end there! Even when you defeat every event, invasion, boss, enemies, it is still not over. The game offers many challenges, you can come up with some of them yourself 'cause why not? When you're bored you can invite some of your friends and do the challenges together, you can choose to have a permanent char or a hardcore one, when you die the char is gone, there will always be a challenge for you.So if you've been playing for a while like me, the game still has stuff to offer you. You can build many awesome buildings, farm cool, rare and good lookin' items and show them off to your friends, make different characters with different loadouts and well... let's say you'll always have stuff to do. And! Even if you get bored from all of this, people make many different mods which you can install and experience new mobs, weapons, bosses, events and such, so you can never say that you fully defeated the game, there will always be stuff to do for you :) Enjoy the game.

												Many people like to compare this game to the worldwide famous sandbox that is Minecraft. They generally quote ""Minecraft 2D clone"" and such, however, Terraria is nothing like Minecraft in its diverse crafting world and gameplay.Terraria is more or less based on epic boss fights, advancing into the game further, and amazing fights against mobs of enemies  in the ground, sky, overworld, and hell. The enemies vary greatly and each have their own special rare drops and common drops, such as money, which is used to buy from the various merchants that exist around the world. We'll get into merchants later. But now, let's dive into Terraria a bit more.Terraria has an astounding amount of gear, armor, weapons, and items that are used to craft boss summoning items and whatnot. The crafting system and just how diverse the item structure in this game never ceases to astound me. The player starts out with a set of tools - shortsword, axe, and a pickaxe - and lets them explore the world of Terraria. There is a guide NPC, however, who will help the player throughout the game, so the player is not jumping into an unknown world, but generally, you get to explore on your own. Oh. Don't worry. When you die, you lose only your money, unless you decide to change the settings of your character. After your familiarize yourself with the system, you further advance into the game by upgrading your armor and tools. Some special items are bought from merchants, which are unlocked by obtaining the different items they carry (finding bombs unlocks the Demolitionist, and finding ammunition unlocks the Arms Dealer, etc.), and building homes for them to live in. Items are purchased from these merchants with money dropped from enemies. More money is found from defeating tougher enemies that are found farther underground, and harder enemies are fought when Hardmore is unlocked by defeating the special boss in hell. Afterward, more and more enemies, bosses, and items are unlocked throughout the game and the player is free to explore and advance further. There's too much content to talk about in a review, you'll just have to check it out yourself.The only bad thing about Terraria is when you finally defeat the ending boss and obtain all his possible loot. Then there does not seem to be a purpose to playing it further. However, there are a few more updates that are supposed to come out before Redigit works on Terraria 2.Overall, Teraria is more for the adventurous type of pixelated player. But don't listen to me continue rambling on! What are you waiting for? Buy the game already!			"

												:|: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED :|:I enjoy Terraria for  many  different reasons.  (The updates are free)  Everything you see is destructible, which is fantastic! I love landscaping the worlds, and building awesome housing for my NPCs. It's exciting to break through a wall I could not get through before, because I didn't have the right gear/powder to remove that tier of material. The more you explore, the better equipment you can craft or  find . As well as discovering underground biomes you didn't even know the game had , and recreating them in a different location to harvest the materials or just decorate with !However, I would have to say the main reasonI like Terraria is that it's one of the most evolving games I have ever played. I started playing it shortly after release on my boyfriend's account and enjoyed it, yet felt many things just... weren't quite right. I quit for a little while because Oblivion and Skyrim had completely captured my gaming interests at that moment, and the PS3 controller is just so much easier to use. This last year I began playing more Terraria, and really I like what the developers have done with the game. It took a lot of time to adjust, and a lot of research into what had changed and how to properly manipulate everything (which I still have yet to do, but look forward to).There is a lot to learn, that is for sure, but the game is so much fun. Once you've read through a few  short, well written guides (or intro videos, easliy found online), and have found a few useful items to help you properly maneuver through the worlds of Terraria, you will likely find something that peaks your interest. Don't forget you are  not bound to the ground , there are Flying Carpets, Clouds/Storms in a Bottle, Umbrellas and Balloons that help you  fly  , as well as Wings later on . There are many goals in the game, but no exact order to complete them in. In every tier there are better materials to build & craft with & more dangerous playing areas available to you.I find something new in this game literally every day! Terraria never fails to amuse and surprise me, I highly recommend this game to anyone interested in building, landscaping, exploring dungeons, multi & single-player boss fights/mob fights, random world generaters, zombie survival, open-world sandboxes... or pretty much anything!  EVERYONE SHOULD BUY THIS GAME! It's worth the price, and often goes on sale.  "

												Terraria is an indie game for PC, console, and mobile devices. It was one of the first game to be inspired by Minecraft. As in Minecraft, you explore a randomly-generated world of blocks. Monsters lurk around every corner, and the only way to get ahead is by crafting more powerful items. You can explore alone or with friends, and in the course of play you'll discover a strange fantasy world of peril and wonder. This does make for a much simpler game world. But it also serves to streamline a lot of the frustrating aspects of Minecraft. One of the most stressful things about Minecraft is the way that monsters can sneak up on you, as you have a first person veiw. With flat, 2D graphics, you can see all of your enemies out to get you at a glance. One thing I also enjoyed is that items don't wear out. Although I haven't played much Minecraft myself, things wearing out after you've spent hours finding resources to craft them, doesn't sound so fun. You're even given some tools right at the beginning to start off with.Crafting options appear automatically when you have the necessary resources. When you first start out, there's a NPC standing next you who serves a guide. Talk to him, and he'll give you some basic instructions to get started. They don't expect you to trawl the wiki just to figure out what's going on. You can build houses, and fit them out with chairs, tables, and other accessories. Expanding your home is a big requirement for progression,  If you build extra rooms on your house, NPCs will spawn, selling items, and helping you along your journey.The more you progress, the tougher enemies become. The only way to cope with these ever-increasing threats is by upgrading all your gear, and it's this challenge that makes up most of the game. Your doesn't wear out, but there are so many weapon classes, and there's always just one more upgrade to buy. The world and enemies are amazing, you really do feel compelled to explore. There are so many different treasures and surprises to find.In Minecraft, and other games similar, you often reach a point where you run out things to do. Terraria fixes that problem by including bigger and bigger enemies, and more and more cool weapons to take them down. I loved how there are so many items and weapon classes, even if some of them are a bit useless. You feel like you're exploring a real place, and figuring out how everything works in this world is part of the charm. I'm not sure if I have the patience to keep burrowing until I'm crafting my own laser guns, however this game will keep you entertained for hours. The game is decently priced, and often goes on sale. With how much you get with this game, such as Steam Trading cards, Steam achievments, (Also the option to save worlds & characters to the Steam Cloud), this game offers many enjoyable hours of single player, co-op and multiplayer, and is definitely deserving a 9/10.

IntroductionI've played this game before on another steam account i had. When i was playing it, i thought Terraria is a boring game and i thought it is really bad game because i did not know what to do and i did not have a friend who can teach me how to play. I have got a friend who played Terraria like 120 hours and we are playing together. He is teaching me how to play this game, how to craft things etc. It is good to have a friend who can play with you and who can teach you.PerformanceMy laptop has got i7 2640M CPU, 8 GB Ram, Intel HD Graphics 3000 GPU and i can play this game without any problems, which is good in my opinion. I was not expecting to have any problems due to how the game looks and i was right. I am playing this game on stable 60 fps.I learnt that this game has got lot of bosses etc so if you think that you can beat the game in a short time, you are wrong. This game is really good game actually and i'm having fun because i am learning how to play and i am playing with my friend. My recommendation to you, is don't buy this game unless you have got someone to teach and someone to play with. I also learnt that you can create what ever you want. Which is good.Fishing is one of the things you should do because you get crates to unlock and you get things to sell. If you go to fishing at night, you will have more chance of getting something good (my friend told me something like that)This game is a little bit hard at the beginning but once you get items (armors, weapons etc) everything will be easier. You will be able to kill bosses etc faster, you will be able to fly which will make climbing and similar things easier. I hope you guys understand what i am trying to say.ConclusionTerraria is a really good game that you can play alone or with your friends. I recommend you to play with one of your friend that knows how to play. Why? Because he can teach you how to play. If you do not have a friend who knows but you want to play, then still buy it. You can learn by playing yourself or with your friend.Score: 10/10 "

												Let your creativity let loose! :DTerraria is a game that requires learning in the initial hours, because after you create your character and world, you will be unaware of the dangers that'll come in the following night. The guide may hint you torwards your next objective in the some what obscure story. You progress by collecting new weapons and armor and defeating bosses but the real game starts  when you use your creativity to make buildings, monuments and just about anything the 2D universe can allow.Apart from being a procedural sandbox, this game is also a deep and intricated RPG. There is a vast number weapons, armor, potions etc. to be crafted, found or bought, which helps you fight off various and colorful enemies, mobs and bosses. By progressing through the 'story', you get access to new items, blocks, weapons and armor to play with.There is also multiplayer which allows for PvP and PvE modes, but the IP based connection may take a long time to initiate a game online. I would have enjoyed it more if there was a steamworks integration.Since it's release in May 2011, the game has recieved many updates that have not only made the game more accessable but also added tons and tons of new items to play  with. So the conclusion would be is - If you  love sandbox games, adventure games,RPGs , online games , 2D games - then this game is definitely for you. If you do not like those kind of games then you should definitely give it a try :) My rating is a 9/10			"

												While i was hesitant to pick up this game at first, it has provin to be very enjoyable.The first time i played it I was.... less then interested.Terraria is not very intuative. And I found myself wondering how to do the simplest of things.It took a while for me to get into the mechanics of the game. But after the initial noob phase I was starting to enjoy myself. I found that (and this is my personal opinion) Terraria is a lot more fun if you have someone to play with, Even if it's just every once in a while to keep things fresh and new. (and to help tackle those pesky bosses)Now with nearly 200+ hours into the game I still find myself starting it up and seeing what trouble I can get into, what new things I can build, and secrets I can discover.+edited for correct spelling+Review Update. 11/24/2016And now with the new content update theres even more fun to be had by new players and veterans alike.

												For me, Terraria is a 2D Adventure-Story game. You start off as a simple human, overcoming many obsacles, until you can be the best dark or light magician spawning creatures to fight for you, or have the best sword currently in the game and slash stuff and be the king. You can choose your way in many ways. You can build, kill and even dig stuff. It doesn't have sotry elements, but killing the bosses one after another makes me do that by myself. The best part is this game is now alive again. It has had many updates since 1.2 which was the biggest update ever.Music - Awesome, suits the game in many ways. Favorite: Underground Mushroom Biome.Graphics - Very awesome, pixelated in a good way, the game looks much nicer in pixels than 1080p non-pixelated graphics.World Design - The backrounds are awesome as well as interacting with the world (breaking objects) makes you feel inside it.A.I. - The enemies are not stupid at all, they can see you. Amazing too.There's no story or cutscenes, because it doesn't need to. It's too much awesomeness for a game. If you're looking to buy it, please, check the 1.2 trailer on this page and you will change your mind.Terraria. Awesome game to spend your time, but better with friends.A masterpiece without the need of next-gen graphics.                                  10/10			"

4.5 out of 5If you told me a year ago, I'd be playing (and thoroughly enjoying) a game where you have to dig dirt for hours, I'd call you bonkers.And yet here it is, the simplest but most addictive 2D sandbox that Steam has to offer. Actually simplest maybe a stretch, granted the game is at first easy to learn, but to actually advance in the game you're going to need a wiki open every five seconds...but that's not necessarily a bad thing, it just proves just how much depth this game has to offer.In short, I would recommend this to anyone who loves games.

												Terraria is a fun 2D game where you create your own character and explore your world. You can craft items to help you survive, battle, or build. The game is centered on defeating several tough bosses, ranging from somewhat spooky such as the giant mechanical skull, Skeletron Prime, or just silly, like the incredibly large shark/fish Duke Fishron. In order to prepare to fight these bosses, the player must find materials to craft their own gear. They'll go from makeshift wooden armor to the fabled Hallowed Armor, earning and finding weapons on the way. The game has violence in it which most of the time cannot be avoided. Finding some materials and sometimes just surviving means defending yourself against monsters small and large, ranging from floating eyeballs to surprisingly dangerous unicorns. When killed, enemies can splat pixelated blood that isn't very realistic. Most children and almost all teens can handle this. While not supposed to be a learning game, it does have some learning aspects, such as logical thinking. If I want to craft this sword, what items are most likely to make it? Besides that, it's not too inappropriate. The only other thing inappropriate in the game is that the player can craft a keg and brew their own ale and get an effect on their character called ""tipsy."" Besides this, I'd say it's good for anyone with a passion for adventure			"

												The only problem with Terraria is that the multiplayer conectivity is not as easy as you might think. The creators should make an easier system to host and play with friends online. Other than that, great game with a lot of awesome stuff. HARD at first, but not boring as many people say. The problem with most of the reviews is that people focuses on graphics and things that are not really gameplay issues.			"

												I have to say that this game amazes me technically much more than all these AAA games with photorealistic 3D graphics -- a huge world, lots of content with tons of weapons, monsters, and mobility options working in different ways. Especially that in these AAA games the world cannot be changed in any way (no destructible terrain), and they even look all the same, and in Terraria you can dig or build wherever you want, liquids are flowing, mushrooms and corruption are spreading, and so on... (Probably especially amazing in multiplayer, although I have not tried that.)The gameplay (which could be described as a platformer/sandbox hybrid -- thus, for example, you can design arenas yourself, so that you fight the bosses in a location which gives you an advantage) is very good. There are some minor design flaws, though. I dislike games where the inventory space is limited -- they are neither realistic nor fun, they only annoy the player without making the game more interesting or fun in any way (there are games when inventory limit does benefit the gameplay, like in DoomRL, Brogue or Hydra Slayer, but often this feature seems to be added without any reason). This is especially bad in Terraria, because you typically gather lots of useful crafting ingredients from each trip. It might be good for the gameplay that you have only a limited space for weapons and potions (and thus you have to plan what to take for your next fight), but I think the game would be more fun if we could collect loot without having to think about the inventory limits -- a separate limited inventory for battles, and infinite inventory for loot (which could not be used during a battle) would solve this. Another minor flaw is grinding: doing boring stuff in order to gather resources necessary to beat your next challenge is a waste of time. Some grinding is fine, but I think I would have more fun without having to go through the Lunar Cultist and all the Celestial Towers again after failing the Moon Lord fight, or having to mine for chlorophyte again and again, or waiting for the day/night to proceed, or having to spend lots of time to find rare items.

												This game is one to be remembered. With full engaged Battles, PvP, and Online capability. This game allows you to build and create to your hearts content. Meny things to explore, meny Battles to be fought and things to discovered. this game covers all ends of what we love and enjoy. In my opinion this game was remembered for its enhanced music and memrable bosses. including the enemies. Meny weapons the we love and enjoy, such as the Star Fury, Blade of Grass, Sunfury, Magic Missle and the harpoon luncher.

												When I first got this game on release I had very little interest in playing it.It had potential, but it wasn't very fun solo.Now, however?  After a couple years and much patching, Terraria has gone from a game with promise to a game with fully realized potential.  It features an in-depth, extensive crafting system that allows for both cosmetic and practical items.  No resources you gather are useless - you can make something out of nearly anything.  Combat is challenging and very fun.  A variety of weapons - both crafted and dropped by enemies- allows for every combat playstyle.  Yoyos? No problem. Swords? Sure. Boomerangs? You got it. Spells? Duh.  The armor and weapons that you progressively acquire really give you a good sense of achievement as you continue on through the game.Although I have found myself getting frustrated and rage quitting on some nights, the difficulty of the game only makes it more addicting.  I just keep finding myself being pulled back into the game despite dying several times in one night (depending on the activity I'm trying to participate in). Boss fights are fun and diverse, and the bosses all have really neat visual designs.  Building structures is a source of never-ending entertainment, and many different styles of building tiles are available.  The tools that are available later on in the game really add a nice touch.

												Terraria, this game may not be Crysis or Battlefield but its take on a quriky colourful art style makes it enjoyable to look at! The game can not be compared to Minecraft as it is hugely different. Terraria was the foundation for Minecraft. People who support Minecraft are just fanboys who are to afraid to admit when there precious game is beaten. Anyway enough of Minecraft I'm here to review Terraria. Straight away as you launch this game you will realise that it is not a building game and focuses on adventuring instead. There are hundreds of Boss Battles and adventuring to be had in this game. The buidling is still fun and enjoyable though so don't be put off! The Multiplayer is really fun and building and surviving with friends is where the game really shines with friends. If you haven't got this game I encourage you to pick it up wheter if it is on sale or you choose to purchase it for the $10 its worth it.			"

												*As of version 1.2.3*Terraria is one of the best selling games in the Steam store and it came out 2011.All you do is well kinda like Minecraft, mine, craft and fight but its in 2-D.Re-Logic knew that Minecraft was boring to most people and that the mobs were just to simple to kill so they decided to make a crap ton of enemies that go through walls, shoot at you, teleport to you and you know what, thats AMAZING. There is over 100 enemies to fight and there is over 10 bosses to fight so they will bring the difficult up.If you didnt notice already but if you questioned who is that girl staring at the bunny beside these words well she is the Dryad who sells nature-like things like a dirt rod, a magical rod which you can move dirt (useless). There are over 20 NPC but only 19 NPC can be in 1 world (i dont know why but go with it) and if you want them to spawn, you must complete a certain objective which you gotta ask the guide which is beside you when you 1st enter a new world. Once you completed the objective, you have to build a house thats 6X6 with a door,table,chair,walls, and a `light source`.There is a LOT of weapons to find categorized from ranged to melee and magic to summons.It is recommended that you make at least a wooden sword during your 1st play. Many of the items can be found by killing a mob. NOTE: the Slime Staff is currently the hardest item from a mob (1/10,000) and it can be dropped from the most common enemy in the game, a slime. 60% the items you need are dropped from enemies and if i were you, watch out for mimics, for they are desguised as chests but if your near the chest it will expose and lunge at you with its teeth.As you progress through the game you will need armor which if you wear a full set,you get a set bonus which is really helpful.Theres 1 problem about multiplayer and that is when you play on a new world server, many people tend to hide items that they arent suppose to have, either their too scared to actually leave their good stuff that they didnt get leget or they wanna be idiots by playing the game cheap.I give this game 9 out of 10 due to the popularity and the little greifers in the Terraria community.

												Terraria is very fun 2D adventure game that can easily give you more than 50 hours of enjoyable gameplay. In Terraria you have various types of weapons and enemies from banana boomerang to lightsabers and from a deadly jellyfish to a clown that throws bombs.Sadly after you get the best gear it starts to feel bit boring as the enemy feels too easy to defeat. Overall I suggest giving this game a try.			"

												Awesome game, and a dream come true for many of us.People call this a 2D Minecraft, and while that can be fair, it mainly means to revisit old games from the 2D sidescrolling era. This includes game like Metroid, Castlevania, Adventures of Link -- to name a few.There are a lot of games coming out that try to do what Terraria does, but I find Re-logic to have them all beat. It's hard to beat a team that constantly pushes out awesome updates with new mechanics (Wiring, fishing, minecarts, quests, mounts, endgame content, and so on).			"

												Notable features:*Like a hundred weapons or something*Sound effects*Hardcore mode for those who like eternal torment*A hoverboard*A puppy*More puns than you could shake a slime at*Extremely accurate dirt physics*BeesI've spent at least 300 hours on Terraria (242 on record, but we all know how accurate that is) and darn if I don't keep coming back. Endgame is now more challenging than ever with the 'Moon events, and co-op is quick to set up if you'd rather dig/fight/explore/build with a partner or three. With lots of replayability due to the sheer amount of content in the game paired with the randomly generated worlds, this title will keep you coming back for more. At the time of writing this there are even more content updates planned. If you're one of the four people in the world that hasn't already bought Terraria, I would highly suggest you do. (If you're waiting for Starbound to be less messy and unpolished, I find Terraria works wonders as well.)			"

												This one looks kind of repulsive, does it not? However do not judge book by its cover. Behind the almost ugly, square like face of Terraria lies humungous world filled with adventure. Craft your own equipment and set to explore many underground layers, called biomes, each with their unique set of creatures. Gear up and face different bosses to get your hand on more exclusive materials and eventually face the final boss to push the difficulty to another level by unlocking hardmod.On second look even the graphics are not as bad as they seemed. Sure they are simplistic and really ""squary"", but when everything gets put together the image can get quite amazing, considering we are dealing with kind of a pixelart. Some sceneries are really rather breathtaking and stretch your imagination to its limits.In the end it is your imagination that is going to decide whether you are going to like Terraria or not, because the game is about putting IT to use in the first place. The adventures are only half of the game, the other half is about building whatever you can imagine and the potential of the game is almost limitless. Are you up to the task?			"

												Terraria, while many who haven't played it believe it to be a minecraft knock-off, is actually so much more fun in my opinon for the giant amount of enemies, craftable weapons and armour and most importantly the boss fights which need to be prepared for because of the difficulty. Terraria was the first game I ever bought on steam last year and I still enjoy playing it with friends because of its hack and slash feel as well as tactics being involved in order to have the upper hand over the enemy.

												Terraria is an exploration platformer developed by Re-Logic (Headed by Andrew ""Redigit"" Spinks and Jeremy ""Blue"" Guerrette) in March 2011. The game went through multiple updates ever since then, first culminating in the 1.1 release of December 2011 before developement ceased in February 2012. In April 2013, development continued with a promised 1.2 update that was released October 1st 2013. The game is availible on Valve's Steam platform and a console version released by 505 Studios around late 2012 is availible on Xbox Live Arcade and Playstation Network.Gameplay: Gameplay is focused on a 2D side-scrolling playing field. Players initially start out with gathering wood from trees to erect a basic shelter for the first night. This may sound similar to Mojang AB's Minecraft but Terraria makes a more exploration turn. Even while mining, players can find underground treasure chests with unique items, accessories. Fighting your first boss of the game is where Terraria truly shows it's not any sort of Minecraft clone (even when people claims it is, Markus ""Notch"" Perrson supports the game). Players also delve into the corruption or crimson to fight the nasties hidden, a dungeon filled with skeletons, an expansive underground jungle buzzing with hornets and even beehives and the lava filled underworld as well. Even after beating a strong monster in the underworld, there's still a massive amount of content ahead that I should probably not go into detail of it all, as tempting as it is.Graphics: The graphics are appealing, much like an old SNES side-scroller along with some neat effects such as flames, smoke, rain and snow and despite it's almost cute style, it manages to be scary at the same time.Sounds & Music: The sounds are simplistic but very effective such as tinks of mining stone or using your inventory. Meanwhile the music is composed by Scott Lloyd Shelly. The soundtrack in it's 2011 days were quite limited (Title, Day, Night, Cave, Boss, Eerie) before we got more varied soundtracks come 1.1 and then even more varied music in 1.2, some of it brought over from the Console version.Goods: Very addictive that can have you playing for hours on end (if five ingame day cycles pass, you've played for two hours because that's 120 minutes). Adventurous, fun to play with friends.Bads: Some of the longetivity is caused by enemy drop rates being so low (for example, one is 0.025%) making some of the gameplay just simply killing enemies in the same general area for a hard to get item. It's also frustrating dying to a boss.Overall: It's cheap. Buy it. It's worth it.			"

												There are many many many sandbox games out there and as we all know sandbox can get boring after a little while, BUT!!!!! Terraria is different.Terraria gets you hooked the first 3 nights and makes you really look at the depth of how much stuff is out there. Tons of different armor and weapons. Hundreds of different blocks. And countless enemies to fight as darkness approaches.After a while you start getting into routine. ""Chop wood, build up house, kill slimes, explore caves..."" And when you think it gets even a little boring a message appears on your screen. ""You feel an evil presence watching you..."" Then as you are wondering what the heck that meant it attacks you unexpectantly...Bosses in sandbox games are somewhat hard to make because of the free realm and no story but Terraria does an amazing job incorporating multiple bosses that differ in difficulty to this is a challenge to IMPOSSIBLE!!!! Good job Guys!!!11/10			"

												Much like the Ford Transit, Terraria offers multipe choices including the 3.7-liter V-6, a 3.5-liter twin-turbo V-6, and a new 3.2-liter turbodiesel inline-five. It can contain up to 487 cubic feet of cargo space which is 75% more than in the largest E-series. Terraria might not look pretty, but with its combination of utility, fuel efficiency, and cabin comfort, I expect its customers will find it shines from within.On a more personal level, I while I find magic to be the most fun approach, it did make some boss fight like the Golem laughably easy.In short, I rank Terraria as number one Full-size Van, just slightly above the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter.

												Whenever I think of writing a review for that certain game, I cannot avoid thinking of that certain game, and when I do, I end up playing that certain game and have no time for writing a review.I was only able to write this because I wasn't trying to write a review and thus could avoid thinking of that certain game.Joking aside, this game has a rewarding progression tightly intertwined with lots of creative freedom, and that's what made me surprise myself with liking this game so much. I'd not call myself a devoted gamer anymore these days, yet Terraria managed to keep me interested for hundreds of hours.It also has a difficulty progression that can not easily like in many MMOs be solved through outleveling, since there are no levels. At a certain point an unskilled player might gently bump into a difficulty barrier that poses a real challenge to overcome. The amount of preparation one might have to do for certain bosses would prompt Witcher Geralt to call you insane. ;-D But that's part of the game's interesting character.But if you can't overcome some challenges, the game is still great. You don't miss anything if you don't manage to defeat that last boss or such. Or you could also get some allies and try your luck that way.Patch 1.3 made many things even better. My personal favorite is the *ka-ching* of coin pickups.And the conveyor belts added with 1.3.1 are a delight, too.If I really try to find downsides to point out, it would be this:- Very resolution-dependent game. Higher res enlarges visible area. 1920x1080 (or x1200) is maximum. I personally prefer(red) 1280x720 so stuff isn't so small, but the game is technically problematic and if windows are open in the background and you play the game in full screen, it might resize them; cut them down to the game resolution, which is very annoying. Also, when you change the resolution in fullscreen and confirm, it doesn't change it. You have to switch to window and back to fullscreen to make it work.- UI use (e.g. item management and use), although somewhat improved, is still a bit too complicated for the amount of materials you'll accumulate after a while.Still not convinced? Then let me tell you what I did the other day: I saved the tormented soul of a tax collector in hell only to dowse him in lava and take his cane before it could melt.Good times. :-)Ever since I play Terraria I get more sextants.UPDATE: Not playing anymore because dev company ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off.

Terraria, 6 tool levels, copper/tin, iron/lead, silver/tungsten, gold/platinum, Nightmare, Hellstone, Thats six right there. but then theres hardmode, 9 tool levels, cobalt/palladium, mythril/orichalcom, adamtite/titanium, Hallow, Chlorophyte, Spectre, Shroomite, Lunar Event (Solar, Vortex, Nebula, Stardust) Lunar (Luminite)    All in all, Terraria has 15 tool levels, 3 times as much as Minecraft if you dont count wood as an ""ore"". So it takes much longer to beat, but it seems to me to have a much better replay value			"

												Only ever played singleplayer without fighting bosses, but really enjoyed it. I like the simplicity and pacing, slowly getting stronger as you establish a little home and craft some stronger tools, expanding your knowledge of the game and collecting useful items as you explore the land and mine underground. The music is fitting, and the game itself is well made. There's plenty of depth to it offering more gameplay in multiplayer and boss fighting that I haven't even tapped into yet.			"

												You're gonna dig this game. Literally.It has a great game vintage look and a very pleasing soundtrack, which is a very important part of a vintage game.It takes you back to the SNES games. It provides you that arcade fun that a fast paced game always delivers but at the same time, if you are that other kind of player, the one who really digs into the game, it can be something else for you.It can be very detailed on many levels since it provides you discovery, adventure, defense, building and organizing.It's not just a pretty game. It's really relaxing and makes you feel lonely, but the good kind of loneliness. The one we're all looking for in a discovery game in a big area to explore and make it your way.Playing with friends is also great but not mandatory. Still Multiplayer works very well and it's pretty simple to set things up.Wether you want to spend time or be a great explorer, Terraria delivers what a game of its genre promises. With an addendum: Beautifully.			"

												Awesome game!Given it might not look much but you will feel its elegance after you've played it.It's like minecraft in 2D except:Fighting is more emphasized in Terraria.First night time if you're caught unprepared might turn out ugly quick.It has more bosses than minecraft.More events than minecraft. (I don't think vanilla minecraft even has events like mob rain [correct me if i'm wrong coz I haven't played minecraft for a long time])Building is ok, Most of the time you build houses for your NPC's.NPC are limited yet more memorable than villagers in minecraft. (that's given)Crafting is substantial, there are lots of things to craft.There are also a lot of furnitures and accessorial blocks even a block of smore and a block of cloud. lol.Automation is ok. but I think minecraft redstone builds are better.You have mounts and wings!Guns!Chainsaws!Drills!and many more!I'm not saying that this game is better than minecraft but it's a really good game!Lucky for you if you get it on sale, but even without a sale it's cheaper than most games out there.grab it to have MAXIMUM FUN!

												Terraria is one of those games when you play it, you know the Devs were passionate about. This game is awesome. Every time I look up there is an update, bug fixes, etc... Lots to do and totally has lots of replay value of any game I've played in the last two years. If you haven't played it, what are you waiting on? 10/10.			"

												Terraria is a great adventure, one of the best sandbox games around, and an absolute steal for ten bucks on Steam. It's well worth checking out for anyone, regardless of how they feel about Minecraft. Despite having one fewer dimension, Terraria hides greater depth than its 3D cousin.			"

												I still say that eight bit is a big upgrade over seven bit, and worth every penny.Grab your yoyo, because Irreverend Opinions is taking a spin in Terraria!---The BlurbA 2D, 8-bit sandbox game with endgame content, fully editable terrain, and plenty of content.  Terraria promises quite a substantial amount, and then delivers.The GoodThe graphics are 8-bit, but not 'cheap', with quite a bit of effort having been taken for the way things appear despite the low resolution.  Character customization is substantial, allowing for players to define who they want to appear as quickly and easily.Audio is decent, though the musical score may get repetitive after a time, cycling through different tracks for day and night, as well as for the different zones; night time deserts have a different sound to daylit jungles, to the Corruption in the rain, to the Hallow, etc.Equipment is varied and expansive, with an incredible number of tasks that a player can take, and tools to cover them.  A player could play as a gun-toting ninja dungeon raider, a demon-summoning architect of marble towers, a bee hunter, a fishing enthusiast, and more.At it's core, Terraria is about exploration, and covers this with an exhaustive terrain palette, with distinct features that prevent each zone from being a cut-out copy with different color hues.  Ice is slippery, sand falls when there's nothing to support it, jungles have thorns, etc.Exploring through caverns and tunnels is pleasantly alternating, allowing for players to traverse marble halls, granite caverns, lava pits, and more.  Treasure can be found in the form of minerals to craft tools from, unique stones to build with, lost chests of gold and equipment, plants to grow, and more.  As the game progresses, changes can occur to allow the player a chance at exploring new environments that are opened with the death of a particular boss, for example.Combat styles can be broken down into a number of equally-viable groups; yoyos (thanks to their partnership with One Drop Yoyos[onedropyoyos.com]), boomerangs, summons, swords, spears, bows, chainsaws, guns, flails, bombs, spells, and crossbows.  Pickaxes, hammers, and other tools are typically less viable for combat, but can still be used in a pinch.  Different weapons allow for alternate approaches to battle, and may give benefits such as heavy knockback, lazers flying off per swing, and so forth.Monsters are diverse, from the standard 'charge in and hit' to ranged attackers, spellcasters that can teleport, flying and burrowing brawlers, debuff and damage-over-time specialists, summoners, and more.  The AI typically has monsters seeking you despite all situations, though some will run when on low health, some will stop to collect treasure, and similar.Bosses are neither standardized nor just 'harder hitting normal monsters', giving a range of single-target juggernauts, multi-target swarms, bullet-hells, and brutes for players to try whittling down, or grouping up to fight together.  Rewards typically measure up to the challenge that has been overcome, allowing for a sense of progression through the game.Construction is quite in-depth, allowing players to complete projects of giant, labyrinthine towers with a lava-filled ""eye a la Sauron"", or sprawling castles, or farming fields, and more.  A set of simple 'mechanical' tools allow for some forms of automation, and enough different forms of material texture exist to allow a discerning builder immense free reign for their expression.Setting up a server to host a multiplayer game is exceptionally simple, both for ""while online"" and ""long-running"" server styles.  Resource usage is noticeably low, allowing players to enjoy their own server without fear of disconnecting friends from half a globe away, though latency does tend to parse poorly in transcontinental multiplayer.  PvP is possible in duel, free-for-all, and team-based combat, with items spattered through that can be used for competitive games akin to variations of 'capture the flag'.Developers are both friendly and active, having made numerous updates to the game project, including cross-referencing it to their other games.The BadWhile varied, the music selection per zone is limited, so staying put for something (like construction) can lead to the sound getting quite repetitive.A steep learning curve for new players, though mitigated by a helpful 'guide' who can tell you what you can build from materials you have.Despite the wide variety of textures and models, typically weapons, armor, and tools tend to homogenize at the top tier of play, neutralizing the customization on offer.Merciless with difficulty increases (such as the hardmode plateau), which can put off players who are easily discouraged.The UglyPlayers have no choice as to taking part in certain boss fights; various bosses will spontaneously spawn and attack regardless of player activity, location, or readiness.Bosses can appear at the player spawn point, allowing them to repeatedly kill players as they enter game.SuggestionsThe developers seem to actually pay attention to their customers, and have a steady update queue.  So, can't really say much for suggestion that the team doesn't already tackle.Perhaps linking the boss spawns to a certain gear score and/or time playing.  New players will be put off by finding that they just purchased a spawn-camping simulator.The SummaryEminently playable, more fun with friends.  8/10.---If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group "

												I used to play with Lego a lot as a child. Just, piles and piles of the stuff, and I'd build things which, to be honest with myself, were probably quite rubbish. But I lost myself in these worlds, where the possibilities were endless and I could keep playing and playing and playing...As I grew older, life started hitting back. My Lego got dusty. There were moments, when younger family came round, when the Lego would come out and I'd look at and wish I could have that feeling again - I felt like I would never really have that childlike immersion in something again because my brain is filled with useless things like how taxes work and how to open a bank account.Terraria solved that. I get so distracted in this game, there's so much stuff I want to do, and so much stuff to do. I love the freedom and I love the fact that there are bosses and quests to do but they're not shoved down your throat. There are elements of kookiness (the Hallows) and elements of seriousness (the Wall of Flesh, the Crimson) and nothing beats stumbling on some new area and thinking ""I wonder if I can use these things to make a suit of bees?"".It's a fantastic game, well worth full price, and definitely recommended jamming with friends.And yes, you can make a suit of bees. And fire a bee gun.			"

												BEST GAME  EVER---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This Has to be my favorite game on my PC. From fighting the Eyeball Of a Monster to Slaying the Lord of the moon, This game can get you addicted in mere seconds of gameplay. 3000 items makes it even better, including the weapons and tools, such as the final Prism that shoots light, to a portal gun straight from the game, mechanics and all. If you haven't gotten it yet, I recommend you buy it now. 1.3, The Final Update.In this version, the golem is now broken and torn up, and you think you're safe, however a new pressence sends you back to the dungeon to meet the cultists. They seem harmless, until you see they're worshipping a mysterious god. After you kill all 4 Cultists, The Ancient Cultist is summoned. Beat him, and terror breaks out. You must destroy the 4 Celestial towers with new weapons you will find, such as Daybreak and Nebula Blaze. In order to break the power that shields the towers, you must slay 100 (150 for expert) of their individual monsters. Then, you can damage,  then soon destroy the towers. When you thought that was hard, you're going face to face with the lord of the moon, the reason for the chaos and evilness of this realm. After a long and hard battle, you'll be seeing a flash of white as he decays into nothing but bones, and, with special loot too, you've beaten the game, destroyed all evil, and saved Terraria. And with that, you can live without Chaos and be in peace...                                                                                         ~~~THE END~~~			"

												[Review originally written in 2014. I'll make a proper update another day]Some people say that Terraria is a 2D Minecraft. That's NOT true. Minecraft is a completely different game (and isn't even close to be fun as Terraria). Anyay, Terraria is a 2D Sandbox (Craft 'em up)/Platformer/RPG game where you start with nothing but a cooper sword, a cooper axe and a cooper pickaxe, 100 HP and in the new version, 20 mana. But as you dig more and collect more ores and cool stuff and craft them, the game turns you from hunted to hunter. It's not only about mining. (Sure, mining is essential, but you don't have to be always looking for ores, as they're not rare at all and the crafting recipes are pretty simple (as the crafting system). If you get stuck anytime, the Guide can help you out.The game is really slow paced at the beggining, but as you get stronger, it can surprise you with it's fast paced PVP, party system, bosses and enemies. You can have weapons from bows and shurikens to flametrowers and the craziest guns ever made!It also lets you pick your character's difficulty, which can be: Easycore (You drop some coins on death), Mediumcore (You drop your items on death) (i don't recommend playing on mediumcore), and Hardcore (when you die... you die), but not the game's difficulty. You begin without armor and easily die in most places and at night, then you get stronger and find a harder place, then you get stronger again and find a more challanging place, then you get EVEN stronger... and after you kill the ""last"" boss, your world is instantly converted to a Hardmode world, which has more biomes, bosses, ores, items and difficulty. Some enemies require only skill to beat, as your set doesn't matter, they WILL kill you if you are careless.Dig, fight, explore, build, shoot, craft, find cool stuff and enter the awesome world of Terraria!!!===============================================================[Review originalmente escrita em 2014. Vou atualizá-la propriamente algum outro dia]Algumas pessoas dizem que Terraria é um Minecraft 2D. Isso NÃO é verdade. Minecraft é um jogo completamente diferente (e não chega nem perto de ser divertido como Terraria). De qualquer forma, Terraria é um jogo Sandbox (Craft 'em up)/Platformer/RPG em 2D onde você começa com nada mais que uma espada de cobre, um machado de cobre, uma picareta de cobre, 100 HP e na nova versão, 20 MP. Mas à medida que você cava mais e coleta mais minérios e coisas legais e as fabrica, o jogo te transforma de caçado para caçador. Não se trata somente de minerar (Claro, minerar é essencial, mas você não precisa estar sempre procurando por minérios, já que eles não são tão raros e as receitas de fabricação são bem simples (assim como o sistema de fabricação). Se você ficar preso a qualquer hora, o Guia pode te ajudar.O jogo tem um ritmo bem lento no começo, mas à medida que você fica mais forte, ele pode te surpreender com seu ritmo rápido de PVP, sistema de party, chefes e inimigos. Você pode ter armas de arcos e shurikens até lança-chamas e as armas mais loucas já feitas!O jogo também te permite escolher a dificuldade do personagem, que pode ser: Easycore (Você dropa algumas moedas quando morre), Mediumcore (Você dropa seus itens quando morre) (eu não recomendo jogar no mediumcore), e Hardcore (Quando você morre... você morre), mas não a dificuldade do jogo. Você começa sem armadura e facilmente morre na maioria dos lugares e à noite, então você fica mais forte e encontra um lugar mais difícil, então você fica mais forte denovo e encontra um lugar mais desafiador, então você fica AINDA mais forte... e depois de matar o ""último"" chefe, seu mundo é instantaneamente convertido para o modo ""hard"", que tem mais biomas, chefes, minérios, itens e dificuldade. Alguns inimigos só necessitam de habilidade para vencer, já que seu set não importa, eles VÃO te matar se você for descuidado.Cave, lute, explore, construa, atire, fabrique, encontre coisas legais e entre no incrível mundo de Terraria!!!

Its sandbox like minecraft in 2D with more action, rare drops from enemyes and many crafting recepies and combinatios. Its super fun in singleplayer and its even more fun in multiplayer when palying with friend or joining public servers.

I Put in countless hours and ever since the 1.2 update I've found myself puting countless more. I would recommend Terraria to anyone - Casual Gamers, Hardcore Gamers, and all the in-between. It certainly holds all the elements I look for in a game!			"

Because I had fun experiences with friends.But that is not the main idea here.One day I stumble across this and think""Wait a minute, ive heard of this""I watch a couple videos and im hooked.Forget Minecraft I said, its over and done with.I buy this on my phone, computer sucked at the time.But once I did....wow didnt think youd still be reading...I think you should just buy the game, what else are u doing with your life anyway?

												I really had no interest in this genre of game before I played. Luckily for me, Terraria showed me that not not all sandbox adventures are Minecraft clones. I played with friends who were a mix of battle hardened veterans, and dirt covered noobs (myself included), but we quickly learned the value of having a group, and enjoyed the experience of constructing a small town with elaborate and unique houses, digging to the center of the earth, being attacked by a wide variety of deadly foes, and ultimately unleashing hell upon our little world. Playing alone was equally satisfying, as the game offers a wide variety of things to keep yourself occupied with, but I still recommend finding friends to experience Terraria with. The beauty of the sandbox genre is being able to share your creations with others, and Terraria offers hours of just that.10/10 "

												Terraria is for me one of the best 2D voxel-base game. The reasons I like it, is that the combat systeme is nice, there is sooooo much monster and stuff to craft that, you'll need at least 100 hours to get everything (maybe I was slow or unlucky^^). However it might get boring for people who doesn't like to mine for hours to get armors, tools and weapons. In conclusion, it's really good game with a big lifetime compared to it's price, and it's multiplayer. So what are you waiting to buy it :D ?!			"

												First of all I want to make clear something: I really liked the soundtrack at the opening. Now you may begin to read the review.Terraria is a sandbox adventure game, where your main objective is to survive. You'll start with 3 useful tools in single player: Godly Copper Shortsword, Massive Copper Pickaxe and a Chopper Axe. You can change your character, like the style of your clothes and hair and also the character name. You can decide the map size, there are three different sizes: Small, Medium and Large. And also you can choose up to two different difficulties in the game: Normal and Expert. The game lets you craft lots of contents with the workbench you can make on the inventory menu. If you die, you won't lose your full inventory only things like: silver coins. After these standard things of sandbox from above, I started to swing with my axe hoping to cut a tree, but it didn't work like Minecraft. Apparently you needed to wait several seconds more than the game. But if you cut down one place of the three, the whole tree will fall down so you get the woods faster than Minecraft. So when I had like hundred ten wood I started trying to craft some things, but for it I needed to find the inventory menu. Like I said it isn't the same as Minecraft. So I've pressed tons of buttons to find out how to make a workbench, but I couldn't find it. I looked online on a guide of Terraria to find an answer, after I found the button to craft; esc I died of a zombie. Because it was already dark. I spent several minutes to make a house to survive the nights. After I made a house I started searching unexplored areas and found some treasures. I started turning back to my house, when it was almost dark. I started crafting several of craft able items and began to become a true legend. I still died most of the times. My pc crashed and needed to start all over again, but 10/10 I'll start all over again. But in expert mode.My impressions of the game so far. The game starts boring, but later when you understand how to play it starts to become fun. The game made me clear to say this: the game isn't (almost) the same as Minecraft. The Pros and Cons of the game. Pros. - Lots of different creatures- Lots of different blocks- Lots of items to craft- Amazing gameplay- Lots of caves to explore- Admirable soundtrack- Many bosses- Has trading cardsCons. - The game has sometimes starting up problems on my pc  The game is totally worth it even without any discounts.

												If you're a fan of sandbox games, platformers, as well as some RPG progression, then this should be right up your alley.It isn't really a 2D Minecraft, as it places a lot more emphasis on combat and character progression rather than Minecraft's exploration and building. Sure, you can build a stylish base if you want (and it can be incredibly fun with a bit of imagination), but if you find that kind of thing boring, the game also has a lot more depth than just building. I find the combat a lot more fun, because rather than just a sword and a bow that only comes in one flavor, you've got magic items, guns, boomerangs, and several other different kinds of weapons that I really feel keeps combat fresh. Also, by endgame, you're so OP that it's hilarious to just watch everything around you burn. The multiplayer, while hard to set up at first, is also a blast. Who wouldn't want to beat up baddies with your buddies?Oh, and the music's great too. I've always loved good game musicThat being said, it's not perfect. There are still a couple problems with it, but they're just my opinions. First up, the game can feel a little bit too grindy at points, especially with the endgame loot. Some of the ultimate weapons are locked in chests, and require drops that are a 1/2500 chance to drop. (It was previously 1/8000... roughly about the chance of finding a SHINY POKEMON) I won't spoil much else though. Another problem I have is that after you beat all the bosses and become that ultimate one man army, there's not much else to do besides building and PVP. But hey, it was a fun ride there.So where am I going with this? Well, first for you TL;DR people (You know who you are), I'll just list the pros and cons.PROS   +The game has a lot more depth besides just buiding and exploring   +The various weapon types keep combat fresh and interesting   +The world, while not infinite, has a lot of different types of environments to explore   +When building, there are a lot of thematic options to choose from, as well as a lot of options to decorate your buildings   +Multiplayer is a lot of fun   +You can choose exactly how punishing you want death to be (Lose half of your money, lose all of your inventory, lose your character outright)   +The music is so awesome CONS   -Can get a little grindy, especially for endgame loot   -After you defeat all the bosses and are fully geared up, there isn't much else to doAll in all, Terraria is one of my favorite games on Steam, and you should give it a try if my first sentence applies to you.If there's anything I left out, I'll edit this as more things come to me.

Terraria is a game, no matter how long you have it, you'll keep enjoying it. P.S: If you think that this is a copy of minecraft, think again.

Can I upgrade my gear? Is there a Boss? -/Desperately gather more infoThis is where my terraria start.... yes it's time for adventure!So.... I really want to play this game! What now?Wiki is your friend!  cause the game don't tells you everything... but there's a good random events and boss along the way. Not too much, not too boring. Aim for your equipment and boss fight! TONS OF EQUIPMENT!This is where the fun begins, you want a sword? There you go! You want a Rifle? There you go!! You want to be a wizard? There you go!!! You can be and adventure Almost every stance that you can find suits your play-style in terraria but you have to put up with it......As soon as your Hunt the first boss down.... you want more! and more!!So..... Basicly this game is?+It's a RPG game, with lots of weapons, Gears, Funny stuff and Boss to choose from! +You can play solo or with your friend!+You think this game is too easy? Try moderate! or HARDCORE! this mode are only for the REAL HERO!+There's no realdeal story here, but it's still fun to play and progress are along the way while you play. don't worry.Ahuh.... I might interest in this game...OKAY! now let's review other stuff that's not a game then!GRAPHICS SOUNDS AND OTHER STUFF-2D Flat.... Woman cc are Flat.... Spectacular retro 2D graphics with rich pixelated enviroment.-Not laggy, Smooth game play and support for co-op, can sometimes be ram-eater for your PC.-dedicated server and mods, also 8 people playable. or maybe more!-Controls are understandable, modifyable and user's friendly.-Sounds are lovely done. Even the boss theme!SO yeah.... overall I've played this game until the last boss. and I would  say It's a good co-op game I'ven't met once in a while!hope this Review gave you some ideas.... annnnd Cheers for now! Ravioly out!  :D			"

												I must say that at first glance, I expected absolutely nothing from Terraria, boy was I wrong.When you look at it as a simple game where you just build stuff and kill mobs, it really doesn't seem interesting, but when you actually put time into discovering what it really offers, boy oh boy does it have TONS of content.I bought Terraria expecting it to be somehow like Minecraft (who didn't at first?), and I never really touched it until some of my buddies invited me to play with them. As I expected, we ended up only building houses and mining, I got bored quickly and stopped joining the server after a while.When I saw that Terraria had a new update, the 1.3 update, I asked myself ""Why not?"". And then it started.I put so much time into this game, building, discovering, mining, killing stuff, exploring, and I'm really sad to say that I think I might actually be done with it after 200 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fishing quests.Terraria has so many things it can offer, inclunding many hours of fun, I totally recommend this to anyone who has enough patience to spend a lot of time digging.

												This is by far one of the most enjoyable games I own. At only $10, it's a steal for the amount of replayability that the game offers.Co-op with friends offers countless hours of fun, as you explore the randomly generated world, fight interesting and dangerous creatures, and collect better equipment in an effort to constantly improve yourself for the bosses. It's one of those games that really makes time fly by. One look at the clock after playing this, and you'll wonder where your day went to.Terraria is one of the best Indie games that I know of for building structures. The amount of freedom that it gives the player to be as creative as they want in house design is truly amazing, and the structures that can be built are virtually limitless. Want to make a fully underwater headquarters? Easy. Or are you the type that likes to build a sprawling land fortress that's heavily defended with traps? You can do that too. Or perhaps a space station is more your style? Go for it.All in all, this game easily deserves a 10/10. With co-op adventuring, building, and fighting, you'd be silly not to invest the $10 and have this game in your library.			"

												I highly recommend this game, It's kind of like Minecraft except it's 2D and it has A LOT more content.There's so many different monsters with unique drops to craft your weapons and armors even wings... There's accessories which give you different bonuses and you can combine them to make even better accessories!!There's also different challenging bosses each one of them with their very unique style and form.Dungeons, Temples, Mining, Crafting, Lots of fights, Chests to loot, Vanity items (Costumes), Events such as blood moon, solar eclipse, Goblin army... and much more! Overall i think this is a fantastic game and if you like sandbox games with crafting features and bosses then this game is definitely for you.			"

												Re-did-review-Quick Review-Terraria is probably one of the best games I ever purchased on steam. It's a creative sandbox game that lets you collect, place, hoard items, upgrade, play different styles, explore, dig, burn in lava, fly around, get murdered, get killed by eyeballs, get eaten by worms, and have an amazing time with friends of any gaming experience online, or just play single player! -Detailed breakdown review-Story:  You're still reading? I thought by now you'd have concluded ""this game is amazing because Atratzu said so. I'll get it right now and stop reading his review. I'll even forget to click the thumbs up button for all the writing he does"".I'm just filling space, there's not really much of a story to Terraria, you start in a world and need to make shelter and then build more houses for your townsfolk (NPC's) to spawn in. You can interact with the npc's each one does something different. Learn to be good friends with your guide, and you'll do just fine.Game Play: The controls are pretty straight forward, a little difficult to explain in words. you need select tools to pick up certain blocks. Hammer for backgrounds, pickaxe for blocks, axe for chopping down tree's... there is a range of how many blocks you can reach, but most people can figure that out for themselves. If you can't... I'm sorry.You can carry some accessories, armor, and then you have an inventory. It's very straightforward and basic. A lot of the fun of the game is discovering how to use the various items you get. Some items are vanity items, other go ""pew pew"" (I wish a gun someday would literally say ""pew pew"" for me)There's a strong sense of progression in the game, it's very gear based and as you progress different gear has different effects, some lets you have more mana, some makes you tanky, some makes you move faster. Want to know more? check out the wiki-page or get the game already. Achievements: Achievements have been added, however I haven't started working on them yet. (I realized there were achievements as of 07/20/15.Price: Terraria is $9.99 that might put people off, which is fine I didn't buy the game full price I got it on a 75-50% off sale. but even if I had payed full price I have now put over 500 hours into the game. The only games that I've played more than that are Minecraft, Guild Wars 2, and World of Warcraft.So for me, it was a huge deal and value to get this game. For others it might not be so great, or put as much time into it. Conclusion: I really don't have anything negative to say about this game. I do get tired of people saying ""it's like minecraft on 2D"". Even I said that in my first review... but if you play the game a lot you see more differences then similarities. I recommend this game to anyone who is creative, or even if all you did was play with LEGO's as a kid I recommend this game. The only people who might be put off by this game, would be people who are used to having always-high-action (example would be FPS-only Genre).------Edits and updates------Edit/Update August, 9 2015: Requested edit: ""You can make male genitalia out of obsidian too.""

												Terraria is a very fun game.It combines some aspects of sandbox, RPG, and general free-roam exploration. Especially if you choose a large world size, the world can take so long to explore. You can make multiple characters (with RGB color customization!!!), each with their own special names, make multiple worlds and play any character on any world, with three world sizes, and literally over 2,000 different things, let it be enemies, items, blocks, events...there's so much to do. Over a DOZEN bosses, two modes, three difficulties.I have two characters, I've played over 200 hours, and have not even explored half of each world, and not even CLOSE to getting all the best of the best items. Once you've defeated all the bosses, then they'res two more events to summon, the Frost Moon and the Pumpkin Moon, each with waves and the absurdity of fighting MULTIPLE BOSSES AT ONCE. Of course, absurd in a good way.Vanity exists, so you can have awesome armor but look like an archaeoligist or a wizard, dye yourself different colors (with some special multicolor/changing dyes), and more.Unlike some other good games, Terraria has a little built-in wiki. Several, actually, the foremost being the Guide, the first NPC you get. He can tell you how to craft things, unlike (sorry to bag on it) Minecraft, in which, if there was no wiki, you'd be CLUELESS as to what to make and how to use it and such. The guide will literally tell you EVERY RECIPE AN ITEM IS USED IN, and where it is crafted at. There's so much stuff, over a dozen biomes, and.....this is a beautiful game. 10/10			"

 Why I like Terraria? Good question. You see, there is a sense of achievement in Terraria. It's got character. And you can't say that about many games.Originally posted by Tom Mc Shea on GameSpot: Terraria uses an empowering sense of discovery to grab you, and that unrestrained freedom is a double-edged sword. Free to explore the untouched lands, you may happen upon a monster much more powerful than you, or you may find a chest filled with precious treasures. You're never sure where your travels will lead you, but your curiosity is always rewarded. You may gain knowledge, such as knowing not to talk to old men at night, or happen upon a cache of gold, which can be used to forge a powerful sword. It's a world bursting with possibilities. Terraria is an incredible adventure that continually excites your imagination with the endless secrets that await.	 "

												I'll admit, the game was pretty unimpressive when I first started. I chopped down trees, dug some stone, did some crafting, made a house, and fought off monsters at night. Sound like another game you've played? Well after the first hour or two, you'll forget you ever considered this game a 2-D Minecraft. There's enough content to keep you playing for hours upon hours, day and night. I often find myself playing this game for twelve hours straight at a time without realizing it. Every element of this game was made with the intent of grabbing your social life by the throat and stomping it on the ground. Highly, highly recommended. (And better than Minecraft by miles.)			"

												I haven't written a review on this until now for some reason, but my kids love this game. And I have fun playing it with them. It's kind of like Minecraft turned into a sidescrolling 2D world. Kind of. But it's really a thing all its own. You build a home, a fortress, a village, whatever you want. You craft all sorts of crazy items, armor, and weapons. There are a lot of decorative features you can make for your place, and the developers seem to be adding a lot of content. When you get tired of doing this or that, you can do more and more, and then you can unlock hard mode which changes your world in significant ways... or not. My kids like to make a homebase on one world, then create new worlds to explore and mine together. I guess we have made something like Starbound with our imaginations only without any space travel. There are a few bosses to fight if you are looking for a challenge, and it seems like there's always something more to do. I'm not sure how it would hold up if you played to do and beat everything, because the worlds aren't all that big, but if you are looking for a fun leisure activity to do with your kids, give it a try. Check out the graphics before you do, and make sure they're okay with you. Check out the wiki to learn how to make and do different things. I don't think you'll regret your decision if you do get it.			"

												I've played many, many different games in the sandbox genre, but none of them have killed time for me like Terraria has.Yes, not even Minecraft.I'm sure there are people out there with way more hours on Terraria than I do, but I've been playing it for barely half a year and I've racked up over a thousand hours and I don't consider myself a hardcore gamer in the slightest. It's just that addictive, and for good reason too.The special thing about Terraria is that it isn't too focused on either being a sandbox game or an RPG. It's equally balanced in both aspects and that's what makes it so good. With hundreds of different monsters to fight, thousands of items to collect and infinite options on what you want to do in the game, it's not unusual that it still has a loyal playerbase after so many years.The single player experience is by no means bad. The game itself has more than five years worth of dedicated development put into it and the amount of content it presents for its price is very surprising. Even now, the developers of Re-Logic are still working to create new updates for Terraria. However, while the game by itself is sufficiently enjoyable, the multiplayer experience is what puts the crown of sandbox games on Terraria. Playing with friends or simply playing on public servers online with people you don't know is just that much better than exploring a world on your own. I had barely played an hour of single player before going out to find servers to play on.Like Bukkit is to Minecraft, tShock is to Terraria. This server software greatly enhances gameplay, whether you're a server Administrator or a normal player. There are many other mods out there, of course, which you can also download and install to add even more content to the game. Most servers have plugins and addons to make them significantly different from one another. If you're looking for something to play with friends or even find friends with, multiplayer Terraria is for you!Whether or not you decide to buy this to play with other people, it's still a really great game on its own and it does go on sale very often. If you're a little short on cash and don't feel like paying $10, just wait till a seasonal Steam sale or a promotion on a third party site. Terraria is still very much worth paying full price for, though!			"

												I have absolutely zero interest in Minecraft and haven't done much research on Terraria, but I do know it was a 2D version of what 3D Minecraft is. I have yet to reach Terraria's full potential but from what I see so far, I'm liking it. I'm warning my reader, very easily can you spend a bunch of time playing this game. Why? You can literally make a stairway of dirt to the sky, you can dig to the deepest of the lows, and you can walk continuously left or right to see where the world takes you. Terraria is a splitting of Minecraft. Almost anything can be picked or chopped away at resulting in gaining a resource. For example, you can dig away at a stone, clay, or dirt block and add it to your inventory. With this, you can determine the topography of the immediate surroundings. Don't want a house above ground? Dig a nice big hole, put some wood or stone surrounding the hole or even dirt to find the altitude you want everything at. Besides building with resources, the player can place work benches to construct additional material. What's additional material? It can be weapons, can be armor, can be torches to light up a path for your player at night, can be campfires to heal your player, can be walls made out of cacti, train track for your mining cart, tables, chairs, or antiques that make your house look pretty. It is pretty insane considering the amount of control and combinations that are in this game. I feel like I can literally do anything and go anywhere. There is, of course, exceptions to this. The further you travel from your spawn point, the harder the enemies become as well as the terrain. Random enemies will spawn throughout the game such as walkers or flyers, but at night, zombie looking creatures will come and attack you consistently. The enemies although a welcomed feature, can get pretty annoying after spending a lot of time fighting them. I personally find them numerous and annoying at times, especially when I'm building or cutting something. Traveling to different areas of the game yield different resources. The background/drop will change relative to your position on the map. I also have to add that the way they organized the characters and the worlds is fascinating. I've never had a head-ache free experience with something as similar as this. If you'd like to create a new character but use an old world, you can. If you want a new world with an old character, you also may do that!Graphics are decent and aren't meant to be anything substantial. The artists did a good graphical representation of everything, so it's somewhat difficult to confuse a stone block with an iron block. I did like the fact they added different locations as you progress the map, and the fact they added a day and night scheme. The backgrounds are dynamic and will change over time, even if it is the same background. Sounds are decent. You might go crazy after picking away at your 100th dirt block (*click *click *click). All in all, it's a pretty good game with a lot to do. You will easily find yourself immersed in this sandbox game trying to collect whatever you can get your hands on. Though the premise is cool and the game play, I've had some friends have a hard time get into the game.RATING : 7.35/10The price is reasonably fair but I would recommend a buy on sale.Gameplay B Story / Campaign B Visuals / User Interface C+ Sounds / Music B Replay-ability B Overall  BScreenShots :  What my first home looks like.

												This game scratches an itch I didn't know I had.  At first I only played 30 mins or so and got bored, not knowing what to do or what fun lay in store.  When I came back to it a few months later, determined to give it a go, I got hooked and spent the entire weekend and a few more weeks after work playing.  Which caused my carpal tunnel to flare up, so I had to stop playing for a bit.  While waiting for hands to get better I watched Let's Play videos for it.  I never watch Let's Play videos.   So short story - can't get enough of this game.  If you don't know much about Terraria, read a starter guide if you don't have a clue what to do.  But then don't read too much and spoil the surprises, just explore, build, mine and hack your way through the rest of the world.			"

												I've played many, many different games in the sandbox genre, but none of them have killed time for me like Terraria has.Yes, not even Minecraft.I'm sure there are people out there with way more hours on Terraria than I do, but I've been playing it for barely half a year and I've racked up over a thousand hours and I don't consider myself a hardcore gamer in the slightest. It's just that addictive, and for good reason too.The special thing about Terraria is that it isn't too focused on either being a sandbox game or an RPG. It's equally balanced in both aspects and that's what makes it so good. With hundreds of different monsters to fight, thousands of items to collect and infinite options on what you want to do in the game, it's not unusual that it still has a loyal playerbase after so many years.The single player experience is by no means bad. The game itself has more than five years worth of dedicated development put into it and the amount of content it presents for its price is very surprising. Even now, the developers of Re-Logic are still working to create new updates for Terraria. However, while the game by itself is sufficiently enjoyable, the multiplayer experience is what puts the crown of sandbox games on Terraria. Playing with friends or simply playing on public servers online with people you don't know is just that much better than exploring a world on your own. I had barely played an hour of single player before going out to find servers to play on.Like Bukkit is to Minecraft, tShock is to Terraria. This server software greatly enhances gameplay, whether you're a server Administrator or a normal player. There are many other mods out there, of course, which you can also download and install to add even more content to the game. Most servers have plugins and addons to make them significantly different from one another. If you're looking for something to play with friends or even find friends with, multiplayer Terraria is for you!Whether or not you decide to buy this to play with other people, it's still a really great game on its own and it does go on sale very often. If you're a little short on cash and don't feel like paying $10, just wait till a seasonal Steam sale or a promotion on a third party site. Terraria is still very much worth paying full price for, though!			"

												Through the amount of time I played this game, I'd say it's quite the Acception of Gameplay. I like how there are more than your realise down in that Cave down here, Quick! Bring a Torch! Actually, Bring the Stick Glowsticks that we just crafted! Holy moly, It's a flying Eye ball! No worries, use a bow. Nahh, use a freakin' Sword that Shoots awesome freakin' Things out of it!Overall, It's a 10/10 In my books. Never gets repeatitive, never gets old. Good just Re-Logic :DFor those who are only maybe like 10-15, Don't be afraid! I'd say this is for all of the people who love those kind of sandbox/adventure type games.			"

												Terraria, a lovely game. I find it very relaxing at least when compared to competitive online games like DOTA. That's not to mean there is no challenge either.dig, craft, find, adventure, fight, build.....My only issue would be that it's hard to find people willing to play their character exclusively with you. What I mean by exclusively ? Well someone that will play with you with his character and not play the same character on the side & come back to play with you with uber equipement, because in this game, everything is tied to equipement so hard monsters/bosses will become a piece of cake once you reach higher and higher equipement level.Also still getting updates as of 2016, 5 years of continuous updates & free content updates that other games would probably add as DLC.

												""It's Just 2D Minecraft!""  Said all the minecraft fansAlthough it may seem like that at first it really isn't instead it's better the amount of things you can do and places that you can explore for example all the different types of biomes above and undergroundAlso the amount of weapons is amazing you can get from swords to miniguns or star cannons you can either find the materials to make the weapons or you could buy it from some of the many NPC's in the game like the Merchant or the Gun DealerThere are many blocks also in the game building blocks or just the natural blocks some look quite nice you might even want to put it on your houseSwimming.......Sadly you can't swim without an item so most of your deaths will probably come from drowning if you fall in to a pitHard ModeThere are many boss fights even before hardmode e.g Skeletron or The Eye Of Cythulu but the big boss (The Wall Of Flesh) sends you into hard mode which will make many new Creatures and NPC's spawn that you will have never seen before and making certain recipies craftable since some of the things you need will be in hard modeOverallThis is a great game a definetly recommend this although it does get quite repetetive once you have completed it9/10			"

												I like this game. I like it alot. I'll tell you why.Don't listen when people say it's 2D minecraft. It's a wildly inaccurate statement. It's great because of it's (If I'm using the right word, hell if I'm not) voxel-based world. You can create, explore, and destroy, and the only limit is your willingness to put forward the effort. This game allows you to be rather expressive with your imagination; given, this game shines as a co-operative game for dungeon crawling, fighting all sorts of beasties, and building massive strongholds. Definitely a bit more fantasy-action based than minecraft.This game definitely holds your attention for awhile.Tl;dr version:Lots of things to do, things to fight, weapons to find, lovely game.			"

												It's the best game ever...Had it on the Xbox 360 and PS4, on both about 3-400 hrs of gameplay, now on PC also about 200hrs of gameplay, and the building-survival factor keeps it going on.There are so many different building materials, and equipables and items to collect, so it keeps you busy for the next couple of months if you're really up for collecting everything :)I stopped playing on the console on 1.2.4 because I had done about everything, and since I heard about the 1.3.3 update, and the new NPCs I really take a big time enjoying fishing a lot in this game.Not purely before the crates or the quests, but the quests add a different perspective to the game, and it's sometimes just nice to kill some time catching some fish :)I also like that most of the useable stuff is placeable, like swords can go into racks, and armour on mannequins.There's literally so much to explore that I could write an essay about what's there to do in Terraria, but then I'll be here in two days still typing this review.If you have to ask me, I recommend Terraria to everyone, because it's a game for everybody :)(P.S. you can also play with different classes :) )			"

												I never wanted to buy this because I thought it was just a “♥♥♥♥ 2D Minecraft” but boy was I both ignorant and wrong. My brother kept insisting I try it and eventually I did. I can honestly say now that I regret what I said about Terraria, it’s a really great little sandbox game. There is a lot you can do in this game and it can keep you entertained for a good long while. Whether you want to build things, kill things, collect thing, find things or even just explore, there is a lot of hours to be played on this game.They have added quite a few really big updates to this game that gave end-gamers something more to do, which I think was really awesome. My brother literally loves this game; he finished everything and built a massive mansion with millions of chests containing a full stack of every time in the game.  Absolutely tanked the game and they added in a few massive updates and now he has ten times as much more to do now.So for it to still be growing, I think is a selling point a lot of people appreciate.It’s a lot of fun and is something simple and easy to play on your own or with friends.One of the best side scrolling games I have ever played.

												Terraria is not 2D minecraft.If you're looking for a minecraft-like game, don't buy this. If you're looking for a semi-difficult open world sandbox game, this is just right for you. It does have a few very minor bugs, none of which are game breaking, at the worst exploitable. The combat is not great, but the variety of weapons are in the hundreds. This is easily a 200 hour game. I also took a look at the negative reviews just to see what people had to say, and 99% of people who had negative reviews had played the game for less than 2 hours. They did not experience the game to the fullest. This was the first game I ever bought on Steam and I have >100 hours in on it now. I think anyone can enjoy Terraria.			"

												FIRST THING'S FIRST: This is not a Minecraft clone, I am only comparing certain features to it.Let me tell you a story. ""Once upon a time, I played a game called Minecraft. Wow, it was a great game. The crafting, the building, and survival. Great game. But one day, I decided to try a game called Terraria. Terraria has become my new favorite game. I haven't played Minecraft since."" (The guy in the story is me).Now on to the review stuff. Lets do pros and cons. Some are opinion based though.PROS-2D (opinion) I think it is actually better than 3D with Terraria.-TONS and TONS of weapons and tools.-Player creation. I think the player creation is great.-NO DURABILITY. Tools and weapons don't break. Build a pick, keep the pick.-Lots of unique enemy types. Demon Eye, killer glowing jelly fish, and so on.-Lots of classic enemy types. Zombies, Skeletons, and so on.-Lots of exploration possibilities.-Torches stay lit while in hand so you don't have to always place it.-Modern. One of the things I didn't like about minecraft was that it was set in times before tech. THIS game has guns, grenades, something I can only assume are jetboots, and so on.-Great gameplay and replayability.-ModsCONS-No creative mode unless you have a mod. (Opinion)-(This may just be me but) Hard to find iron and upgrade tools.That's all the cons I can think of.Overall, I give this game a 11 out of 10.Really fun so you should get it!			"

												I have owned terraria since 2011, and I must regret that I don’t have more hours in this game. Terraria is the best Indie game I have ever owned. It has so much for you the player to do. Here is my separate ratings for some of the game aspects.Music (8/10) Amazing retro soundtrack that fits the game so well.Graphics (9/10) The retro style graphics mixed with the music gives off a very light hearted tone to the game.Customization (10/10) The building system in this game is perfect for the 2d world you live in, and the player customization is amazing with over 100 items that change your characters appearance.Gameplay (9/10) The game can be played all by yourself which is really fun, but bring your friends into the mix and it’s even better, fight massive amounts of mobs and bosses with your friends for some awesome loot.Originality (8.5/10) Terraria has plenty of unique game items and aspects to bring to the table and are pulled off fairly well, the developers have mixed in some great references to other media such as Doctor Who, Zelda, and more.The price tag for terraria is $9.99 which is cheap for the amount of content and hours of fun you will have with this gem. It goes on sale fairly often so if you see it on sale and don’t own it yet grab it. Note: My grammar and spelling sucks I know sorry.			"

												Great game, Fell in love straight away, I never stop to play. The Slimes always say Hey!. Especially when I'm chopping the trees, to build houses containing NPC needs.They like to sell me stuff, and use my Gold, But it's ok, I get so much loot, I cant even hold. Most of my worlds are small, and the pre-hardmode bosses are dead, but no tears have been shed, because after the Wall Of Flesh, I'll be dead, dead, dead, dead. You see the game only gets harder, More enemies, more bosses. You will die, and cry, but then find wings & fly. This game is like this rap, it's bad & it's good. But unless you explore, you'll be stuck farming wood... "

												This game is amazing. You can do so much in it, from fighting bosses, to amazing builds, and even hardcore adventures in the mines. Personally, you shouldn't judge neither MC or Terraria. They're both amazing games. Terraria has a s*** ton of weapons, which enhances the game with variety. I have sunk my life into this game, and I have severly enjoyed earning the victory when I finally defeat a boss. Many people also enjoy multiplayer, and it has a great community. You can fight Cthulhu's brother with a cat-sword, and a mechanical Santa with god-knows-what! Why are you still reading?!GET IT NOW OR ELSE YOU WILL REGRET IT			"

Pre review TL;DR:Terraria is one of the best games I own. It's a hugely skill based sidescrolling combat game with fluid combat and great progression.Pros:+The combat is fluid and skill based +Gameplay features hack 'n' slash and shoot 'em up elements+The rpg-like ability to make your own non linear ""class"" or ""build""+The building is great and has tons of variety+The game runs at 60 fps at max graphics and lighting in my huge base (Despite my horrible gpu)+The different biomes aren't just pallette swaps of each other+Hardmode is a MASSIVE change and improvement to almost every aspect of the game+Wiki is extremely helpful+Multiplayer while finicky at times is very easyNeutrals:=Can be confusing without wikiCons:-The ""survival"" tag is untrue, it is not a survival game at all-The communiy is...braindead-The game is SO much worse in the beginning compared to the mid and end. it's the most likely part of the game to throw you off, it's by far the most boring part of the gameRefund disclaimer:Terraria is a massive game but was made far before the steam refund system. Re-logic didn't rework the entire starting game to fit this 2 hour judgement time so expect the early game (prehardmode) to be the worst part of the whole game			"

												Great game , best played as coop with friend.Tip : Avoid looking at the screenshots or reading anything about it if possible. Nothing beats the surprise and serendipity when you discover something on your own.Like exploring? There is a whole world to get lost in. Tired of exploring? Try building your uber mansion/fortress. Bored of building? Try a shot at defeating a powerful monster or boss. Beaten by monster? Maybe you should craft better weapons and armor. This game has more craftable items than Minecraft. Bored of crafting? Why don't you go exploring. And so on. There are so many activities, to scratch every itch - be it your desire for exploring, hunting, mining, crafting, building, creating, or just letting your imagination run wild. Also the game's lore seems quite deep. I dunno the full story though. I am 50 hours in and I feel like I have only scratched the surface of what this game has to offer.			"

There are so many things to do in Terraria, anything you can imagine - you can do it. Which makes this game very interesting and unique. Amazing gameplay, nice graphics, great soundtrack. Multiplayer is awesome, because there is also PVP option. And also, very good price! Buy it, you won't regret it.			"

												When you first start the game, you might wanna learn a few things. First you need certain knowledge to make your world progress and some extra bad experiences to make your next world better. So this game is basically practice. You don't need superb reflexes or anything, just luck and extra players with you, so you'll be in need of friends to win the game. The music is good and the mining experience is quite good, i enjoyed every minute looking, mining, crafting and trying sets for my style of playing. The negative point is maybe that when you defeat the boss that triggers the hard mode, the difference is VERY significant and you need extremely cautious and learn about potions and their side effects. You will need to learn about biomes and how to keep them. All your enviroments are essential, even corruption or crimson. It was a very fun game to play.			"

												1.3 just added a HUGE expansion (800+ new items) for free. These devs are great. They spent more time working on this update than EA spends on it's ""expansions"" that cost money. Terraria is an awesome game. Alot of people say it's 2d Minecraft. It's not. The only real similarity is that it's a voxel game and you can mine and craft. Terrria has much more items and things to do.

												I think one of the greatest features of this game is the map. It's designed by you through experience. This results with you learning and remembering nearly every aspect of it as you are playing; without question. The difference between a map learned through creation experience vs. time experience is apparently much more rapid. If I were to attempt to play this game on someone elses carved tunnel systems, where I can not alter the terrain, I would not learn it and understand it as if I were the one carving the tunnels. Experience is, indeed, the best teacher.			"

 TERRARIA REVIEW   Terraria  is often referred to as ""The 2D Minecraft"", but believe it or not this couldn't be any futher from the truth. Terraria is a game that strives on being completely about the experience. Exploring, Adventuring, and Action is the name of the game to put it lightly. A game like Minecraft prides itself on creativity of the mind with a dash of survival that doesn't even compare to the likes of Terraria. I'm not saying Terraria lacks the assets to make creativity bloom, because then I'd be lying because I've seen some crazy stuff made in Terraria, but I've seen more in Minecraft.  Minecraft  has 3 bosses that are okay at its best, but Terraria has over a dozen bosses which are totally epic, and the amount of obtainable items towers way into the thousands by now. Something Minecraft couldn't achieve without mods. The items are insanely fun to use and upgrading your character's gear becoming more powerful as a result is so satisfying making the hours upon hours seem totally worth the effort.  Terraria  visually has wonderful pixel-art with beautiful pixel parallax backgrounds to accompany the world you're in. It also has a very vibrant ambient soundtrack that is just so damn relaxing and pleasing to listen to as you explore for hours on end. The game's control is on point, completely and utterly perfect with an exception on the consoles and mobile devices mind you, but on keyboard and mouse it's perfect.  From the looks of it  this is the end of anymore updates for this game so a review is more justified in my eyes, but I have heard there is a sequel in the works, so yeah that sounds amazing. The game is truly a masterpiece. A CHILL RUNS DOWN YOU SPINE, OH HOT DAMN. 10/10  "

												An old man awaits at the entrance of a dungeon. Stricken by a mysterious curse, he urges you to return after the sun has set, to free him of the madness that has infected his body. So you spend the day amid the grassy splendor of Terraria, surveying caves, slaying rabbits and slimes, as the hours tick by. Once night has set, you return to the old man, to free him of his curse and reap whatever rewards he wishes to give you. It turns out that the little curse transformed the old man into a demonic skeleton, a hovering monstrosity that unleashes holy hell upon your poorly equipped explorer. The battle rages for 10 seconds, maybe 20 if you run away at the onset, and then you're left staring at your corpse and wondering how you could ever defeat such a beast.But there's no reason to be deterred by such a thorough beating. Terraria uses an empowering sense of discovery to grab you, and that unrestrained freedom is a double-edged sword. Free to explore the untouched lands, you may happen upon a monster much more powerful than you, or you may find a chest filled with precious treasures. You're never sure where your travels will lead you, but your curiosity is always rewarded. You may gain knowledge, such as knowing not to talk to old men at night, or happen upon a cache of gold, which can be used to forge a powerful sword. It's a world bursting with possibilities. Terraria is an incredible adventure that continually excites your imagination with the endless secrets that await.An apartment complex reaching toward the sky gives your helpers plenty of room for themselves.Terraria debuted on the PC almost two years ago, and I was worried how such a mouse-heavy game could make the transition to a traditional control scheme. After a little practice, my worries were thankfully banished. Movement works remarkably well on the Vita, which makes sense given that Terraria feels like a 2D platformer. Performing precise jumps and grappling up walls feel even better using an analog stick instead of keyboard keys, so there's joy in traversing the world that didn't exist before. However, movement isn't nearly as important as excavation, and that's where patience matters. No longer can you dig precisely with a mouse; instead, you use a stick. The game has two options, manual and smart, which have different strengths and weaknesses. If you're clearing a deep hole, smart is blunt and effective. If you need to focus on individual blocks, manual works fine. Unfortunately, your cursor is controlled by both the right stick and the back touchpad, and there's no way to disable the second scheme, so you do have to hold the Vita carefully lest you dig haphazardly.Terraria is an incredible adventure that continually excites your imagination with the endless secrets that await.Discovery is the essence of Terraria, but thankfully that doesn't extend to basic play concepts. The PC version struggled to communicate exactly what you were supposed to do in this expansive world, and though the Vita version doesn't spell out every detail, it does a great job of pushing you in the right direction. Shelter is the most pressing matter for a lone explorer. Chop down trees to gain wood, and then use that wood to build a house. Once you lay out the frame, you need doors and a chair to complete the requirements, and that's where you get your first hint at what makes Terraria so appealing. You're told to make a crafting table, and by standing near it, you can make the rest of the pieces to finish your house. And there are a lot more items you can craft beyond that. With a bevy of weapons and armor, clothes and decorations, there are tons of tools you can make that help you become a better explorer.A little snow never hurt anyone.The items you can craft are clearly spelled out for you, so you're never unclear about what's possible. Once you acquire any of the plentiful materials strewn about the land, you learn how you can use them to craft something that could help you on the journey. Turn cobwebs into silk and then combine that with wood to make a bed. Melt silver nuggets into bars and then pound those into a shining suit at your anvil. By seeing exactly what items you can create, you're pushed to gather those materials as quickly as you can. You want that jungle hat, right? Well, you better find an underground jungle and gather spores if you want to sport that fine protective gear. An enticing cycle of hunting for materials followed by reaping a reward crops up in the early moments. Once you have golden armor and tools, you can venture further, which allows you to access even more powerful weapons.Much of your time in Terraria is spent digging elaborate tunnels beneath the surface. It's there that the most precious resources are buried, so you grab some torches and try to fend off the skeletons and bats as you dig ever deeper down. It's a slow process that stays compelling for two important reasons. First, with so many secrets hidden below, you continually stumble upon exciting new areas. Maybe you land at a place filled with bioluminescent mushrooms that can be brewed into a handy potion, or find a makeshift house hiding a treasure chest. You never know, so you keep digging. Second, there's a puzzle element to digging successfully. When you chip away at rock in the deep end of a lake, you have to figure out how to manage your dwindling supply of oxygen while going further down. Or you may have to divert water toward smoldering lava to create obsidian. You're always planning the best possible route, while fending off enemies, which keeps you engaged during those solitary hours carving out earth.It would be so much easier to mine this meteor if aliens weren't flying at your head.Once you harvest enough gold to drape yourself in it, you may wonder where you're supposed to go next. Well, thankfully, there's a guide who can point you in the right direction. Building houses attracts non-player characters, and each has his or her own way to help you. The guide tells you that it's finally time to fight a boss, and even details how to summon it, which is a godsend if you're lost. If you have an explosive in your inventory, a blast-happy dude moves in who happily sells you dynamite and bombs. There's no way to know exactly what will lure more NPCs to your commune, so just experiment with everything possible. None of them are necessary to complete your adventure, but they are a handy resource when you're stumped. Just make sure you fortify your walls. You wouldn't want a goblin army killing your only friends.Combat in Terraria is often simple. Killing slimes is more about positioning than deeper tactics, so most enemies serve as a distraction rather than a serious roadblock. Of course, you could play with permadeath if you want a real challenge, or lose all of your items upon every death, but such consequences were so severe for me that I didn't want to venture forth, which defeats the point of the game. The normal option is that you lose money when you die, which is a gentle scolding more than a serious setback.Digging a helevator is the quickest way to reach the bottom of the world.Be prepared to die a lot when bosses make an appearance. Every battle is against a massive beast that dwarfs your feeble adventurer, so you have to be smart and well prepared if you're going to come out on top. If you collect enough shooting stars beforehand, you can craft mana crystals that let you use magic. It's much safer to shoot magical strikes from a distance than to get up close with your warhammer. Still, there are many different tactics to take out the various bosses. And, who knows, maybe you won't have a chance to plan out a strategy at all. The Eye of Cthulhu randomly appears once you've become powerful enough, and it's crazy to fight this flying beast while in a subterranean jungle. Always be prepared for a fight; you wouldn't want to lose your hard-earned money because you forgot your bow			"

												Terraria is oft-derided as ""2D Minecraft"", but I feel that this comparison misses the point. Yes, it was developed sometime in the beginning of Minecraft's meteoric rise, but beyond the aspect of having the world portrayed by bricks and allowing players to construct things, the focus of the games is entirely different.Terraria, unlike Minecraft, is -- even before mods, unlike its contemporary -- a game about progressing in an RPG-like manner through a steadily more-dangerous world. Yes, there are resources to collect and things to craft, but there the similarities end. Fundamental to the Terraria experience is the ""Metroidvania""-style item collecting: You can find (or craft) new armor, weapons, and accessories that give you new powers and ability throughout your growth in the world. But to label it as a spawn of Metroid also misses the point somewhat, as at no point is it strictly NECESSARY to get these improvements; they simply make progression easier. For example, sure, the grappling hooks make exploring underground caves easier, letting you more easily mine materials for better armor and weapons, but you aren't stopped from making progress towards harder bosses if you don't have them.And this progression is the core of Terraria. Instead of having static levels or maps to travel, you get a single world, containing (as randomly determined by a procedural system) any or all of a mix of biomes from snowy winterlands, sandy deserts, flat plains, and the alway-present ocean biomes bookending either end of the world. Yes, the world is finite, but as it delves hundreds of 'blocks' into the ground (and, in the case of the Floating Islands containing unique goodies for those willing to build up to reach them), this limit isn't easily reached by most players except after literally hundreds of hours of play. Instead, 'advancing' in the game is dictated by defeating bosses, summoned by certain criteria, and after certain bosses you cause the world to change under your feet.One boss, for example, guards the ""Dungeon"", an always-generated construction consisting of gloomy halls, spooky scary skeleton enemies, and plenty of unique and useful equipment to find. Only after defeating him can you get into it. Another is the boss of the lava-filled Underworld, and upon its defeat comes the game's change into ""Hardmode"", wherein a certain action after its defeats causes several new tiers of ores to be automatically generated in your world (transforming existing deposits of 'basic' ores). Gear constructed from these materials are almost necessary to have a fighting chance to fight the new bosses, allowing more and more progression, and so on and so forth.While on the topic of boss-beating, this plays a major role in a crafting metagame, where some of the late- and end-game gear can only be constructed from drops specific to certain bosses. While it gets ""grindy"" in some cases, this means that you are always pressured to replay some boss fights, and in the interest of making farming more efficient this means you have to learn new ways to fight them, or take advantage of new gear.Last, but certainly not the least, is base-building. While it lacks the grandiose nature of many of Minecraft's greatest constructions, the Terraria world does enable no small amount of player-driven building to occur, allowing everything from simple wooden huts to huge multi-level castles, limited only by your creativity and willingness to gather materials. This aspect will only provide as much entertainment to you as you allow it, but that's the best part of Terraria -- building is a sideshow, a distraction, NOT the sole purpose of the game.With a new team of devs taking on the project and driving the game's growth (for example, Hardmode was a post-release addon, and basically doubles the game in doing so), Terraria is poised to continue expanding in all aspects -- combat, crafting, building, mining, whatever drives your experience. And with the price often dropping to below 5 bucks during many sales, you owe it to yourself to get this game if you love 2D hack-and-slash ARPGs.			"

												This Indie sandbox game really has a little something for everyone.Whether you are into building, creating pixel art, PvP, PvE, this game has something for you!Once you've made your character, you start off in the world of Terraria. Your first goal is survival. During the first day, you deal with pesky slimes while you gather the materials needed to build a shelter before nightfall. Once night comes, the undead swarm you. Are you resting safely in your new house, or are you forced to fight until daybreak?If you thought slimes and undead were all you had to worry about in this world, you were wrong. Outlandish minions and deadly bosses await every turn, as you explore the many different environments in the world. Defeating them will reward you with new materials, weapons, armor, and even trophies to display.Beware of the corruption, an environment native to Terraria, that slowly spreads, trying to shroud your world in darkness. Or, will your world contain the crimson? A festering landscape, oozing with blood and flesh that constantly tries to devour you. You will not be left defenceless against these horrors, however! You can work to purify the land to its original state.In your travels, you will find resources that you can mine and gather. Combine them into powerful weapons and armor, or shape them into building blocks for new structures. As you grow and progress, NPCs will begin to flock to your buildings, offering you aid. You will even find some out in the world, waiting to be rescued.Tunnel through the earth, or take wing and fly to the clouds. Purify or corrupt. Build or destroy. The world of Terraria is yours to explore, and mold into your image.			"

												This game is one of the best things I've ever played.  If you've ever heard somebody call it '2-D Minecraft', as I have many times, it isn't.  There's way more than 4 or 5 metals/gems, and you get roughly a dozen different challeging bosses.I would HIGHLY recommend it to anyone, especially  if you enjoy fighting evil monsters of the darkness with huge swords, super-rapid fire guns, and magic.(or unicorns and fairys, if your that kind of person).

												I'm writing this review with 450-ish hours put into Terraria.  I don't write reviews often, and usually when I do, it's to let people know I accidentally purchased something awful, and to warn them from making the same mistake.But Terraria's fun!  It's good!  It's even what some might call charming.Two-Dimensional procedurally generated world-conquering/colonizing.  Pixel-building/Pixel-Art.  Guide Voodoo Dolls.  These are just a few of the 'features' Terraria has to offer.  And as someone who's played from beginning to now, let me tell you, the Guide Voodoo Doll REALLY IS a feature.  I remember how much anger and table-flipping he used to cause me, and still does from time to time...  You'll never get tired of dropping his doll in the lava, even if it does summon giant walls of evil flesh with wormy mouths that pop off and try to eat your face.  Oh yeah, that's totally a feature too, killing the Guide to start a boss-fight.This game knows exactly what it is and makes no attempts to convince you otherwise.  It's 2D Minecraft.  It's Minecraft if Minecraft had a better combat system, more content, more mechanics it could work with.  Mods might alleviate some of the mellow nature of a game like Minecraft, but it'll never stand up to Terraria in combat.  And Terraria knows it'll never stand up to Minecraft in the ""Turning random things into beautiful art-pieces"" space.  And that's okay.Because while Terraria knows it's 2D Minecraft, it also knows it's not at the same time.  With a much stronger focus on gearing up for fights than just for the sake of it, Terraria quickly begins to make itself stand apart the first time you fight one of its many bosses.  From Cthulu's Eyeballs and brains, to the revived metallic skeleton that probably housed them, to EVIL EFFING SPIDERS WHY DID YOU ADD THOSE RELOGIC to towering Golems, there are a whole whack of bosses to fight, and a whole whack of sub-bosses and special bosses to find and fight in-between.It's a much more customization-friendly game too, designed to do what it can to help each player try to stand out from their friends in-game.  The King Slime has your precious Ninja Outfits guys, but good luck with the farming, you'll be at it a while.  I'll stick to my Jungle Rose in my hair thanks.  But don't think that flower in my locks makes me weak, not ever since they added visual armor slots.  Ya never know when Santa might be wearing full Adamantite armor...  It serves him well to do that too...Because sometimes, even the world itself tries to kill you.  Goblins, Pumpkins, Turkey's, Snowmen...  A few different invasions, and not all of them are normal things...Did I mention the game has seasonal events too?  Like finding snow and candy-canes around Christmas-time, Pumpkins and Turkey's during the months before...  I wonder if we'll see something Easter-themed this year added?  Hmmmm...And lastly, ReLogic does keep tabs on this game.  Official support ended a long time ago...  And then came back...  And then has been kind of in the wind, with ReLogic taking their time, but you know, supporting a game like this with genuinely massive content updates, minor patches, User Interface fixes and streamlining, re-balancing, new bosses, biomes, gear, special blocks and decorative blocks and craftables...  This is a game that sees more than its fair share of love, not just from its community, but straight from its creators, too.Terraria is a game that I keep coming back to over and over.  It's a game that the very creator of it himself just can't quite manage to stay away from.  Give it a shot, and maybe it'll be a game you keep coming back to over and over again too.			"

												Terraria is an amazing survival game. The 2d gameplay makes it unique. There are currently 1786 different items in Terraria at the moment and more to come. The building is a little tricky at first and so is crafting. When you start terraria you create your own character in anyway possible to hair to shoes. Then you create a world, There are 3 different sizes to choose from when creating you world, Small, Medium, and Large. Small is a good size for someone who has just started the game, While Medium Is a good size for a more skilled player, Large is Good for a server more than 5 people. Each world is randomly gererated. The only thing i would change in this game is the damage slimes do, It can be really annoying to a new player if a slime keeps killing them. 9.5/10 idk even more			"

												Terraria is a child born from the womb of the glorious Golden Age of Indie Games. Take well recieved mechanics from 2011 Indie bomb Minecraft and combine it with the notion of gameplay being prioritized rather than the best looking graphics - and Terraria is born. A Indie developer clearly took a very, Very demanded genre and turned it to a side-scroller with pixelated art-style. As expected, people called the game a ""Minecraft clone"" and an imposter, today that is completely unreasonable. It is to be expected when new games comes along with relations to previous Video Games that people will rant all day about it's similarities. Once a few years has past, you realize that there is Plenty of room for fresh ideas no matter the genre.Re-Logic did the logic thing and took a awesome game mechanic with high demands, and made something new with it. The entire Survival genre had been unknown territory until Minecraft triumphed along and showed people what can really be done with the right focus on gameplay and not graphics. The notion of starting out as a weakling, no armor, no weapons in a hostile, unknown world. Slowly progress to make your first tool, build a shelter, slaughter something for food. I think you can relate to that rewarding feeling when it feels like you have survived the first night, and you are a bit stronger than the day before.Terraria has mechanics that extend futher than the ones of Minecraft, namely it's RPG addition. You do not level up, but you will gradually evolve with more Health Points and progress through difficult enemy encounters, boss fights and challenging environments. Loot is also a factor in this game, you will find random chests that will cease your hunger for luxury weapons and items. The boss fights also provide as gateways, once beaten you will be able to craft one higher tier of armor, weapons and tools. Giving the game a progression system and a goal, and ultimately - an actual ending.There is a very long way throughout a complete game though. If you decide to play on the Large map size, it will take hours to find all the biomes on the surface, as well as countless of hours under ground and to some extent - in the clouds. The progression comes naturally, as you have to extend your mining, crafting and hunting opperation deeper and more further out, to proceed. When you are tired of mining, then hunt, when tired of hunting, build. Your small house will eventually grow to a massive fortress, even with NPC's players in it to help you in your journey.Something that I have not tried too much is the PVP mechanic of the game, which is also something unique with this game. You can essentially team up into up to 4 teams, and play your game while being under the threat of other players on the same world. Try and infiltrate the other team's base of opperation to slow their progress, or meet up for an epic PVP battle. Of course you can all choose to play coop and focus the imminent threat of the hostile world you are all in instead of fighting each other.As mentioned, new genres will go through a bumpy road before the community accepts it being a new genre. Survival games are no different. Today, a few years later, we see a lot of survival games, and we do not judge them for it. It is a very fun genre for Video Games, and Terraria is no different - You will spend 100+ hours into this game if you are into the genre. Few games have grabbed me as much as Terraria have, with over 300 hours in it and I have yet not done everything there is. The game is still getting updates too, not only on PC but the game is available on Playstation 3, Playstation Vita and even mobile devices. In the end, this game became a very successful title, today with a little ""clone"" of it's own - Starbound.Do pick this up if you are interested in survival games, you will not regret it! Terraria is also an excellent pixel-art building simulator. For the modern little brother, check out Starbound (Review) "

												TL;DRAn amazing 2D adventure games especially with friends, dont bother reading my review just go ♥♥♥♥ing buy it now since it often goes on sale for $1-5.LOOONG VERSION.So what is terraria exactly? terraria i would say is a 2D version of minecraft in which you mine blocs, use blocks and build blocks just for the sake of the sandbox elements. Inf act drawing a paralelle line you would see many overlapping elements between this supposed minecraft clone and terraria itself but ultimately it is all bonkers and i would call you an idiot because terraria /=/ minecraft. Essentially where minecraft fail to deliver healthy optimization and incredibly boring end game [ENDER DRAGON HAHA] but decides to mix it up with lots and lots of tools terraia in its early days goes differently. I played the version several years ago where you just survive and kill some bosses but going back in now i realize many new things has been put in place.1. GraphicsThey slighly overhauled the graphics between years ago but essentially it is all 2D flat pixel retro ♥♥♥♥♥. With particle effects. Those particle effects made it rather tolerateable but lets not nitpick shall we? Look at the video and screenshots and that is what you will get.2. SoundStellar and does its job well. Zombies growl, sword swings, slime gulches and human produce inhuman level of groaning upon taking damage which leads us to reexamine our own lives and dashing any hopes of surviving in this fantasy world with our pitiful mor---- whoops went off track there but anyways the sound is awesome. Or average. cant make up my mind.3.GAMEPLAYGosh, in between the armor crafting, furniture making, boss fighting and even fishing, cant believe they added fishing. The game is a monstrosity of elements mashed together to form some bizarre form of sadistic satisfying level of fun and engineering level worth of headscrather in terms on how you ♥♥♥♥ing build that floating scout prison room. There's mining, crafting, killing and more building but ignore this section since this game essentially have ♥♥♥♥ load worth of things to do.4.CO-OP..... With murder.This game by itself is stupidly boring but add in 1 clueless friend who knows nothing about the game and lets just say its incredibly fun, you have the standard pvp options but you can ♥♥♥♥ing choose your own colour. ducking amazing but if killing is not your thing you can always join forces t build that tower of doom for killing other online hopeless chap. In the end its all about the killing.END♥♥♥♥ me i was bored, i might add some more when my head clears up but essentially read the TL;DR on why i think youre an idiot for not owning this incredible game.P/S:Played the yarr version for 2 straight years.

												It is a game of looting, killing, and patience. You start off mining and exploring, getting amazing loot, then you move into the bosses, very good fights that anyone can die to, finally you kill the last boss and you start just getting everything in the game. It takes hours of patience to get 1 item that you will only use for 10 minutes - but this part is optional - you don't need to do the grind, and of course there's cheat mods too. With 627 hours of playing I would say itis a very god game, just don't waste your life on it like me! :P			"

												Crafting, exploring, or fighting, whatever you choose player freedom is at the center of it all. It's up to you what you do in this world and that's what makes it so fun. Mining for new materials is a blast, and the more you find the more you can create. You can also tackle the various enemies about and hunt down some great bosses. Or you can avoid all that and just focus on shaping the environment around you and build a castle. Whatever you choose to ""Terraria"" is a constant source of player-created fun.			"

												A 2d sandbox game with randomly generated worlds.Offers a lot of hours of gameplay before you finally ""beat"" the game but you can enjoy it for quite a while even after that, due to the randomly generated worlds you can even enjoy starting anew, or you can raise tall structures and let out your creative mind.Think of Minecraft, except now it has a working combat system and is in 2D. Has a lot of boss fights, minibosses, rare encounterable mobs and plenty of spelunking to find rare treasure. There's also no confusing crafting system as everything you can make with your resources automatically shows up and you can ask the guide NPC about what can be made out of your materials.It's going to get a couple extra content updates at some point in the future but after that I would rule out ""new content"", still, the content already in the game should be enough to convince a purchase.

It has a ton of things it has many, many items like swords, magic stuff shields, etc. Terraria a lot of accessories and it makes it unique and fun. you always have the feeling of oh, I wanna get that item and that one and that one and you wanna craft and sell and buy there is just too many things to do and that's good. More than that there are many bosses and many enemies. If it compared to minecraft's skeleton creeper ender man and some pigment and slimes and one boss. You just need to buy one game for a humble amount of 10 $ that is always on sales and you will get many things and it's always updates . buy this game you wont regret!

												By the description, this would have been the next to last game that'd interest me (last would be anything hinting at ego shooter and/or vehicle simulations).When a friend streamed a game for me after I asked why everyone (on my friend list) was playing Terraria, I thought:  ""Want, please go on sale, want want want.""First day I had it (gift from a friend, 1 week before the kinda Halloween sale), 18 hours playtime. It's a great time sink. (Don't know whether that's a good thing, but I just don't notice the hours going by when having fun.)I'm not much for action, but I like building, at my own pace. Here I can build, and when I want to do something else, go whack a zombie over the head. Or throw foul eggs at the Idiot (aka Guide) when he opens the door and lets the zombies in at night. Or go on a (non-capital q) quest to find stuff to make better equipment.Even progression is at my pace. I can go beat up the next tougher boss, or not. Or ask a friend to host a new world where he and other friends help beat up a really tough boss that makes stuff available that I can then drag home to my peaceful world to continue building.I'm really into doing it my way, doing what I want, when I want, and this game lets me.Edit: Nominated for the Steam Awards from the Steam Autumn event started on 23.11.2016, for the ""Just 5 more minutes"" award.I still play the game now and then, and still forget the time. Oh, and the pot of coffee I made before I started playing, so I end up with that the next morning (after some sleep, finally, when I can't keep my eyes open any longer).Did I mention they are still doing updates with new content for the game? And all for the same price still! (Never mind the generous discounts you get during sales.)			"

Now I dont hate either infact both are pretty great games, but Terraria is just better heres why.- Better Graphics- More mobs- More armor- More weapons- Guns- More bosses (Minecraft has two Terraria has atleast 16)- Much better community than FNaF - If you think its a rip-off you probably watch this kid for entertainment

												Terraria is a great game, full of possibilities and can make you stay up to play (okay, maybe not... actually yeah). Do I have to say any more? You can turn it into an action game, a building game, an adventure game, you shape it by how you play it!  A very casual sandbox game. JUST GET IT AND START PLAYING! STOP READING!			"

												Oh here we go. First of all, If you like 2d sidescrollers you would like the consept of this game. Merge it with awsome bosses, wepons and uber cool events you got yourself a game. Terraria the jaw-droping game is cool because of stuff like mana. Ever used magic in a RPG and wanted to use it in a adventure game? Well now you can! There are also places like the Ice bioume, Crimson, Croupted, Jungle. And Mini bioumes like the bee hive, floating islands, and metors! There is also multiplayer, servers that can be 2p game, to capture the gem! Altough it loses points for not being always updated it regains them for Terraria 2. Software from here is good. I recommend this game for the First-Stop-Shoper thing. You make your own char and you get stronger when you play so I give this game a... *drumroll*  8/10! Don't get me wrong it's a good game but there are flaws like Rod of discord grapple flaw. It's been patched and stuff have chagned. I can't wait Till Terraria 2. Good game, Good second. There may even be a third. So did I do a good job? If you got it beacuse of me then...*blush* Thanks! You can also become my friend if you have it or get it. See ya later! "

												I dont know why I didnt make this review sooner.This game is really good, it has some major progression issues towards the late-middle to end game where they close off the wide variety they offered in the beginning and slim it down to only allowing you 2 or 3 choices per ""class"" (classes being magic, gun and melee oriented) but that doesnt stop it from being a fantastic experience that I highly reccomend.

												After reaching 800 hours, I think it's about time I wrote a review of this game. I've restarted my terraria save countless times over and I have never found an end to the joy I get it. Terraria offers it's own unique and thrilling experience the further you get into the game, whether it's spamming shurikens and knives at bosses, to picking away at ore pockets in the caverns and even just going about your stroll over to the oceon. Recently, I got playing this game again with a friend of mine, early on they kept asking 'when's the fun part?'. Once we actually had semi-decent gear, she finally said 'Oh yea, this part's pretty fun'. Long story short, keeping new friends to the game is a struggle but rewarding, best times are on expert mode where you can start ♥♥♥♥♥ing about who gets what and framing ♥♥♥♥ on each other.With the updates that game with this game such as the chaotic madness of 1.3, they've brought so much more to treat yourself with, and makes all the effort and time much more rewarding. How about the sountrack? There isn't a single decibel that i could complain about, it adds to the ambience and atomsphere of every level making the game even harder to leave.I took a look at the achievments and the percentage of people who've earnt them and I feel that not enough people are reaching these exciting components of the late game. People either than out of time or interest in the game and move on.  I can definately assue you that the game is worth every single penny.			"

												Terraria is in my opinion one of the best games ever made. I bought this game years ago, when I was still a little Steam-infant, and now that I am a full-grown Steam-man, the game still gets updated. The game still gets support, and that is absolutely amazing.I bought the game for about 2.50 and it has given me hours of joy. I would recommend this game to anyone I met on the street if it wouldn't make me a weirdo and even more of an outcast than I am right now, so I'll just do it the easy way and write a Steam review.So, go buy it, and play it, and look back at it after years and think: ""Wow, if I didn't spent all of those hours playing this fun game, I could have become a professor at Harvard."".And then think: ""♥♥♥♥ that, I'mma play me some Terraria.""

												For such a small game you get a lot of gameplay out of it and for it's cheap price you can't go wrong. I love the 2D style art work for this voxel side-scroller type game. It really is fun! A little bit slow to start but once you have built a base and got your first set of armour, everything else falls into place and the fun begins once you start killing bosses.You can get creative too and build some awesome stuff.

												It is a game of looting, killing, and patience. You start off mining and exploring, getting amazing loot, then you move into the bosses, very good fights that anyone can die to, finally you kill the last boss and you start just getting everything in the game. It takes hours of patience to get 1 item that you will only use for 10 minutes - but this part is optional - you don't need to do the grind, and of course there's cheat mods too. With 627 hours of playing I would say itis a very god game, just don't waste your life on it like me! :P			"

												Crafting, exploring, or fighting, whatever you choose player freedom is at the center of it all. It's up to you what you do in this world and that's what makes it so fun. Mining for new materials is a blast, and the more you find the more you can create. You can also tackle the various enemies about and hunt down some great bosses. Or you can avoid all that and just focus on shaping the environment around you and build a castle. Whatever you choose to ""Terraria"" is a constant source of player-created fun.			"

												This game is the stuff of legends. It's extremely replayable and just stays fun. It will stay that way forever. Redigit did a really  freakin' amazing job here. Some of you would say ""But Sharko! It's just a 2-D Minecraft!"" It is much more. So many more bosses and content. Sure, the worlds aren't infinite, but who cares? The non-3D just adds to it. It looks so amazing. There are even a few mods floating around. Don't like singleplayer? Invite one of your friends to play along. Want minigames and levelled survival? Go on the server list and pick a server. It has infinite replayability as you can see by my hours. One of my more advanced friends has nearly 4000. You can just keep playing. It's simply amazing. If you have it, go play it. Why are you on the reviews?! If you don't have it, buy it. It's definitely worth the $10.			"

												At first glance, Terraria is reminiscent of its popular 3D counterpart Minecraft. However, underneath its crafting, mining and exploration based surface, lies a game brimming with content and adventure. The game's main concepts revolve around the mining of various resources to craft new weapons and armours, or to design and build houses and structures. This crafting system ties in well with the game's combat and exploration aspects, and gives a greater sense of progression. There're many hidden treasures to be found, along with a multitude of customisation options. The combat is very fast paced and the amount of content featured is astonishing. Would highly recommend to anyone, whether they enjoy building, combat, or just exploring. Terraria's procedurally generated worlds offer endless opporunities and fun.			"

												After having put quite a few good hours into this game (and still going strong) I can say that it is worth the small price of getting it. Like some people, when I first came into Terraria, I exepcted something of a 2d Minecraft. After spending 40mins trying to figure out how to place a damn door, I realized that this really shouldn't be compared to Minecraft alone. This game feels like something of a hybrid between Minecraft and Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. Yes, it sounds strange to say that, but considering the items you can get, the boss battles, and the general atmosphere of the game, I feel that is pretty much what Terraria is. That being said, it is unique in a lot of ways and highly worth getting. It may be confusing, difficult, or frusterating at first (I didn't look at the wiki until at least a good 15 hours into it, so that might explain that), but once you pass that hump, it is quite enjoyable. Once again, it's worth getting.			"

With over 300 hours on my other account, I must say this is truly an amazing experience, well worth its price.Pros:Many, many weapons, blocks, accessories, bosses and fun stuff to doControls are very responsive, but they aren't really intuitive, it takes some time to get into them.Awesome chiptune-ish musicCharacter customizationCons:2D, obviouslyNeeds some balance changesCursor can lag with some graphic chips and is not easily visibleOther than these nitpicks, the game is flawless.If you're a fan of open-world sandbox games, this is definetly for you.It gets a 9,5/10 - Perfect			"

												First of all, I just want to press this issue: This is not a minecraft clone, or just ""2D Minecraft"" honestly, the most similarity they have is the concept of digging, building, and fighting. But it stops there. Even those concepts are so much more different from minecraft. It is a great game, and it has great replay value. It is more RPG focused than minecraft (Especially if you download Nterraria), and it can take real life weeks to get to ""Endgame"", at which point, you are ready to begin the mid level of game.Highly Reccomend.

												Similar to Minecraft, exploring randomly generated worlds where you collect resources like wood, stone, ores, gems and various other things. On the surface it may look like a simple 2D clone of Minecraft, but it’s extremely easy to get lost in exploring the world of Terraria.Pro: Insane amount of things to do, retro presentation and deep crafting.Cons: Huge learning curve and the game starts off slow.

												A really addictive game. You start playing and magically your clock's alarm rings for work, school or college...  ;-)Anyway, the game itself is not comparable to Minecraft, as many try to compare the games.Both parties appreciate the other party and I like that.You have a lot of fun digging (""grinding"") for ores and other secrets.There are countless of secrets to discover, for example hidden chests with really handy accessoires or weapons.There are NPCs which sell you things like ammunition or simply mana/health potions.They need a roof over their head, so you are asked to build/prepare them a proper home (and yourself too).I also like the fact that you (currently) do not skill or level up.The game simply builds around the fact of which kind of ore tier you are currently using.This is brilliant.You progrees the game by climbing the equipment ladder (armor/tools/weapons) and also fighting some bosses.The bosses are assential for certain materials (scale plates/demonite ore, later on ""souls"", used in crafting certain weapons/tools/accessoires) or to progress the game (Wall of Flesh boss, which enables the ""hard mode"" in your world).All in all a pretty enjoyable and inspiring game.It offers many different possibilities to develop your creativity (even if you are ""grown-up"" by age) and you will definitively enjoy a game with your friends or new friends.Simply put: A MUST BUY at any sale for usually 2-2.5 USD/EUR.For recipes and general advise have a look here:http://terraria.gamepedia.com/Terraria_Wiki/Terraria_Wiki "

												Terraria has got to be one of my favourite games in my lifeAlthough u may see that i havent played this as much coz i've always had Terraria cracked. It was only then Terraria was on Sale on steam so i decided to buy it to be kept up to the latest version automatically.Anywho, Terraria is a game where u go on adventures. Hunt, mine, dig, fish, craft, and build.Well, since a lot of people are comparing this to Minecraft, I'm gonna join in the fun!Some may say that Minecraft and Terraria are similar games but i can say that both are completely different. Having experienced both games, I noticed that Minecraft is much more creative in its mechanical aspect whereas Terraria is more RPG-like.CREATIVENESSITYMinecraft is 3D (Duh) and has a lot of different ways to build a house or an office tower by using all 3 dimensions to fit different designs for every wall.Terraria, being 2D, is limited in that structure as you're restricted to foreground and background only.FIGHTINGLYNESSITYMinecraft has limited combat as in its current state only has Swords and Bows. Although the tools can also be used as weapons but they are meant to be tools. The only way to expand this system is by installing mods unless Mojang adds more.Terraria consist of 3 different classes in its combat mechanics: Warrior, Ranger and Sorcerer. Warrior being the one with Melee weapons like Shortswords, Longswords, Polearms, Flails and Boomerangs also having the highest defense due to class-based armor. Ranger, one with the Bows, Repeaters and Guns has the highest DPS. Sorcerer is mainly the support class but its the longest lasting class as they have the ability to heal others or themselves if they are equipping the endgame armor.NOTE: In Minecraft, there's Enchanting to improve weapons and armor with higher values of damage and resistance respectively. In Terraria, you have prefixes that changes a weapon's stats negatively or positively.NON-PLAYABLE-CHARACTERSNESSITYMinecraft has villagers as NPCs. Consist of a Farmer, Blacksmith, Priest, Librarian and Butcher.Terraria has multiple NPCs and are unique in their own way. Consist of the Guide, Nurse, Merchant, Painter, Dye Trader, Demolitionist, Dryad, Arms Dealer, Party Girl, Stylist, Angler, Goblin Tinkerer, Witch Doctor, Clothier, Mechanic, Pirate, Truffle, Steampunker, and Cyborg.You are also able to get Santa himself as an NPC.Each and every one of these Terrarian NPCs has a randomly generated list of names.BOSSNESSITYMinecraft has the Ender Dragon and the Wither.Terraria has the Eye of Cthulhu, King Slime, Eater of Worlds, Brain of Cthulhu, Queen Bee, Skeletron, Wall of Flesh, The Twins, Destroyer, Skeletron Prime, Plantera, Golem and Duke Fishron. On the console and mobile version of Terraria, there's the Ocram and Lepus.There's more bosses for Terraria but they are Event based.BIOMENESSITYMinecraft has a very very long list of Biomes but they only vary in height and scale like Plains, Mountains, and Oceanic. To summarise the list of biomes: Grasslands, Forests, Jungles, Oceans, Deserts, Savanna, and Mesa. Including some weird looking biomes such as the Nether, Mushroom, and The End.Terraria seem to fall short on the variety of biomes as to summarise them: Forest, Desert, Jungle, Corruption, Crimson, Mushroom, Ocean, Hallow, and Space.That is about all for my Review although it's more of a comparison.I just want to say that Terraria seemed to be longer lasting due to its rich content without mods. However, Minecraft also has much to provide for but falls short when compared out of the creativity aspect.To conclude - Get Terraria if you're the type of person who loves APRGs that doesnt have regenerated maps.Get Minecraft if you love to travel far and wide to explore undiscovered structures such as the Ocean Monument and/or Desert Pyramids.I personally recommend Terraria to any sandbox / RPG lovers out there. Seriously, i've spent more than 2 years playing this game and i am not tired of it.My final verdict for Terraria is an 8/10			"

												This game is basically a level-up sandbox. You don't actually get levels and stats to increase (except health and mana), but you get stronger via equipment. The point of this game is basically to kill things and obtain certain materials to get stronger and kill more things and find even better materials while finding some cool stuff along the way to build your house or make your house look prettier with.Those who like the level-up aspect are going to enjoy the wide variety of accessories and weapons to mess with. The people who enjoy the sandbox part are going to enjoy building their houses/building with all the different kinds of materials and furnitures.Replay value gets bland after a while. You can make a new character and get more items again (maybe even new items) in your new playthrough, but after a while when you get most of the items and you've beaten all the bosses the game starts getting repetitive and bland. If you're really creative though, you'll probably enjoy the game for a while longer thinking of new things to build.Overall, I like this game, but I think if you're going to get it you should just wait for it to go on sale.

												With the recent update (1.3) adding steam integration which allows multiplayer without hamachi or portforwarding, I can safely say this is a game that should be in everyone's steam library. It's a 2d sandbox adventure that not only has it to where you can craft a bunch of stuff, it also has it to where you fight bosses, loot chests, and a lot of other things that you'd expect in an adventure-sandbox game. It also includes tons of references from Lovecraft's Cthulhu to some of the NPC quotes referencing movies like castaway.So yeah, if you're a fan of adventure-sandboxes, then this should be a no-brainer, pick this game up now!

												Terraria is a 2D-based Sandbox game, where the players were asked to survive and thrive in a gradually changing environment as you progress through the storyline. For some reason, if you turned on the music the game's tone gets darker and scarier so I suggest don't turn on the game SFX and Music to avoid cardiac arrest (jk).Singleplayer Review:The game gets interesting when you acquire something special from a dungeon (underground, overground, sky island). Some of these acquired items can actually summon a powerful beings (mainly called Bosses in game dictionary) at night. These creatures will be your biggest nightmare when you didn't see them coming from a mile away.My point is, this game helps to develop your preparation abilities before a fight-to-death battle. Which can be applied in real world as well if used correctly. The gameplay is perfect for a sandbox game, but it's 2D you can't really expect much in architecture design unlike Minecraft.Multiplayer Review:Since the game was greenlit into the Steam Market in around 2011, this game developed and everlasting community where you can enjoy and relax the madness of the servers available to play. You don't have to go to the dungeon and look for a summoning items, you just need to ask the admin kindly to spawn it (which I usually does with my friends' server (yes I was an admin )). After a while, this game's popularity decreased due to limited gameplay or the game era we're living in right now.Hope in the future:The community that crumbles to dust can be rebuilt into an everlasting group of people full of enjoyment and excitement playing the game, instead of screaming around after they die.Infinitesimally's Rating of Critical Injury7.8/10 "

												Самым молодым представителем этого нового семейства на данный момент выступает Terraria.Процедурной генерацией разработчики балуются давно. Можно вспомнить всеми любимую Diablo 2, где практически все локации для каждого героя были уникальны. Подземелья, равнины, пустыни и разнообразные пещеры — все это создавала сама игра, найти два одинаковых места было невозможно. Ну, кроме городов и обиталищ сюжетных боссов.Terraria — это ни в коем случае не клон Minecraft. У нее совершенно иная внутренняя философия. Это приключение, не привносящее в жанр ничего нового, но обильно и очень уместно заимствующее чужие идеи. Правда, после того, как будут найдены самые мощные вещи, станет резко скучно.Плюсы: уникальные и интересные миры; огромное количество рецептов и простота крафта; «живой» мультиплеер; приятная пиксельная графика.Минусы: быстро надоедающий саундтрек; завышенная сложность в «сингле»; невозможность начать без дополнительной базовой подготовки.

												This game is epic for many reasons. For starters, people may buy this game because of its similarity to minecraft, but its much more deserving of that! Terraria has developers that not only keep in contact with its fans, but releases updates regularily (major content patch in ~1 week) and is still considered to be in ""beta"" stage, as it has so many paths it could follow.Sure, the game might have a small interest for re-playing as a new character, but as i said, its still a beta, and the Devs have confirmed they are working on that problem, this game will return every penny you spend tenfold, with its long game-span, as you start out a a noob and work up to Hell-stone gear. This can be as easy or as hard as you want it to be, with a large community and online resources and options to learn more / tweak the game to you're difficulty (coming soon in 1.0.5).Definate buy!!!<3, Leo :)			"

												This game, is incredible. I swear, look at my hours. 300+ hours of fun! I still haven't even beaten the game yet after 300 hours... mostly because it is a true challenge. I reccomend this game to hardcore gamers. If you aren't good with hard survival games that can be confusing at the beggining if no videos or people tell you anything about it. AND IT IS NOT ANYTHING LIKE MINECRAFT SO STOP SAYING THAT! Here are some tips throughout the game:First, get wood and make houses so that you and NPCs can live in them. For it to be a valid house, you need to have solid blocks, no  holes in the wall, a table and chair, and a background wall.Next, go mining and exploring. Don't forget to bring torches, NIGHT AND CAVES ARE REALLY DARK WITHOUT LIGHT.You may find cool gadgets that you can equip in your inventory, also, you should make some armor.Next, fight bosses such as the eye of cthulu and get even better gear.You can go and fight skeletron at the end of the world and have access into the dungeon.Keep playing the game and progressing further.Next, go to the bottom of the world, make a long, straight, pathway and then throw a guide voodoo doll into lava and fight the wall of flesh.You will now be in hardmode which makes a new biome and every enemy is buffed incredibley.I will let you continue from there on your own. Have fun :)			"

GeneralTerraria is a survival 2D RPG with free content updates, randomly generated worlds, and overall a masterpiece done right. Build, dig, chop, fight and survive are the 5 major elements in Terraria. Enemies that are small, to major bosses, you'll have your hands tied in an experience so great you don't want to stop playing.Terraria has proven to be one of the best 2D survival games for its multiplayer to play with friends, down to the part where it can be very hardcore to master. Terraria also has simple character creation, basically changing the color of your character's hair, body, etc.Building in Terraria is very basic and honestly great at times. Kill bosses to unlock npcs, build traps to protect your home from invasions or master it all with endgame gear. Yes, that's right: gear. Terraria has thousands of items to sell, keep or fight with. If you think you've done it all, re-think that.With a new team re-developing Terraria, they have made the expectations high for Terraria: reworking a lot of in-game features and adding brand new features like fishing or mounts to make you play even longer!My OpinionStill actively developed, Terraria is just one of those overwhelming games, if you've experienced it. Character creation is basic, which why would it be crazy? Half the armor you get in-game will basically cover your character up. Multiplayer is fun  when you play with friends, basically creating great structures, down to owning bosses. Terraria has been one of my favorite, well put together games ever since it released and when it was picked up to be continued via development.Thousands of items to collect, hundreds of bosses to kill, possibly thousands of enemies to conquer, and world changing difficult experiences.Terraria will keep you playing for a long time.OverallI have no complaints. Terraria is a great game overall.Rating: 10/10			"

												TL; DR: I like this game a lot, but the Multiplayer on it, if you have no friends, is trash.Terraria is a game that, just like Minecraft, is about Survival and Building.The similarities stop there.While Minecraft is focused on Building (Being 3D), Terraria is mostly about the Survival and Discovery, which translates, in-game, to Explore, Get Materials and Progress.I recommend not using a Guide (Asides from the in-game ""Guide"" NPC), unless you really cannot advance. If you must, search ""Terraria Wiki"" on google, and read away.It has building as well, some more options than MC offers, including a wider selection of blocks and colors as well. Only things that ruin it, for me, are the lack of NPCs (For huge houses/cities) and the finite world (Get Starbound, if you want to build rather than survive, albeit they are adding hunger next update).The game is flawless, as long as you don't use the Cloud...--Not Affecting GAME Review--As for the community, it's trash, consisting of the Item Trinity, which are people who give items (Usually End-game, therefore ruining the Discovery aspect), which I call ""Item Givers"", a certain world containing every item in the game (Also destroying ""Discovery""), which I call ""Item Worlds"" and those servers with the equivalent of MC's ""/give"" command, ruining the Discovery and Exploration aspects; I call those ""Item Servers"".Basically, if you want Discovery to be at it's max, avoid the ""Item Trinity"" (Item Giver, Item World and Item Server)....It's also overrun by kiddies who can't even type correctly, let alone play.

												I'm going to do a review for the game ""Terraria."" This game is an action-packed 2D sandbox game developed by Re-Logic. I honestly love this game prior to it's cons. So this game is an adventure game, where you defeat monsters and bosses, and face challenges you've never experienced in other video games. Craft some armor, get your weapons ready, and your on a roll already. This will get you addicted to the game from the adventuring throughout your progress. I absolutely reccomend getting this game. It is SO fun. If you ever get bored sometime or have frusturation, go on a server, or make an incredible house to get you pumped up. The graphics are great and the community is full of friendly people. Get this game. It's worth for only $10. Trust me on this review. You will love Terraria.			"

It is SO fun. If you ever get bored sometime or have frusturation, go on a server, or make an incredible house to get you pumped up. The graphics are great and the community is full of friendly people. Get this game. It's worth for only $10. Trust me on this review. You will love Terraria.			"

This review explains why mediumcore difficulty is the best choice for playing the primary RPG campaign of Re-Logic's survival crafting game Terraria.[. . .] Re-Logic's continued support and improvement of this already wonderful game has turned it into one of the deepest crafting-based adventure games ever made. And if you take my mediumcore advice, I think you’ll find your entire countless-hours campaign in Terraria to be satisfying, engaging, and surprisingly immersive.

												An overall interesting game, the idea of a 2D Minecraft confuses and interests me at the same time since I played the much hated Minecraft for many years before eventually switching over to Steam games in general. There really is not much to say about this game as it is really straight forward, but I'll give it a shot.I would like to start off by saying I have played a limited amount of time with this game and I have limited knowledge of it, so please understand this as you read my review. The first positive thing is the idea of the game. Someone has gone ahead and made a simpler version of MineCraft at a cheaper price (sort of). But honestly, that's also a negative, great idea, but you ripped it off someone...Now onto the actual game, it's frustrating that's for sure, in the 1 hour that I played it I made a good underground house (imo) and I was beginning to like it, then in about the period of 5 minutes I died maybe 5-6 times and my house became ridden with creatures. Certainly not the start I was looking for, but fun to deal with. In the next .7 hours it became apparent that I was a 'noob' the amount of crafting recipes and formulas was never ending, and I realised that this was not a simplified MineCraft, but rather a more advanced Minecraft...There, that's all I learnt from like 1.7 hours of it, do as you please, I sit on the fence.Overall Rating: 7/10 "

												I had terraria on the xbox 360 for the longest time. Didn't hear about much about things that were pc only.Then I heard about 1.3 and knew I had to get it for pc. It is MUCH better on pc. EVERYTHING!I know most people think ""Oh, minecraft has mods it's much better!"" or ""This is a minecraft rip off!"". Minecraft and terraria were going to be the same game. Don't know why they aren't. they came out about a week apart. Also, minecraft NEEDS mods to be fun.Also, any questions I will answer.Edit: Minecraft is actually fun in creative. That's about it.

												Terraria is one of the best games I have ever played, there are people out there dense enough to say that it is basically a minecraft copy-off except 2d instead of 3d just because you craft, which is pretty stupid onsidering Terraria has much more diffrent elements in it and crafting is only one of the smaller things you do in the game, thats like saying TF2 is Minecraft because you craft items in it, see what I mean? Aside from that Terraria has over 3000 items in it, bosses, armor, vanity items, items used to customize you character and much more! I definitelty recommend Terraria to anybody any age.10/10.Ok, the review above was written by edgy 13-year old me. I would like to redo this while also being able to have a good laugh about the older one,Terraria is basically a 2D action-adventure sandbox video game developed by Re-Logic. The game has over 3000 items in it by itself. Mods can easily expand and break that barrier with mods such as the Exxo Avalon mod, the N Terraria mod, the Tremor mod, the Necro mod, etc. Obviously for a 10 dollar at max game this is a huge ammount of content to recieve for such a good price, every there are a lot of unique and interesting items in the game and many mechanics, weapons, armor, accessories and block types to explore and have fun with. The game also has 15 bosses and 2 events. The overall item balancing is also pretty solid, it does feel that the gameplay has a certain order to it, but it's so well done and interesting that I do tend to forget about it. Overall the game is fun as hell and a really easy time waster. Got back into it after about a year of NOT playing it and played quite literally 30 hours in 4 days (Exxo Avalon mod, I'm also sick so I can get away with that ♥♥♥♥ :D) go buy it.			"

Must buy at any price [✓]
Worth the money but wait for a small sale [x]
Wait for a huge discount [x]
Avoid at all costs [x]Terraria, a game that offers tons of things to do, seriously look up how many items exist in this game...This game is reffered by many to ""2D Minecraft"" , don't let that fool you as this has ALOT more to offer...This game sadly isn't very story based but it's still an amazing experience especially with friends. The Beginning/Pre HardmodeIt starts of pretty slowly and like any survival game, get wood , build stuff to survive and get weapons/armor to survive. This however allows you to start off however you want, try speedrunning to a dungeon to get good items, or start of slowly and nicely and just collect wood and oresThen you'll start getting into the boss fight/even farming some, in Terraria you get a chance of getting 1 of these 2 worlds, the ""Crimson"" world and the ""Corrpution"" world. These are quite important but keep in mind they're biomes, they have different items/bosses in the 2 biomes, both are very unique aswell, theres 4 bosses in the beginning of the new world, the Corruption and Crimson biomes both have different bosses but it doesn't change the number of how many you can beat.You'll get to the ""Devil of the world"" which is called ""WoF , Wall Of Flesh"" and is the hardest ""Pre Hardmode"" boss you can get and definately the final one for this mode... Hardmode / End Game After you beat the Wall of Flesh you'll free ""The Spirits of the World"" and then your Crimson/Corruption will slowly spread across your world, theres going to be a new biome! More enemies / items, MORE BOSSES! And more challenges ahead of you, the game basically does this""Hey player! You just killed the Wall of Flesh! Have this awesome item!""Player:""Thanks! This is easy now!""Terraria""EASY?! Well you're doomed now!""You get 7 more bosses now! Double (Possibly TRIPLE) the items/enemies unlocked and you'll die alot at first, you'll then get Invasion events! You'll get invaded for a whole day in Terraria (Or less if you're OP) and keep dying, those are exciting though as you get items and a non stop fight experience, after you kill all the bosses many players consider it finished but there's more... Expert Mode / Character Levels Expert mode! Basically you start off with Hardmode and then get Expert mode which is double to triple as difficult as Hardmode...so have fun at looking at the ""You have died"" screen, there's a plus though!Limited to Expert only Items1 ""End game boss"" <-- considered to manyAnd overall a bigger challengeCharacter levels are something that you get when creating your character and theresSoftcore Mode - On death lose coinsMediumcore Mode - On death lose itemsHardcore Mode - On death you die permanently, gg rip character Servers / Item Servers Servers to play with friends! Easy to set up with Steam and overall good quality for how simple it is (You do get lag spikes if you're on a friends server unless its a LAN) and there's public servers that are amazing! There's actually custom gamemodes made by the community (1 or 2 were staged for multiplayers by devs!)Gamemodes found on servers (Keep in mind not all are listed these are examples)Capture the  DiamondPortal Gun MapsTeam DeathmatchBoss Battle Arenaand alot more!Item servers are a sort of problem of people spawning in items into chests and anyone can take them! Even the Expert mode items which sort of ruins the players/feelings of beating the boss legit but knowing people get those items for free by going on a item server...Keep in mind you don't get somehow banned/ your character deleted if you go on an item server, I haven't heard officialy if servers get put down if they give out free god mode items but I did see some get shut down (Unknown reasons) Mods and Modded Maps You get mods for items and modded maps for challenges / gamemodes (Portal maps /Team Deathmatch maps etc.) Thank you for reading this :) Like I said already this is my longest review / the review I put most time in and I'd like to thank you for reading all of this :)			"

!! This review will be deleted after revision is made !!Terraria. A 2-Dimensional adventure in a pixelated reality. There isn't a specific objective for this game. (From my experience,) you're free to explore and do whatever you feel should be your goal.My opinions of it all:The GoodIt does have a few elements that remind me of Minecraft, but I wouldn't be one to say that majority of it is so. The soundtrack was nice, pleasant, relaxing. I found my expeditions to the unknown rather amazing; the randomly-generated worlds were astonishing to me upon first site. Those enemies, too. If only I could see more!The BadI don't know anything that I may need to speak of that I would consider bad about this game.OverallI haven't had a lot of experience in this game yet, but I did enjoy what I've been able to do before things happened. After I fix and survive my computer conflicts, I'll have this game another gander and edit this review for farther explanations. I wouldn't necessarily use this review to determine whether (you) want this game or not yet.--Sir Shinigami.			"

												When I first bought this game I wanted an old style scroller, with a Minecraft feel. Knowing that there are a lot of games similar to Minecraft, I had a lot of games to look at. One game that kept on coming up was Terraria. I knew my friends had played it, but I didn't know much about it. I decided, ""Heck, I'll give it a shot."" Little did I know...Wow, this game is hard. Let me rephrase that. It is more difficult than I thought. When the night comes, you better have a shelter, or else the monsters are gonna mess you up. It also has a lot of stuff to do. Build, craft, fight, mine, multiplayer... I'm still getting into it, but so far, I like what I see.			"

												What is Terraria, would I say? Nope. At least I can describe it quite a bit, it's 2D sandbox game, like anybody else said. But you will never know how it's good. Many of people might think this is a copy of Minecraft, but not really. Many of unique things are here. Unique mechanicsm. Bosses, combat to make up your frustration on your way of game, and what it's best is it's sandbox game where you're not limited to do anything, of course. These game types allow us to have some more diffuculty settings in our head, see Capture the Gem, Drow Elf, or some such so much there. Just really, don't know what to say, do it yourself.			"

												This game is CRACK.  If you're not obsessed with graphics, and enjoy sandbox games, you'll probably like this.  If you're a bit OCD, you'll probably be unable to stop playing.  The combination of combat, crafting, and exploring is phenomenal.  Every time I think I've done everything, I realize I've only scratched the surface. Since I first bought the game, it has had multiple rounds of massive, free content additions, and there's so much in the game now, it's hard to keep up with everything.  This will satisfy your urge to explore and just noddle around and build stuff. The boss fights are pretty epic as well.			"

But once you find informations on that terraria gives you much more options on killing and beating bosses with combat styles that you like.Building blocks are unique but a bit limited, compared to other games I've played.

												Oh, My Good Friend Terraria...What Can I Say About It? It's Highly Regarded By Me And Many Friends Of Mine. We Play Terraria Constantly. And In Short, We Favor It HIGHLY Over Minecraft. Reasons Are That You Have More Ways To Fight, More Weapons, More Gore (Hellz Yea!), And More Everything Than Minecraft EVER Would Have. Plus, MInecraft Updates Are Tiny And Don't Give ♥♥♥♥. Terraria Updates, While They Takes SOO Much Longer To Come Out, Produce MASSIVE Amounts Of Things That Make The Game SOO Much Better. In Minecraft, It's Diamond Set And You're God, Simple As That. In Terraria, It's So Much More Than That. You Don't Just Become God In Terraria, You Fight For Your Immortality. You Gain And You Seek Out The Loot That Rarely Rarely Drops. You Seek Out More Than Just Diamond Godmode, You Seek Out The Thrill Of Constant Battle, And Risk Yourself, But The Risk Just Adds To The Thrill. Even The Strongest Armor In The Game Doesn't Make You A God, It Just Makes You Harder To Kill. Diamond Armor In Minecraft Is Just A Stupid Godmode For Cowardly Players Who Don't Give Two ♥♥♥♥s About Risk. Plus, Minecraft Is So Much More Costly, For Features That We Don't Really Give Two ♥♥♥♥s About. So In Short, Terraria Outmatches Minecraft In Ways So Numerous, And So Amazing, Nothing Beats Them. Plus, Minecraft's Combat Is Just Poke Poke Poke Poke Ded. Terraria's Combat Is Shooting, Slicing n Dicing, And Spellcasting. Suck On That, Minecraft!			"

												Addictive little surprise of a game.  Reminds me of an ancient video game I played as a kid called Below the Root, but with zombies.   Generates a entirely random pixelated little world to explore populated with creatures, monsters, treasure and adventure.   Build shelter from the zombies at night, mine, craft weapons and explore above and below ground.  Don't like the world?  Just destroy it and create a new one to live in.  Really Cool!			"

												I can't believe I hadn't review this game earlier. It's one of the best, if not THE best game out there. That is, if you like sandbox/adventure/rpg games. It has great replay value. I'd recommend it to everyone that doesn't yet own it. Even if you don't like this type of game, try it. You might like it anyway.			"

												Before about 100 hour playing this, I was having fun, but once I play it for 100+ hour, I started become bored, so since that I did'nt play terraria for about 1 year I guess ?, then I started watching some terraria video from Baum Production, since that I wan to play terraria again. I was going to play a modded terraria, but sadly my Graphic Card broke  when I play dota so I cant play terraria. I don know why its broke.My opinion, the gameplay are great, the mechanic, the graphic are nice, even the music too, Planterra OST is my favorite. What i'm dissapoint is, the mecha boss does'nt have a new mechanic in expert mode, and other boss like golem does'nt have it too. and re-logic should add more throwing weapon, like an upgraded shuriken, such as explosive shuriken, bouncy shuriken, ETC.I give this game rating 9 out of 10if the mechanical boss have new mechanic in expert mode, I give the game 10I recomend you to buy this game if you like a sandbox, action, and other.Sorry if my review bad, this is my first time writing a serious review, I always saying like ""Best game"" when i review, but this time, NO, i will serious. I will try my best.			"

												What is Terraria, would I say? Nope. At least I can describe it quite a bit, it's 2D sandbox game, like anybody else said. But you will never know how it's good. Many of people might think this is a copy of Minecraft, but not really. Many of unique things are here. Unique mechanicsm. Bosses, combat to make up your frustration on your way of game, and what it's best is it's sandbox game where you're not limited to do anything, of course. These game types allow us to have some more diffuculty settings in our head, see Capture the Gem, Drow Elf, or some such so much there. Just really, don't know what to say, do it yourself.			"

												First and foremost, I don't really like Minecraft. Yup, I said it. And after seeing all the reviews comparing this game to Minecraft, I was completely disinterested. I would've never even played it if my brother hadn't purchased me a copy. For his sake I played it, just so he wouldn't feel like he completely wasted his money. Two months later, I haven't played any other game! Upon my initial playthrough, the obvious similiarities between Terraria and Minecraft were obvious: Collect, craft, build. But it took on a different charm as a 2-D platformer. There is more to do than just craft and build. There are boss fights, events, fighting/maintaining the corruption/crimson/hallow, and numerous NPCs to interact with. You can cxperience the different biomes (forest, snow, swamp, etc), with their own unique creatures and dangers.Bottom line: If you like Minecraft, get it. If you don't like Mincraft, get it. It's a fun game that has a TON of replay value and is just simply fun.			"

												This game has given me 90% of my steam hours, and everyday I find myself looking to see if it updated. This game is a fantstic game and allows you to do a huge amount of stuff. Do you love tower defense? Summon the pirate invasion and protect your helpless NPCs. Love building? With over 200 different blocks, you'll never run out of things to build. Love killing harmless creatures by blowing off their limbs? Go right ahead. Honestly, if you have the slightest bit of imagination, you can do pretty much anything you want. My only disapointmentis that some of the drop chances are so low, they might as well be unobtainable, but most of these items are novelty and aren't required to beat the game.			"

												This game is CRACK.  If you're not obsessed with graphics, and enjoy sandbox games, you'll probably like this.  If you're a bit OCD, you'll probably be unable to stop playing.  The combination of combat, crafting, and exploring is phenomenal.  Every time I think I've done everything, I realize I've only scratched the surface. Since I first bought the game, it has had multiple rounds of massive, free content additions, and there's so much in the game now, it's hard to keep up with everything.  This will satisfy your urge to explore and just noddle around and build stuff. The boss fights are pretty epic as well.			"

												9/10Terraira gives you more of a RPG feeling, with fewer guidence on what to do next, it could be confusing to know what you are actually supposed to do. But once you find informations on that terraria gives you much more options on killing and beating bosses with combat styles that you like.Building blocks are unique but a bit limited, compared to other games I've played. Similar game that I like : Starbound, if you enjoied Terraria you will love this game as well.Starbound made me abondon this game "

												It is a great and enjoyable game and no it is not really a sandbox, sure you can build, but the game focuses more on getting better loot, similar to borderlands 2 or the such. This game also has a ridiculous amount of content in it, which is something I love, where you kill 1 boss just to realize you have 5000 more to kill.			"

												Many people call Terraria '2D Minecraft'. While that is true in the sense that it has mining, construction, and sandbox aspects, Terraria is so much more. Hundreds of items, swarms of unique enemies, and 'easy to play hard to master' gameplay makes for a very well rounded experience. Don't let the pixelated graphics or the side-scrolling aspect turn you away. The dynamic lighting is very nice. Carrying a torch will light up the area around you. You can throw glow sticks down into caves to see what's ahead. You can even buy a mining helmet, and won't have to worry about carrying a light with you at all! One of the things I found impressive was the way liquids work. Water settles. Lava flows the way one would imagine lava should flow. Want to flood an entire cave? Dig a tunnel from the ocean and let it flow. All in all, Terraria is a spectacular game. It has multiplayer support, and the combat system ties in well with that. The most recent update (1.2) has effectively /doubled/ the saize of an already impressive game. Would recommend to anyone.			"

												I can't tell you more about this game, other than it's original, creative, funny. if you think Building is going to be stupid because this is 2D, you are very mistaken. There are tiles like tables, chairs, plates, windows, ovens,furnaces, sinks, toilets. Anything you can think of, for EVERY tile in the game ( or almost every) Building can be more creative than all of those Take-Your-Money ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Steve-♥♥♥♥-craft games out there. Multiplayer works amazingly.Almost no major bugs. Extremely fun and addictive.If you're looking at this reccomendation considering buying the game.

												Terraria is a Teen rated sandbox sidescroller where you create a charecter, fight monsters, search for supplies, build communities and of course hang with friends. Now when I first played this, I wasen't a noob. (I played it on Xbox)  I knew instantly how to play. Enough bragging about my winnings. It's time to give you what you wan't. This game is well known for it's bosses & minions. It's also known for it's badass level customization. Like...uh. You want to dress up like that alien from Aliens? Well now you can get it & wear it ingame. Some bosses include skeletron, the eater of worlds, eye of cthulhu and the very own twins. Most of these bosses require you to think of a way to trap them, attack them or block them. And now you say...What else is here? I like what I hear.Well timmy, I shall say that last up is the biomes or places.Inside this game there a lots of places for you to visit..such as: Space, Hell, Underground (cave), underwater, juungle, desert and the winter forest. Now this game arouses you, you say? Well. GO BUY IT THEN!			"

You can throw glow sticks down into caves to see what's ahead. You can even buy a mining helmet, and won't have to worry about carrying a light with you at all! One of the things I found impressive was the way liquids work. Water settles. Lava flows the way one would imagine lava should flow. Want to flood an entire cave? Dig a tunnel from the ocean and let it flow. All in all, Terraria is a spectacular game. It has multiplayer support, and the combat system ties in well with that. The most recent update (1.2) has effectively /doubled/ the saize of an already impressive game. Would recommend to anyone.			"

												One of the most addictive games ever made, there are lots of things to explore, craft, build and fight. The game is getting new content from time to time without any additional costs and provides multiple hours of fun.			"

												at first glance, this looks like 2-D minecraft. nothing special. a straight downgrade. however, when you take the time to play the game for yourself, you find its a lot more than that. it may not have the extra dimension or creative mode that minecraft has, but it more than makes up for it in a lot more weapons and weapon types, more bosses, npc characters that sell a wide variety of stuff, and the multiplayer, while it can be frustrating and slow sometimes, is pretty easy to get going and fun. if you have the money for this game, definately give it a try.

												Although Terraria is lacking the 'Metroidvania' tag, this game is the absolute gem in this genre. It even offers you the choice to progress as melee, ranged or magic. Lots of new events and stuff to discover after every stage. Loads of things to discover if you keep looking.So many genres and good aspects of gaming distilled into one masterpiece called Terraria. The best part is that it's only $10, or even less! "

												Personally I prefer Terraria over Starbound.Reasons:Terraria costs lessStarbound didnt offer the same experience as terraria did for me, however thier not really the same game either but if it comes to choosing one over the other I'd say buy Terraria as it will deliver much more fun in the long run.Bosses in Terraria are much more intressting and better overall			"
