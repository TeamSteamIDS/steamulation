												This is one of the hardest reviews that I’ve had to write to this date. And it’s hard because I’m giving this game a negative review, even though I love the game and they’ve pretty much been serving long time vets a sh*t sandwich for years now. A bit of background info I started playing this game back in 2009. I’ve been a premium player ever since I began playing. It's safe to say I like the game. Combat System The combat system is challenging, fun, and one of the best combat implementations I’ve ever seen in an MMORPG. It requires you to pay attention and be on the ball with things, both for melee and for mage.Stereotype archtype classes do not exist here. Healers are expected and are capable of healing and dpsing at the same time, and tanks are capable of dpsing while being meatshields in raids. You can take on many roles for groups if you know how to play your class well enough. Graphics Beautiful, realistic graphics, that in 2008, outclassed practically every other game out there, and still manage to stand well against newer mmorpgs today.  Roleplay Ok, I’m going to be bluntly honest here. The Roleplaying community in this game is absolutely toxic. Toxic. Yes, I had to reiterate it. And it’s toxic because it’s the same twenty or so people playing childish, dramatic games with one another, metagaming, and making bland RP guilds that end up imploding because they squabble with one another every three or four months like clockwork.  PvPPicture it: Sicily, 1998Twelve men are having a contest to see who can pee the furthest. One side has taken Viagra and the other side hasn’t. The side that hasn’t taken the Viagra urinates all over everyone. The side that has taken the Viagra begin to complain because they cannot pee at all. They begin smacking eachother with their peens in frustration.Now envision them hopping around wildly and telling one another they coited eachothers moms.Now envision the “I boinked yer mum” banter being in your global all day and night. This is PvP on Age of Conan. Lackluster Free to Play systemAge of Conan has an okay but restrictive Free to Play system. You are limited to one toon per account (unless you were a member, buy toon slots, or had a free account before the f2p revamp) of which you can choose any class. You get access to whatever you buy, ie, if you buy Khitai you can access t4 raids. Gold cap is 10g which sucks given the player driven economy of goods has items that cost well over 500 gold. Poor Management of game You know, how on most MMORPGS, they do little events and special deals to celebrate the game’s birthday? They actually used to do that for this game. And it was fun. They used to do little seasonal events, like other games too. And then, it’s almost like they stopped caring. Almost? They did stop caring. They implemented worldbosses, which was a step in the direction of negating any purpose of going to t1-3 raids, they no longer had to do a winter event, because they could use the excuse that the worldbosses for December and January went back to back. Then, for the last two years… slap in the faces to the community. 7th anniversary, they release a new content pack, (which you think would be a good thing) and then made us buy it. Our 8th anniversary was last month, and we got a free pet… that was a recolor of a pet that already existed in the game… and then… they turned on double AA points after there was a backlash from the community. No subscription deals, nothing.Now, you think they would learn after years of poor management and poor decisions… but this is Funcom, and they do and say things that surprise you and make you lower your expectations of them… and then make you keep lowering those expectations. Item Store Revamp and Membership changes Fast forward a couple weeks past the 8th anniversary of the game, and you’ll see they let us know they were going to revamp the item store because of its clunkiness (there was no clunkiness, you just had to actually pay attention) and wanted to make it “easier for people to get back into the game”Whats in the item store now? Well it’s certainly not their best selling items like social gear! Nooo… Now you can buy yourself an 80 in full t3 raid gear! Now you can pay money to gear yourself up in t4 and t5 raid gear without ever having to to go into those nasty raid instances again where you might have to do actual work for gear! Now you can buy 4 hour magic damage increase potions that are 400% more expensive then what they were before! Now your item store will open automatically trying to get you to buy things as you level up! Now you can call it “Age of Cashgrab!”And on top of that, they’re changing membership. So now vets are losing perks that they have earned, such as offline levels and vet tokens will be discontinued. All premium perks will be better suited towards new subscribers and fresh 80s. And they do this, because they love us long time vets…  Because they love us… and need our money... to fund TSW's and Conan Exiles's newest content.  Update 5.0: The update that shook the world  On 30th June, 2016 Funcom patched the game to its newest update and it packed in new things that I figured I'd give an update on. For starters, there's lag! No surprise there. Among the new things is that people who are f2p can now enter Khitai if they purchase (or purchased) the expansion. You can now do t2 and t3 raids! If you ever bought anything from AoC, such as points, an expansion, or membership directly from Funcom you get Dragonspine for free. This looks good on paper until you realize the fact that the f2p goldcap has not been increased, making it impossible for f2p players to buy upgraded gear.The item store also broke for a while, with the new loyalty claims and item store not delivering items to people. It took me over 24 hours and FOUR petitions to get some of the stuff I bought with my bonus points that Funcom allotted me due to my subscription.The Raid Finder system is.... interesting. One dungeon a week. Where people can join and afk the entire thing! Just like the world boss and minigames! And these people who afk cannot be kicked by the raid leader. Loot system is also different, giving t4 relics and tears along with t3 drops.  With a bit more fine tuning this could be a decent system that gives people a chance to see a raid area they might not otherwise get to go to.Loyalty Rewards for being subbed are a mixed bag for me. Offering things like vanity gear, feat specialization chart, and mounts.. with a spider mount being part of the higher tier rewards if you sub for a year. The spider mount looks aesthetically pleasing to me, but doesnt really fit in with the lore of the game.5.0 gave us a daily login reward system that screams ""MOBILE GAME!"" but works okay in the game. They however, made it so that you cannot claim the reward on all your toons. My initial thoughts are that the rewards are good for fresh 80s needing AA xp as that seems to be what is rewarded to you most of the time, however you can get about 4 gilding tokens a month, which is the equivalent of sending about $10 usd a month. The thing that upsets me about this though, is that it, along with the item store, are shoved down your throat with each login.  tl;dr It’s a fun game, somewhat limiting as a free player, but unfortunately has bad pvp (and bad pvp community), poor management from the company that owns it, has sold out and implemented the buy to win strategy, and should be renamed to “Age of Cashgrab” Play it if you want, but do not support this game financially. Do not encourage them.EXTRA NOTE: The most recent Q4 investor statement states that this game is now on what we refer to as ""maintenance mode.""			"

												Summer 2008. One of the hottest summers I can remember in Norway. Why? A game graphically way ahead of its time was boiling my graphics card through the side of my case on medium settings. Normally I would have just turned the settings all the way down, but the transcendent experience of these newfangled rendering techniques had me hypnotized to the point I'd rather invest in overkill airconditioning and suffer. I am sure I lost dangerous amount of weight that summer, and workmates were probably worried I was doing drugs, on account of the black lines under my eyes and the loss of weight.But it was worth it. Despite the lack of content at launch, there was no way I could hate anything about this game. Worldbuilding, music, immersion, animation and what content was actually present; all blew away any MMORPG that came before it.While it only took a year for Age of Conan to become the game it was supposed to be at launch, it was too late as 70% of the million plus playerbase had left, and the game became synonymous with 'failure' to the most attention deficit amongst MMO game consumers.The PvP was never developed to the standard I had hoped, but the PvE is still among the best there is.This is one of the greatest MMORPGs that are still alive today. If you haven't tried it yet, give it a go. If you've heard even a hum of one of the many grumpy, outdated complaints about this game, it will surprise the eyelashes right off your face.			"

												One of the best MMORPGS ever made. Forget childish elfs, gnomes or dwarfs this is brutal and savage world of R.E. Howards Hyboria. Stunning graphics, unforgettable music, immersive combat and beautiful world waiting to explore. You dont believe me? Watch this and try for yourself.

												It’s hard to stay objective when it comes to online computer games to which you invested thousand of hours into, played on and off for years and enjoed with some amazing people. The game itself gives you that wierd feeling of place far behind it’s glory days with just few very dedicated people still sticking around. And that is probably it’s greatest strenght and weakness, both in terms of community and technical side of game. This game alone and community around it got me through one of the hardest times of my life. I switched partners, interests, computers, countries and places to live, but AoC is and hopefully still be something to get back into once life kicks me down again.			"

												This game is in maintenace mode. No communication on the forums, and zero development. Funcom is spending its time releasing Conan Exiles. Continues to be many bugs from launch, and lots of half-baked features. Guild vs Guild sieges don't happen because of zone crashes and the extremely poor implementation that hasn't been touched since 2008. Only 1 new PvP minimap has been added since launch, and that was 5 years ago. As for PvE content, end-game continues to be the Rise of The Godslayer Expansion which launched in 2010. To be fair, the game has an amazing soundtrack and the graphics still stand up very well for a 10 year old game. The low fantasy setting is also refreshing in an MMORPG market full of elves and dwarves. If you're ok with a small playerbase of 1,000 players and no active development then give it a try.			"

												Beautiful world, beautiful music, items made to little details ... so raw and vicious, this game has best mmorpg world I ever played ... also I find things from Howards stories as a great reward for somebody who loves Conan and his world like me ... game has a lots of bugs but which game does not ... as always it is not for all ... the combat system may be hard for somebody ... and other will just miss their pinky stuff and violet dragons ... I highly recommend this for all Howard and Lovecraft fans.			"

												Ok so lets start from its faults, f2p model in here is really, really bad, its more like trial instead of F2P because you are still very ilmited in things you can accually do in here. You have to know this before you`ll start to play this game. And in fact that`s the only bigger minus i can came up with. Now lets head to the actual gameplay experience. Starting from graphics and sounds, they are absolutely gorgeous, THIS IS THE MOST BEAUTIFULL MMORPG ever, after 5 years of release its still the best. You will not find better looking MMO and honestly even non-mmo AAA games can feel ashamed in comparison to Age Of Conan in terms of graphics and overall world desing.Now let`s talk about the biggest part of RPG - combat. Combat system was advertised as new, unique back in the days and it is. It`s good, it`s bad, my opinion, your opinion, whatever. The fact is that you need to get used to. When i had my 1st contact i feel its not for me and quit. After year i tried again with same result. When i tried 3rd time and focused more on the STORY ASPECT of the game... i was sucked it totally, i completely forgot and just got used to it, i somewhat like it now. Did i said story ? Yea, lets talk about the story. This MMO is heavily focused around the story and God damned it is good. This is real RPG, similar to Gothic series at this point (if you like it you will like this as well). Voice acting in here is superb, even ESO suck in this aspect when you compare it to voice acting here. If you like story in game you will end up most likely even forgot that its and mmo, as i did for the first 40 hours of gameplay. I will not tell you how big the world is and how much variety you`ll find in here because its still mmo, so its pretty obvious that it is HUGE game.There is yet another thing you should know. It is NOT an easy game. It is very hard game most of the time and if you will find yourself surrounded by group of enemies, your only chance is escape. Run as fast as you can as far as you can. This is a thing which some people like about it and some not so keep this in mind. Last thing is community. If you have ever played mmos you should know how tard and annoying some part of community can be. And since most ppl playing Age of Conan are mostly people who play not as f2p users from (in most cases) the very begining i expected that people wont be too polite. And God i was wrong, Age Of Conan community is awesome. You should pray your every gaming community to be like in this game, people in here are very helpfull and always polite to each other. And i`m saying it because its an mmo, when we sit an mmo`s we are doing it for hours and that is very important who do you play with.Overall guys in my opinion in plenty of terms it is one of the best MMO`s so far and you should definitely try it out, you may not like combat system but you still definitely should try it ! Cheers !			"

												So... as soon as Conan Exiles came, I had to go back into AoC to see what happened... I played this game for 7 years,with about 2 years of pausing in between. The reviews here? The people crying about the Itemshop,about it being ""pay-to-win""? Complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. And as a true AoC veteran,let me tell you why.Itemshop? Completely optional. You can get the gear they offer you in not even a month of playing PvP if you do the daily PvP quests,Minigames and the PvP week-events which will give you INSANE amount of PvP xp. So the people saying this game is Pay-to-win are just bad,they need to step up their game and that's it,you have people qqing like this in every game. If you're a really good player,it just doesn't matter if you have the first PvP set (which is earned PRETTY easily) or the last (t3) PvP set,you will kill anyway. That's what the new players nowadays just don't get,they buy this game, have NO CLUE about it whatsoever and the first thing they do is either cry at the itemshop or buy the PvP set from the Shop and get completely destroyed by everybody nonetheless... There are only 2 REALLY important factors about PvP in this game: AA Feats (Alternate Advancement system,kind of hard to explain,but long story short: You get AA points if you play and you spend it on your character's AA feat so he gets better at resisting for example crowd controls, or you get special abilities. However, if you take your time and show patience by skilling the right things,you wont have to worry ONE BIT about AA's because with the PvP AND PvE quests that exist you get them EASILY nowadays.)Movement. You need to aim in this game,not point and click. This is what makes Age of Conan so awesome, if your movement is good,you can kill anything worse than you. New players don't get that even though that's the most important thing about the game... You run around the enemy,predict his moves and try to counter them, you try not to get hit by certain things and and and...Try this game. You will have many people crying out loud here on Steam saying how incredibly bad it is or something like that but those are ALL people who do simply suck at the game and it's mechanics. It's a skill game after all...Take your time with it, look at the lore, listen to the music, and own ♥♥♥♥ when you hit lvl 80 (which you can reach easily in a week or two). YOU NEED PATIENCE TO GET INTO THE GAME!This game has more than enough people to play it by the way,so don't just think this game is dead..this game is alive and running and they improved it A LOTalso very important: PROBABLY 95 PERCENT OF THE AOC PLAYERBASE DON'T PLAY THIS GAME VIA STEAM! So don't get confused by the steam count, This game has been around since 2009.			"

												This game is One of the best MMOs around.Great art, music, sounds, Mature themes, and intelligent tactics to bring down mobs that require every group/raid member to work in sync with the others.The worst things are lack of new content, lack of voice in game linked to the groups/raids, lack of easy group/raid making for instances, gear bounding policies to the toon(the game dont lets you share or trade any good gear betwen toons), minor bugs that persist since the launch of the game like invisible mounts when entering playfields, every member of a group entering diferent instances of the same dungueon etc.It looks like the game stopped getting any investment a while ago, not even for bug correction. All this problems are making me get very disapointed with the game.			"

												I just made an perfect and efficient combo on a minion, which results in ripping this chanceless foe's heart out in cold blood. I then approach this big Viking, this is my final target with this quest and I charge towards him with a perfectly timed ""hellstep"". It's an extremely deadly combo, and takes the boss' health down to 75%, I then force his legs to the ground with ""Word of Command"". One single step back, where he can't touch me, I launch a wide flame against him and afterwards with a couple of combos making him cold again... I am venturing through the most beautiful landscapes I have seen for my soon-to-achieve reward, that's waiting for me. This is a part of my journey, this Hyborian adventure, with my Meaveth of Xotli, a gothic and devilish character in Age of Conan.It sounds wild, but despise Age of Conan is a MMORPG, the action part got the same elements and quality equivalent to a singleplayer game. It's ravishing, and unlike games like World of Warcraft this ain't a never-ending fight and desire for levels and gears - it's about skills and that, makes Age of Conan so fantastic. It's sexy, challenging and beautiful.			"

												I've only just installed it on steam, but I played since release back in I guess 2008ish, and levelled about a dozen characters up to level 80.  The game got harsh reviews on release due to lack of endgame content, which was something the game suffered from for about the first two years.  Fortunately, they've listened to the players and now there is a mass of content.  There's no level up grind because there are more than enough quests to see you through, you could start as one of the four races and follow a completely different quest line from levels 20-45ish.  Graphics are beautiful even after a bunch of years, and the combat system is good, balanced, and easy to get used to.  The f2p version lets you into a lot of the game, you can play it through without paying and still have more content than players had on the original release, but if you want to raid regularly you'll probably want to sub to the game.  I've also noticed that a lot of groups looking for players will insist on anyone joining be a subbed player with epic gear and a particular AA build (not the games fault, players can be jerks).  That coupled with the relatively low player population can make it a bit of a solo game once you get to 80 unless you're willing to put your hand in your pocket.  That said, you can solo most of the content.The music in most areas of the game is great-the original game came with a soundtrack CD, even if you treat this as a single player game there's enough content to keep you happy for a lot more time than it'd take you to play through skyrim.  In todays world of dumbed-down games (particularly MMO's) AoC is a breath of fresh air that after some 7 years still has me coming back to it every now and then.			"

												I will give an honest review of the current state of the game from my point of view. Have been playing on and off since the day it launched in 2008.FIRST OFF IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING THIS GAME FOR YOUR KID IT HAS HALF FRONTAL NUDITY (BREASTS). ITS MA RATED! I play on Fury PvP under the name Laethiel I have made updates and changes to my old review, see below.PVE sideYou can level to 80 but along the way you will have a very hard time finding groups for any low level dungeons on the pvp server Fury, You will have better luck on the the crom pve server. Unles you play on EU prime time. They have a bit higher population on Crom. I had to power level my buddy to 80 on Fury due to all the missed content because of lack of groups. At end game (Level 80) you can do 6 man dungeons which aren't bad and are quite rewarding. and you will be able to do 24 man raids.. If you can find a raid.. on Fury PvP raids are rare or non existent , on crom they are somewhat more frequent since pve is all they do. They have since added a Raid finder which i hear mixed reviews about. Sign up and join a pub queue for raiding. The 24 man raid. These generally consist of 4 groups of 6 combined to form a 24 man ""raid"". Most bosses are tank and spank time sinks with need/greed loot rolls that are open to all regardless of class. This leads to ninja looting on occasion. Most raids will be very controlling in dispersal of loot. There are on average 2-3 pieces of epic gear that drop per raid boss and raid instances can vary in how many bosses. from 1 to 8. Raids can take a few hours to complete so set aside some spare time on raid night, especially progression raids. expect alot of elitist attitude and assholism. and don't be surprised if you come away completely empty handed.. alot... I raided for 6 months once to get a piece of tier 2 gear. PvE Can be very Grindy. The 6 man dungeon, There are many variations of these. from revamped low level dungeons called ""unchained mode"" to the khitai expansion pack dungeons. They are mostly quick and like i said very rewarding. I would recommend these starting out for quick epic gear. Problem is you have to be subscribed to play most content in the game so dont go in expecting a free ride, this game is hardly ""free to play"". You will find yourself having a difficult time getting to max level as a free to play member. Free to play model: Improving slowly. you are limited to 10 gold currency,  You can do all pve and pvp content provided you own the content. Festival,minigames and world pvp. Baby stepsGlobal chat - A fun time if you have a thick skin.. Think barrens chat in WoW. This can be worse. But they do ban people for blatant non political correctness like using the N word or spewing homophobic slurs etc. I rather enjoy it. This alone kept me coming back for years.The PvP sideThe PvP Festival The pvp festival, which pvp players enjoy more than our pve ?????tain counterparts, consists of daily pvp zones that switch around at approx. 8pm est every day to a new zone. In these zones all pvp is encouraged and guards will not intervene! this is great if you're like me, bad if you're not... plus you get pvp daily quests you can do to get pvp xp which is ok.The monthly event.This feature takes place on the 3rd week of every month starting on Tuesdays and lasting for 7 days. It takes place in one randomly picked zone (it cycles through 5 zones) and you and your friends must fight for objectives such as control domination, kill count, and the like. the rewards are pretty good. This event draws crowds of old and new players alike so get into a group/guild for it. They have group dm, solo dm, group domination. and chosen of ghullah in which you become an epic boss and try to score as many kills as you can before you die . They are at random locations in the zone and happen every 20 mins or so. There is no real notification system,youll just have to keep your eyes open. As for the rest of PvP, You have open world pvp which comes with ganking (Fury) and all that fun and now mostly happens in the daily pvp zone due to there being no guards. You have minigames you can queue up for which consist of 3 x 6v6 ctf maps, 1 x 6v6 dm map where you can smash the enemy spawn and end the match quickly and 1 x 12v12 domination map which half your team goes afk most of the time because win or lose you still get a token which you need to buy pvp gear. But you get more if you win. Problem is there jut aren't enough people left playing to even get minigames or world pvp.PvP Balance - It's like paper rock scissors. The minigame queue which i will describe below is horrible. The ""balance algorithm"" they supposedly installed in 2010 or so cannot seem to balance teams. So you'll end up on a good team or a lousy team. One team will have all the high ranking pvp players and healers while your team will be all low ranking players and no heals, aka cattle. This is an ongoing problem. Deal with it. Update: Lately teams haven't been too bad.Minigames - The thing is in age of conan you CAN'T join pvp minigames with a group or a friend/friends. Unless you are doing a full 6v6 tournament like a premade match and you have 2 full groups ready to go.. The public queue is completely random. You CANNOT decide who is on your team. This will induce episodes of rage. Granted there is a 50% chance you'll get your friend on your team.. They will never change this aspect. We have tried and failed to convince them for years that making it a random queue is a bad idea. They are afraid of premade stomping pugs which to be honest i would rather deal with.PvP Gear dependance is fairly high in pvp but having high gear wont make you good. AAs (Alternate Advancement Feats - do your own research) also play a role. They have lowered the requirements to obtain pvp gear significantly so it's easier than ever to get in the game. By pvp 3-4 you are already a pvp contender and it took me and my buddy less than a week and a half of steady pvp. Sieges (48v48)noone sieges. Forget about this aspect. If you try to siege a battlekeep youll have a carebear consortium allying to defend it from you. Not to mention it costs a fortune in game currency to launch an attack.The expansion pack ""Rise of the Godslayer"" no longer requires a sub to use so this is good. You no longer need this to get access to the AA feats tree, also good. Guilds -- It takes a long time to get off the ground and this game rewards large guilds not small ones. You can make a small guild but you'll never get anywhere without a guild city and those take time and or money and lots of manpower. To put it bluntly a guild consisting of say 200+ active unique members farming resource nodes daily would take 6 months to a year to build a guild city to full tier 3. . Some people sell these guild cities that are abandonded... I recommend buying one in this case. Again this game rewards zerg numbers. small guilds get crapped on usually. There is no alliance system and no faction system. You cannot kill guildies but you can kill anyone else. I have updated my old review to reflect the current changes and I think the changes are good. I have since been logging on more frequently and have seen new life in this game. I will give it my recommendation and hope they continue down the path of customer satisfaction they have for too long strayed from.So give it a whirl. What have you got to lose other than your free time?			"

												I played almost when it came out for 2-3 years... tried it again when it became ""F2P"", if you are willing to pay every month its an awesome game but the F2P is more of an endless trial. Yes you can reach max level but most of dungeon and raids requiere subscription in order to ender.			"

												This is a very well done, ""old school"" MMO. It stands up to any modern MMO and is becoming my favorite MMO. Combat is fun and takes skill. The hide\sneak system is good as is climbing. Quests are often challenging and unforgiving. And it's set in the Hyborian age so it is raw, gritty, bloody, and sexy.NB: when you first load up the game, go to the advanced graphics settings where you can make the graphics look much better than what you get by default.

												I've played this on/off and have enjoyed myself a lot with this game.While I use to play World of Warcraft for 6+ years, I wanted a new MMO to play and tried many and couldn't get on with them. I Found The Secret World and Age of Conan: Unchained, fallen in love with Age of Conan and wished I played it sometime around it's release date!Also, best part, is there a thing in this game called ""Fatalities!"" And they are gory and awesome!Combat Melee:Combat is awesome! You have to combo your skills to activate them and the further you play and level, the more you have to put into the combo's. While it's fun, it can be a little difficult to level as a melee class at first, but once you get into those levels, it becomes a little less painful.If you are a melee class player, then defantly try this way of combat out! It will be more fun than just pressing 1,2,3..Combat Mage:I played a Priest of Metra from level 1-70 for a bit and as it was fun and didn't have to worrie about death, because I can self-heal like mad. There is nothing new to magic classes. You'll get a feel for the old-school casting, 1-2minutes on skills and GCD's.Combat Ranger:Same with melee classes, you get combo's also! While I've not played much ranger, you do have a mix of melee and range. But of course, your main focus will be using your bow and keeping targets at range. If you think melee combo's is not your type, try a ranger.Questing/Leveling:The questing and leveling as a F2P player, it's no problem. Your not restricted like most games can be, and recently they made it so you can level to max without having a expansion. (If I'd remember correctly?) I went from level 1-45 and never felt like I needed exp potions or subscription to get bonuses. Questing at the start can be little harsh if your new or have little experience (Like I was). But once you get into the higher levels, things get a little more easier and less deaths will happen. Try it yourself!Graphics:Of coruse, this game was release in 2008 and looks dated. But for it's age, it still looks great and I have nothing against it! For some it may be a bother. If they could do a small graphical update, then the game would look even better, but not sure if Funcom would do such a thing.Pros:Nice graphics for a 2008 game.Quite a few classes to pick from.Combat with combo's.How a F2P game should be!Good community.A lot to do at endgame. (Only from reading and watching.)Cons:Small player base on Steam Charts. (probably way more. Dunno.)Subscription needed for endgame content sadly.Random lag spikes at times but really not noticable.Chat/guild spams. Very annoying sometimes.Most players on in EU time. (For anyone outside of the EU)If anything missed out, comment for others to see. :)Really worth playing if your trying to get into a new MMO, help this game get more populated.			"

												Don't let the ""No"" recommendation fool you - Age of Conan is by no means a bad game. Looks solid, plays solid, and the right player with the right mindset will quite enjoy it for multiple hours on end - Especially the many with a fascination for 3D model boobs.However, after my initial spat of AoC (having been an MMORPG player for countless years) I re-installed yet again after my last session (total of 80 levels gained across two characters) and quite simply couldn't get back into it again.AoC has a very impressive soundtrack and a lot of content on offer or places to explore, yet I didn't find it very engaging and also had quite a variable difficulty curve based on classes. Still, I trucked on and enjoyed what was on offer, though after a period of time it just fades from memory.If you're an MMORPG fan who wishes to explore what is on offer - Definitely give F2P AoC a chance - Though if you're looking for an extremely polished product that will hold your attention indefinitely, you'd do well to invest time and effort into a different title.

												Fun and unique mechanics, solid lore and source material with beautiful visuals; zero community moderation, buy to win overhaul and atrophied development; a ""don't blame us"" attitude towards a mostly poisonous user base. Though there are a few really good folks, most of the players are petulant, abusive and demanding on their best days. It appears Funcom made a ""new"" version of the game in Steam's listings just to get away from their own community's opinions on their product. For brutal detail, check my review of the identical ""OLD"" version where I've logged hundreds of hours. tl;dr = pass on Funcom and AoC.			"

												After playing AoC Unchained for about 200 hrs now, I'm pleased to say that it's alive and kicking 7 yrs after launch. The population in the game is as strong as ever and there is plenty of content to enjoy at all levels. I originally purchased this game when it was first released and have been able to see the game grow into something unique. There is no other MMO quite like this. From the combat, quests and even the music (which is some of the best music of any game available today). However, this game is a little challenging than other mmo's. It can be brutal at times, and yet that is what makes it such a beautiful experience. Overcoming the odds as you conqueror your enemies and make off with the loot in hand. I believe there are 12 classes to choose from and 4 different races. The starting area of the game is the best in any mmo imho. Now that the game has moved to F2P, the item store will pop up right as you log in and that is the last time that you have to see it. The shop isn't constantly shoved in your face. The game has now opened all areas/dungeons/raids to all players, subscription or free. There's no better time to jump into this game and enjoy what it has to offer. It's FREE!			"

												First Review in steam this is one of the best mmo out there and you can go through the game and hit 80 lvl without payment. If you are casual or a veteran gamer there is so much content you can play for years, the combat system has a love/hate feeling, some players like it others not and the game looks like a typical mmo after lvl 20 but the atmosphere and the feeling of the world is so good and so unique.If u hate the korean mmos and u like a mature world with great atmosphere-blood and cultures its a jewel.Pros: 4-races restricted to specific 12-classes         Great regions design and great Graphics for a 8 years old game         Combat is unique with more action approach         Tons of Quest         Tons of LootCons: Population are low the game needs more players asap          PvP is Hard and unfriendly to Casuals          PvP dying slowly too           Marketplace need some price changes          The F2P restrictions for the in-game currency is annoying          Some bad animations and bugs can happent but its an old game and you can live with those glitches8.5/10			"

												Of all the MMORPGs I've played AoC was the best at organically forcing players to work together, and therefore was a uniquely social game. I made lots of friends and got involved with my guild - something I didn't feel I had to do nor had a desire to do in other MMOs like WoW for example. Unfortunately it suffered in other ways (lack of voice acting past level 20, lack of mid-level quests thus resulting in a heavy grind) and so eventually I moved on. Would recommend if they fixed their previous issues and there was a larger player base. The world was beautiful and the lore felt much more rich than any other MMO I've played.			"

												I lost 4 years of my life for this game. It is a great story of slave becoming a master and hero with tons of epic battles and side quests that introduce players even more to Howard's world of blood and violence.Unfortunately, Funcom decided to spoil a lot of great features since the beginning - missing skill trees, PvP changes, paid services etc.Still, it is very much worth playing. The music is awesome, the graphic is still great. And the blood, of course. The blood!			"

												It took me a while to Consider playing this game, but as I managed to enter the world of Conan the barbarian, I was afraid it would not respect the main protagonist lore, but, my expectations were not so ruined(regarding the things you find out there as MMOs, paid or free to play). I love the atmosphere and overall contant and never fails to deliver mainly what is ment to be, I like it overall, and I wish the devs will do a nice job forwardly if they will do, I guess they will keep enriching the experience. Well this is my opinion on this game fermly made after some hours and I will come back for more editing(in case is needed) especially and hopefuly for the good.			"

												While I do recommend AoC, I wouldn't suggest it for a long-time commitment.A game launched ahead of its time (which is not a good thing because it kind of needed a better engine), with incredibly fun questing due to the background lore, unique combat mechanics combined with fun PvE and PvP battles and one of those games that were worth calling a potential ""WoW killer"" at the time. It had everything that somebody could ask for even now; beautiful graphics, graphical violence, detailed lore based on the Conan universe, fun combat, voice-freaking-acting and a lot of promise right off the start. That is untill you get to leave the tutorial area....It's still a great amount of fun and worth throwing a little bit of money at it to get some extra areas and quests. But that's it really. The end-game is generic raids and that's about it. Some areas are locked to subscribers only, which are the end-end-game areas that you will have to go if you want to progress even further. Thankfully they improved their payment model, but it still is bad. There is some PvP to be had, but unless you are in the most populated server AND in one of the active and big guilds, you won't get much out of it.It fell short due to it being rushed as all hell, which is painfully obvious. You get to be introduced to mechanics at the tutorial area that are NEVER used again in the game like a single-player mode for story quests and a nice hub city to link everything together. After that you are thrown ALL OVER the map in a fairly generic area system. No quests apart from a few that can be easilly counted with maybe just 1 hand and the story quests are voice-acted afterwards. You get to have to do group quests which requires pure luck of finding somebody at your level to do them with and due to you not having them done you will fall short later on (depending on your class, some are simply too OP on everything) and have to tediously go through annoyingly hard quests.Also as I mentioned, some classes/builds are simply overpowered. Doing insane amounts of damage without long cooldown abilities and/or having too much survivability. It's one of the reasons that unless you are purely into the PvE part of the game and join a PvE server, you won't have too much fun unless you pick the objectively good builds.In conclusion, it's still a great game due to the lore and the environments and Funcom 101 stuff that they have nailed in both their MMOs and I could even argue that you are missing out if you don't give at least the tutorial area a try. As a ""Conan"" game it also does what it does very well and you will love the world you are in. However, it has many issues including the payment model itself so playing to rush to the end-game is not adviseable.			"

												Game is now a real f2p with some restrictions but nothing that will hold you back, you need to buy the expansions though.For me, this is the best MMORPG, a jewel, a piece of art that somemay like otheres not, its up to you, but you have to try it.For a game that was born below the WoW shadow , where every other MMO wanted to clone the giant to get a piece of the cake, FC decided to make something diferent, oriented to the adult players, based on the world made by Robert E. Howard, with all the lore, and the feeling of the conan universe.Yes, they made a terrible launch, but now, the game is different, after all this years, you can set all that hatred and disapointment away for a moment and give it another try. i can't asure you wont be disapointed, but i speak in my own experience, that since i played this game for the first time, couldn't see another MMO the same, and i've tried a lot of them.what you can expect is: -a unique combat system-an adult oriented enviroment-a different kind of fantasy-boss mechanics that actually need coordination and comunication-beautiful graphics, for a 8yo game-amazing soundtrack, fitting to conan lore-blood-real character customization, no ""meta"" builds, that everyone uses leaving every other option unusefull for the end game-Fun PvP, where skill is above gear-a game that you can play with limited time and still get to participate in the endgame, but with a semi hard learning curve for each class-a mature international playerbase, you wont find a lot of teenagers like other games around there.yes the game has many flaws, but surely, it deserves a try.

Groups and guilds exist, but not really necessary for 100's of hours of enterscapement (have played outside Steam). They are down to one PvE and one PvP server.... might die soon.The mature, visceral and brutal nature of combat and the game world remains a standout. If you've read the R. Howard works, you'll see frequent hints of the original Conan vision and that is VERY satisfying.

Age of Conan is among the few fantasy themed MMOs that is not obviously modeled after World of Warcraft.PROs* Game world which is true to the Conan source material, including its adult themed content.* Beautiful graphics and in game music* Intricate and involved combat system with combos, finishers, and bloody results shown in detail.* Thousands of quests, dungeons, raids, and World events for long term game play and variety.* Unique character classes like the Demonologist and the Herald of XotliCONs* The game is somewhat buggy even after extensive revisions earlier in the game's life* New content is released at a slower rate than in the past * The player community is still significant but relatively small.

												Stagnancy, the perfect word to describe this game, this game changed nothing over the years. Non-permium users are very limited. The ingamestore is the cancerous tumor of the game, it should be limited to simple social items and minor accountboosts. Compared to other f2p mmo-s, the idea of locking game content(raids, dungeons, classes, races, lands) behind payment doors is outdated, unhealty and bad for the game itself, if the game's main priority is to grow and profit. Shame, this game has a unique world, diverse classes and an original combat system, all of this potential is obliterated by the horrible ingamestore.			"

Even now, 6 years after release the game stand strong, and you can get a lot of it without opting for the payed version.

												As a free to play game this game has potential. Sadly though FunCom ruins that by maiking this the most limited free to play experience I have ever tried. It's very clear that free to play players are forced to either quit playing or aquire a premium account in order to continue playing later on.Thing that are a very big part of the game but free to play gamers are locked out of:- Sieges- Alternative Advancement- Offline Levels- Veteran Points- Limited character creation spots- Limited bagspace- And so much moreI would urge all and everyone to think twice before playing this. Take a look at other free to play alternatives since there are a lot of them today. Make FunCom either shut down this game or make free to play better. As it is now, it's a joke.Update july 2016:Was notified about a new f2p plan, whent to the website to read up on it, it had a lot of good things going for it like no more restrictions to zones and so one. But then it came and i quote:""Unlimited Gold Capacity!""- You are limited as a free player to how much gold you can carry! What, why!? Ok, I can live with that. I read on and then came the deal breaker, and I quote:""What are Loyalty Rewards?  Membership Loyalty Rewards include awesome new items, such as pets, mounts, social items, & more. These rewards are granted based on how long you have been a Member.""- Even more limits for the free player (in terms that paying players get access to content free players don't, not even by ingame cash shops).Also some mention of ""Bonus Expertise: Every time you gain a level, you gain a bonus Expertise Point!"" for premium member. I'm not fully aware of what tha means but granting extra points on level up for paying players vs free players is never good and usually leans towards a pay to win situation. No matter if it's in combat, crafting, housing or whatever it's still a pay to win feature.To me this new update feels like a pathetic last atempt to keep a dying unfair business model alive. But they still restrict free players in order to hopefully catch a few subscribers. All I can say is that if a free to play game has a fair business model I am not afraid to throw my money at it, I can honestly say that I have spent more money on f2p games this year than I have 8 years in wow all together. But this business model is stil not fair and AoC will keep dying.A f2p play business model is not by limiting the free players with content. It's by granting subscribers bonuses such as XP bonus, cosmetics and so on. NOT items and mechanics that has a direct impact on game play. And free players should have access to the exact same items and bonuses through cash shops so if he or she want to buy it tey can but if they don't they should not be punished for playing a game the developers decided to make free to play.And by all means charge all players for expansions, that's fair enough.Either it's free to play or it's not. You can't have something in between. Ad yet again I fell like it's not worth even try this game again. So once I'm moving on.So here comes a few tips of other f2p mmos (with same or better business model) you could try instead of this bs.Rider of Icarus (Free to play)Elder scrolls online (Pay once, play for free)WildStar (Free to play)RIFT (Free to play)Tera (Free to play)ArcheAge (Free to play)Google is your friend			"

The old F2P model is what most likely made me want to rage from this game as I had both a retail copy for Vinilla AoC and Rise of the Godslayer when they locked me out of Khitai and most raids because I was not subbed it felt like a giant middle finger to me....With that said Funcom listened to what the player base was saying and they changed it using THE PLAYERS feedback taking what suggestions had the MAJORITY approval from the community at large I am pleased with this new model.. Yes they got rid of offline levels but you know what if you sub your get a HUGE XP boost and increase to money tokens EVERYTHING so leveling should NOT even be a issue for subbed people even at high levels. If you cannot level quickly from this new system and needed the offline levels you are either A. Lazy or B. You don't know how to level correctly...That being said PvP has always been meh on this game as griefers had a HUGE to do with the PvP servers being all but abandoned.. The PvE Servers still have mass PvP in the form of Seige battles and borderland PvP and Mini games so a PvPer should find a way to get his rocks off on fighting other players.For the RPers out there this game is AMAZING for RP the RP community is still alive and VERY active for those who are old players that RPed I would strongly urge you make a return as the RP reminds me of how it was during lunch days with Open world RP happening as well as mass RP in SHI (Serpents Head Inn) for you non RPers give this game a shot it's got a unique combat system that is not in any other MMO and now that the new model is in play has TONS to offer.Bottom line the negative reviews on this game in my opinion are for the most part without merrit as it is just people either crying about their offline levels being removed or how they were a vet and feel shafted.... Which I am a Vet and don't feel shafted by this new model update and all that vanity gear you could get mostly from World Boss drops.I could go on all day but my lasting message try this game if you haven't before if you have give it anther go you won't be sorry.

												I'vev been looking for a new RPG to play, and I saw this and decided to give it a go. I have to say I played 2 hours straight and enjoyed my self the whole time. I will keep playing this, for sure. I've been trying ourt various ones on Steam, and can't find one that I have no complaints about. So far I have none, and am enjoying that I don't feel like I'm playing another generic MMO. I feel very interested and invested in the world and what I am doing. I have zero knowledge about the Conan universe, but am loving it.			"

												Everyone seriously, atleast try out this MMOrpg and see what you like. I've tried so many free/P2P MMOs (From everywhere around the globe) But I think this game is the best one after World of warcraft. This game is BURSTING with content, Beautiful graphics and an unique fighting mechanic. There is also a story mode gameplay, which was there way before SWtor or any other MMOrpg. The game is tailored for guild/group activity in both PvP and PvE. The structured PvP is insanely competitive when it goes to City conquering. Guilds can have their own cities, build them how they like and conquer other guilds cities. This was just a small example what this game holds in.Overall:+Graphics+Gameplay+Content+PvP+Lore+Loads of classes and customization-System Requirements are extremely high and might be a turn-off for some.-Online shop with little boosts. They aren't gamebreaking, but it can annoy a few people.-Just a few servers.-It can be hard for casual players to join, because of the brutal PvP-system. "

												Came back after having not played since the PAID launch. (Yes, I paid full price for this game once).How is it now?2/10 - I gave one point for every character slot I have available.Meanwhile, all my many other characters are now locked behind a paywall. Also, the UI is clunky as hell and looks hideous.I really wanted to get back into it, but I'm not going to bother with a game that removed standard features just so that I can pay for them again.

												Best MMO ever!*Funcom did awesome job bringing the world of REH novels to life - the architecture, cultures, weapons, armors are excellent! Then they've put awesome into awesome, by introducing Chulhu Mythos in expansions (House of Crom, Rise of the Godslayer, Secrets of Dragon's Spine).Melee combat is meaty - the animations, movement, collisions create an illusion of characters being physical objects. Most of the melee attacks are real swings, so anything caught in their reach will be hit (you don't have to target) and the direction of your attack matters. Then there are fatalities, a real reward for dealing massive damage at the right moments - throats will be cut, hands chopped off and you might even find yourself ripping your enemies head with bare hands!Mages are able to enter spellweaving stance to unleash a real hell on their foes, but every boon from their gods or demonic masters comes with a risk. Healing is more HoT-based and priests are also encouraged to contribute as damage dealers.While dungeons and raids in base game are more straight-forward, the expansion content is just jaw-dropping. Most of the fights have very unique bosses with crazy mechanics (naughty posy!) and stuff like Enigmata of Yag or House of Crom raid are just state-of-the-art.Spent almost 4 years completely engrossed in the game - download it and get a piece of it yourself!*ex equo with TSW :)			"

												Age of Conan: Unchained is a free to play MMORPG set in the world of Conan the Barbarian movies and novels.  It worked on Win 10, looked ok, played ok, sounded ok.  This game is 7 years old, the graphics are dated.   Has many voiceovers for all the NPCs and multiple choices in many conversations.  Has 3 races and 12 classes, not gender locked.  Has bloody and gory graphics, mature conversations, bare boobs.  Has PVP and PVE.  Free players are more limited, has more content behind paywalls.   Very detailed and imersive story.  Has a 19 gigabyte initial download and uses 30 GB total.  Check out wikis and guides for more info about this game.CONS:- The devs have this game in Maintainance mode, devoting their resources to their new Conan Exiles game.- Performance problems. - Low population.Try it, if you like MMORPGs. Play it for the story before the game is closed.For more info:

												Really enjoying the gameplay so far. It's simplisitic, easy to navigate. The graphics are pretty good for a game that has a few years of age to it. F2P, and very little complaints. The in-game market doesn't seem to be for much more than mounts and other vanity items. Aside from a small selection of boosts, potions and what have you. If you do end up playing, don't skip over conversations and quests.. take your time, enjoy the immersion. Would certainly reccomend this to someone looking for a fun f2p mmorpg to download and grind out on.			"

												it is aged. it was at the edge of being outdated when it released. but it is nontheless one of the best MMORPGs that i personally played (and sometimes still do). It had a few modern mechanics in it that alot of other MMOs implemented shortly after, sadly the over-all tech the game used was based on the generation before, and that might be it´s main problem. The Story is nice, mostly with spoken dialogues, which was rather new back then, the action-combat system was rather new back then as well and ist still interesting. it is a mature game in a mature world, yea Conan... If you like classic MMORPGs with some modern touches, it is always worth to check it out. With the DX10 client it doesn´t even give you eyecancer like some older titles do, the world has some very nicely designed areas to offer which you can enjoy if you aren´t too focused on top-notch grafics or have an older machine. The community is still more than alive full with people to answer you question or lend you a helping hand. As most funcom games, it is niche, but a niche quite alot of people are happy to live in. i recommend it, but with the addition that it might not be everyones pair of shoes. ps: ignore the hours played, i played the Unchained version when it came out with multiple characters at mid- to high level and some times between then and now.

												This game is evolving constantly and it is still absolutely great.   The recent udpates and change to paid membership has really made alot of people angry (those that have paid) because they had to pay for what now can be purchased ala carte.  Those that complain about rude people are on the pvp server (Fury).  If you don't want rude people and pvp ganking, log into Crom server.  The Fury PVP is so unbalanced I can understand why people are leaving that server- Overall, the game is addictive and beyond fun.  The graphics are fine, even great by today's standards-the music is wonderful.  There are so many things you can do beyond the normal storyline/gameplay such as, crafting and building guilds.  Being in a good guild makes alot of difference.  Play the game.  If you are a fan of Conan, or just fantasy settings and MMO's- play.  You'll love it.  Really.  You will.			"

												MMO I played from 2008 November to 2011 May without break. You can say this game defined my character, my playstyle, my live. I stopped playing it after they announced f2p, since then,I always wanted to come back, but I was scared, scared of what f2p can do to great game, with epic pvp, epic guildwars, and epic raids. I was thinking about coming back on weekly basis, that's what happen when you dedicate a part of your ""soul"" to one game, you feel your character, you feel world, and you forget, which one is real. Most gamers don't know this feeling, when your character becomes part of you and vice-versa, your guild becomes your second family, and you know world more than your own. I am scared, because I don't know if I was forgotten, if my old guild (long live SPIRITS from Aquilonia) is still existing, if all players I knew are still playing it. That bothered me since I uninstalled game, and unsubscribed. But I am soon to find out what happened to game once I loved, and will forever. Because you cannot deny what is already in your heart.

												REVIEW: PORTUGUÊS / ENGLISH Excelente MMORPG!Todos os NPCs do jogo têm voz e uma backstory, mesmo que mínima, introduzindo o jogador à uma personalidade, coisa pouco vista em MMORPGs. E embora os objetivos de muitas sidequests sejam maçantes ou clichês, o combate do jogo contrasta com isso; o sistema de combos (onde você deve apertar os botões na ordem certa) e a sanguinolência irrefreável tornam a experiência viciante. A existência de uma missão principal é também um ponto fortíssimo, pois esta é feita com o foco no singleplayer, e isso torna a experiência fantástica, pois ali os desenvolvedores puderam dedicar fortemente em detalhar e expandir a história, consolidando uma reputação fidegnina do mundo na fictícia Era Hiboriana.Os gráficos, antigos, têm um charme convidativo; são velhos, mas são tão bem detalhados que envelheceram bem, assim como os de World of Warcraft. A trilha sonora, diria eu, é o ponto mais forte do jogo. Ela é fantástica. Não seria demais dizer que ela é a melhor do gênero, e menos ainda que se equipara com a de muitos jogos grandiosos, como com a de The Last of Us, por exemplo. Ultimamente, andei testando vários MMORPG. Age of Conan: Unchained, apesar de antigo, é o único que fisgou minha atenção. As missões completamente trabalhadas com áudio de voz e cutscenes e a fidelidade ao mundo mortal de Conan (cujas histórias originais de Robert Roward são queridíssimas por mim), e os detalhes dos mapas abertos são incríveis. É um MMORPG de altíssima categoria, embaçado pelas areias do infortúnio. Merecia muito mais sucesso._______________ENGLISH:Excellent MMORPG!All NPCs are completely voiced, featuring even a backstory, even if minimal, which introducts the player to a personality, something that is indeed not commonly seen in MMORPGs. And although the quests are often clichés, the game's combat profoundly contrasts with that; the system of combos and the irrepressible bloodthirstiness turns the gameplay into an addictive experience. The existence of a main mission is also a strong point, as it is made with focus on singleplayer, which helps constructing a fantastic experience, since the developers could heavily devote time detailing and expanding the story, consolidating a loyal reputation to the Hyborian Age.The old graphics are truly charming; even if they're are old, for being so detaild they aged pretty well, like WoW's graphics.The soundtrack, I would dare to say, is the strongest point of the game. It's astounding. It's not only possible to say that it's the best in the genre, but it's also possible to say that they are equipped with that of many great games, like The Last of Us soundtrack, for example.Lately, I've been testing several MMORPGs. Age of Conan: Unchained, though old, is the only one that caught my attention. With fully voiced missions with cutscenes and an amazing loyalty to Conan's mortal world (whose original Robert Roward stories are special to me), and the details in the open world maps are incredible. It is a very high-class MMORPG, blurred by the sands of misfortune. He deserved, and deserves, much more success.			"

												Before I tell my story, I'm going to list some pros and cons, sstarting with the positivesPROS*Conan authentic bare chestedness (for both genders)*Cosmetics system is really good, allowing for total control over your look for free*Dialogue is really Hilarously salty (I particualarly like being a Stygian and arguing with a Cimmerean craftsman about whether my people's smiths molested camels or not)*Runs alright even on cheap laptopsCONS*The game is super money grubbing and the Cash Shop menu opens itself every chance it gets (it's even the first thing you see logging in)*The Direction Shielding system is far less interesting than advertised and usually amounts to ""mash basic attack at one side then use a stronger attack on another*Class abilities are either grossly uninspired or take too long to start being interesting (didn't play long enough to test which)*Story missions are both uninspired and a completely solo affair (and I played a healer, joy)*Equipment drops are stingy as hell*Grouping is near impossible between the awful (and often glitchy) social interface and the restrictive as hell instance changing*Customer support is obnoxious and as unhelpful as possibleAfter having to contact Customer Support 3 times just to get the game to accept my login, I had a rather unfun time slogging through the early parts of the game just trying to get to the point where I could Group (and as a healer, not easy). After a long while I realized that I was long past the point where I could Group, I just couldn't join my IRL Friends because while they could Friend and Group Invite me, I couldn't do the same for them. After DAYS of asking Support about this, they finally told me I was on the wrong server (which shouldn't have been POSSIBLE since my healer was made in the same slot as my test character which COULD contact my buddies before I deleted her) and that they could switch me to the server my friends were on for a fee. Even after it was made clear that it was IMPOSSIBLE for me to have chosen the wrong server they told me, ""Well you're not on your buddy's server now, so pay up. Do you have any other questions"" and I said, ""Yeah, how do I uninstall this?"" Still no answer to the last question			"

												8 years ago when released this game was a jewel (a.k.a. some great ideas set in a great world - like the awesome fighting system), but wrapped in s***t.I've played it for for 4-6 months and gave up on the bugs and problems. I am a huge fan of R.E.Howard, the only reason i've decided to give it another try after these many years.Unfortunately still the game owns an awesome starting zone but after that it's still the same.Well ...some things never change - a s**t remains a s***t even when served for free.I recommended it because of the great idea it represented but I don't think I am going to play it anymore! If u want a decent MMORG with good support and almost zero bugs and nonsense decisions (without monthly pay of course) - I suggest you to play The Elder Scrolls Online.			"

												Well, this game isn't perfect. It has flaws, bad design choices and distracting things.But!This game has a lot to offer. Mature themes, a rough, dirty world - where only the strongest will survive. Will you rescue those women, who are about getting ♥♥♥♥♥? Or will you kneel before somewhat pathethic rulers? Its up to you. Immersion and atmosphere are stunning, the music and sound is one of the best i've encountered. You can explore the world of Hyboria for free till LvL 80, and even then you don't have to pay. It demands on your personal playstyle. Yes this game is not the newest, but the graphics get the job done, and if you add SweetFX this game looks amazing. I've played this game before and after it went F2P - and a lot has changed.My biggest contra is the offering of new content, but even this get sorted out slowly. Server issues were adressed, a huge amount of Bugfixes happened - at least this game isn't perfect, but its unique style, theme and story really captures me.Forgot Elves, dwarfs, and that other lazorpony ♥♥♥♥.

												As MMO's go this is by far my favorite, a Visually impressive huge, dark and brutal fantasy world with hundreds of hours of exploration and questing. Unique combat mechanics unlike any other MMO, War Mammoth mounts for PvP wars and plenty of PvE and dungeons for those who aren’t interested in the PvP. Guilds can build, yes actually build their own stronghold with harvested resources and wage war against other guilds on huge battlefields with hundreds of players at once. Beware this is a mature hardcore mmo and possibly one of the most complex and in-depth to date. For any MMO fan this is a must, and now it’s F2P and certainly not pay to win.			"

												Funcom has brought the game a long way since its rocky beginnings and a lot of care has been taken in improving each aspect of the game that is currently not up to par. For a game that for quite some time looked like it would cease to exist, it is exciting to see the game back on its feet. There are many hours to be spent exploring this beautifully crafted world, and I completely geeked out many times. The latest Adventure Pack has helped to bridge a large gap between the Tier 3 and 4 raids, an issue that plagued many players and halted progression. With the right eye players will find a magical world full of rich lore, gruesome gore and plenty of barely clothed wenches. What more could you truly ask for?			"

												I spent some hours on this game. While I'm not a huge fan of MMORPG games, I really love the world created by Robert E. Howard and other stuff connected with Conan of Cimmeria. I really enjoyed Age of Conan, but it was not about the atmosphere. I liked the fighting system, storyline (like that one on Tortage), graphics and breathtaking music. It's free2play now, so if you are guessing if you're going to like it or not - then you might try it and see if you like it or not. As I wrote before, I personally enjoyed playing this game.			"

												This game is now ruined it was my favoured MMORPG out of the whole crowd, even World Of Warcraft could not contest against it in my opinion because it never took itself seriously. The narratives and quests in this game are always in depth, the story is top notch but would you expect otherwise with a game built on the Conan universe of Hyboria? PvE and PvP servers which are absolutely brilliant and have a lovely community dedicated to the game and its survivability before the free to play conversion to this very day, huge content and beautiful graphics and interface. Violance and portrayed as grusome as it should be according to the Conan Universe sticking to its roots. The marketplace had only cosmetic products and had no end-game content which made this in my opinion the untalked of superior MMO of this current day.NOW this game is slightly ruined for me and I will tell you for why, the announcement in December in which I did not read and now I suddenly see 'Pay for Level 80 Instantly Today!' for the price of £35.00. I love FunCom and all of the games they produce, like Secret World etcetera but guys, you are ruining this game now it is practically ruined for what it originally was.			"

												As an avid fan of the Conan Franchise, from the Arnold Schwartzenegger Movies, to the original Novels and even some of the Comic Adaptations over the years, I was actually surprised to learn a Conan based MMO even existed, how did a 7 year old game fall under my radar?! It was a great idea with a large scale universe that is easy to immerse oneself in and explore for themselves. And it was Free to Play on Steam!? Of course I would try this out, I heard some less than favorable things about it but I figured I'd try it for myself. But was I satisfied with this game? No. Why? Well first off the combat system, now I know the game is old and that it wanted to try something new in regards to the typical MMORPG style of Combat; but seriously, it is tough to pull off, from what I can tell; many of the special attacks outside of one's main three left-right-upward thrust attacks, are executions one has to pull off by pressing the key to activate it again AFTER pressing it the first time (WHY!?) and then pressing the basic combat thrusts to fully execute the executions. I like the idea but the fact that the tutorial on how to do it is easily forgettable and very easy to mess up makes your attempt to pull off these executions pretty much a failure and no extra damage out of them will happen. That would not be so much of a problem if this games idea of difficulty scaling wasn't basically making every enemy you face off against when doing a side-quest literally 3 levels higher than you by the time you do it. The last time I played this game (and trust me, it will be the LAST time); it was when I was doing the lowest level possible side-quest for my character which was level 8 by the time I was doing it, and the quest involved me just having to kill 3 pirates; easy right? Not really; because they were level 11, and you CAN'T fight them one at a time, eventually they'll all join in and tackle me and kill me. I cannot even complete the lowest level side-quest in the game at Level 8; it's like the moment you reach level 6-8; the difficulty spikes up to levels that could reach Jupiter! Maybe if I can buy some good items from the shopkeeps; maybe that'll help me? Nope; not even high enough level for me to even buy them. And enemy grinding doesn't work because the cap for XP gains dies out at 2 levels or lower! The only time I have EVER seen ANYONE in game (which is rarity because the games' servers are empty), they have paid for the exclusive weapons via-microtransactions. That means the only way possible to beat the game after level 6 at minimum is to pay for good items with REAL MONEY. Now look; I know Free to Play and Microtransactions go hand in hand and you're probably saying; ""What did you expect!? How else are they going to make money!?"" And to be fair, I am not against Microtransactions; I think they are a necessary evil for games like these, however; I do NOT believe they should be forced upon the players to the point where it is only possible to continue with such (might as well put a paywall), nor do I think the exclusive items should be so overpowered that they create an imbalance between players who pay and players who don't. That said, why is it that a game that is so beautiful and enriched by the Conan Universe so lackluster!? I can only guess that my feelings are the same as others. I don't recommend this game for anyone, the game itself is not strong enough to stand on it's own and only got my attraction because of the Conan name. Conan deserves better.			"

												I played this game a lot, seriously, and here is what it isPros:- Hardcore game mechanics -> Different gears, different feat trees, really cool stuff can come out- Dungeons -> The game has one of best PvE concept i have ever seen in any MMO- Great maps and items etc. -> amazing view (Disclude T5  plz, never saw my guard look that gay. Not to mention T5 raid is actually T1+Defibrillator)- Story -> Good one.- Music -> Very best ones. Tortage specially.- Flame/Vortex/Palace -> These are dungeons you will hear a lot, and probably will do a lot at lvl 80, but great way to learn character, boss mechanics, testing fantasia feats etc. etc.Cons: - GM-Player relations -> They answer fast sure, but answer is ""We can't offer that service"" usualy or ""thanks for sharing information blah blah"" sort of stuff when you try to show a greatly exploitable bug or want to report some one. Ofc they fix things fast when its about payment and so on.- Bugs -> I was able to do Tier 5 raid just by simply jumping in to wall :P not to mention some classes doing fear combo on you at pvp and you end up being in ground can't contribute to team, many more bugs to count.- Class Balance -> Clearly in PvE there wasn't such a thing called balance just because peeps in pvp QQ'd hard enough to make dev's change classes game mechanics and mostly reduce them to dust (Most basic example Conq nerf where pve conq's literally had to made pressure to get it reversed)/ PS-Pro tip: Don't start game as Guardian, nor any other tank, play a healer or a mage at start. Specially HoX, they are best ""Wanna learn"" classes.- Community -> If you can call handfull of people a community, be my guest. Else than that there are few guilds for each interest, so the way you play, makes you go into a certain guild.- Era's of hack -> There are times come and go, that a hack gets into game, which basically ruins the game. The fun thing there were cases where GM's did nothing to those cheater players, one of other players actually took a great video, if not enough brought a GM with him to prove some one is hacking, result? nothing happened.- PvP -> i appriciate the fact that they try hard to revive it, but no matter how much you use the defibrillator on a dead body, its dead bro :/- Nudity -> Over displayed. Some love this factor, but i greatly dislike, even hate it.- Pay to Win -> Well, if you only buy the expansions, the premium game time and then buy an inventory slot maaaaybe not that pay to win :P But want to get that 20 win streak in pvp? Here is some Indemnity for you!So the point is, if you have money to spend, and a time to spare, go give charity and read a book, don't waste here :P But if you insist on playing the game, you can contact me, i can guide you trough what ever you want I played this game instead of breathing for a while.

And MMO have a tendency to have spawning monsters, and I hate when I killed one, slowly advance, and the guy I just killed spawn behind me. Conan offer a solo quest, but its full of bugs, plus its force me out and grind xp in common world anyway. Good settings, but since I dont like button smashing games, this gets thumbs down.			"

Age of Conan: UnchainedVersion 5.1Playtime ~6 hoursSize ~25GBIn Age of Conan you play a barbarian or a wizard of your picking, you start off as a slave(totally not a Morrowind ripoff) on a ship that crashes and then ghosts whisper sweet nothings to you as you are washed on the shore where a friendly local old man tells you to head for Tortilla in order to gain freedom.As you move through jungle, slaying pirates, natives and gorillas alike, you finally reach gates of Tortilla. There the guard tells you that your shackle fashion is not okay in the city and you are forced to conform to the local acceptable dressing code instead.After that you're free to do nothing as there is a severe lack of low level quests, which changes at around level 9-10 where you get far too many quests, even though they're all the same under the hood. You spend most of the game at the local inn getting wasted and talking to the local cat.Leveling is slow and there is no one around to help you since the game seems to be on its last legs as there is barely anyone else to be found. Your days are spent creeping around static NPCs whose only purpose in life is to do barely anything.Sometimes you use a boat to teleport to another location full of natives and crocodiles but nothing much changes. You slay them or they slay you sometimes, repeat repeat. Combat was fun until I realized that essentially you get 3 of the same basic attack and to use a special attack you have to press two buttons in a sequence instead of one like in most games. All this does is reduce your keyboard lifespan. It does not add to the gameplay much besides having to remember which direction an ability needs.Playing alone is really tough since world NPCs respawn really fast and when you're done with one group, it will start respawning, locking you into an infinite wave survival.  This game could work a lot better if you dealt a bit more damage and enemies did not respawn as fast. I wanted to invite my son to play with me but the game mechanics were a bit too complex for a 9 year old. Though it is for the best since I would not want to damage his mind with how poor the game plays.I played until level 15 and could not do any more as it felt more tedious than a manual labor job. All you do is run from one bland place to another doing bland quests killing mostly bland enemies. There is no strategy, just monotone grind. Maybe it gets better in higher levels but if after 6 hours it is all the same, that is more than enough to say no. I originally intended to play until when you leave Tortilla but I changed my mind after all the mind numbing experience.======- Additional DownloadsAfter runnig the game from Steam, the launcher has to download more content. This puts up false expectations of being able to play as it is done downloading. Sorta like when gifting your nephew a Wii U but then having it to update for 3 hours straight.- Separate account registrationThe game does not use steamworks and forces you to register a separate account with their system. That's more nonsense to go through before you can jump into the world of Conan the Barbosa.- Slow launcher launchEvery time you open the game, launcher needs to rescan everything which takes longer than it should. Every. SINGLE. TIME.- Bad latencyI don't know which server I was assigned to, but the game would constantly average at 140ms which is ridiculous considering there's total of three other people playing. Though this is most likely due to them being unable to afford more servers since no one is playing.- Quest limit of 30You cannot have more than 30 active quests at a time. If you want new quests, you need to delete old ones. I get that this is an old game, but come on, update it once in a while to allow more than that.- Quest tracking limitYou can only have 3 quests being tracked at one time and you cannot have 0 tracked quests as at least one needs to be tracked at all time. The UI to track/untrack quests is also painfully clunky.  - One character slot limitSeriously!? Can't even try out other classes unless you either delete your existing character or create 10 new accounts. I suppose you need more registered accounts to show some activity to your bosses.- No populationIt feels like a ghost town. During all of my playthrough I saw 5 other players, one of whom invited me to a Russian clan where admin proceeded to purge all inactive accounts, dropping clan member count from 80-something to 7 including me.- Generic questsTypical mmo quests of going here killing X of that. Very monotone and it gets annoying to walk back and forth.+ Fun clothing and armorArmor, weapons and clothes are rather enjoyable to look at with the realistic barbarian style. It is always fun to just take an ax that does not have any glowing elvish inscriptions and smack some pirates with it.+ ExecutionsNot many MMOs have fancy executions. This is not one of them, but the executions Conan does have are fairly decent. Sometimes they go all wonky and animations don't exactly match but hacking someone's head off or taunting your target while your ax is embedded in their chest is rather fun as far as this sort of stuff goes.+ Low level enemies don't attackEnemies with much lower level than you will stop being hostile and will allow you safe passage. Saves some time when you have to go to same place a hundred times for all the different quests that unlock one after another rather all at once.ConclusionIt is a dying game standing on its last legs. Wish it went open source so that others could turn it into an actually epic adventure rather than having this mess of a tryhard mmo.Final rating 3/9Not worth the weight			"

												This game is just too old without any love shown to it. For example, there is not a vertical sync option in the game, the UI does not scale to higher resolutions, and it continues to have a ton of junk loot with even a found boss mob alligator dropping just an item to be sold for a small amount of cash. It's an interesting historical look at MMOs though as some of the game mechanics show off what used to be acceptable. For example, the voice-acting takes place only in dialogue scenes instead of happening during the action to provide narration and context to the world, so instead of enhancing the experience, it interrupts it. Also, they've pulled back heavily on the gore that was the most fun thing about the game. I used to get ridiculous, sick kill effects, but the kills for my character were all boring and standard. Plus, it used to have the maiden you find in the tutorial be chained up with breasts exposed but now they've covered her up. This game's mature (and Conan appropriate) edge was what made it stand out. . .  I'm amazed they've lost the good bits and haven't seemed to have any engineers working on keeping the game engine fresh and viable. . .   but then this is a game that launched incomplete, so maybe their time has been focused on completing the game. . .  or maybe since it is 8 years old, they're just milking it with a few employees and keeping it open for fans. However, if you're returnign to see if it has improved, I'm afraid the opposite is true.			"

												I have a natural hardon for this game.Doesn't spoon feed you everything like other MMO's.Restarted playing after a 6 year break.After playing countless MMO's, nothing filled the void that I had when I leftthis game. It has it's faults like others, but the grittiness of the brutal world makes it very forgiving. Stick to it through Tortage (LvL1-20) and you'll be rewarded with a wonderful world of Epic boss battles, exploration, building your fortified keeps with your guild.I honestly don't mind paying for this game, unless it's for a lvl 80 character.So challenging, so brutal and so unique.

												After having played it for a while I am going to have to thumbs down this one. The graphics are acceptable. The fighing is clunky requiring you to have 3 hands to manage all the keys you have to hit and still be mobile. The quest system is garbage on the starter island. There is no linear quest progression it gives them to you all at once with most not being able to be completed when they open up.			"

												Age of Conan.  I’m not entirely sure where to start with this review.  I started playing the game in October 2015, after a friend told me that it was their go-to MMO, so I thought I would try it out.  For the age of the game itself, the graphics are not too shabby at all, and would happily put a few more modern MMOs to shame.  The downside to this comes when it’s World Boss time, and there are spells being cast, and exotic damage graphics galore, which really leech memory and induces spectacular lag.The play-style I found clunky at first, with the need to use key combos to make attacks work, but I got used to that.  Not being able to use a mount to get around the game until level 40 was a bug-bear, especially with the sheer amount of running around maps that’s required.  The map interface is pretty poor if you want to see where you are in relation to the rest of the world as there is no button that takes you directly back to viewing the area you’re in – you need to know the name of the area you’re in and select it from a drop-down list.  Local travel merchants in-game: location names not always accurate, so if you’re new and don’t know where you’re going, it can get expensive.Like most other MMOs I’ve played, Age of Conan has an in-game “item store”, where you can buy un-lockable chests, better mounts, un-lockable areas, etc..  Funcom (which will further be referred to as F.U.com) recently “re-vamped” this, in presumably and effort to make it more snazzy.  In my humble opinion, they failed miserably.  It is now open by default when you log-in to any toon, and it pops up at random intervals, usually when you’re in the middle of fighting something vaguely important.  The prices for the items within it also seemed to change – somewhat unsurprisingly they made everything more expensive, so you get less bang for your buck.Another of their latest “re-vamps” to the game is a daily login “reward” system.  This entails having yet another pop-up window in your face when you log into your toon, but not just the first time you log in each day, it’s there every time regardless of whether you’ve claimed your daily “reward” or not.  The “rewards” themselves are okay.  On top of this, if you’re a subscriber you also have the loyalty reward system, which is claimable from the item store, once per toon, but require you to have been subbed for different amounts of days depending on the reward being offered.  These don’t change month-to-month, and are only claimable as long are you are a subscriber.The latest update included a number things, one of the most notable being opening up pay-to-play/purchasable areas to free-to-play players who’ve already purchased the areas, but not raising the in-game currency cap for free-to-play players.  In terms of PvP, I have no experience of this in-game, and I'm not likely to venture into it either. Offline levels have disappeared in the lastest update too.  These were one of the perks that subscirbers could enjoy, where every few days you gained a level token you could use on a toon to level it up.While the game's fun to play overall, I won't recommend it.

												This game is too old to have all the bugs it has in it, Quests can be broken, Items that says only can have 1 you can have multiple of and some you cant even delete out of your very limited bag. game has confirmations except where it is really nessary e.g the petition section of where you try to get help dont accidently click delete petition because you can spend 30 minutes or so creating one and then go to respond to it like the support emails say and then the whole petiton and the days you waited was a waste.

												Quick read :-DO NOT PLAY, DO NOT SUPPORT THIS TERRIBLE EXCUSE OF A DEVELOPER.I played this game back in 2008 when it first came out it was pretty cool, yes buggy as hell and ran like crap but still a decent game....I came back wanting to lop some heads off as a little past-time but issues permit me from doing this, Firstly steam downloads 15gig of files and then another patcher attempts to download 4 gig more ( Developer should just update steams files to a recent build) The patcher simply fails 99% of the time and downloads nothing in hours and then has a sudden spurt and then fails again and sits idle.......I have attemptrd to contact support 3 times and you get no answer at all, and whats worse is ive logged into the forums and i see no way of creating a new post at all, so ♥♥♥♥ it too much hassle.They have announced a new conan game buy avoid it like the plague funcom are ♥♥♥♥♥.

												It's not a bad game, I haven't find a way to enjoy it for more. There isn't many things I can say about Age of Conan: Unchained - if you enjoy action Multi Massive Online games then you will probably like it more than I do. Graphics are also nice and there are female's coconuts, so if you have a good time looking at them it's a good reason to give this game at least a try. Since it's free to play go and check yourself if it's a game worth playing.			"

												This game is like it always is.... It's fun at first. Thats fun for about 366 hours. THEN the fun stops. And why is that? It's simply because:1. Not enough players pr server2. Not a RP server (for those that enjoys roleplay)3. Not enough good quests. Most quests are repetative and boring really. That's about it. I have much more fun playing Path of Exile without guild and friends than playing Age of Conan in a guild with lots of people to chat to. That says it all.			"

												Well.. What a dissapointment.. After two hours of playing this and coming from premium MMOs this was a dissapointment.. The cash shop.. Well that didn't really affect me it was the actual aspect of the ranged classes was literally useless and the only class which is suitable is melee classes.. With the range in this game you have to litereally stand still and shoot while the enemies are slowly killing you.. This is with any ranged class which is something which I couldn't handle coming from WoW and Archeage as well as Neverwinter and GW2Unfortunately I can't recommend this and If you are a main ranged class I wouldn't personally recommend it either.

												Bugs, bugs, bugs. For a game that's 7 years of age I'd imagine they'd have fixed it by now. 2 hours in and all the skills from the skillbar just vanish. Ok, whatever, for now I'll just make my pets attack and just stand around. Then, the pet command slider disappears, so now the pets are useless. ""Oh? Owner is being attacked? Lol whatever."" 7 years and no one thought to make the combat mechanics and the camera angle at least a bit more sufferable? A basic attack is literally classed as a skill. I was having a fun time, then as time went on the cons just began to outweigh the pros. Pros:-Decent story. (horribly cliche, though. But if that's your thing, go for it.)-A wide variety of classes and custimization.-Decent graphics for a game of its time.Cons: -Mediocre characters-Poor combat system-Terrible camera angle-Cashing in on sex by oversexualising characters. (It's common nowadays, but just because a lot of developers do it doesn't mean it should just be dismissed as a normality. It's just pathetic because you actually achieve the opposite effect, ugliness, revolt and you make it impossible to take the character seriously because as a developer you don't either.)The story has potential, but the gameplay is not satisfying and the characters are poorly written. Like for example, at the very beginning of the game: The slaveboat your character is on crashes and sinks. You get stranded on a beach and wake up to find a random stranger approaching you. The stranger sits crouches next to you and begins to give you directions. Not even a ""hello."" or a ""Woah, are you ok?"" Nope. Just right off the bat he says: ""The city is this way and this and that is that way, be careful."" My only reaction was: ""Wait, what? Who the ♥♥♥♥ are you again? Help pls? I'm probably DYING?!"" I've rambled for long enough and if you've made it this far down, well, if you should choose to install it, prepare for an experience that is very much like watching ""The Room"". It's horrible but has a charm to it for all the wrong reasons. Thanks for reading. <3 "

When it was launched i was lookin forward to it all these fatality thingies the way you fight bu when i played it through i was totally dissapointed full of bags some classes are way OP the whole siege pvp mode is rubish and its too damn shame it could have been a very very good MMO.Dont spend time on this fail sinkin game wanna play mmo there are dozens out there 100 times better and way more balanced than this one trust me i learned it the hard way at least you ddnt have to pay for this crapP.SMy advice never spend time on a game that was P2P and went F2P it just means something and generally never trust F2P games			"

												Nice game, if you are bored and looking for something to entertain your self with for a while, Age of Conan: Unchained (ACU) will provide you with few hours of enjoyment. Sadly, like every game with PvP content, ACU has quite few fake PvPers. Fake PvPers are the players that do not have a clue on PvPing so they use ganging or the level adventage in order to brag on how ""good"" of PvPer they are.In My humble opinion I think the game diserves at 7/10 based on how old the game is. keep in mind that is an old software.Taking in consideration how old the game is, I do think the expansions are a bit high on price.

												The physics are a joke in this game. Horrible character gestures, stupid animations on abilities and spell designs. The only positive thing in this game is boobs, and only boobs. The rest of the things, both primary and secondary matters are too primal for a game which is released in 2016, or even 2008! I can easily claim that Brutal Legend, which is made in 2009 can eat this game in graphics, and gestures and face mimics. I suggest you all not wasting your time downloading this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.

I have been play`d  this game on release and was great the problem was that not many had at the time the rig to play on and enjoy this game plus the game introduced many many new things to the  MMO genre. And the lame kids dissed the game because there was no ""META"" how noobs  say this day`s.        The game from then only got better and better and now is even better all servers merged only 2 remain and they are crowded.

												Ignore the hrs played, its my time in the steam client, i have a level 72 pom from launch. The game seems just as solid as the first time i played it. Tortage still strikes me as one of the best tutorial areas on any mmo i have ever played. Those of you who played in the beta weekends and then the launch probably remember the utter heartbreak of leaving tortage and discovering that the later production didn't match the island and then the hell levels where there was litterally no content...sigh. I'm playing again though to give it another go after hearing good things. I'm told these things were fixed.That said...my immediate concern and why at this time, i cant recommend the game. Funcom...Microtransactions should be micro over £10 is not micro, £5 is a reasonable price to pay for a char slot, more then that and you are just guaging. I would have brought one at that price... and doing crappy things like charging 1500 for a character slot, but selling in bunches of 400 is just lame.			"

												This game is a complete cluster ♥♥♥♥ from the start! They through you into combat by saying ""press 1, 2 and 3 to attack"" which never worked! Then I realised I had to hold the Alt key down in order to attack! And my least favorite thing is the controls... First of all there is no visible way to quit this piece of ♥♥♥♥, there isn't any way to edit the settings and worst of all is the piece of crap camera angles! HOLDING the right mouse botton keeps the camera fixed behind you and the holding the left mouse botton lets you move the camera around! But heres the catch: when you move the camera freely, IT FIXES IN THE POSITION THAT YOU LEFT IT SO YOU WILL BE STUCK WITH AN AWKWARD CAMERA ANGLE! this game is a waste of time playing and an hour and 30 minutes waste of download time.

												THIS WILL HAVE TWO PARTS PVE AND PVP.PVEso i got the game. make a toon it has 1,2,3,4, pages of making one. then time to give it a name. name i want is taken ok but... it backs me out to page 1 and i have to repick everything for my toon again. this took like 15m as i really wanted a variant of that name. so now i get to long into game. befor i even move using w,a,s,d, i fall thro the floor of the viking area into water. ok its a new game so i relog get back into game now i am on a floor and i am able to use w,a,s,d, and read all the tool tips. now this part of the game i loved the graphics looked good, sound was great. i leave the main town i am atked by and npc right near the exit of the main town. i ran not knowing what lv the npc was and the town guards killed it. the controls are close to mount and blade warband and so is combat. i join a guild all nice guys and gave me a few tips. also i read a bit about the game befor i got it so i would know how to spend my str, dex, hp, points. so i was told i should go at lv 1 and kill lv 1-9 npcs near town i did but i found a lv 23 when i was only lv 2. i was able to kill it and i had 75% or so of my hp left. only do this if you are good at mount and blade warband as the exp is well worth it. so imo pve is greatPVPok so i goto a town with pplz from my clan we atk said town it had no players that i could see. a few npcs. we break a few gates with our spears and swords and take said town. i get paid for helping kinda like a mini quest i guss. then i goto a tournament where if you die you lose nothing ok great good way to get exp and test my skills. haha lol. its 19 vs 21 we had the 21. so its what team can get more kills in say 10m. its was 13 to over 100 near the end of the tournament my side lost. the lag i went thro was bad. i would be hitting someone and think i am doing great next thing i knew i was on the floor dead while the person i thought i was atking had little to no dmg. so imo PVP needs a lot of work befor its worth anything and since its the main part of the game well to me anyways i would say wait to get this game till they fix lag also i would say game is worth as is 10.00-15.00 so wait for a sale.

Nothing about any extra steps to add the game to my account.No information about the game being added to my account, or any buttons or ANYTHING!!!.Check my acocunt and the game is still NOT added.Got basically stuck in a repeating loop of ZERO PROGRESS!!!End result, the game is a paperweight of software that does nothing. UNPLAYABLE!Not a good first impression for a tile. Make it almost impossible for a player to get into the game right out of the box.The last thing I want to do is spend hours pooring through user forumes, and troubleshooting and tech support and a bunch of hoops just to start the game.

I uninstalled and tried again and it happened again.Just recently, I use steam to download the game and it updates fine, but after changing my password multiple times for an old account I had it would never let me sign in and I tried for two accounts. I think the password it kept sending back to me was for Secret World even though I have never even tried to play that game.Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me!!			"

												My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.			"

												extremely outdated look, subpar animation, clunky user interface.(Edit since some found my review lacking of detail)its from 2008, its not as old as you would think.As for compareing it to games of its time Star Wars Galaxies (2003) looked better. While (SWG) slightly dated look now there approach aged better then this because of their style, highly stylised games do not always age well. City of Heros (2004) had better animations, more fluid movements, higher quality (more detail in the movements). Also as much as i hate it World of Warcraft (2004), it has had only some minor animation inprovements over the years its still basically the same game. This list goes on to games MMO or Single player, they chose a visual style that would not age well coupled with probably fairly inexperienced animators, at the time most animations in games were the devs stumbling through the movements instead of a skilled or trained animator.Additionally just because a game is old does not mean it is above criticism. When you put a movie, game, tv show, ect (any form of art) out into the world it can be critisised forever its age doesnt mean anything although it can lend a form of understanding or lense of ""this is the best of what they had to work with at the time"". This game however is just visually bad and boreing when compared to games of it generation.Also the stroy was not gripping in anyway as to overlook the other parts where it falls short.			"

												Early review based on getting my chracter to level 15.Having bought Conan Exiles I thought I would give AOC a look. So far I am really enjoying it and there seems to be quite a lively population for such an old game. The graphics although somewhat dated are gorgeous on full settings. The combat system is quite good fun relying on left, upper and right hand attacks along with special combo moves that can be chained for various effects including some lovely finishers.There are plenty of quest givers scattered around the starting zone with plentiful rewards of armor and weaponry. The thing I like most is the idea of a `night-time` zone that is used to persue your individual `destiny quests` as opposed to `day-time` which you share with other players.My favourite aspect is the ability to have armor items on a fashion tab which have no effect on your actual gear ratings. If you want to run round nekkid whilke defeating your foes then have at it :)In short if you like MMOs then I would definitely recommend giving this a look. It definitely rates as an `oldy but goody` in my book.			"

Age of ConanFirst let me say I play a lot of MMORPGs and am subscribed to three of the largest and play others.  Age of Conan was a game I was excited for when it was released in 2008, as were many of my friends I played other MMOs with.  It was a hopeful challenger to the older and ""Gold Standard"" of MMOs, World of Warcraft or WoW.  It appeared to be a hit for the first couple of months by the sales and the community, patient as they were for the promised game, hung in for a few more months. Hawever, by the 5th month the game qucikly died off, like several other MMOs that didn't meet expectations of the consumers, leaving only the hopeful fans.  TL;DRThe game in general is lack luster by todays standards.  For a game still trying to get money out of your wallet via micro transactions and subscriptions, Funcom has done little to the graphics engine, combat system, and UI to make it  feel current, fluid, and fun. Play this if you are a fan of the Conan lore and old school RPGs and can adapt to the awkward combat system. FaultsThe chief complaints were that the game was buggy and the zones following the starting area felt unfinished and lacked end game content.  Although Funcom has fixed many of these issues over time, the game struggled to produce revenue with a small community.  As a result it was repackaged as a FTP in 2011 (Unchained edition) with a business model that limited your ability to play this game as an MMO if you do not purchase the expansions/subscription packages. This also had problems, much like Rift faces today, with step prices for content and pay-to-win/ pay-to-progress debates. Current Business ModelFuncom has recently removed some, not all, of the pay restrictions for non-subscribers to access content such as zones and instances.  You can purchase game packages including expansions, T1 & T2 gear sets, mounts, loot boxes, consumables, and bonuses via micro transactions. A set of Tier armor will cost you $60 USD while mounts range between $10-20 and expansions will cost just under $20 each.  Subscribers still pay $15 a month and recieve increased XP, loot, and currencies. GameplayAge of Conan offers a unique love/hate combat system.  The combat system is designed so that you can attack and block in multiple dirrections with combos.  However, the system feels unnecessarily complex, slow, and clunky with animations that lack a wow factor.  The combat performs more of what you would expect from a small indie team rather than a triple-A studio supporting a giant MMORPG. And compared to a MMORPG like Black Desert Online (BDO), the combat system is aweful. You can chose to play in two game settings, PvP and PvE, on three server types, PvE, PvP, and RP.  Player vs Player is enabled when you want to play in the sunlight with other players. On a PvE server, enemy NPCs are in the world to attack rather than actual players. Player vs Enviroment is the night phase and you will not encounter other players as well as have completely different quest lines. This is a open world game however some areas are instanced and the world lacks the size of WoW, ESO, Rift, and BDO.  GraphicsAge of Conan was a beautiful game when it was released and pushed the boundries of MMOs of the time period. However, by today's standards it is lack luster at best. The game lacks brilliant attack/spell animations leaving you with a feeling of blah when fighting with your character. Some people may not mind this but when combined with the slow awkward feel of the attacks, it is not very satisfying.  While other MMOs have updated the engine, combat, and textures to ncrease the graphical fidelity of the game world to current standards, Funcom has done very little to Conan. Compared to other triple-A MMOs you can play for free like WoW, SWTOR, ESO, Rift, and BDO, Age of Conan is a jewel in the rough and only shines in the story.StoryThe story is set in a great lore based world and this would be the only reason to recommend this game to anyone. The writing is great and interacting with the quests NPCs can be very enjoyable. I found myself laughing several times at the dialog. The voice acting isn't bad, but I wouldn't call it great either. You will encounter a wide range of accents which can aid with immersion and also break it when the large white viking looking barbarian suddenly speaks to you with an East Indian accent.  However, this is by far some of the best dialog I have experienced with NPCs in an MMO. RecommendationIf you are a fan of the Conan lore and enjoy RPGs, then this may be a game for you provided you can adapt to the awkward combat system.  If not, then there are several other FTP MMORPGs that offer a more enjoyable experience.			"

												So I've recently decided to finaly check this game out. And I must say, for a 7 year old game, It's incredible. There is so much to do and the community is absolutely amzaing. Which is pretty darn rare for a game this old. One of my fav games ""Destiny"" is 2,5 years old now, and that community has pretty much turned to ♥♥♥♥. Anyway...Gr8 game.			"

												Overall Awesome Experience. If you are a fan of Robert E. Howard's Conan stories then you can't miss this one.Spent hours and hours over several years playing this and I must say that I enjoyed every minute of it. What can I say, the story is awesome, the soundtrack is amazing. The game is from 2007 so don't expect awesome graphics this stage. Funcom is already working on the successor for this game however I do think you can still give this one a try. A few expansions and places to explore have been added to this one that increase the replay ability. in essence this never gets old.Highly recommend.			"

												This was the first MMO I played. It was fun then and it would be fun for anyone who is NEW to MMO's now as long as you're playing with someone else who is into it, too. Assassin and Ranger teams are good.			"

												Excellent MMO for those looking for originality, diversity, story and last, but certainly not least...PVP.It's been vastly under appreciated.			"

												This game has kept going with updates since 2008 and is now really nice, very large playfields with lots of dungeons and raids. If Age of Conan had been this great from start after all improvements it had attracted thousands more players.Now I hope new players will find this game as it is well above a standard mmo game out there (yes I did play lots of them). It should be said that the game is not for a casual clicker as it is a difficult game and after passing through the first months playing vanilla instances I can encounter some unforgiving game mechanics, but that makes it fun as challenge is what keeps me going.It is quite lenghty too as you can play for months and still didnt see it all.
