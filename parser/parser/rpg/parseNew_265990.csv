												Roguelikes (or at least roguelites) on Steam are almost a dime a dozen nowadays.  What exactly sets Rogue's Tale apart from the heavyweight in this category on Steam - Dungeons of Dredmor?  Honestly…. not much.  If you want an in-depth experience with multitudes of classes, skills, and items types, don't look here.  Rogue's Tale is, simply put, a roguelike distilled to the genres' simplest concepts:	1) Turn and grid based play, randomly generated dungeons and encounters, and perma-death.	2) Unnecessarily clunky and cumbersome controls.  	3) Unyielding difficulty, unfair and frustrating deaths that encourage you to punch holes through your monitor.	4) Addictive as crack.  There's no crafting, only a small number of different basic item types, and essentially only three different archetypes you can play with the limited number of skill choices in the game - mage, fighter, and archer.  Yet this simplicity is a large part of what makes this game so addictive.  It's just so easy to walk through a dungeon, floor by floor, killing monsters and discovering treasures until you inevitably get killed by a lucky arrow or random spike trap.  Just one more death until I sleep, I swear!  Seriously though, you will die in this game.  And you will die a lot, often within 5 minutes of character creation.  Don't expect any handholding, other than some sparse tutorial messages.  Your deaths will be unfair.  My record is actually a death within two turns, less than 10 seconds into the game.  Human and humanoid NPCs in this game have similar stats, skills, and equipment as you, after all.  The difference is the human controlling your character.   Thus, the only way to improve is to master the game mechanics and unlock different heritages, skills and equipment that carry over to your future characters.  At least until you get flattened by a cave bear.  As part of the challenge, nothing in this game is identified.  Sometimes this is nice - you'll find that your sword is causing status effects on your enemies, for example.  But other times it's just plain annoying.  In most other games, you wouldn't think twice about drinking an unidentified potion if you're really in danger of dying.  In this game, the potions are more likely to kill you than not - there are a total of 24 potions in this game, 5 of which are beneficial, 19 of which are poison.  An additional problem with requiring identification is that storekeepers simply will not buy unidentified items from you.  This is a severe disadvantage through your first couple of playthroughs before you  unlock any heritages.  It doesn't help that 90% of items you find will cost more to identify than how much you can sell them for.There certainly are many complaints that I have with the game.  Those aforementioned heritages are far too difficult to unlock after the first couple.  Just an example - I played over 15 hours on a single character, grinding through dungeon after dungeon, before I was able to unlock the enchantment and ring heritages.  Yes, everything is randomly generated, but it really should not take that long to unlock.  It's extra difficult because the game does not give you a list of the items that you've already found or identified.  So if you see a missing item in the town store or a travelling merchant, you may not know that you need to purchase that item.  Frankly, this was the reason I got tired of the game.  At some point (admittedly 40 hours into the game), you just feel like the rate of reward and advancement becomes far too slow.  The controls in this game are also pretty terrible and needlessly complicated.  Different weapon types have different keys you need to press in order to attack with them.  Controls that work in the equipment screen don't work in the shop screens.  It seems like the only reason that this control scheme was used is to pay homage to the classics of this genre.  There's honestly no reason otherwise.  I left this game a ""recommanded"" rating, but I would really only recommend it to people who enjoy playing punishing roguelikes.  Everyone else, please stay far away.  As the reviews on Hack, Slash, and Loot indicate, if you aren't looking for a game in this genre, you will not like this game.			"

												Oh Jesus Christ, where do I start.The learning curve caps relatively early (15 hours in I learned all the tricks and neat strats alone. 35? Went online and♥♥♥♥♥♥ Found out more.)After the learning curve caps out, then it's the RNG grinding. There's not too much you can do to manipulate the game in your favor with the equipment you have to make a really distinctive difference. And it sucks. It takes a lot of control out of the player's hands and it feels really sloppy to scoop up anything beyond a kill in a 2 v 1 fight. Either you win or you don't. And it's seldom close.You need to grind for more starting equipment. Prodegies. Traits. It's really cruel and unusual. It's basically telling the gamer you aren't meant to play this for the first time and win. Ever. See; ToME, NetHack, Stone Soup. Roguelikes where every class comes at face value and you CAN potentially GG with ALL of them. It takes a lot out of you.Leveling up is a curse and you actually literally need Woof to potentially win the game. Enemies scale with your level. Equipment drops stay relatively the same. It really, really sucks. Woof, on the other hand, can be at level 20, while you coast at level 2. It's really needed for early/mid gaming where you can stall levels with your dog. I wouldn't dare recommend it to anyone. It's ♥♥♥♥ing suicide. It's a good price? It's very challenging? I've obviously sunk a lot of hours into it but I'm not. It's. No.EDIT:: Y'all can't sit here and seriously blame people who ""just aren't hxc roguelike fans"". ♥♥♥♥ing Dungeon Crawl wouldn't do some♥♥♥♥♥♥like this and it's damn hard for all the right reasons.There's roguelikes, and then there's this. This isn't standard roguelike formula. This is hell.			"

												Death Simulator 2000. I hate this game. I hate it with every fiber of my being. I die over and over again. Then, like a ray of hope, I start to progress. Level 6, then 7. Level 9.. could it be? Level 10. Fully geared. Reset the dungeon twice. Im finally making progress. Then I open a door to 3 orcs and a wolf. Well, theres 2 hours of wasted progress. Screw this game. ...Alright, one more go.			"

												Enjoy all the brutalizing by procs?  This game is for you.  Marvel at the game throwing an enemy at you on the second floor that kills you in two hits.  Watch as the only way for you to progress is barred by a door in a narrow hallway with a deadly spike pit in front of it, creating a scenario where you actually can not succeed.  Gaze in awe as the first mushroom you attempt to pluck poisons you, the poison being uncurable and lethal by normal means and forcing you to sell necessary provisions in order to cure it.  It's a good thing that chance is such a big factor in this game that it renders most of the skills undesirable, seeing as how you will probably not find a bow, but will find lots of arrows.Don't bother with this game, it's obnoxious to the point that it removes most of the fun, and it moves like mud, which is a feat for a roguelike.  Yes, this game crawls at a crawl.Clearly unfinished.Addendum: I am still playing this game because I want to like it, and the MUD-like net play is really fun, but holy cow man, you really have to put it in for this one.

												woah my first negative review ever. I wish the game had any subtlety, or an easy to acess which command = which action. Lets say the game is brutal, punishes you as far as one shotting you in the very first room, even in the turorial. Otherwise it just feels a bit pointless. Imagine a game like dwarf fortress adventure mode or ADOM, but stripped barebone and add a little better graphics. yeah.. What ends it for me is that the game is just too brutal and luck based, for whatever reward it gives. The stats are limited to +3 from the starting ones, which feels a bit..limiting considering the scope of a game and the customisation we wish to have, items are a lot more relevant than the rest. ive had only 1 good-lucky run because the only monsters i encountered were the harmless kind. 1 out of 12 runs was 'ok'. I spent hours to make it to level 5 that one time, and even then i was only able to identify 2 of my 12 items in my inventory (lack gold cant sell if not identified). all of which were basic item, nothing special but the amulets. Then i died trying to disarm a trap over and over but for some reasons it made me step on it instead of disarming it.. twice. the game is not BAD its just.. not good enough for me, sorry. Good first try from the producers though!			"

												I had fun With the game However i can clearly see that its poorly made. The skills have no balancing forcing you into 2 or 3 possible builds.  The difficulty is on par with the games its clearly trying to Emulate ( older roguelike games like nethack) but instead of an insane amount of skill,dedication and knowlage of how the game works and a little bit of luck You really just need massive luck. Your skill level makes little to no difference compared to rolling dice. As the developer adds more and more content to the game they only make the luck element more important and the skill less important. I Feel like they focused on making the game harder thinking that would make it better. It does, who doesnt love Dark souls or Dwarf fortress, but its one thing to die beacuse you didnt step back or didnt keep resources compared to beacuse a computer didnt roll high enough. If they would just focus on making a game more skill based (nethack) or more strategic (DF) and not on more luck based it would have better reviews. ------------------>http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission <-------------------------			"

												I got this game for two fiddy during the last sale and was like ""am I going to play this? Probably not but I'll have more than three dollars of regret if I don't pick it up"". I started playing it one night because I just wanted to get it out of my head. I played it, I was frustrated by it, and slightly intrigued. The next day, I played it a little more and read the website to get some of the inner workings of the mechanics. The next day, I played it basically all damn day long. Now I'm hooked.What is this game? I'm so glad you asked, incredibly pliable hypothetical reader. It's a roguelike. You take one (or later, two) actions per turn. Then everything else gets a turn. A large amount of the game is driven by luck, and permadeath, and unlocking things that will make your characters stronger forever...starting after your next death. It follows in the vein of Nethack, Dungeons of Dredmor, TOME, and ADOM. You will die. You will die a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton. People will describe it as a terrible game for masochists, because it makes them feel good for beating it. I'm old enough to know that any game is really just a matter of time and motivation, and whether it's hardcore roguelikes, or bullet hell shooters, there ain't nothing to it but time and dedication to a meaningless diversion. Play it because it's fun, or don't if it's not.As I was saying, it's a roguelike. I've played other roguelikes before, but I bounced off almost all of them super hard. FTL, Binding of Isaac, and Our Darker Purpose is about my level of tolerance for roguelike(likes). But this one? For some reason I'm hooked. I've played better roguelikes before, but I haven't liked any of them better. I've now spread the Rogue's Tale virus to three other people. Two of them are hooked, one hasn't installed it yet. It's inexplicable.Let me talk mechanics for a little bit, since my subjective rambling is doing no good. You have to be okay with dying. The game is not judging you. You are not bad for dying on the first floor. The game isn't laughing at you. Sometimes you just walk down the stairs and get killed by an orc with a pickaxe before the game even truly begins. You have to make peace with that. Restarting takes about all of 10 seconds. The longer a run goes, the more control you gain over it. If you die at level 1, it's easy to cry BS RNG, but when you hit level 20, it's almost definitely going to be your own stupidity that kills you. The first time you die to a curse at level 8, you'll cry BS RNG. The second time, it'll be because you weren't able to find a curse immunity item before the undead mage got you. The third time it'll be because you abused the line of sight around a corner, charged the mage, but he got a lucky shot off before he died. The fourth time, you'll win and manage to fast travel back to town before the curse kills you, pay a little gold and survive the ordeal.Part of the game is learning every little nuance, every right reaction, every micro-tactic. You have to fight an air elemental? Better have a ring of elements or a shock ward amulet. Don't have those? Stay at range. You're a melee character? Switch to a 2hander and hope you kill him before the lightning stun kicks in and lets the guy pick you apart at his leisure. Don't think you're strong enough to do that? Then avoid the fight. Lure him into other enemies, and let them fight, or just push a boulder down the stairs and find a new dungeon.A surprisingly large part of this game is knowing when to give up. When you're new, you think you're supposed to win every fight, and you can't. That's part of why everyone loves to decry the RNG so much. Poker players don't go all-in every hand, and trying to do so means you have no idea how to play poker. So it is with Rogue's Tale. You learn to recognize when fights will be too hard for you to faceroll, and you'll either try to win by using scrolls and potions, or use the environment against them, or you'll avoid the fight entirely. Or you'll roll the dice and hope you come out a winner. That usually gets you killed though. There are three situations in Rogue's Tale where you'll die: when you're starting the game and still vulnerable to RNG, when you misjudge the difficulty of a fight and you don't realize your mistake in time, and finally, when you just do something incredibly stupid. I shot a boss with a wand of crippling before, hoping to wreck him with complete impunity. Little did I know his amulet reflected orb spells and weapons, and that a wand of crippling counts as a weapon or orb, and that I myself was not completely immune to the worst afflictions that the wand could cause. Over the next two dozen turns, I watched helplessly as my character was paralyzed, and the boss calmly strolled up and killed me extremely slowly. At least, it would have been slowly if I had any ability to react.Anyway, the game is great, and I'm hopelessly addicted. Don't buy the hype about the RNG, it only is really bad when you haven't invested much time into your run anyway. You'll learn cool tricks like turning enemies into rats and throwing cheese at them to tame them.			"

												I had to take the time to write this review, as i played this games for a few years now.Great roguelike game, and getting better with updates.Your simple goal is to become the King, by defeating the old one.The current king is announced at the start of the game, and is the player who last claimed the crown.There are no classes, you can develop your character as you like. There are different talents, and you control your 4 base stats to improve you character the way you choose.  Dungeons are random, with some pre-generated ones, so games are always different. And after you complete the dungeon, one way or another, you can reset it, and adventure more. There are no limit on resetting dungeons, so you can explore until you challenge the king, or die. Frustratingly hard, until you get the hang of the game mechanics and ways to counter enemies,death is lurking around every corner! And after, too... You really need to think your next move when in tight spot, if you want to get out of it alive. Death is permanent, unless you have a certain amulet, in which case you might get a second change ..=) The basic game is simple, but has surprising depth as the game has ""heritages"" to unlock, making the game a little bit of easier as you unlock them,  as once you unlock them you can use them in later games.Overall, personally i have spent countless of hours trying to learn from thousands of deaths, and even succeeded in thinking before acting. And, ive yet to achieve the crown, despite hard trying. This next game Im gonna get there..! Really a good game, if you like a challenge. Besides, in the coming update, there should be an easier difficulty level for those learning the game, wanting more casual experience, or not just man enough to handle the game. Good job!maybe the easier setting takes out those nasty bad reviews telling the game is too hard....I really recommend it, best roguelikes ive played. If you got the stomach for it, its hard as hell for beginners, and youll die a thousand deaths =) Thanks for reading.			"

												Another dev mistakes randomness for difficulty. You'll be wasting hours dying trying until you will finally get some lucky streak. Absolutely no skill or strategy involved. Just roll the dice and 9 out of 10 times you die. And even if you're lucky to live more than 20 minutes you'll eventually will be killed by some unexpected thing that RNG will throw at you without any logic behind it.Pure fail and garbage in a pile of roguelike wannabees.

												tl;dr: Get one of the games listed below instead, unless you know what you do when you buy a ""real Rogue"" game - endless frustration.Positive:Compared to many other rogue-like or rogue-lite dungeon crawlers, the graphics are nice. Dying and creation of the next adventurer is fast. With each adventurer dying within 30 seconds to five minutes, this is a positive aspect. There are many extras in the game, like gaining equipment for later characters through exploration. Using other monsters to your advantage is sometimes possible. This is a true recreation of the Rogue game of 1980 with modern graphics.This game is for hardcore gamers, those who like getting their teeth pulled without anesthetics, because it is badass. :)Still, if you want to have fun playing games, I suggest to play any of these games instead - from casual to more hardcore:Claustrophobia: The Downward StruggleSword of the Stars: The PitTales of Maj'EyalDarkest DungeonWhy do I suggest these games, instead of Rogue's Tale? Any of these games will give you a feeling that you survived the last encounter (or did not) because of choices you made. In Rogue's Tale you realize each time something happens that you won or lost because of the random number generator - your decisions do not matter. Toss a coin instead - on tails you lose.It felt to me like playing an old buggy version of Rogue where the end boss can spawn one step from you when you enter the dungeon. Monsters, loot and interactable objects seem to be generated completely randomly. You do not survive or die because you made the right decisions, you do so because you had a lucky or unlucky roll. As Rogue's Tale's environment is mostly open areas (not narrow tunnels or small interconnected rooms), you can rarely use the environment to your advantage.Using other monsters to your advantage is sometimes possible. Creatures who are usually docile may attack your opponent if you lead him to them. Unfortunately some of your opponents will be of the invincible kind, so that they decimate the complete level, including you, without losing one hitpoint.This is how my playthrough for the first ten adventurers went:Some died to an invisible spike trap after a few steps.Some were slaughtered by the first brigand they encountered after a few steps.Some of them actually found weapons and armor immediately after entering the dungeon, getting them equipped just fine - and died to three opponents attacking simultaneously two minutes later.A few more tests showed a complete dependency on the game's random number generator, instead of modern game design. It is truly a recreation of the 1980ies Rogue-type games. Suffer, player! :)In my eyes, the game's major flaw is that it is Rogue. You will die because of the flip of a coin, after a few seconds or minutes.			"

												I am shocked by the amount of negative reviews.This game is challenging and unforgiving, but I would definitely not call it unfair or RNG pure. It simply has a steep learning curve and is especially punishing for new players. Once the mechanics are known, it becomes very possible to migitate the risks. 9  out of 10 times death occurs, it is the players mistake. When I started to play on server, I lost all my heritages and had to build my heritages from scratch. It didn't take me near as long to get the essentials as for my first time.Many of the challenges that seem impossible become quite likely to do. But the advantages of this title are great. The best thing about it is the lack of grinding. Compared to other Rogue-likes, for instance Dungeons of Dredmor, this game feels quick. You dont have to slash through hordes and hordes of minions until you find a boss that kills you. Instead, each encounter counts. It should keep you focused. And when you die, you dont feel bad of having invested hours upon hours.Also the way the leveling works and the infinite amount of dungeons makes it not necessary to kill every enemy to scrap as much xp as possible to slightly stay ahead of the curve. Instead, running away is often the smart thing to do. And the levelling is fast.  In one or two hours you could reach hypothetically lvl 20. Equipment is not terribly randomized, you simply have to find the right type of equipment (i.e. sword etc) and enchant it(which is random, but still works fine). This gives it an amount of predictability and you can actually plan your character nicely.And the game has an great depth. After 200+ hours I still find new things. For that price, I would call it one of the best buys I ever had on steam.Last but not least the game has great support via a website with tons of useful information and an in-game chat feature. The community is very helpful and I had some great conversations with great people.So if you don't mind a challenge and opt for a great game and social experience, pick up this title.Edit 2015: The game had a major update that made crafting possible and also added a casual mode. Both of these should made the introduction to the game a little easier. Also, I added a beginners guide to get beginners going.In addition, I played a lot of other rogue-likes and can probably pinpoint a little more, why I like this one most. It has, similar to The Binding of Isaac and Spelunky, simple mechanics and no real story. This sets it apart from say Nethack or Tales of Maj-Eyal, which are great games by the way, but you have quite difficult mechanics and especially in the case of TOME, huge amount of statistics and finetuning. In Rogue's tale, you have only few stats and they are not finely graded, so that you have to spend too much time compromising (which always feels a bit unsatisfying to me). At the same time it is turn-based, so not as hectic as TBOI and spelunky. You have little inventory management, as compared to Magicite. Successful runs can be very memorable and the feeling, when you beat for the first time three enemies previously thought impossible is amazing. I believe this game is truly underappreciated.			"

												having grown up playing rouge/moria/angband, and sinking my teeth into just about anything being called a rougelike, i feel qualified to review this game.   My first few plays, had me feeling like this was another poorly concieved graphical ""interprtation"" of rouge.  however, after playing many many more times, i think this game is easily the best modern graphical interpretation yet.   No it is not exactly rogue, but if that was what you wanted you would play rogue, right?   What this game does is force your character development into certain paths using the randomness of the map to do it.  You are pushed by the type of gear and shrines you find to develop your characters in a certain way.    If playing a mage, you will not have access to every spell, and you will need to be a little more creative, or wait until you find those DD spells to make your mages.    This style, has allowed the creators to up the difficulty to an incredible level, while keeping it fun.  You arent going to be making your 50th identical character in this game, its just not possible.  The rouge elements are there, with the complete randomness (sometimes to impossible difficulty).  Something that this game has captured, is just knowing that your about to die.  every door, every step, you are about to die.   Did you just find a ring of superpoweredness?  cool, your about to die anyway, cause it doesnt protect from poison pits.   With that being said, they way they designed character develpment allows that to be a great quality again, not a punishment.   I still havent progressed far enough to try some of the other gameplay concepts, ie. crafting, but i think this game deserves a big thumbs up.  The spirit of Rogue is a live and well here.			"

												Maddening, frustrating, and hard to put down, Rogue's Tale is a punishing roguelike in every sense of the word.""Unfair"" might get thrown around. It might feel like it is, at first, when you basically start with nothing but a stick. But as you slowly (very slowly) gain progression: a potion here, a starting piece of armor here, and you start to learn the extreme subtleties of the game, it begins to really shine.I never beat the game. I only even challenged the final boss once (and wasn't even remotely prepared). I haven't played it in months, but I still think about it. I think about runs I got cocky in, thinking I was overpowered, and paid for the sin of it. I think about one run where I started and died within 2 steps from a boulder. I think about runs where... so many runs. So many deaths. I understand the mixed reviews. This is a game you really have to play a lot (and I mean a lot) to get why it's actually pretty good. This game pulls no punches. Be prepared for that.			"

												DANGER: IF YOU ARE A CASUAL ROGULIKE PLAYER, PLS STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME.This game is meant for HARDCORE roguelike players who don't have any EXPLOSIVE TEMPERS.This game is SUPER DIFFICULT and RNG matters a LOT in this game. There is going to be LOTS of deaths.It is BRUTAL for new players. That having said, new players can progress in the game by learning the mechanics  and learning how to play it smartly as possible. There are also few guides out there to help out. Mainly focus on unlocking the EASIER heritages as it will help out your run in the long run. Weighing the possibilities of WINNING a fight is VERY IMPORTANT for your run to even survive SLIGHTLY FURTHER.My personal opinion of this game it is sadistically fun to play. I have to keep learning from my mistakes and improve my runs. As of this writing, the highest level i have reached is level 13 with 50 deaths after playing for a whole day. However, this game seriously deserves MORE LIKES as i believe this game is NOT BROKEN as what the initial commenters felt due the RECENT UPDATES this game has. THUS, I HEAVILY RECOMMENDED THIS GAME FOR HARDCORE ROGUELIKERS OUT THERE.EDIT:16JUL16 I have beaten heroic difficulty after Nabon. Its not really that difficult as what everyone claims ;DEDIT:28AUG16I have attained insane title. Just another prove that game isnt that hard:)			"

												In my opinion while playing Rogue's Tale it always feels like your ""tool-box"" (the amount of options you have on hand to deal with a threatening situation) is extremely limited, and by design. Compared to say, ""Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup"", one of the titans of the rogue-like genera, the majority of early-game deaths in Rogue's Tale feel entirely unavoidable and down to the whims of the RNG. The game's item identification (ID) system is clunky and idiosyncratic; for example you might have ID'd a ring and then found another one just like it, and while the game will tell you it's the same ring the shopkeepers in the ""Town"" area will refuse to buy the second one because it has yet to be subjected to an ID effect. The bulk of items you pick up will ID as having no special effects, yet the shopkeepers will still refuse to buy them unless an ID has been attempted, meaning the majority of items cannot be sold for profit until you luck into a source of permanent IDing via a rare item drop. The RNG seems extremely harsh given the fact that you often cannot escape from most bad situations; a newly reset dungeon whose first floor is several mages and archers will result in an unavoidable death, for example. I realize that harping on the RNG in a rogue-like seems counterproductive, but I think that it just doesn't stack up well when compared to other equally difficult yet more fair rogue-likes, such as the aforementioned Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup. In DC:SS, scrolls do not require a specific skill in order to be read, meaning that it is a perfectly legitimate strategy to burn through un-ID'd scrolls in a pinch; the tactic is risky as you can cause bad effects, but it can also save you from an untimely early death. Similarly, given how much of the game is tied up in gold-use in the “Town” area, it seems weird that it's not possible to sell un-ID'd items, even if at a lower value. Having said all that, if you are a massive rogue-like fan you might still derive some enjoyment out of Rogue's Tale. It probably won't compare very favourably to other titles in the genera, however, and if you aren't someone who has played rogue-likes before and are curious I'd recommend you give this one a pass in favour of a different title.

												I’m usually pretty forgiving of games that are lacking in some areas, but all I can say about this one is please do not buy this game. The definition of a game should be to have fun, or at least enjoy the experience. From the moment you enter the dungeon, to the moment you finish the tutorial it is evident that this game lacks what it takes to be an enjoyable Rogue like experience. Let me explain. I enter the new dungeon. I walk up to the first monster (a Snail). I attack it, it attacks back, I lose half my life. I kill said monster. I heal myself after resting. I take another step. A pit trap hits me. I die. I go back into the dungeon. I go against a demon bat. It instantly kills me. Back into the dungeon. I get a sword, a shield, and some sticks. (The whole time, mind you, I'm doing my search check to make sure I'm not walking toward a trap) I come across a water pit, no matter what I do to try and get out (resting, moving in different directions) of said pit I can't, and die. Back into the dungeon again. Take 3 steps, giant dog attacks me. Hits me once, I die (keep in mind I have 8 points in stamina [the highest you can have at the start of the game]). I proceed again into this frustrating experience. I'm blessed with a bit more items this go-around. I fight a few snails, and make it to the next level after having successfully emptied the first one. A priest, that hits me once, promptly greets me, and you guessed it I die. Do this about 60 more times. Each time I’m making it anywhere from 5 steps into the dungeon, to maybe level 3. Each time dying because the game refuses to 1. Give you items that can take on high level creatures 2. Give you enough money to identify 1/10th of all the items in the game that ALL require identifying to know what they are at (such as rocks, mushrooms, arrows, bolts, weapons, armor) 20 gold a piece.3. Blows you up for looking at anything funny 4. Gives you dungeon levels that are so small that going down to the next level guarantees you’ll be under leveled, equipped, and prepared to take on anything that is waiting for you the second you go down the stairs.5. Refuses to give you loot on about 85% of all mobs you kill.The list can go on and on, but I’ll make this a bit short. The game promises a challenging rogue like experience. I can indeed give you that. But there is a difference between a challenge, and the process of smashing ones head against a wall over and over again in hopes that at some point it won’t hurt anymore.I must emphasis my warning as to why you should not buy this game. A good analogy would be the person that tastes something and realizes that it tastes REALLY bad, so they tell their friend “Man this tastes disgusting, want to try it?” and the friend says “OK”. The experience of someone else should count for something, and I must say this game isn’t a challenge, it’s a headache you give yourself after spending five dollars on it. Don’t waist your money. Unless the game designers want to adjust the size of the levels, the damage of the mobs, and the loot you get, I’d stay clear of this rogue like like the plague. I’ll give them the graphics are decent, and that’s about as much of a positive I’ll throw their way. A game should not require you to do everything perfect, and also require you to have a greater than 80% luck ratio to succeed.Not what I call fun or enjoyable.			"

												a Desura player fan coming to Steamstarting on a fresh account, i haven't played in quite some time, but I have many many dozens of hours into the game.first of, you might want to check the game website which stand as a wiki made by the game's creator,Game website & guide[rogue.epixx.org]this will give you all the tools you need to start earning heritages, and getting better and better.heritages are account bonus that gives you STRONG advantages.I have to say i'm utterly impressed by how many people downvoted, and complained about how punishing the game is, and how many bad reviews there is of this game I love...I strongly disagree with every single one of them, to every complain about an unfair death, I bet you ask the OP, he was just carelessly exploring, unaware of game mechanics and just randomly complaining about rng.checking the game's website should help you pass through this point.After a few heritage unlocks, if you play carefully you'll die a LOT less often, and the game isn't made for your chars to live forever, but to live long enough to have a shot at the KING.think of it this way : the longer you stay alive, the more likely you are to die but the more powerfull you'll be to defeat the king.I think way too many player just fail to see the point of the game, expecting something this game is not. That doesn't change the fact that this is a unique game, very well tuned.and founding very rare equipment, wich are not displayed in the wiki (some blessed rings/amulets) is really a awesome feeling, you'll find yourself saying : THIS IS THE RUN I WAS HOPING FOR!I DO RECOMMAND THIS GAME, STRONGLYits maker is talented, and deserve support, + the game gets content updates since a very long time.

												Seeing that quite some of the bad reviews missed some central points, I kinda felt the need to drop one myself! Sorry ´bout that.Actually, the mere fact that, while having lots of arguably good ""big"" games, I keep coming back to this one should say it all. The ""Rogue-like""-Tag on a game is tantalizing to me. And the more down-to-the-core-Rogue-like it is, the more I like the game. Only regrettable feature would be ASCII-graphics ;) And these games tend to be hard. Very hard. The kind of hard that the majority of younger people can´t cope with, maybe? The Generation WoW: clicky, blingy , levelup..! I don´t know. I know, that back as a kid in the former GDR, I ""played"" Bards Tale on a C64, hundreds of hours, without even knowing what an RPG is. No Internet, Nobody to ask... I believe that this is the reason for the success of, say, Dark Souls. It´s so hard, that winning something is actually rewarding again! And that feels good.And I like Rogue´s Tale! You have to know that it´s hard and random. But that also means the very next item can be that difference-making blessed Ring of Something... You do die, and sometimes cheaper by the Dozen, but hey, it´s hard! But over time, you learn various ways of shaping chances in your favour. If you play it like an generic japanese RPG, then you are bound to fail early and often. It´s a turn-based game, every turn you can make the best decision based on stats and inventory. Most of my (hundreds of) deaths were avoidable in hindsight. In short, if you like the concept of rogue-likes, maybe played NetHack and the like, or if you like challenging games, then this one´s well worth a try. For people who enjoy games that splash you with levelup from the start, you might find this game, ahm, ...unrewarding, which is great irony in itself!			"

												A poor attempt to create a roguelike game. Insensibilities abound such as loot being unsellable because they're 'unidentified' and no merchant buys unidentified loot but to 'identify' each loot item requires a price that you can't afford unless you sell some loot which you can't because they're all unidentified *grrrrrr*. And that's just one of the silly design issues that show this game to be unworthy of the roguelike title. - skill upgrades are uninspiring- skills that have no cooldown but have to be activated each and every time- random overpowerful encounters with no escape- several level ups before just one attribute upgrade point is given- etc etc etc0 stars out of 5 (and that's being generous)			"

												It's a good game. It starts off very simple, with classic roguelike elements. Turn-based, grid tiled combat with complete randomization. You will die a lot, because the game doesn't hold your hand. There are a lot of little things, like jumping/searching for traps, that are not immediately obvious but immensely useful. The dungeons, from what I've seen, lack graphical variety. The grey walls are simple, but easy to get bored off. There are nice touches, like little torches on the walls and camp fire lighting being important, but it needs more themes to make it more replayable, although this is very minor, because there is a lot of content here.It's a great game if you like roguelike style games, and could be an okay introduction if you're not a fan of Stonesoup graphic styles. With a little extra work, the game could easily be worth $10, and at $5 it's a steal that you can get many hours of enjoyment, and frustration, out of it.			"

												Basically a casual reach for the roguelike-genre with a bit of humour. Basically mechanics are spot on as roguelikes go but something is seriously off here. You die, alot. Which is ""funny"" as far as you get something out of it. That doesn't happen here. Either you get extremely lucky and get 3 levels of giant snails which are easy to kill or you get blast to orbit in the first 3 turns. Theres not much between here, it's either one.Game is not difficult, it's just extremely stupid. You just run around pressing S (to search traps) and hope for the easier enemies. And if you are lucky enough to clear the 1st dungeon, you are gonna be miserable once you reset it. I've got to the point of reset dozens of times, just to get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ No talent or potion or anything is gonna save you.There is no variety in the items. Weapons are boring and most of them useless. Never got to see an enchant since they are extremely expensive and you don't get much money SINCE YOU DIE!♥♥♥♥ this game, especially with the 5 euro price tag. You can have numerous better roguelikes for FREE. Stay away from this.			"

												Great rogue-like! If you are a fan of the genre it is a well-worth purchase.I only wish there was more equipment, more sets.If you're on the fence about buying it, make sure that you know what a rogue-like is and that it's for you. This genre is not for everyone; it will lead to alot of frustration over dying from things not directly influenced by your actions but rather just random. Rogue-likes are generally a game of chance, with your gameplay choices merely improving your odds.Big plus for me personally is that you can play the game fully with only keyboard which is great for a netbook for example.What's so good about it?It is highly addictive. That feeling of ""just one more try"" .. ;)Eventually you start to unlock Heritages, letting you pick different options to give your next character a ""boost"".It is very easy to just pick up, play a few lives, drop it and go back to doing other things. I'm not sure if the term ""coffeebreak roguelike"" is applicable, since if you're on a roll you can keep going for a while.Why is this game difficult?Big, scary monsters as well as tiny creatures will kill you. It will happen.All items are unidentified, and unless you have the luck to find an unidentify spell you're stuck relying on merchants who charge a fairly high fee to identify items for you, for some reason they won't buy unidentified items from you either so scraping together gold can be difficult. (Odd choice for the merchants, purchasing items cheap, identifying them and then flipping them just seems like Economics 101..)This includes all types of gear, scrolls/tomes, food and water, as well as potions! You might find yourself starving to death and all your food/water is unidentified; do you take the chance to consume it and die from the possible effects or do you struggle to find clean food? Red potions are healing.. right? :'(To find deadly traps you need to use the Search skill, be careful. More than once have I entered a new level, walked in any direction, right onto a trap, dead.How complex of a RPG is it?Not at all. Very basic character system with 4 different attributes (strength, agility, stamina, charisma) there's no crafting or similar extended-RPG system in place.Take it for what it is, a simple game to pick up and play a while :)Certain actions in game (picking locks, killing mobs, disarming traps, lighting torches, etc..) earn you Exp, with enough exp you level up, get to improve your characters attributes and on some levels you get to train a skill.There are 3 basic character classes/archetypes; warrior, mage, ranger. Each of these have places to train skills and if you're unlucky it can be a struggle to find the one for the class you want to level as, making you end up with a type of hybrid character.One thing that really surprised me about this game is that it's possible to play on a server, the developers have an official server or you can run your own. It enables you to chat with other players (no other interactions)			"

												RT a very traditional roguelike. You go into a dungeon, and you vanquish monsters and obtain treasure in a turn-based, procedurally-generated fashion. You die horribly through carelessness or bad luck, and then you create a new character and try again. So what are its specific strengths and weaknesses?Strengths:- Difficulty. RT is much harder than any other roguelike I've played, and demands both careful attention to your actions, and learning from your mistakes over countless deaths. It does not hesitate to brutally punish carelessness and lack of foresight, so when you finally conquer your first dungeon, or finally get a character to level 10, or finally slay one of those thrice-accursed cave bears, you feel a sense of accomplishment that most contemporary games will never provide.- Strategy. The game is fair, in the sense that all enemies work by the exact same rules as your character, and will also typically be of your level or just below (only bosses and special encounters violate this rule). When every enemy is your character's potential equal, you can never win by overwhelming force, but only by intelligently exploiting every possible advantage, from positioning to equipment to creative use of spells and special abilities. And RT really comes into its own when you find yourself in the middle of a pitched battle between two or three different factions, each of which could individually wipe the floor with you, and gracefully manoeuvre them into destroying each other with the aid of stealth, mobility, precision damage, and that wand you've been carrying around for half the game but never quite dared use.- Reward. While insanely hard, RT provides tangible milestones in the form of heritages, which grant permanent bonuses to every character you will ever create (including the one who unlocks them). This grants both motivation (you may not be able to even imagine beating a game at this rate, but if you can just survive for three more levels and find a training dummy, that starting swoard and board set is all yours) and progression (unlock the leather armour set, for example, and animal foes go from lethal to merely threatening). For those who have made a fair bit of progress in the game, there are also challenges, with cosmetic rewards such as character titles and colourful cloaks.- Variety. While the level of content on offer here can't compete with the titans of the genre, every playthrough is a distinctly new experience, as even a single decent item can make a huge difference to your playstyle and odds of survival. Likewise, the different principal playstyles feel distinct from each other, and even simple choices such as sword and shield versus two-handed make a tangible difference. This is even more the case when playing a caster or hybrid type, as between the three different spell schools and the heavily random access to spells, you may find yourself playing a magic-armoured pyromaniac one game and a demonologist who harvests the souls of those slain by his summoned daemons before using them to enchant his equipment the next.- A good manual. The author has put a great deal of effort into a comprehensive manual on the game website which both lists nearly everything you can find in the game, and explains how all the mechanics work. This is one roguelike where you won't be forced to rely on a community wiki for essential information.- Addictiveness. That ""one more turn""/""one more character"" quality? To those who are not turned off by high difficulty, Rogue's Tale has it in spades. Death is swift, and character generation is swifter. The knowledge that your dead character was just off the requirements for that amazing-sounding heritage will inspire you to roll another one even when it's late at night and you have work or school in the morning.Weaknesses:- Difficulty. The RNG is strong with this one. As you unlock heritages and learn the ins and outs of the game, you will become able to defend against the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune to some extent. Even so, you will have many great characters who die because procedural generation puts them in a situation that they simply have no way of surviving. You will have initial (pre-heritage) characters that die in two turns because they started the game next to multiple monsters. You will have characters get hit with early-game poison attacks when there's no chance of you having found and identified an antidote - and poison in this game is fatal more often than not. You will spawn in dungeons where the only way to progress is to fall into a spiked pit and hope you can climb out before it kills you, because you're in a narrow corridor and there's a door that stops you from just jumping over. And, of course, you'll face monsters in contexts where they are simply too powerful and you haven't yet found enough items to swing the balance or secure an escape (cave bears at level 10 say hello).- RNG-dependent character builds. Specialists have far higher odds of survival than generalists, so it pays to put all your starting points in just two of the four stats. Only there's no guarantee that your tank will find decent armour before you face a truly deadly enemy, or that your archer will have a decent supply of arrows (and the prices in town are murder). You may find a Blessed Amulet of Ghost Form that lets you laugh at dual-wielding berserker daemon hordes (an actual thing), or you may be slain without ever seeing anything better than leather armour and a dagger. You may put all your starting points into Strength and none into Agility, but then only find archery targets to learn new talents from. And it gets so much worse for a caster that it's worth a separate point.- Creating a caster is hard. Dedicated casters, while potentially obscenely powerful, are hard to get off the ground, to the point that you shouldn't expect to play as one until you have the more advanced heritages. It takes getting to level 9 (of 20), finding three altars and learning three talents before you can efficiently use magic for damage or healing. That's 8 levels with no offensive or defensive abilities, just basic bashing things with a stick. Then you have to find spell tomes, which are pretty rare, and hope they're of a school you can learn. And you have to hope the first spells you learn are the useful ones - the offensive ""orb"" spells, for example, or Summon Daemon, rather than something like Consume Soul (which is useless without its twin, Release Soul) or the merely mildly convenient Telekinesis. And, of course, the spells that don't run off Stamina use Charisma, and if your character's two high stats are Stamina and Charisma, that means you're useless with any and all weapons. The situation is a bit better for paladin types, since Celestial spells don't suffer from armour/shield penalties, and hybrid types are viable as long as you focus on physical combat first and then aim for support/utility magic, but you're still increasing the amount of luck you need in a game where the RNG is always out to get you.Overall verdict:After (probably) triple-digit hours, I still love this game. The big stumbling block is that it is hard, and you will die. You have to recalibrate your expectations. You're not sending heroes on epic quests that are destined to inevitably save the world through the power of quicksave/quickload and perhaps GameFAQs. You're sending thousands of faceless rogues against impossible odds, each time hoping that this one is different, that they'll be able to achieve or learn something that none of the others before them could. Each achievement comes from climbing atop a mountain of past rogues' corpses - and, accordingly, seizing it will briefly make you feel like you're on top of the world. That is this game's greatest weakness, but also its greatest strength - it does absolutely everything it can to kill you, and that makes every victory feel fully earned.			"

												tl;dr: An attractive, straight-forward, god-awful hard roguelike that is worth the price.The game's pretty straight forward: You roll a character in no time, enter the randomly-generated dungeon, desperately try to find enough equipment and critical skills to survive, then you're poisoned by a spider, burnt by an imp, crushed by a falling rock, drowned, or just plain run through.  There are many ways to die in this game, and you will experience them all, over and over.  Pro tip: Don't put too much thought into naming your characters.All right, well beyond that there's side-quests, a variety of skills and spells, newly-introduced crafing, and a final boss if you're so lucky, but if you buy this game really you're buying it to die over and over.  It can be quite frustrating, and like a classic rogue your death can be well-deserved, or entirely unfair.  Yet I found myself coming back to this game more than the more complex ToME, Dredmor, or other rogue-likes for its simplicity and purity.  Each fight is a battle of life or death, each choice is agonizing, and that's all there is to it.  Pure masochism, really.The game is, basically, too hard.  You'll be lucky to see half the content, but for the money Rogue's Tale is an attractive, simple, classic rogue-like.			"

Probably over 1000 play hours, maybe 2000 or more.You should definitely give this game a try, it has a lot of replayability and the mechanics are amazing. It's a fun rogue game.I finished most of the game pre-Steam release, but its had several updates and additional content post-release, I think I'm currently way behind on a lot of the new content. Which means I've got a lot of catching up to do. Essentially, it was a full game on release, and then received a lot of free content updates essentially Free DLCs afterwards.Also, one of the very few games I'm listed in the credits for as beta tester and included in the game as an NPC :)10/10			"

												Rogue's Tale is a roguelike in the vein of the older roguelikes instead of the many new ""roguelites"".First of all this game might not be for anyone, the content is randomly generated each playthrough like in many roguelikes. Although this one can be quite unforgiving, being oneshotted at the spawn point is not a rarety. You can play really well for an hour but die horribly in 3 turns. Death is always lurking in each corner and it adds a lot of tension, especially if you advance far into the game. This fact might be really offputting for some people because sometimes you just can't do anything to evade death. As you progress through the dungeon you gain loot and supplies which you use to survive on your journey. It's all fairly standard without adding anything new. I think this is a strong point of Rogue's Tale, it's just a really nice roguelike without any fancy twists. It's really addictive and you always want to try your luck again. The major aspect that I dislike is the somewhat cumbersome controls, they are not intuitive and there are many keys that could have been merged together. Nevertheless you get used to it fairly quickly. The graphics and sound effects do their job, it's a nice tile based rougelike. Although I wished there was more variety in the music.I recommend it to anyone who likes more oldschoold and hard roguelikes if you can bear the random nature of the game.			"

												Wow. So yeah, this game far exceeded my expectations. Super addictive! There is so much more depth here than what you might expect on your first couple of playthroughs. You definately have to give the game a little time to grow on you. It is a Rogue-like, after all. You will die, a lot. But it's so easy to just start up again and hope you'll fair better and find even more epic gear/artifacts than the last go-round!Best $5 game I've bought in years.			"

EPIC & Unforgiving as it is Addictive..It was too hard for the negative reviewers, they took a chance away from thier hidden object and Date simulators and didnt like it. and lets be honest ..its probably too hard for you too!If you dont mind spawning in next to a balrog dressed in just your skivies and armed with a twig, then you can join us hard bar-stewards and maybe...maybe..this might be the game for you.But dont worry you can always load up Candy Crushed or Pop my virtual cherry 2 ..if it all gets too much for you..

												Most modern RPGs do not follow the same scheme as Rogue and instead focus on character building and are made so that you can finish the game with one character.  Not this game.  Sorry.  This game was made as a faithful implementation of the original Rogue (which was released back in 1980!), at least in terms of gameplay.  What that means is:1) totally random generation2) very high difficulty3) lots of dying + frustration4) lots of WTF momentsThat said, I think that this implementation is quite good, with very nice graphics (for a Java game).  IMHO, the only major improvement that the game could use is a save feature.  True, the user interface and controls could be improved, but it is only $4.50!!!I played this back in the 1980s on a PC with ASCII graphics and later on an Amiga.  The way that I advise you play this is as a casual game.Bottom line:  I recommend the game for a $4.50 or $5 price point, but only for those that are OK with dying a LOT and a high frustration factor.  :)for more, read the longer review by GAR.

												This game is quite difficult. It is not impossible, and i have yet to actually get past level 7. But the difficulty is mostly based off random chance, but if you are careful traps won't get you and you can avoid deadly enemies. (Spiders) A tip would be to block the entrance to the lower dungeon with a boulder if you feel you won't survive, this will force you to have to reset the dungeon.Highly recommended, the graphics are minimal but it is very atmospheric(In a sense of being immersed and focused).After playing for a bunch more runs i finally understand the beginning strategy to winning. This game is very addicting and the ability to unlock heritages makes you want to play more and more to be able to get a better first run. This game is all about lasting as long as possible, and if you manage to do it the right way you are able to start off with better equipment or perks.Highly recommended. This game is similar to IVAN in how brutal it is.  (This game is even more unforgiving)			"

												I'm not gonna lie here, this game is hard. Slight mistakes, wrong turns, or just being rather ulucky is often punished by death. But since it's Rogue-like game, what a re you expecting?This game as very strange controls but the learning curve is not that bad if you know how most rogue-like games work (shiny necklace? probably shouldn't wear it until I identify it). Though some things take some time to figure out, most are not truly that important (egg + snake  = friend).Like most games in this catagory, it's got replayability, and a lot of it (unless you get cornered by a Deamon and stabbed to death). I have more than 100 charactors under my belt as of the time of this writing (30 hours), and I will add many more to my morbid collection.It's an awesome game. Hard as hell, but still great.			"

												I've mastered roguelike games like The Binding of Isaac, FTL, and Dungeons of Dredmore, going all the way back to roguelikes from the 1980s like Temple of Apshai. When I bought Rogue's Tale I was pretty excited - the first few playthroughs were brutally hard and I was very excited to learn how to conquer the dungeons.Hours passed, and more hours of gameplay passed, and eventually I found that while I could learn some new tactics, ultimately I would be defeated by any random monster that landed a few lucky hits, no matter how conservatively I played. This trend continued, and continued, and no matter what items I got or strategies I used, I basically could not figure out how to get very far in this game.My conclusion is that the game just isn't developed enough to provide adequate strategies for the player, and instead leaves most of it up to chance. It's too bad because the game had good potential, but ultimately I'd recommend staying away from this game as it needs a lot of work before it is actually ""playable"". "

												Rogue’s Tale is a rogue-like that sticks true to the genre but has lacks novel concepts and simplifies customization found in the old school Rogue and Moria ASCII games.You cannot pick a race, statistics have been simplified down to four stats, there is limited item options and limited enemy types.  Any one of these might be a small issue or gripe but in their totality it makes Rogue’s Tale an abysmal step background from the old-school Rogue and Moria predecessors.  In the early 1990s this game may have been worth a few dollars – but today there are so many other games that have done it better in the last twenty years that you should not waste your time here.

												Roguelikes pretty much require one to be something of a masochist. Go into a dungeon or what have you, kill everything and steal anything not nailed down with only one live to spare and if a monster gets a good shot on you, well game over, try again.And it is (imo) the gaming equivalent of crack. Monster kill you moments before you beat the game? Like hell you're gonna take that lying down. Repeat until win or you throw your computer out the window.Rogue's Tale (hereafter shortened to RT)... makes me wanna do the latter after an hour. Like most Roguelikes, the RNG will be your godsend or it'll make you its ♥♥♥♥♥. Except in the case of RT, I lost count of how many times I ended up becoming the cosmic plaything of the RNG. EVERYTHING is randomized, including the dungeon, the items within and even the monsters.And that's where the trouble starts. Almost everything is unidentified and that includes your own equipment. Which doesn't seem that bad; get it identified.At 20 gold a pop, that option is not viable. And because you need food and water and those cost as well...Let me shorten this. Monsters can easily one-shot you even with diligent planning, helpful items are very difficult to come by, and the whole game seems like a lesson in how NOT to do an randomly generated roguelike. I said in the beginning that roguelikes practically require you to be a masochist; even a masochist would have trouble enjoying this game.			"

												There are three ways that you can play this game.1. Stop the Cultists2. Get the highest score possible3. Die a lot.You will be playing the third option of the game mostly if you are not careful and/or try to fight every single enemy that you see. The items that you find in the dungeon can either be blessed, neutral or cursed and each time you play a new game, everything will be different again so that amulet that gave you extra turns can turn you into stone the next time.The achievements in this game plays a big role in making the following runs easier by giving you knowledge about certain items but you still need to indentify what you find in the dungeon to see if they are cursed.It is much better to see the game instead of reading of it and nobody even reads these reviews.To describe this game with five words, DarkSouls meets Pokémon Mystery Dungeon. Except not at all since there is not a single sun or monster houses and I don't know how to end reviews.			"

												Wow, an indie title that claims to be a roguelike and ACTUALLY IS.  Rogue's Tale could be a fairly competent roguelike, but the balance is just awful.  Random unpreventable deaths are somewhat expected in a roguelike, but they are far too common in this game.  A good roguelike can get away with brutal almost unfair encounters by providing the player with a large toolbox of skills and gadgets to diffuse the situation.  Rogue's Tale gets the difficulty right, but doesn't give you the tools to overcome it.You'll fall into an unseen pit you can't get out of. You'll enter the level surrounded by 3 enemies and no escape route. You'll get 2 shotted by an archer on the other side of the screen.  Your weapon will randomly break in combat.  You'll step on an invisible trap that locks the doors and summons 4 orcs....etc.The enemies appear to always scale to your level and do not respawn, so it is not possible to gain the advantage by farming easier dungeon floors.It does get one roguelike quality quite right - in that it never ceases to surprise you with new mobs, event, objects, and dungeon tiles.  4 hours in and I'm still seeing things Ive never seen before even on the first few levels of the dungeon.Another problem is the identify system.  Every item, even plain non magic items are unidentified, and it costs 20 gold to identify. Problem is you cant sell unID'd items to pay for the cost of IDing, so it's a Catch-22 of annoying.  You also cannot use unID'd potions and scrolls.  Letting the player use unID'd consumable is a pretty key mechanic to the great roguelikes of the past.  It gave the player a dangerous gamble to get out of a tough situation, and it allowed the player to ""self-identify"" items by observing their effect after use.  In Rogue's Tale unID'd consumables are basically a waste of inventory space.Now on to some good stuff.  The game has very nice sprites.  They aren't the over pretentious flashy art style common in kickstarter indie games these days.  Equiped items showing on your character is a nice touch.  The UI is smooth and easy to navigate, and mouse control is always a welcome feature in any roguelike.There are no starting classes in Rogue's Tale, so the start of every run is essentially identical.  Why not allow playstyle choices right from the start, like every other half decent roguelike of the past?There is a meager meta progression system called Heritages.  Heritages are unlocked by completing certain achievements during a playthrough, and allow you to start the game with some weak starter items.  For example a sword and buckler, or a staff.  These items do not appear to change how you play the game, so I don't really see the point.  The Heritages also feel completly out of reach.  I have 4 hours logged, and have unlocked 1 Heritage, and came no where close to any of the others.Finally, the game requires that you make an account and login every time you run the game.  As far as I'm concerned this is a single player game, and having to login is a giant F U to the player.  Even in ""offline"" mode you have to login. Isn't playing the game through Steam DRM enough?It's not awful, but it's no roguelike for the history books.P.S. Since ""roguelike"" is thrown around so liberally these days it barely has any meaning.  Perhaps calling games of this genre Morialike or Bandlike would be more appropriate now?			"

YouTube™ Video: Rogue's Tale! A First Look 

			Views: 58		

			I take a look at the rock hard turn based RPG, Rogue's Tale. Don't forget to like and subscribe!		

Video review above!This game is terribly HARD.  If you want a walk in the park game don't buy it!  On the other hand if you like a challenge this game has good value.  Because it is a rogue-like and has procedural based dungeons every play the replayability is through the roof.  The difficulty comes from the fact that every time you start you could literally be faced with a monster that will easily kill you.  However this means sometimes you will be fortunate enough to find some good gear and maybe survive more than 5 minutes :)Because the game is so hard it teaches you to make very deliberate actions and slow down your game pace.  You will find yourself saying ""one more"" after each death and before you know it you will have burned 3 hours.  This game is not for the light of heart but it is a great game, don't listen to the negative reviews.  Just has to be your cup of tea!			"

												This game still feels like an early beta.  There is no balance to this game, sometimes you will spawn in a dungeon and instantly die with no chance whatsoever, as the starting stats/levels of enemies seem completely random.  The economy is also broken in this game as even mundane items must be ""identified"" for 20 gold apiece before they can be sold.  Only arrows and bolts can be sold for a small sum of gold, so you cannot profit from loot other than ammo.  Yes, that's right, you can't sell an ordinary leather armor or even a piece of cheese without ""identifying"" it for 20 gold.  You cannot disenchant cursed items.  It seems like a lot of features are missing or incomplete.  You cannot start with a magical character, you have to be melee.  Attributes all start with penalites and you MUST put points into AGI and STA or you won't be able to deal with dungeon hazards.  There is little to no freedom in character generation or development, at least for now.  All in all the game can be fun if you get really, really lucky but the heritages seem mostly impossible to unlock right now unless you want to spend 40+ hours grinding and starting over.  The game has potential but right now I recommend that you DO NOT waste money on it until the game has been updated.			"

												Roguelikes are all about procedural generation, and sometimes, people mistake ""lolrandom"" for this. Rogue's Tale appears to be making this very mistake. One run, I could have tiny floors, barely worth the name (and yes, I did search the walls), the next, I could have a sprawling, infested complex. One run, I could barely get any weapon or armour worth the term and die horribly to the first ranged enemy of the game. The next, I got great weapons and armour, and was killed by poison.Tying skills to random altars in the game makes this an exercise in frustration, and, sadly, I can't recommend this to anyone.			"

You want throw hours upon hours of effort with zero progession - this game has it.Want to killed instantly after spending 2 -3 hours meticulously combing a dungeon for deadly, and possible loot to gear your character - this game has it.Rogue-Like games are meant to be hard, requiring skill to know when to fight, when to run. You know like actually give you a chance to play the game, not just Random generated death.Hell most times, you'll be killed the moment you start the game. You want to play slots in the form of an RPG Turn-based Dungeon Crawler, here you go. You're better off going to Vegas... you might actually win.			"

												One of the best roguelike games. True hardcore game with different game styles such as melee fighter, archer, mage, assasin, shapeshifter. All of this game styles are playeable, and able to beat the game. But first, prepare to die a lot. Die from a single common enemy, potion, poison, broken bridge and many others threats. Good and clear ability system, rather simple(it will took a few hours) fighting system based on dice rolls. Enemies can pick up weapons/armors, all amunitions and magic effects work as on player. As advantages:* Simple player building system and clearly explained fighting system* This game is challanging and hard to complete* This game have nice graphic compare to others roguelikes* There many small tricks* Completeness of the game (normal AI, bugs are realy rare, many features)			"

												I've been playing nethack for 23 years, and I like this game for the same reasons.  Easier in lots of ways, but I'd say it's more deadly. so expect to die a lot.  Definitely just as addicting as the old ascii games, but with quicker restarts.  I'll complain that there's not as much depth, especially starting out since you need to unlock specializations that I haven't even gotten close to in 12+ hours.  Overall, I've already gotten my $5 worth, and I plan on keeping this one around for a while.  Things I'd like to see in updates: 1) I've only started up the game twice, do I need to log in every time?  I'm ok with a saved password, thanks.  2) Why can't I do a random character setup? I wish I could easily get a new look each time I restart.  3) Caps and food rations (2x1 items) start on the bottom of the loot box, so I have to move the cursor to loot them.  That slows my flow way down, man!4) I'll second the other people complaining that spawning next to an orc on turn 1 kind of sucks, but really it's not much of an issue since restarting is so quick.

												I honestly don't know what to rate this game, a good or bad.Here's the thing: This is a very difficult game. Luck is the biggest factor that ends up kicking you in the butt when you east expect it. I've dead suddenly from stepping on some random square and being spiked. Let me tell you, that's not fair at all. Also, there are enemies that appear on the first level that you have no chance at beating, and the fact that I can't just sell my unidentified stuff? Lame. What, no ""I have this equipped so over time I learn about it?"" No? No. Well, maybe there is but I never lived long enough to SEE IT HAPPEN!This game had potential. I like dungeon crawlers but damnit, it's hard to be hyped about a game when you die two minutes in every time. Super Meat Boy is hard but you know what to expect after dying for the twelfth time, it's just a matter of strategizing how hard and when to hit your freaking space bar. With Rogue's Tale it's all up in the air: You literally do not know what you'll get and the odds are too risky to do anything like eat a random mushroom for food or drink a potion. You can't even use scrolls just to see what they do, no you have to wait until they're identified, which costs money. Lame.The controls are very hard to get used to as well. Can't you just let me customize my controls? Why do they have to be optional? I like having full control on how I customize my way of playing, thank you very much.Here's the thing. Go to your App store and find Pixel Dungeon. It's 10x the dungeon crawler this will be, requires only a little bit of luck to get good items in the very beginning and pick up the right potions and scrolls, and it's completely free. I'm addicted to it. That's right, a little pixelated app game for freesies is much better than THIS.			"

You will eventually get better, learn more, become stronger.  Then you will be killed in one blast by a frost drake and have to start over again.  But you will start again, if only to ram your chosen weapon deep up the rear end of that damn drake.

												I don't mind hard games, so long as with some learning and skill you can succeed.  This game is pure RNG based.  You'll win or lose depending on how lucky you get...no skill necessary.  Skill points are useless, for male's you can have at most a 3 point difference between them, then you have to start leveling the stats you don't want.  For females I believe you can go as much as 4 points.Shop is useless, you can't sell anything without identifying it...and it costs you more to identify than what you can sell it for.Not worth it, especially when there are better free alternatives.

												After having binge bought this game on a whim a couple years ago, I regretted it for weeks. It seemed too hard, but some achievements make it progressively easier. There were no easy ways to make money, but then ""Easy/Don't Hurt Me"" mode came out, making the game enjoyable on a casual level, while still maintaining the super difficult Normal mode. And now, Heroic mode has made it's way in, for an even bigger challenge. At first, getting experience was hard, but now there are a few quests that you can do, and there are several new types of monsters to add variety, and even have elemental allignments, and therefore, weaknesses.. The developement was slow, and almost seemed non-existant. But every month or so, there was an update, and Rogue's Tale has been polished more and more. I now no longer regret my decision, and play this game often. My only complaint, is that the account system is not connected to your steam achievements, so if you forget your password or username, you will have to re-earn all of your heritages and achievements.

												So first of all:If you are looking for an extremly challenging Rogue-like you will not be disappointed with this game.Most of the negative reviews you see here are stating that this game is too luck based and you can do nothingabout it. I have to say that i think this game is very luck based indeed BUT there is also lots of strategy and skill involvedThose people who try to tell you that you can't do anything against dying did probably not put enough playtime into this game to understand how to survive. This game has a steep learing curve and you will see that if you continue to play it you will get better and better.So as you could maybe already tell it is a turn based RPG with randomly generated dungeons. The loot, monsters, traps... are different every time you play and the game itself is very fast paced. The main objective of this game is to unlock heritages (some sort of achievments) to permanently get benefits for every subsequent run of this game. So it is completly normal to die as a beginner without even completing the first dungeon. But if you let's say reach level 7 for the first time for example you will get a potion of antidot on every run you attempt after the current one. So do you remember those mushrooms that can poison you when you are trying to harvest them? Great! Now you can take the risk thanks to the potion and if you can reach level 20 without eating anything else than mushrooms you will not get anymore debuffs for eating them so you will have much less trouble with food.And thats basically the point of the game. You unlock benefits that help you unlocking even more benefits and you will get stronger and stronger by every time you play. This game is great even if so many people tell you that it is too luck based i for myself can say it is notYou have my recommendation for this game so buy it!			"

												It's a fun, interesting game.  I've put 6 hours in since yesterday, and have managed to reach level 12 or so as my best.  I do find a few things a bit annoying:1) The heritages are really, really tough to unlock.  I'm not sure I will spend enough time on this casual game to see very many unlocked, and so I wonder if that's as much of an appeal as it seemed at first.  I also wonder why there are so many of them.2) There's no such thing as 'vendor trash'.  Sure the game gives you loads of items you won't want to use, but...A) they have to be identified before you can sell them, and 20 gp a pop, and...B) the vendors only buy until you clog their inventory.So as above, why am I getting so many items?  I may start leaving them on the floor, because there's just not much point to it.As it stands it's probably a 3 of 5 for me.  It's okay, not great, not terrible.			"

												Imagine yourself lost in a dangerous forest... Suddenly you find a hut to sleep in. You enter the door and a bear kills you. Why was the bear in there, you 'll never know. Somehow you get a second chance in doing that. This time you are wiser. You check through the windows carefully to see if there's any bear inside. You see nothing. You open the door and A BEAR KILLS YOU AGAIN. God laughs at you. That's what rogue's tale is like.I WANTED to like this game... I WANTED to play it, a lot. And I did, for a while at least. Eventually, all the ''sorry buddy, you just gotta die'' mentality got to me. I suppose too much RNG in a game is not my cup of tea. You will enjoy this game only if you get some twisted sense of happiness out of losing even though you don't deserve to lose.			"

												Got this one in a recent bundle.  The bundle cost me about 2 bucks.  I'm writing this review in hopes of encouraging development of games like this one.  It's not Tales of Maj'Eyal, but you can have some fun with it.I enjoy rogue games, but recently, many of the true rogue-like games (as opposed to FTL or such games, which are considered rogue-like by some) have left me feeling a bit disappointed.  For example, Hack-Slash-Loot just didn't grab me like I hoped it would.  In contrast, this simple game has really held my interest.  Every dungeon feels unique.  I've run something like 20-30 dungeons (most fast deaths) and randomly, one time I find a castle place.  I hadn't seen anything like this yet, and the uniqueness of it was exciting.  It felt like I was infiltrating some underground base and stealing their loot.  On a separate play through, there was a merchant and his bodyguards that had set up camp on one level of the dungeon.  Once I found a ring that made me ethereal (?!?). Some times I find cool weapons, cool items, or cool enemies, and every time feels different.Don't get me wrong, this is a very simple game.  However, there's something about it that is just done right.  Perhaps its the balance or the RNG tables.  I can't put my finger on it, but it's just well done.The damage system uses the die system.  For example 1D6+3 would result in damage equal to 3+ a random number between 1 and 6 (like rolling a 6 sided die and adding 3)... in case you've never seen it.  But the damage system just fits.  The skills are interesting, though I'm not entirely sure what they all do.There's an online chat built into the game so that, if you choose to make an account on the main server (which I don't believe is required) you can chat with others playing the game.  High scores are kept, so that you can see a list of the scores of each of your play throughs.Now, the game does fall short in a few areas, at least according to my brief experience.  All items are unidentified until you pay 20 gold to identify them.  For many items, its a total waste to identify, cause they only sell for 5-10 gold and you ""identify"" them as unremarkable -- just a normal bow or helmet.  But merchants won't buy items unless they're identified.  I rather like loot hoarding and playing the inventory mini game, but this aspect definitely discourages it to any significant degree.Also, I'm not a huge fan of the level system, which follows a standard path for every character.  You do get to select which skills you get (by visiting a particular skill training object) and you get to select which stats to increase.  However, this doesn't happen every level, and, except for repeating the game until you learn it, there is no explanation of what each level gets for you.  If it's going to be so cryptic, I wish there would be an option to randomize it.  Why should I gain a stat at level 2 and 5 every single time?  Why should I gain a skill point at lvl 3 every time?  Given the lack of description, I feel like the leveling should be less predictable... or, at least, I wish there was an option to make it random if desired.For 2 bucks (especially as part of a bundle), I feel like I've already gotten my money's worth, and I'll be coming back to this game from time to time.

												Best 99 cents I've spent in awhile!It -IS- more RNG based than many other modern roguelikes, but its still pretty fun. This is just a more hardcore old school king of game. If you can't handle completly random nonsensical permadeaths this may not be for you (maybe consider a tamer rougelike, or even regular RPG instead of a roguelike). But if you don't mind the occasional super flu, bear trap, living water, or helldemon painting the cave wall with your remains 30-60 seconds after your latest character set foot in the dungeon, this game hs plenty to offer.

												All of the obtuseness, randomness, and boredom of an old-school roguelike, but without any of the charm, customization, or fun.

												Not sure what to say about this one, the roguelike aspect of it is a bit overshadowed by achievement grinding.  The game is just a step short of perfection, but that small step makes for a large gap in perception, or I should say, 'fun'.A trend in recent roguelikes, 'unwinnable from the first try', not simply due to lack of experience, and lack of luck, but lack of 'starter bonuses', or upgrades.  this game having the former, other itterations of this genra begenning to have the latter.It's great to see so many attempts to put a new twist on an old trick, but you change the game too much and it becomes exactly like another type of game which people have already gone and avoided years ago.  Classic RPG wine and grind.  Don't make us do it, we've done it, we know what its like, we don't want a job were we don't get paid.  Wonderful game, but desperately near to the classic grinding problem, of its own sort, achievement grinding for starter bonuses, beware.			"

												 While I have not accumulated any playtime on Steam as of yet, I assure you I have spent atleast 40 hours on this game pre-steam.  And just wanted to publish a quick review to let my friends and anyone else know how awesome this game is. Warning: You must be a FAN of rogue like games, as this game is so hard it'll have you slapping your own face and screaming in anger.  But OMG is it good when you actually make it far.   It's not the most complex game out there, but it has a good amount of content. The replay value comes from legacy unlocks and random change that is usually 98.9% NOT in your favor.  I would recommend this to anyone who seeks out hard rogue games, anyone else should probably steer clear. As it IS POSSIBLE to die within the first 3 turns LOL			"

												I just don't feel there's a learning curve to it unlike other roguelikes which are perhaps harder but in which deaths don't seem so inevitable. In RT you get to a certain level then you are almost guaranteed to go down a floor and meet enemies you simply stand no chance of surviving against. It's not like you have a choice in the matter. Dungeons increase in difficulty as you level up, and you don't have multiple paths to go in. Just one. To death. I rarely died and thought I could have done something differently. Perhaps there's a gameplay mechanic I'm missing? Perhaps this is just a game for dying a lot in. I don't quite get it and I got quite bored doing the first few floors over and over again without any real variation in what I could do. Floors are small, builds are unvaried. I'd recommend DC:SS or IVAN over this. Both have more depth, more variety, and are ""harder"" whilst being fairer.			"

												So, been playing this game for a couples of hours now and I'm trying really hard to love this game, but the more I try stuff, new approaches and strats, the more I see how much crap this is. Nothing you do or plan matters, because sooner or later you'll face an overwhelming enemy and fall in a trap while trying to flee or even spawn the new character you just made right next to a demon or any OP enemy. Also, you shouldn't have to mash the search button every damn time you move to a new square just to ensure you don't die from a insta-death trap or whatsoever. I played my share of hard games, but this game is hard for the wrong reasons. Designing a game that's based so much on luck is just plain stupid. Don't waste your money on that piece of crap. You can invest your 5$ on something much much more fun and rewarding than this.			"

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!! This game is rubbish. I tried it for seven minutes, and gave up. Here are my reasons:1. THERE IS NO WALKING ANIMATION. What kind of a game has NO walking animation!? 2. I died within the first thirty seconds of playing. I didn't know how to attack, let alone couldn't see, because there was a talking dog in my way. 3. The game starts you off with seven HP. I mean, come on, at least 10. Or 20 even. But seven? Just no.4. The description says you can customise your character to make it the rouge you want. You can change the hair, hair colour, and cloth colour. How is that making it the rouge you want!? You can't even change the weapon!5. Controls. It could've been an easy, simple control scheme, but to pick up an item you have to press alt or mouse wheel, select it from a grid, and equip it. No thank you. 6. The designer obviously put no effort into this whatsoever. He created a character, some enemies, and some pictures, wacked it together and called it a game. Conclusion: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. It is a scam for five dollars, a waste of time, and there are better things to buy with five dollars. This is the worst game in my library. Rating: 3/10. The ONLY thing I liked was the music, which wasn't even that good. It was the only good thing about this game.  Do not buy this game. Ever. In a bazzilion gillion lightyears.			"

												I've played dozens of roguelikes. This is most definitely not my first, nor my last. Believe me when I say that this game isn't worth your time. One of the core parts of a roguelike is the randomized dungeons, you will never ever play the exact same dungeon twice, ever. That is something this game gets right, in most aspects. What it gets fatally wrong, is that you can spawn on a dungeon floor rext night to a very high level enemy. This isn't hard and unforgiving, that's just terrible coding. I wouldn't mind if there was a tough enemy on the first couple of floors, like with Sigmund and Jessica and Grinder in Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup. But spawning next to a Dire Wolf leaves me with no options other than die. I'd suggest you go play another roguelike, one that's better made and far more polished.			"

												EDITED : Well , a while ago I recommended this game, but after actually beating it and trying lots and lots of good roguelikes ,I began to really despise this game. It's poorly made in terms of rewarding skill, and while random is always huge part of roguelikes here it's not placed right. Author is idiotic in his way of thought in making heritage system where you MUST die and do ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ things over and over again to just have a try at completing main game , and ammount of content is lacking. Don't be dissuaded from trying this wonderful genre of games just because this particular one is poorly made, i'd recommend you trying out few others that are very much more worth of your attention (and worth of being added to steam).Games I'd recommend instead of wasting your time with this one include :Nethack Vulture (I think it's on Steam if you search for Vulture)Dungeon Crawl StonesoupCataclysm Dark Days AheadShattered Pixel Dungeon for mobiles.EDIT : I'd like to point out that heritage system is not bad in itself, it's just badly made here. ToME and likes of it does it right.			"

												This game is extremely difficult, but fun.  It is one of my go to games for playing something quick when I only want to play for a few minutes.  Because that is usually all the time you get before you die and need to start a new game.The only change I would make to the game is the identification system.  I feel it would work much better if the character can tell whether an item is magical or not, and only need to identify magical items.  Or, as an alternative, allow the player to sell all items, but if it is not identified, then the trade value that the player gets for a magical item is only that which a non-magical item would give you.

												It is rare to encounter a roguelike that not only follows a more traditional recipe for the genre, but refines it to the extent of being visually pleasant, functionally simple, and having its own immense depth of gameplay that feels both reasonably balanced (for a roguelike) and very replayable. I recently activated this game on Steam but had played the game since early beta, and for completing it I was rewarded a key by the developer. During beta he not only listened to feedback but responded with revisions to the game, though very little feedback was needed because bugs were rare and the game as it was being developed was already turning out to be great.Gameplay could be technically described as a hacklike with a bandlike inclusion of a town with shops, a Diablo-like inventory, and a unique perk and spell system all presented in a beautiful GUI with smooth animations and excellent sound effects. Best of all it gives you the D&D thrill of ""what's in the next room"" as you weigh your potential for doom. You need to eat, drink, and be careful to avoid traps during combat. Expect to make many poor decisions as you learn the game, and each will be a lesson that improves your playthrough until eventually you'll find it much more plausible (with the help of starting bonuses related to achievements) to reach end-game in nearly every playthrough. But like the best of the genre, this roguelike may also suddenly vanquish its hero with a falling boulder or a spiked pit that your player simply can't roll his way out of due to low strength.I would recommend this game and this developer to anyone, although it does require some appreciation for challenge and a healthy respect for RNG (random number generator) in order to fully enjoy. Those who love roguelikes as a genre will enjoy this game and those who aren't familiar with them may find it a great introduction. Those that hate roguelikes will probably complain about learning curve, difficulty, and harshness of the random nature of this game and most of the genre. It is intended to be difficult, and rewards you for learning. You learn by experience, and not ""experience points"" (although there is a level system in this game) but DEATH.Gameplay 10/10 -- Great depth and balance, and recently added crafting?!Sound 8/10 -- Could use more music, but all sounds and music in the game are lovely.Graphics 9/10 -- One of most visually pleasant graphical hacklikes with very unique artwork.Difficulty 7/10 -- Died hundreds of times, but still found it easier than Nethack. Which is not bad!Developer 11/10 -- Responsive, generous, honest, and very talented. Can't wait for the next game.			"

												An addictive rouge-like. While frustrating at first, once you understand the system you quickly delve deeper into the dungeons. Unlike most dungeon crawls though, the systems don't require complex calculations on the users part. My tip, build your characters based on what you find and less on what you want your hero to find, you'll get a lot farther.			"

												Unfortunately, this fun, well-made game is ruined by crushing difficulty.  I have made about 25 characters so far, and not one has made it past level 3 (about 5 minutes of play time).  There is no skill involved; you simply encounter things that kill you, over, and over, and over again, and there is no way around it.			"

												EDITED : Well , a while ago I recommended this game, but after actually beating it and trying lots and lots of good roguelikes ,I began to really despise this game. It's poorly made in terms of rewarding skill, and while random is always huge part of roguelikes here it's not placed right. Author is idiotic in his way of thought in making heritage system where you MUST die and do ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ things over and over again to just have a try at completing main game , and ammount of content is lacking. Don't be dissuaded from trying this wonderful genre of games just because this particular one is poorly made, i'd recommend you trying out few others that are very much more worth of your attention (and worth of being added to steam).Games I'd recommend instead of wasting your time with this one include :Nethack Vulture (I think it's on Steam if you search for Vulture)Dungeon Crawl StonesoupCataclysm Dark Days AheadShattered Pixel Dungeon for mobiles.EDIT : I'd like to point out that heritage system is not bad in itself, it's just badly made here. ToME and likes of it does it right.			"

												This game is extremely difficult, but fun.  It is one of my go to games for playing something quick when I only want to play for a few minutes.  Because that is usually all the time you get before you die and need to start a new game.The only change I would make to the game is the identification system.  I feel it would work much better if the character can tell whether an item is magical or not, and only need to identify magical items.  Or, as an alternative, allow the player to sell all items, but if it is not identified, then the trade value that the player gets for a magical item is only that which a non-magical item would give you.

												I like this game. The only problem is the randomness of the game, it's too random, it isn't fair. Often I died at the very beginning, it really needs to be more balanced. That being said I enjoyed my time with Rogue's Tale.			"

												It's a pretty great game, but it does take a while to really get into. There's a steep learning curve, and much of the game is RNG-based. There's a lot more depth to the game than you'll notice for, probably the first 10 hours, at least. Once you learn the tricks to the game, you'll be able to survive relatively long in most runs.Rogue's Tale is still being updated, although very infrequently.I really enjoy this game, and I think it's definitely worth the price of 5 measly dollars, or perhaps less still, if it's on sale. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys rogue-likes, dungeon crawlers, or RNG.			"
