												Is the game worth $40? Hell no? Is the game worth around $10? Well that depends. Many gamers today aren't willing to invest into games that provide a mediocre experience. They only want to play games that are highly recieved. Gone are the days of going to the store and just picking out a game because the cover art looked cool. With reviews everywhere, gamers are more wary of their purchases. So I will say this, the game will not woo you. It will most likely be a forgettable experience. The controls are somewhat clunky and the animations are subpar. But is it worth your time? I say yes. Games like this reach towards the stars and fail poetically due to a lack of budget. IF you are looking for a decent Action RPG with an OK story to pass time, then I reccommend this game. If you only concern yourself with the highest quality of game out there, then I suggest you move along.			"

												I bought this game at a pretty hefty discount before it was released after watching trailers and reading previews. I like the game quite a bit, not at all disappointed with the purchase. I played it pretty consistently until I finished it. Overall I'd rate it a 80/100The story is dark, set in a world plagued by demons and monsters after some sort of cataclysmic magical apocalypse. The decisions you make have very real consequences both for those close to your character and for the city where you spend most of your time. The game system works well - clearly heavily influenced by the Witcher 2. The combat is pretty good, but slightly rough around the edges. So should you buy this game? Depends on how much you like RPG's with dark stories, and whether or not you are willing to excuse the combat for not being as good as Witcher 2, Skyrim, Dragon Age or KOTOR 1&2. Finally I'd like to address the ""incest"" thing. Clearly people were not paying attention as your character is not actually a blood relative of the possible romantic interest.			"

												Demonicon has a few things going for it, but the bad outweighs the good for me. The combat is not the greatest, it is very linear, the voice acting goes from great to atrocious, to pricey at time of release and the art design is not very good. It does have some interesting characters though and some nice areas later on in the game which save it from being all bad. It doesn't do anything horribly but it also doesn't do very much great either. Sort of a mixed apple of sorts, I would only reccomend it to people if the game was on sale for $5 or so. I think if they put some more work into the combat and making more things to do other than the main missions it  would do wonders. Think of a poor mans Fable mixed with a  poor mans Drakensang, that also has some cool characters.5/10 or 6/10?			"

												I've given this game a 'Yes' recommendation, but only if you can find it going really cheap in a deal or a sale somewhere. So - Demonicon. It's not the worst game you'll ever play, but it's not terribly well designed, and it's kind of 'obvious' that it worked to a budget, which is a shame because it's got some nice visuals and as an RPG it manages to hit some of the right notes. It's got a lot of obvious bugs and half-finished elements, it's kind of clunky, and the story isn't amazing, and isn't really developed entirely well. I think the game tries to rely too much on the background The Dark Eye lore, which will appeal only to fans of that pen & paper RPG. The first couple of areas as well are a bit cumbersome, and it's not really that enjoyable a game to begin with.But eventually, after about 10 hours or so, maybe? Towards the latter half of the second hub, suddenly you get a sense of... moorishness. By this time Cairon should have some better abilities & equipment, and should be levelled up to a point where he's actually slightly ahead of the curve for that area. This makes the fighting easier (but not boring), which stops some of the sluggish battles you may have had before this. Keep on top of things and this advantage can last you the rest of the game, and all in all it makes you feel like a little bit of a badass.As an example, in a later hub section, I found myself confronted by three or four demons in armour, wielding some pretty nasty looking weapons. I was preparing myself mentally for long and difficult fight, and I ran at the first one and did that stabby move that's kind of like what Brad Pitt does in the movie Troy. The demon knight fell instantly - recovering from my momentary surprise, I repeated the move on the others, and then the fight was over. I felt like a total BOSS, and that's something that this game is kind of good at, especially in the later half.So – all in all, if you find it cheap and are willing to put up with a rather poor start, this is one of those one-shots that can entertain you for a while. I finished the game in 26 hours, so it’s not short by any means, but it’s fairly linear for an ‘RPG’ so the story can only go on for so long.For more information, especially about the specific mechanics of the game, check out my full review at Strategy Informer: http://www.strategyinformer.com/pc/darkeyedemonicon/reviews.html "

												Demonicon reminded me a bit of Dragon Age 2 because of its repetitive and dull environments. But it's a game that's understandable, a game that anyone can play. It's actually fairly good for an action RPG. Until it becomes very repetitive as far as the quests are concerned. The character and skill upgrade systems are refreshing. They aren't perfect, but at least they allow for a lot of customization, even if half of these upgrades aren't used all that much. You earn AP by finishing quests, killing enemies, you name it. These points can then be spend on upgrades. Each skill requires 4 blocks of points before it is entirely upgraded and there are about 10 skills in total. You can also spend these points on stats like strength and you also unlock a magic system early on that uses GP which can be earned pretty much the same way, but you have to use magic while doing things.Quests consist of kill and fetch quests and halfway through the game this becomes rather repetitive. This is also thanks to the not-all-that-exciting combat, which is real-time, by the way.The graphics are sharp and pretty good, but the framerate drops in villages and I have no idea why. The villages aren't overly crowded and there aren't any spectacular visual effects in it either. Weird. Otherwise, the game runs well.The voice acting isn't all that bad, even if some of the voices don't match the personalities of the characters. But then again, this is no AAA title so if we take that into account it isn't all that bad.Demonicon didn't disappoint me because I didn't really have any expectations so if you feel the same way give it a try. But if you want a quality RPG that isn't too repetitive look further.[Rating: 74/100]			"

												The Dark Eye Demonicon is a third person action-RPG set within The Dark Eye series, a German tabletop role-playing game that outsells Dungeons & Dragons in the German market. You play as Cairon, a young man who suddenly acquires demonic powers when his blood is mixed with the blood of his sister. Some people begin to take an interest in you, and events unfold from there. It is a fairly straightforward tale, with plenty of twists and turns that are less than shocking along the way. But it is an interesting story, and it features one of the most often used tropes in role-playing games today: moral choices.At certain points throughout the story, you have to make choices that will affect how others will view you. Standard stuff, but the best part is that you will often have no idea how your choices will impact you in the future.As Cairon explores the world, he has a few methods with which he can dispatch his enemies. Attacking with your weapon and using whatever physical skills you have is the first method, alongside throwing weapons which he can use to attack enemies at a distance. And then there is magic, which is comprised of four spells with multiple unlockable variations for each spell. Both play well, and I used a mixture of the magic and the mundane as I journeyed through the game.Alongside your combat skills are your non-combat skills such as lock-picking and legend lore, which are used to acquire and unlock additional opportunities. If you upgrade your fast talking ability for example, you will be able to obtain greater rewards for quests or avoid fights entirely in some cases. But a key detail to all of this is the way in which you use experience, or in Demonicon, AP and GP. AP is used for physical oriented skills, non combat skills and primary stats, while GP is used to upgrade your magic abilities. This is an interesting feature, as you now have to choose between upgrading your skills and upgrading your stats when you obtain experience.  In theory you could turn Cairon into the least capable warrior in all existence, but in practice you will have increased everything at least moderately by the end of the game. You’ll want to level up everything at least somewhat equally, but the non-traditional character progression forces one to make careful decisions as you progress through the game.If there is one major problem that I can pinpoint in Demonicon, it would be the technical issues that pop up time and again.Textures would pop in and out when I entered conversations, the camera would often move by itself to the worst possible place imaginable during a battle and plenty of other technical glitches and bugs occurred during the 19 hours I spent with the game.With Demonicon being far from flawless, I found myself wondering whether or not I enjoyed it enough to give it a positive recommendation. Honestly, I did. Despite its issues, The Dark Eye: Demonicon remains a fun adventure that, while lacking polish, is an enjoyable journey through The Dark Eye setting.			"

												Neither a Triple A rpg nor does it have top notch gameplay but extremely well done game nevertheless. The Plot:The plot is quite interesting but may put off some people, personally i love it. Its not very deep and has a few plot holes but manages to pull through. The areas in the game also ain't that big. Standard RPG formula, main plot brings the player to different places where he/she can choose to clear side quests(basically made up of kill this, collect that). Within the main plot there are crossroads where you will have to make choices and side with either faction. Without spoiling much, these choices affect that portion or area of the story but not much towards the ending. I've completed the game on my first playthrough within roughly 20hrs, minus all the afk and crash and completed almost all side quests.Combat/Skills/Stats/Crafting:Combat is action based not very fluid and flashy(it is a bit dull) but still passable and entertaining. Quite a limited Skill/Magic and Stats system, a far cry from other Dark Eye games and other ""single character"" RPGs. Again, nothing that really impressed me. Technically you can almost max them if you do grind the side quests. Crafting is very simple but kinda pointless, you don't really need the potions/buffs unless on higher difficulty.Graphics/Soundtrack:Looks more like a pre-2010 graphics, it looks somewhat dated therefore do not expect much on the looks of the surroudings, characters and world itself. Soundtrack is decent.Overall, i'd give it a 7/10. Plot and the backstory premise mainly the reason i play this game for.			"

												7.5/10At first I was really excited for this game to come out, then shortly after I read the reviews, I saw the game and my initial excitement waned. However, for some reason this game still called to me, the world of The Dark Eye just seemed so interesting and so when I found it on sale for dirt cheap I had to satisfy my curiosity and i'm glad I did.Demonicon, without a doubt has it's flaws, but buried beneath these flaws is a game that could've easily been 9/10 had Kalypso taking their time and fleshed things out just a little more. The story, which is slightly cliche, is told wonderfully. The characters feel real and not like some extreme virtue of either good or evil. The decisions that are made throughout the game remind me of that of The Witcher Series in that no one choice represents true right or wrong necesarrily, but instead leaves it open for you to decide what is right and that puts you in some difficult spots. My only complaint with the story is the lack of an epilogue, which leaves the ending feeling lackluster and meak. Probably one of the best things done in Demonicon is the lore. From a city's history to the different demons of the world, the amount of detail put into the lore is outstanding and truly gives you insight into the happenings of the world. On the other hand some might consider the combat to be the worst. While it's true the combat is clunky and the stop-and-go fighting can be rather annoying, I found the combat to be enjoyable. Again another feature that is reminiscient of The Witcher 2 with and emphasis on parrying and thinking about your moves instead of just hacking away. It isn't as polished as The Witcher 2, but I didn't find it as bad as some say.For me the worst aspects of this game are the bugs, the graphics, and the overall ""lifeless"" world. Most of the bugs are minor, such as your father randomly taking a knee throughout your conversation, but for a game that's been out for awhile now you expect most of these bugs to be gone. The graphics, while not terrible, certaintly don't look like the other realeases at the time. Demonicon looks like an early xbox 360 realeased game. The characters convey no emotions on their faces and if it weren't for the voices you'd proabbaly just assume they were tranquil with everything. The world also seems dead, sure there are people who inhabit it, but they all just stand around gazing emptily maybe talking to another citizen and it makes the city feel dead. Overall, I do recommend this game to RPG fans if they can find it on sale. The story and the world will entrance you, just don't expect too much else from the game.			"

												It's a WRPG without manual saving. What more do I gotta say?Wait wait wait. Okay. If I had to put it simply, it's more or less if you made Witcher 2's combat very stiff and awkward, then mixed it with the one track mind of Dragon Age 2. Now that may sound horrible, but it's not for a lack of trying. Whatever miniscuile budget they had, the developers tried their best to tell a (mostly) coherent story that sprinkles around lore like it's going out of season. Beyond that though, there would be a LOT of reasons to hate it... if not for the fact that most of the sins that it commits were first perpetrated by Bioware, specifically Dragon Age 2. Which mind you, was critically acclaimed by hack journalists. So let's beginA dialogue wheel that doesn't actually show you what you're gonna say? Yup. Consoley design and controls? Yup.Linear as hell and a slave to its main plot? Yup.Bad character models and downright horrible animation? Yup.Enemies that kind of just, pop in out of nowhere? Yup.Two choices rather than a third option you'd want to sensibly make? Yup.Characters that stand around making idle threats rather than actually doing anything? Yup.Inability to interact with the game world such as killing people, stealing from people, etc unless it's specifically involving the story in some way? Yup.Reusing old areas? Yup. (Although Demonicon justifies it by writing the plots around the areas, rather than just copying and pasting old areas and telling you they're new.)In terms of its own sins, Demonicon lacks a party system. I understand however, that it is a smaller adventure, so to have a second or third character that can level or change would be pointless, but I'd have been happy with a generic hireable that dies easily - at least then I'd have something to do with all the money I had, but more than anything, it just feels so weird to not have anybody allied with you for a segment despite it being clear that if it were any other kind of RPG, they'd be in your party or at least along for the ride. Speaking of adventure... there isn't any. As mentioned, it lacks any kind of interactivity with the world, so it feels more or less like a static environment that you're running through, and boy oh boy does this game pack on the giant areas filled with nothing that just eats up your time, specifically, the giant empty monastery that you have to waste time running around in that reeks of not only filler, but running out of money. All you can really do besides following quest markers is go down a corridor that you can see on your map and maybe find a chest filled with junk that you sell at a vendor. It has exploration in terms of maybe finding a chest in the corner, but there are no side quests to find or anything of note besides maybe lore. Side quests. Another big problem. You find them on dart boards akin to MMORPGs and slap them to your dashboard with the markers to tell you where to get the seven pearls of Uranus or some garbage. Just take them all, there's no penalty either way, as they're all pointless fetch quests with nothing to offer and no choices to make. It's busy work.So the main systems to the game - the role playing, the combat - has to at least make up for all that stuff, right? Well... Even on hard my first time, I found the combat rather trivial even despite not knowing how to parry. I seriously beat the game never parrying. I did end up doing a lot of combat rolls as a result, but even so, with just one combat skill and a few magic spells, I was able to trounce most of the game not using anything beyond my sword. In this regard, I can see what they were going for in terms of the replay value as an RPG, as there are a variety of combat skills and levels to the magic spells that you can't necessarily reach in one play through. I just felt I would have never had a use for any of it, especially when you only have 4 slots (4 for magic, 4 for skills, 4 for items) to put every ability. It is fun, don't get me wrong, and it is exactly the kind of action game I was expecting from that dog Dragon Age 2. Mixing and matching everything and doing the right commands in tandem with enemy animations works and it has a meaty feel to when you're slicing and dicing.In regards to building the character, it's similar to The Witcher, where you're stuck as a single character with no customization per-se, which isn't necessarily a bad thing if you're able to build them to how you feel. So once again, the problem of a single person RPG comes into play, because Cairon is essentially a multiclasser. I maxed out the passive skills, so I was a top notch haggler and charismatic. I was a knower of medicines and could open any lock or disarm any trap. So on top of doing all that, I was brute in combat and could freeze you in place with magic. Huh? I don't feel like I role played as anybody, I just feel like I went on Theme Park RPG #361.So let's say if they balanced the games stats properly, and you could actually miss out on a few things here and there and would need to replay the game to see them. Well, you could be potentially boned. Like lock picking. It's completely useless and a dump stat. You never find anything actually of worth in chests, even the few that actually require you to use rank 6  or 7. Whereas haggle for example, could be used to get a ton of points to spend by using it at several vendors at once, then upgrading it and doing it all over again. The problem arises in that some of the seventh mastery passives are never actually tested, because I assume the developers ran out of time and couldn't rejigger and balance things like they should have. There should have been several 5-7 rank chests that you couldn't open that had cool stuff in both early and later parts of the game, so you'd WANT TO invest in lockpicking, so I'd be Cairon the Rogue, rather than Cairon ""Who Can Do Everything""Despite all that, and the fact that the game ending requires you going back to an old area THE THIRD TIME, I was  intrigued overall with the story. Characters never truly ring of good or evil, instead, seeming far more gray than I was expecting. It was seldom anyone was ever an outright jerk. The few choices you make actually made me feel confilcted, because they never offered you a clear conscience one way or the other. ""Sure, you did X, but Y happened.""Despite railroading you the whole way, those few snippets felt refreshing, whereas other RPGs would have made it very clear cut one way or the other of what my deed would wrought. I just wish it had more characters to meet, more stories to see and a far more satisfying ending.Still, I can't recommend it. It's no lost gem or even an unpolished one, it's a game that had a lot of aspirations, but had no feasible way to deliver them. I definitely don't dislike it, but hey, I actually put in the time to beat this game unlike Dragon Age 2, and considering the money EA/Bioware put into that turd - that's worth something.The Pro's:+Surprisingly decent writing here and there+Choices that leave the player scratching their head (in a good way)+Fun junk food combat+Voice acting that was never embarrassing or truly badThe Con's:-No real depth to the role playing-As linear as lines on a paper-The base price is asking a little too much-Certain combat mechanics don't actually seem to work or aren't worth using-Reused areas-Poorly designed filler content-Cairon is no Geralt "

												Actually a pretty decent RPG.I got this game in a bundle that I bought a few months back. When I first bought the bundle, I kind of ignored this game, instead concentrating on the centerpieces of the bundles. I thought it nothing but a throw-in, and because of the ratings, threw it to the side.  However, once I had beaten/gotten bored of the rest of the games in the bundle, I finally ""Eh, why the hell not"" and installed this game. After a story that took me about 13 hours to complete, I found that the game pleasantly surprised me.As you can probably see from the videos and screenshots of this game, it's not a AAA game. It's not gonna blow you away. But it's not meant to do that, but instead draw you into the story/roleplaying elements of the game.The game takes place in the Dark Eye Universe, a spin-off of the D&D universe. It's akin to other games set in the same universe, such as the Blackguards Series, or the Drakensang series, and lore from those two, though unneeded, would possibly help you appreciate this game. But unlike those two this is an action-RPG, whereas those are turn-based. However, I can't say that's necessarily for the better. The combat in this game primarily consists of button-mashing, trying to get combos, which in turn you can use to activate powers/magic. It is very clunky, but you get used to it eventually.The story is probably the best feature of this game. Although it is flawed, it does have a fairly unique plot, along with semi-interesting characters. The quests aren't bad either. One aspect I did like was that you have a choice in a lot of the major plot points in the game. Although the choices don't really affect the ending, they do affect the characters you interact with, turning them for or against you. As for side-quests, they're your run-of-the-mill type quests. ""Go here, get this, come back"" or ""Kill this, come back"", but you do get some solid rewards from them, so there is SOME incentive in doing them. Lastly, don't expect this game to be open-world. Although you do have partial free reign to explore the mission areas, your choices are pretty limited to either trading with merchants or looking for ingredients/treasure chests. There is a skills portion to the game, but it isn't very fleshed out either. It includes the standard RPG skills: Herblore, Lockpicking, speech, etc. But don't expect there to be a flasy minigame associated with them like the Elderscrolls Series. Also as a sidenote, don't let the Blacksmith skill decieve you, it's purely used to disarm traps (odd I know) and apply upgrades to armor/weapons. There is no actual crafting.Overall I would give this game a 7/10. I wouldn't buy it full price, but if it's ever on sale, I'd strongly recommend grabbing it.			"

												As a longtime fan of the Dark Eye pen and paper rpg, I was intrigued when I heard about Demonicon. An action-rpg in the Black  Lands, dealing with the legacy of Borbarad - sounds good, at least in theory.Let's see how it holds up:Liked:- the content is mature (little SPOILER: there is a budding incestous relationship between our main protagonists)- the gameplay is on average pretty smooth, barring a few hiccups- the setting has been almost painstakingly recreated and the details border on continuity porn (if you don't know what that     is, look it up on tvtropes.org)- the story manages to pull you in and doesn't let up until the very end, with tough decisions, whose results you only see after a while, but for some there is always a third option depending on your skills-superb VA (at least in the german version, haven't tried the english yet; little spoiler: your father has the german voice of Liam Neeson)Disliked (well not actually disliked, but more puzzled by):- a couple of glitches in the graphics, nothing major or gamebreaking; I've seen a lot worse in AAA titles- something in the story progression that didn't make a lot of sense (SPOILER: you beat a powerful and annoying Rondrian and loot the armor from his corpse, only to be immediately offered a better demonic version by a demon - what's up with that?)Bottom line: IMO Demonicon felt like a somewhat quality-reduced clone of The Witcher 2, which is a superb game and thus Demonicon managed to be at least a good game. If you liked The Witcher 2 and you need to pass some time until The Witcher 3 arrives, then Demonicon is the game for you. If you're a fan of The Dark Eye, then Demonicon is also for you, since this is the only game besides Drakensang that made me feel like I was actually walking through Aventuria. Everybody else, it's up to you.			"

												This game was pretty good. Not super lengthy for an RPG (~16 hours), and very linear. There are some side quests and stuff, but for the most part it  guides you through the game. Not necessarily a bad thing, but don't expect a lot of free roaming exploration or anything. The combat is done well enough, and The Dark Eye provides a good system that gives lots of variety for leveling up and character development and whatnot. The graphics are very dated, and it can be pretty clunky at times, so if you're expecting a super polished, streamlined experience then this probably isn't for you. The story is quite good, though, and the voice acting is acceptable to good for the most part. Very few technical issues, only the occasional stutter or sound effect that was too loud. If you have a soft spot for rusty european RPGs, or any of Cyanide Studio's games (Of Orcs and Men, Game of Thrones), you should give this a go.			"

												+ Story is good but it's a bit complicated to understand completely.+ Decision making which does influence the game to some extent...- Graphics, animations, lip-sync, facial expressions are weak to say the least- Combat is meh...not too cool and the parry function is worthless or I did not understand the mechanism of using it effective...- The game feels raw and seriously lacks polishIf you don't have any high expectations from this game and you get it in a bundle or for a good discount (at least 80% off) it might be worth your time... However as people said it's not the best in its genre so try to be indulgent... Something kept me playing it to the end but it's not for everybody.I'd give it a thumb sideways but there's no option for that. The idea behind the game is good but the implementation is sloppy.A sequel of the game that corrects the minuses mentioned would have a great success in my opinion. "

												Demonicon is a 3rd person action RPG. You follow the story of a brother and sister, which takes place in the Dark Eye universe, who find out they have special gifts when their blood was mixed. You only play as the brother leveling up through action points and gift points you earn through battles. You can level up main stats like strength and vitality, skills like lockpicking, medicine, and speech or combat skills with the action points you earn. The gift points go towards your gift skills which are like magic powers.Combat in the game is ok. You have one mainattack besides the combat and gift skills. When attacking you need to time the button pressing right to continue your combo attack. Enemies can become bothersome or annoying sometimes when you go to attack and they keep hitting you and stopping your action. Controls did feel a little sluggish and slow when attacking. You do have a dodge roll which helps a little but your character seems to move slower than everyone else. Graphics look to be from something 10 years ago which isn't bad just not up to par with some games today. Plus it doesn't matter how a game looks if you enjoy it. Sounds were pretty generic and sometimes annoying. There are some parts in town when you are running around and NPC dialog got load and cluttered when it seemed like 10 people are trying to talk over one another. Characters were pretty interesting and funny. You can choose different ways to go in the game and I chose mainly the good side of things. What was weird though was in some conversations it seemed like my character was rude and evil even though I would pick the better dialog route. The story overall wasn't bad and get me interested to see how it all panned out in the end. You could even do another playthrough to see where other actions would take you.There were some issue with the game though. Framerate issues were a problem throughout the game. No matter where I put the settings I would drop as low as 15 frames sometimes which made for some rough video. I also would see pop in at times and screen tearing. I even had the game crash on me about 5 times when I was more than halfway though the game.Despite these flaws the game was still fun and intriguing. I liked some of the characters and even had some laughs here and there. It also has replay value if you'd like to see where the different choices would take you. If you can get the game on sale than pick it up and enjoy your time.			"

												I had totally forgotten I owned this game, but being a huge fan of the ""The Dark Eye"" universe, I finally had to try it. So please keep in mind during the review that I'm not a genre veteran, but rather a casual player who hoped to find a consistent implementation of one of his favourite universes...((TL;DR at the end))This game doesn't start out as a heroic adventure, but instead shows the harsh and gritty reality of refugees in the demon-cursed Shadowlands. You play as Cairon, a young man with a mysterious gift, who finds himself in the middle of mysteries and intrigues in the recently freed city of Warunk.It's definitely one of those games which need some ""warm-up time"". The graphics aren't up to date, and combat doesn't feel very smooth, especially in the beginning before you get your first maneuvers. Cairon starts out as a slightly annoying loudmouth (at least that's how it felt to me), but gradually turns into a more layered character. The more you learn about his past, the better you understand his opinion of the world around him. There haven't been many huge decisions yet, but the ones so far always made me stop and ponder to find the lesser of two evils. You really have to choose between a rock and a hard place here! The fact that there's hardly a choice without a downside fits the general atmosphere well.Demonicon uses a watered-down version of the TDA skill system, which allows a rather detailed customisation. You can invest in basic attributes (which influence a few other things), skills and combat maneuvers, while your ""gift"" powers are levelled separately. Depending on which skills you favour, you might gain access to additional items within the game world, helpful information, or different dialogue options. While you might have expected Persuasion to help with the latter (as usual ;)), you might be surprised to find out that Legend Lore can be just as helpful. The story itself starts out slow, but gains momentum after a while. The more you find out, the more new questions are raised. It's not the most epic example of storytelling, but it's enough to keep you entertained. As a seasoned roleplayer, it had a very ""pen & paper campaign-y"" feel to me, actually. I'm not yet sure whether that's a good or bad thing - or maybe it's both.Speaking of pen & paper, I would like to finish this review by adding the perspective of a seasoned ""The Dark Eye"" player. Those who don't know the universe might have a totally different view on the game, so if that applies to you, take the following with a grain of salt (or skip it altogether). As a warning, it also contains spoilers - but it would be hard to discuss the relevant topics otherwise, sorry!So, does this game really feel like TDA? The answer is ""kind of"". Of course, the atmosphere in the Shadowlands hugely differs from the setting a pen & paper TDA player will be used to. People feel forsaken by the Twelvegods and first and foremost care about their survival (and the next meal). The background is in keeping with the p&p setting (a definite plus for me), and one might recognize a lot of ""historical"" events and big players. This, of course, makes some ingame informations redundant or ""old news"" to seasoned TDA players, but as the game tries to appeal to a broader market, one should accept it as a ""refresher course"" in Aventurian lore ;)There's a downside to knowing those things already, though. I could easily foresee a lot of plot twists by applying my TDA background knowledge (""oh, it must be a case of X because only Y would be able to..."", ""the mysterious NPC is probably [official NPC] because..."", and so on). Said knowledge also made me VERY reluctant to accept certain quests, use some items, and (perhaps most importantly) make full use of Cairon's ""gift"", as I knew that in Aventuria, all those things are VERY VERY BAD STUFF(tm). Players not well-versed in TDA lore might enjoy those apects of the game, but I just sat here and thought ""no, I don't WANT this, but game mechanics make me do it... this sucks!"" I should probably mention that I usually play the ""good guys"" in the p&p, and the furthest I go is dark grey with a tendency to turn lighter... even my demonologist hates demons and just wants to exorcise them ;)---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------TL;DR: Do I recommend this game? Yes, tentatively. If it happens to be on sale, fans of the genre or setting should definitely take a look at it. Demonicon is a flawed, but still entertaining game. Experienced TDA players might enjoy the grittier take on Aventuria, but will also be able to foresee some plot twists.			"

												Noumena Studios is able to pull off a better BioWare game despite coming uncomfortably close to putting Baldur's Gate fanfiction of Imoen to code.Following The Dark Eye Pedigree to the letter, there is nothing about Demonicon that does not involve the likely foreign and confusing lore of Adventuria. Fortunately for the player, the key aspects of this game are immediately and consistently explained to the point that anyone could become an expert on Borbarrad and his teachings, whether or not they care to hunt down all the legends and specific conversation choices. The fact that they are able to successfully craft a compelling narrative out of Borbaradianism - that is a demonic mixture of two parts extreme Nietzchean philosophy, three pinches of Social Darwinism inspired ritualistic sacrifice and a whole helping of Objectivism, present your potential adversaries as more than just giggling maniac cultists. There is a real methodology to the evil or demon worshiping characters in this game that is as morally questionable as it is seductive; “Every man – A Mage” and the pursuit of freedom through the power of Blood Magic which often comes at the cost of enslaving and murdering others. Outside of the inexplicable charm of the story, there is a tight combat that is a comfortable blend of simple Action RPG slashing and spell flinging. Easy to pick up yet difficult to master, Demonicon is as pen and paper as you can get without scripted irritation from a wrathful DM.As for cons, however, this game has a strange sense of what should have the effort to be animated and what will be skipped over abruptly - to the point where I am always surprised whether I have high or lower expectations of what the game will do. It has difficulty keeping characters out of making the same arm folds or generic dramatic finger points for the 100th time, yet it has the depth to program taking a single bite out of an apple and then casually tossing it aside in order to anger the parents of starving children, if the player so chooses to be a Rear Admiral Dickbutt for one specific part of the early game.It is a lower budget indie RPG and I wouldn't have it any other way after experiencing it in all its flawed glory.

												After playing other games from this developer like Mars War Logs, which I did enjoy, I fought through the negative feedback and thought, maybe this game just isnt for everyone! Unfortunately this game wasn't what I was hoping for. The fighting mechanics are slow, clunky and extremely repetitive. I probably could've played the game with a macro, 'swing, swing, swing...' The story was okay at best. It had nothing that excited or really made you want to play more thinking what's next?Frankly I'm shocked I played this game to completion, I dont recommend playing it as it might just sit in your library forever.

												I think this game is a real hidden gem. I'm a huge fan of RPG's but had never heard of this game until i saw it in the sale. The game can seem very linear and a little simplistic at times but you can forgive that with the in depth storyline and fluid combat. The areas can be quite small and although it's techincally free roam in these areas with side quests it doesn't always feel that way. The Game does have some basic customization with armour and weapons but could be better, i found myself with a massive amount in my inventory throughout the game but not a lot to do with it other than make potions, add runes to weapons or armour and equip these new and improved weapons and armour. The Graphics are OK and it's nice to have choices with dialogue throughout the game. I was impressed at the length of the game and the entire game has voice acting which is a bonus. But there is a lot of talking so if you have a short attention span this may not be for you as although the dialogue can be skipped the storyline is very in depth and can get confusing if you miss any. The  game has quite a complex level up system which can be very hard to grasp at first but gives quite a few options to change gameplay such as fast talking to open new dialogue options and different branches of magic to mix up combat. This is a great game to pick up in the sale as although i find it to be a great game it doesn't match up to some of the other great RPG's with a similar full price price tag such as skyrim. The biggest problem with this game is the lack of manual saving and to some people i can see why this would be unforgivable as i have died serveral times on hard difficulty and have been put back to my last save 10 minutes earlier so i have to kill everyone and loot the area all over again.

												Demonicon:10 hours in the game at the time of writingNow where do i begin?This game gives you choices, well to be specific, a set amount of choices as well as consequences tied to said choices.That is what i love about Demonicon. If you can look past the funny voice acting, the hilarous script and the bipolar tendecies of your hero Cairon, then you are in for a very funny ride.The graphics of the game were average at most, not bad and also not that good. Just average. There are a few graphical options to choose from in order for you to tweak your experience with it i guess.There will be a few instances where some textures take time to load or will not load at all, but this happened rarely.The voice acting in this game is really funny to me. There's the obligatory english/british accent and what really makes it funny is the script. It is like they really wanted Cairon to sound like the most bi-polar hero you'll ever encounter. You can be mad in one moment and immediately be the paragon of kindness in the next. The consequences in the game are shown to you in a cutscene whenever you finish the quest chain that had you make the choices. It sums up your choices in a very creative way, i love the presentation. The consequences themselves range from things you can live with, things you can't sleep at night about and things that are cartoonishly evil.The thing i like the most is that while you can be a total♥♥♥♥♥♥to everyone, your dickishness won't lock you out of doing good things and you have a chance to turn it around should you wish to. There is also a fair amount of flirting since apparently a ton of women find Cairon attractive.The story of the game revolves around the two siblings, Cairon and Calandra, and their ""destiny""I won't really spoil anyone reading this but one of the main bits of the story itself is actually revealed in the steam trading cards you get from the game.The combat is annoying at first. Like really. It takes a while to kill something, imagine getting swarmed while you still have the starting equipment. But it does get easier as you progress, though some skill combinations kind of break the game for me as it makes you near invincible. (Feint+Nova, Ice Lance+Mortal Blow. Plowed through hordes of enemies with it.)There isn't much variation between the weapons and armor that you get, most of them look similar to each other if not totally the same except for the stats that it has. There isn't really a class since you just tweak your skills to your liking.My Cairon was a fast talking, persuasive, lockpicking, trap disabling, spell throwing, sword slashing, medieval ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.I absolutely loved playing Demonicon and i'm seriously considering a few more playthroughs with different choices likeflirt with Girl A instead of Girl B or be a♥♥♥♥♥♥to NPC A instead of being a♥♥♥♥♥♥to NPC B, etc etc etc. You don't have to buy it at full price if you don't want to, i got this game in a bundle and i totally recommend getting it that way too if you're on the fence about buying the game. It is a must try experience.6.5/10			"

												I have only played about 6 hours or so, just about to beat chapter 1 (I think) and I am fully enjoying this game. The story is a bit jarring at first and can be hard to follow at times, but seems very well done. Combat flows well and your spells and skills are easy to manage. Graphics won't blow you away, but there is plenty to look at as well.There are a few bugs here and there, both graphical and gameplay wise, but nothing game breaking.I was able to get it for about $20 and at that price its a steal. I think I would even go full price if I had known about the game earlier.If you like story-driven, fairly linear RPGs, check this out, you won't regret it.			"

												Ok here's the deal, I seriously gave the game a shot because I really like the Black Eye series. I played through the whole game and it has some serious issues. The fight system is kind of slow but acceptable, once you understand the skill system the game gets incredible easy, the story is atrocious and and while you get to make decisions which alter the game ending your character always comes off as a major ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. The voice acting isn't good and takes a lot of atmosphere away. The game is only 2 years old and really looks bad even on the highest settings, remember this is a 40 € title. If you get this in a bundle you can have some fun with it, but if you buy this full price I'll guarantee that you will be disappointed.			"

												Ok, I played through it as for when you begin forming your character one can hardly stop who is into RPGs. It's easy to pick on talents and they all make sense at various points of the game. The story turned out great after a very sceptical start, just try to read and listen to all there is - I left no stone unturned and had no difficulties or got stucked. The graphics remind me of something between Gothic and Risen - not the best, but in my opinion RPGs don't need this, since the atmosphere is typically ""Black Eye"". Side-quests and Missions are easy and most of the time you have to go to ""A"", kill ""B"" and deliver ""C"" to ""D"" but always fair balanced at your point of state. The main-quest may be played different, at some points of the game you are asked to make final decisions which result in continuation and/or various endings, which I couldn't really prove as the game doesn't allow you to save your success, it saves automatically. First I thought this would be a disadvantage but this rule turned out most realistic to me and you may play the game again, choosing another way, very interesting. Overall: A solid RPG with hardly no bugs, an interesting story with many turns and more than 12 hours to play, if you read, play and listen to the whole story. A must have for RPG players, pure action-fans should pass this title.			"

												Have you ever wanted to bang your sister? Have you ever wanted to have sick demon powers?If your answer to any of those questions is ""yes"" then this game is for you!Demonicon is a diamond in the rough. It is made by a studio that has ideas and to be honest they are quite competent. Sadly they lack one ingredient: Money.It's rough around the edges for sure, but the game has an undeniable charm and is very adept as an RPG (comparable in many areas to that of The Witcher 1)A Personal score would have to be: 7/10 - well worth the money and solid game overall.

												The default controls are terrible with kb+mouse and dodge and parry don't seem to actually do anything. Aside from this combat is (at least at the start) a case of just mashing whatever button you have assigned to attack since LMB and RMB are not changeable from their default other than to switch the two. In addittion, the camera angles aren't exactly the best making it easy to get confused during movement in combat. It's a shame because the story and atmosphere otherwise seem reasonably good. Also if you are unfamilar with the Dark Eye universe then talent and attribute distribution will be bewildering. It would seem that this is one for fans of the setting only and, even then, there are caveats. If these issues alone are not enough to put off prospective players then you will quickly find the console-style autosaving frustrating and annoying. Forget about any notions of this being an RPG in the traditional sense for it is essentially a console ARPG - and, unlike Dragons Dogma and The Last Remnant, not a very good one at that. Those looking for a real RPG set in the Dark Eye universe would be far better off picking up the excellent Drakensang games.*edit* plus the game crashes my computer every time something alerts me on windows or I alt-tab out			"

												This game is pretty average....I am a big fan of rpg's and I really dont think it is worth the 40.00 price. I got this rather cheap however but was surprised to see how much it actually costs. The story is pretty interesting. I have been playing other Dark Eye related games and enjoy the lore quite a bit. The combat in this game takes forever though....ugh!!!!...I don't understand!!! I just want the guy to move faster and he doesnt so what would usually take ten mins in typical rpg combat is doubled in this game. I still would recommend this to anyone that enjoys rpgs or is just starting out. Great for a beginner. Helps pass the time. I enjoy the choice and consequence related aspect of this game similar to fallout 3 or dragon age series.  It is probably the only reason why I am still playing to see where the story goes in all of this. I just feel like there was a lot more the game devs could've done to polish this because it has real potential and falls short in a lot of areas.			"

												Well, any game that lets you start a romance with your sister in the first hour is an interesting one, innit?Demonicon is a hard game to review. It’s graphically‐subpar, sloppily‐told, questionably voice‐acted (though Calandra is voiced by Alix Wilton Regan, of all people—the brilliant voice actress for Samantha Traynor from Mass Effect 3 and the British female voice for the Inquisitor from Dragon Age: Inquisition—making her an incredible high point any time she’s on screen), and altogether one of the roughest 3D RPGs ever released. Considering the reused environments, dark high fantasy setting, and focus on telling a story about siblings and dark family legacies, it bears strong resemblence to Dragon Age 2 if the latter was made in half the time with a quarter of the budget. And none of this even begins to cover the combat system.At the same time, though, it’s simply charming. It is, in a very real way, the closest thing to a WRPG version of an actual tabletop game I’ve ever played, as GM’d by someone whose excitement outpaces their inexperience. I enjoyed the moral decisions, many of the characters (it’s a crime Calandra only gets about a quarter of the game’s screentime, as she’s more interesting than her brother by orders of magnitude), the ambition presented in the development, and simply the fact that the developer was clearly putting their heart and soul into making it. I enjoyed my time with it all the way up until the sadly too‐predictable, too‐dark ending, and even that managed to be sweet in its own right.Ultimately, it’s worth playing for fans of WRPGs. It only lasts 14–16 hours, with no real way to make the experience longer or shorter than that, so it’s no large commitment, and it’s a novel experience that managed to keep me engaged until the end.

												I was born from the depths of the demon realm, fought monsters, demons, warriors and even my own kin to build my powers and seek the truth of my existence.  Along the way I chose which people I would help, what alliances I would form, who I would trust and whom I would betray via conversation trees and my actions throughout my story.  With every monster I killed I became more powerful by upgrading my skills, abilities and magic.  What powers I upgraded determined how I interacted with the medieval style fantasy world I existed in.  Upgrade my healing abilities and not only did potions work better on me but I was able to heal others on my journey.  Upgrade my plant knowledge and more potions became available to me to be crafted, for healing, buffing and to poison my enemy.  I was able to choose which magical attacks would best fit my play style and upgrade them accordingly to wreak havoc on my foes and seek vengeance, love, sex or various truths of the day.  Demonicon was an above average action RPG overall.  It did everything an RPG is supposed to do well enough and has lots of flexibility in character creation, an enjoyable story that you get to sway here and there with meaningful choices, and solid if unspectacular graphics and voice work. I really enjoyed Demonicon more than most RPG’s I have played, the “Dark Eye” universe was new to me and I enjoyed exploring it and the character development choices and powers really made me feel like I was evolving into a demonic weapon, very satisfying experience and very underrated game.

												Was absolutely loving this game until the last chapter. It seems to be a common problem with Risen/The Dark Eye series/Two Worlds, the games start out so strong and promising but eventually lose steam halfway through and slump towards the credits.Ofc with all three of those franchises the combat is imo fantastic but the quality of the narrative really needs some work in future titles.In Demonicon's case this was all the more painful as the story was excellent, the overall writing was of a high standard not seen in many big AAA titles.The game is comprised of five chapters and after chapter two I had the feeling that they had run out of time or budget, the areas of the game seemed to get smaller and smaller with less steps in the main quest line.That being said! Demonicon reminded me ALOT of Witcher 2 in the good way. Lots of story branches with choice/consequence. Meaningful in a world impacting way which leads to high replay value.The game tackles some controversial issues very early on  : Cannabilism, Incest, Necrophillia. A refeshing change from the more generic issues brought up in other titles.Character growth and progression - Again fantastic, you really feel Cairon growing stronger as the game progresses.Cairon at first glance appears a generic  hero, just shows how appearances can deceive, especially if you have a high skill in Charisma :)Some of the supporting characters were forgettable but Calandra, Father, Cassio were for me in particular very memorable. Well thought out and a good job done by the voice actors involved.Highly recommended. Its on sale alot as well for a disgusting 4-5 bucks. A steal believe me. "

												A great action-rpg that has interesting lore and investigates a moral grey area. The game uses a bioware style conversation wheel but improves upon the idea as none of the choices you are given are purely good or bad as each decision has a negative. The combat itself is not that good with just basic slashing and dodging. The magic system had lots of potential but in the end you only get to play with 4 different spells that can have their stats increased. You spend that vast majority of your time within the city of Warunk but do after a while get to visit a different location for a chapter ie a marsh. It took me approximately 18 hours to finish the game so it was a decent length and the areas you visit are very well crafted with lots of things to see.Definitely worth playing.			"

												Well then, where to begin... To begin with: this game is decent. It has solid combat mechanics and an easily maneuverable UI (Crafting, level up etc. etc.). Storyline, and the universe itself, is dark and unforgiving (think Witcher mixed with Dante's inferno), yet really cool.The only ""negative"" thing is  that the game promises the ""good/evil"" meter most games these days have, but when playing you'll experience a lot of ""grey zones"" AKA. No1 is without a dark scheme, and most people will betray you or slaughter you children. I, personally, don't find that to be a bad thing as it brings diversity and depth to the universe, but some people might be confused by the lack of linear gameplay.Overall, it's a game worth getting if you're into old-school RPG's with demons, white knights, cults and lush fantsy environments.7.5/10			"

												This is a great game, at least for the story. Yes it will crash from time to time or at least it did for me, but it was still worth at least one play through. The choices you are forced to make are difficult especially if you are trying to play as good a guy as you can.  Your choices do have visible effects to others around you.  The story is dark and twisted, but that gives it more of the appropriate atmosphere.  The gameplay itself isn't great, but at least it isn't bad. It's fairly easy to get used to and allow you to enjoy the storyline more.   While this may not be the best or longest game it is a decent length of play and has a reason to play a second time through if you want to see how the opposite choices change the game.			"

												I am in two minds about this game. To be honest, I was really looking forward to playing this game ...very excited about the idea of it and its background, but unfortunately it never seemed to amount to my over-all expections. The game play seems almost too simple, with not enough choice of weapons and unlocks or finds, upgrading does not seem to add any visible change or added power to weapons and the magic system was flat as well. The story line seemed to have interesting branches with some of the dialog quite surprising with its context and choices, but also slighty overblown and bored waiting to get back to gameplay. Sadley not the ARPG I expected. If I could compare it to anything, it would be Kingdoms of Amalur:The Reckoning, which to be honest , I really enjoyed and found to be alot better than this!( Personal Opinion)			"

												***** (of 5) Very good story with deep athmosphere, even it is very dark at times. Despite what you might hear, it's not a love affair between brother and sister. the graphics is great, especially the landscape. I also love the combat system and the way you can improve your abilities. Only downsides are, that you have to walk a bit far in between to get from one place to the other and that the potions are more or less useless except the healing potions. The enemies are developed quite good, so that you have to adapt to their way in order to beat them. All in all a really good game.			"

												A nice ambitious game, that wished to be many things; it does not exceed every expectations in any, but it still is quite enjoyable.For instance, its graphics appearence is outdated, and the fact that you cannot save whenever you want is extremely out of place in an RPG; however, the RPG component is not the only one - we should call it an action-RPG, with scarce focus on equip, with stats and abilities that are used and developed more like a hack-and-slash than a pure RPG and generally feel less important than your dodging abilities. Your character cannot be personalised, the story is quite linear, the world clearly has its lore, but you never get really sucked into it.All of this said, the story keeps you interested long enough, the style is challenging without being frustrating, and the Dark Eye's world has a lot of potential that has been scarcely exploited in games, so it feels like a breath of fresh air. If you can accept its limitations, it is a game you will enjoy.			"

												I play RPGs for the story. As long as the controls work and the premise isn't half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I'm happy. This is very much one of those. If you're looking for a game to blow you away with graphics, or let you roam the world endlessly, this is not the game for you. However, if you enjoy good story-telling and some fun gameplay to go with it, this is a good pit stop. The biggest claim to fame for this game is the DnD type feel. You're never much stronger than your enemies. You have ongoing side plots and decisions you make matter for the future. If you like DnD and RPGs, take this one for a spin. You won't regret it.Only 1 complaint: no fast travel and your movement speed is kinda slow out of combat. Near the end of the game there's a section where you'll ravel over the same area like, 7 times. Put on an audio book.... you'll be briskly jogging a lot.			"

												An excellent game and an absolute steal when it is almost always on sale. Heartily recommend to anyone who enjoyed the playthrough and style of the 1st witcher, with it's dark fantasy, nihilistic choices and adult, not teen pandering storyline. I hereby name it The Witcher 2.0.			"

												It's a solid ""B-movie"" quality action-RPG. Definitely rough around the edges and clearly a low budget production. There are some good ideas, some good choices and consequences, and the combat is fun for a few hours. I don't have any desire to finish the game at this stage though. The story and world doesn't feel that coheisve and combat is getting mighty repetitive. This isn't a hard no by any means. I would say people looking for a 3/5 linear action-RPG might enjoy it, but it's not a game anyone needs to play. For that reason, I'm going thumbs down.			"

												Lot's of lost potential. It is a dark fantasy, linear action RPG with small and not always believable levels. The translation of the complex attribute and talent system of The Dark Eye works well and the skills can be combined for fun battle combos. If you're not familiar with The Dark Eye universe, the story probably makes no sense at all, the (German) voice acting is lacking and the best parts are the storytelling 2D panels in between.Not an entirely bad game, but it could have been so much more.

												The controls are made for consoles and therefore pretty annoying to handle on PC. You can't use half your keyboard and only have 4 potions on shortcut at a time... yeah!The combat ist super easy and extremely boring. It's basically rolling around, spamming left click to beat someone to death and occasionally cast something. Even though I specialized my character into casting spells neither did I have the essence (mana) to cast a lot, it didn't really deal damage either. In the end I found the talent that made me practically an invincible killing machine... didn't get more exciting from there. On the plus side you can finally invest loads of points into non-combat perks and still beat the game. Generally the perks are way more important than passive stats anyway. New dialogue options, better gear, healing people, finding traps, picking locks etc.The story (the reason to play an RPG imho) is... not bad but not really good either. It's a typical ""save my love from a demon"" thing. The visual presentation is a little dull since the characters show little emotion in dialogues. What annoyed me the most was that the story went straight in a direction that was ""choose one of the optionsthat you don't want that screws over your character"" and finally you get blamed for taking decisions you didn't even take. Maybe some of those triggers were faulty. Made the end a lot worse, though.			"

												Demonicon... well, demonicon is the perfect example of a mediocore rpg game. It has a decent story, an avagare combat system, not-so-bad voice acting and so on... Everything about this game is avarage. The game is easy, but not too easy, and sometimes you will be wondering why on earth is there an invisible wall evertime you are in combat. The game itself resembles some of the stronger titles of the gerne like witcher, but it doesnt quite give off the feeling that they do. It is not a bad game, but it is not a great game either. 6/10, it is buyable if you enjoy rpgs and find it on sale.Pros - Decent story- No significant downsidesCons- Everything is avarage- Graphics may seem ugly to some- Combat is restrained			"

												I was hesitant at first to try the gameas it looked like every other fantasy RPG on the market; however, immediately it drew me in and had me making decisions that would impact the entirety of the game. More than once i've gotten frustrerated that the outcome wasn't what I wanted and been unable to load a previous save due to the autosave feature. By the end of the game I was pleasured; however it left me wanting more. I'm not saying the game in itself was disappointing, in fact, it was quite enjoyable; there just wasn't enough. It all built up to a climax that fizzled out like a drunken hookup. I greatly enjoyed the choices i had to make. i enjoyed the different paths that I had to take and the different people i had to betray to get there. I enjoyed using blood magic and throwing stars. I did NOT enjoy those stupid demon hounds that kept setting me on fire, but alas, i digress. There were lots of twists and turns that left me shocked. This is a game i recommend for those that like to have a different expereince with each playthrough.			"

												Stay away from this game. Its is absolutly awful. The combat is dull, the voice acting is as flat and lifeless as the world in which you play. I love RPG's, i enjoyed critical flops such as Two Worlds and Arcadia but cannot find a single thing to recommend from Demonicon. It tries to give the illusion your choices actually affect the world and story progression yet apart from a couple of cosmetic differences they really do not. Infact twice whilst playing the  choices i made seemed to be totally ignored and the dialogue made no sense.			"

												The major annoying thing I felt with this game is that it doesn't allow the player to save the progress manually. If you don't like a choice you just made in the game and so you load a previously (and automatically) saved game record, then you will need to go through what you have done since the previous save point all over again. Sometimes this means redoing everything you did in the past a couple of hours, especially if the choice you don't like is made at the end of a chapter.The in-game tutorial doesn't really teach you any useful tricks in a fight, and the enemy/monsters in the game do not progressively level up as your character. Therefore, in your first a few fights, you may feel it difficult to defeat the enemy/monsters without drinking a few potions. However, once you get a grasp of it, you may start to enjoy the fights.The equipment you can buy from the merchants usually is no match to those you get after a major (boss) fight. As such, the merchants in the game basically are places where you can dump the garbage which you pick up during your journey. In fact, as I can recall, I only purchased maybe 5 or 6 items from the merchants before I finished the game. From my point of view, the trading system in this game is useless.The combat skill and magic systems, on the other hand, are more interesting. The storyline is okay. The 3D engine runs smoothly on my computer. I have completed the game once already, but so far my computer has never hung up during playing. If the game is on a 50% or 75% off discount, I would suggest RPG lovers to try it.			"

												Just finished Demonicon.If you're a fan of story driven RPGs this is worth a look. There are a fair amount of twists and the story tends to stay fairly interesting throughout. There's a lot of choice and consequence throughout, though the ending is a let down in this aspect. It uses The Dark Eye rule system (like Drakensang and Blackguards) which tends to make character progression and building quite fun and rewarding. There's a handful of normal stats and skills and you get rewarded for making potions, opening locks, identifying lore, collecting plants etc. It's an ARPG due to the action combat, which I hate, by it's far from the worst implementation I've ever played. I never found combat to be overly clunky or difficult and the story was good enough for me to push through to the end. I did find that spell points to use for improving spells being rewarded based on spell usage during a fight to be a nice feature. There are some annoyances worth mentioning though. Demonicon does seem like a budget title (though with very solid writing). It isn't a long game, taking me about 10 hours to complete the entire game plus all the side quests I could find. Levels are fairly railroady and there's limited exploration (think Dragon Age 2). There's also a limited number of game areas and one dungeon gets reused 4 times for different quests. There's also semi limited itemization (this is no Baldur's Gate, but a fry cry from say Of Orcs and Men). It also uses an auto save feature rather than save anywhere which can be quite annoying.Overall I enjoyed most of the experience and would pick up another RPG by the developer.			"

												This is my first review, so don't expect anything technical.The game has a lot of potential, but if you're expecting an arpg with free roaming, free combat, then this game does not have it. Combat and the ability to gain 'AP' are limited to quest only; no level grinding here.I played the game before the first patch was released, so the game was quite buggy but playable. I was looking for a dark, mature storyline; found it here.The high point is the combat. It was quite fun. The unfortunate part is that you could not initialize combat on your own, but had to wait for the game to do it , which meant you were constantly placed in situations where you were outnumbered and surrounded; frustrating.I paid $49 for it. The fact that there was no free roaming and lack of exploration made it feel like I got ripped off. I would recommend this game if you can get it cheaper.			"

The sound is all-round acceptable and the skill system is novel and well balanced (you gain experience based on how much you use which abilities, not just the usual simple XP systems).			"

												I simply can't compel myself to carry on with this game. It's boring. That's all there is to it. There's nothing interesting about the game.No manual saving, poor optimisation, nonsensical mechanics, mind numbingly boring narrative, lifeless characters, and♥♥♥♥♥♥combat. I'm not even sure if God knows what's going on in this game, or the motivation behind why certain mechanics and systems exist as they do. Want to pull a lever to deactivate a trap? Prepare to waste a tonne of experience in smithing, for some odd reason. You can't do anything without investing ungodly amounts of experience into passive skill trees - the same experience which you also need to increase other attributes. It's not as if a single point of experience equals a single point in an attribute\skill, either. Nope! That would be too simple. You have to pour your experience into unintuitive gauges which, once filled up, increase your level in that skill. However, until you do fill up these gauges then you will see no change in those abilities.The combat involves nothing more than spamming the attack button. It claims you can dodge, parry, etc, but you can't. Well, not effectively, anyway. Try to dodge? Your bumbling protagonist only does so after getting hit by every enemy near him, and only after a painfully slow animation plays out. Want to parry? Only if the RNG gods decide you're worthy. What's the point of a parrying button if parrying itself doesn't always work, or the command to make it happen doesn't always appear? The characters and dialogue are probably the worst aspect of the game, though. It's like watching wooden mannequins in a soap opera. The dialogue feels unnatural and just plain tedious. For the first time in my life I was glad there was a way to skip through dialogue in an RPG. The terrible dialogue is made even worse by the poorly animated, badly designed, characters which spew out this crap. Unblinking eyes, stiff movement, and uninspired design simply add to the tediousness of the game. The main character neither looks, nor sounds, interesting. His face reminded me of those old Action Man figures.I wont talk about the graphics, because in my opinion they were pretty good. I've certainly seen worse. The game was kinda laggy, though. It's strange. The actual game wasn't lagging (button input and what not was fine) it just looked laggy.Some of the environments look quite nice, it's just a shame you're given no room to explore them. Everything exists along linear paths (and I do mean linear) with nothing of interest to break up the monotony. There were a few interactable points here and there, but it's just junk fluff which doesn't serve a purpose beyond simply existing. It rarely, if ever, plays a role in the events which happen in the game.The game does have some minor choice and consequences, but I'm really not sure if said consequences have any real effect beyond a few new bits of dialogue here and there. To be honest, I didn't have the will to find out.Now, I did enjoy the non-animated cutscenes in the game. Well, the few I've seen, anyway. It has that whole Dragon Age vibe, using nicely drawn images with a voice over. Oh! Did I mention that you can't manually save, either? You have to wait for checkpoints. No idea why this system even exists in an RPG, but it does, and should you decide to pick this game up you'll have to screw around with it. Enjoy.I don't recommend this game at all. It's nothing but a chore to play.			"

												I had this game on my wishlist for some time priot to purchasing it. Today I was thrilled to find it on sale, so I excitedly purchased it and could not wait to play it... I wasn't far along in the game before  becoming very frustrated. The combat system is terrible, I cannot for the life of me understand why a modern game is so hampered by such awful game mechanics. To compound the problem, the save system is appalling. I found myself dying way too easilly, then I'm stuck having to replay useless game time rather than simply being able to start where the battle begins. Initially I thought perhaps I was supposed to save the game manually - so  I went hunting for a fast save key.  But.\, of course,  the game, has automatic save. Why would a developer choose a game structure that would force you to replay and replay territory you've already been through only to be faced with clunky, frustrating combat?  To me, these two issues add up to a game that, in its present incarnation, is unenjoyable and aggravating. I'd like to say that for $40 a consumer deserves more, but... there's more to talk about. On to other issues  you should know about before buying it.  The game does not allow for ANY character customization whatsoever. Not even the choice of a name,  Oh, and if you planned on playing as the female protagonist, as I did, forget it. You start the game as the brother and have no choice about that. As a woman gamer, I prefer to play as a woman.. I will even skip a game that doesn't give me the option. Unless, like the Witcher, the game itself is good enough ot offset that glaring oversight.  It's 2014 - how hard can it be to give us that option? It never fails to shock me when developers don't get why women gamers feel this is important. Yup - it's my bad for assuming. I should never have seen the female character and assumed she was playable. I could not for the life of me figure out how to use the health potion - or to equip it. Why did this game have to be so complicated? And mana potions? I don't know if there were any. The point at which I gave up I was forced to fight lesser bad guys to obtain their ""essence"". Why did everything in this game feel like a struggle rather than entertainment?Perhaps the issue is me. Indeed,  I've been  spoiled by games like Elder Scrolls, Dragon Age. Mass Effect. However, I've been similarly spoiled by Indie games like Path to Exile. It's a shame really because this had the elements to be an excellent game.If they improved the combat system and incorporated a worksble save system, I could classify this as playable. The way it is right now, however, I'd call it a headache maker. Amd for goodness sake - it is certainly nowhere near worth $40!  "

												This is a roleplaying game about banging your sister before the villian does first, yes that's the main characters motivation. It's got standard fare stats, skills, and magic akin to other games in it's genre, unfortunately it's difficult at times to determine what to spend your skills on because most everything is unexplained.Thankfully you can button mash your way through combat without spending many or any of your skill points on fighting skills. This leads to the combat basically sucking, but well, it does the job.Animations are awkward and wooden, but the models and texturing are pretty well done. It feels like a budget game and I'd not recommend paying over 5 or 10 dollars for it. If you're unsure if you'll like it, wait for it to go on sale for a fiver, if you're a fan of the lore I'd say wait until it drops to 10.Overall generic budget fantasy rpg  game with enjoyable, but repetetive combat about taking your sisters virginity before some dude named Falk can.Do you let Falk get away with it or will you snatch your sisters snatch from his dastardly crotch for yourself.

												I really enjoyed this game. Its a decent story and the gameplay is about right (not too hard, not too easy). Its like a simplified version of the Witcher. It runs about 25 hours which is about right for me. There is very little replayability as you have just one character to play. Be sure to invest in special moves (big hit and roundhouse) and gifts (freeze, speed/shield) as those are essential for bosses and the more difficult monsters. The normal hacking is only good for weaker monsters. You should also spend AP points on attributes such as Strength and Courage as well (and some vitality) but don't put too much into talents as they are pretty useless generally (except for medicine which is useful for recovery). Dodging was useful in this game but parrying was pretty useless so you can forget about the Agility attribute. All in all, I recommend it strongly.			"

												Action-RPG done right.Usually the term action-rpg just means ""action"", but every now and again a developer gets it right. Demonicon may be a bit rough around the edges, particularly regarding dialog continuity and the occasional frustrating camera angle, but the core gameplay is a spot on mixture of live action combat and rewarding character progression. Real time hack-n-slash that also gives a moderate amount of actual character customization, with upgrade paths not just for spells and combat moves, but general stats, haggling, crafting, perception checks, lock picking, and more. Plus, each zone allows for some freedom of exploration rather than forcing you down the linear path right away. Combine this with a decent story, and the game actually feels like it is taking the RPG half of ""action-RPG"" seriously.If you liked The Witcher II, you will like Demonicon.The game is a bit short though where the campaign should take around 20 hours, so try and get it on sale.

												I tend to personally emphasize distinct character and originality of writing in my gaming immersion, even if game-play and user inter-face are of course far from irrelevant. Push comes to shove, I'd still take something bit flawed and interesting; than mechanically perfect but bland.What I like about Demonicon is that you get a sense of a greater gameworld, lore and back-story, this being part of ""Dark Eye"" franchise not primarily published for PC. (Drakensang would be the other title I'm aware of)Combat is not excessively tactical, but I was not bored, and found the levelling up and skills system fairly satisfying.The story premise is interesting, and the voice acting was particularly excellent for a title that probably did not have enorous budget: recognize and like both lead actors a lot. Special thumbs up for making my in-game dad so insufferably illogical in his little schemes, and allowing reasonable amount of back-talk to the old geezer!I think this title is worth a try for RPG fans whom do not mind action -RPG combat but enjoy a back-story.

												Demonicon is an action adventure set in the Dark Eye world. You play Cairon, a man who only wants to protect his sister and keep his family safe. However, fate has a different destiny in store for him. The story starts out simple enough. You are out on a quest to rescue your sister, who was kidnapped by a cannibal. You’re immediately thrust into a dark mountain cave fighting demons and unnatural beasts.Demonicon boasts a robust story filled with tales of heroism, forbidden love, and lust for power. As you travel the desolate lands of Aventuria you’ll meet many people, fight wars, uncover the cause of a plague and make choices that affect the population. All those things are thrust upon your shoulders like all good heroes. Even though the story overall ends up being a bit clique I enjoyed it. The characters that make up the town of Warunk and the surrounding areas are full of personalities uniquely different from each other and do their part to help or hinder your adventure.Choice also plays a major role in this game. You’re presented with tough decisions fairly frequently, the first within an hour into the story. No matter what you choose there seems to always be those who are unhappy with your decision and others who will praise you for it. But the nice thing about Cairon’s journey is he can be as fickle as he wants. The only constant being his desire to save his sister / lover. And for those who are off put by the prospect of a brother and sister love interest rest assured the game doesn’t go that path for long. So don’t let that deter your curiosity.The graphics are excellent. Even though this is a fairly linear game it boasts an array of beautifully rendered environments from dank caves and dark swamps to regal temples and monasteries. Controls are simple enough as you wield both magic and melee attacks. I found myself using magic a lot more than melee. I was kind of marginally aware of the melee powers until after a quarter of the game in. You battle enemies just about anywhere, from wide open temple spaces to cramped basements. It helped that you have full control over the camera. This is definitely a game where I think playing with a controller gives you a bit of an advantage.I also enjoyed the stat boosting attributes. You could increase your attack, magic and battle parameters but other skills such as lock picking or ‘fast talking’ gave you a leg up in situations outside of battle. They also provided extra knowledge of the situations you found yourself in or unlock additional conversation rewards. So the social aspect is just as important as the fighting.Overall the graphics and characters create a great atmosphere that draws you into the story. Accompanied by a soundtrack that compliments the areas you explore for an enjoyable experience. Decent game length and plenty to do. It’s no Skyrim but if you’re into fantasy games this will not disappoint.			"

												Would I recommend this game?  If this is a yes or no question then:  Yes.  But honestly it's not a great game, let alone RPG.The game is mostly a guilty pleasure, it's not really a fantastic game.  It's a competant 3rd person RPG with some pretty awful combat mechanics and animations.  Enemies can juggle you in combat, they will cheese you and you'll find yourself dying more out of poor mechanics then being outwitted or outplayed.  The story is almost incomprehensible at times and honestly too much - I ended up skipping/skimming dialogue towards the 2nd half of the game.  For an RPG there isnt much character development; you invest XP earned in skills and magic.  It becomes very easy to know which skills to use at the beginning and to only upgrade them.  Throughout the game you're presented with dialogue choices with NPCs as you complete quests, you are given a black or white decision to pick.  The problem is that these decisions never impact the game in anyway, some just open or close quests that may occur.  The gameworld does not change, any meaningful change occurs after the credits roll or when the narrator tells you of your actions consequences for the future.  I would even say that the overal plot was pretty bland, though I do appreciate what they tried to do - just the execution was poor.One of the worst things about the game is the lack of saving.  There are no manual saves, instead the game opts for checkpoints only at specific points of the game.  It's agravating entering into a new zone, picking up a few quests and killing a few mobs just to enter a house and have a trap instantly kill you.  Loading the checkpoint brings you back 10-15 minutes prior having you kill those mobs and talk to those NPCs all over again.Another poor aspect is the inventory system, and the world economy.  You'll end up getting really good gear quickly and you keep looting what is quite frankly junk.  The worlds merchants simply do not have anything to offer you or the coin to take your stuff.  You end up having to buy junk you may need, such as ingredients for potions, just to sell your junk.  This is compounded by not having a weight limit for your inventory, your inventory ends up having pages and pages of items and its nigh impossible to find anything you need.  Also crafting is pretty awful, even when maxed there are only 3 ""healing potions"" you can make - where one is honestly the only one you'll be using.  To make them you'll need to appropriate materials but they are finite in the world.  Gear crafting is similarly poor, you insert upgrades into your gear but you cannot remove the upgrades so you're constantly ditching and rebuying your gear if you want to upgrade.If I had to rate the game I'd give it a 3/5, I dont see myself playing it again for awhile.  It has two endings, but both can be obtained at the very end without any previous choices influencing your options.  I did most if not all sidequests, about 19 hours.  If I had listened to every single NPC proddle on about their drama it would be about 20-21 hours.  Beat the game on normal - it's not a hard game, as with all RPGs it gets easier as you play it and level.			"

												Demonicon is a third person rpg that mostly takes place in one town and it's surrounding areas. There is a bit of freedom to explore, collect plants and attempt to pick the locks of chests scattered about. The world itself is quite gritty touching on subjects such as incest, cannibalism, a seemingly incurable plague sweeping the already starving refugee camp and more. It's not all doom and gloom though, there are times in which the game can leave you grinning. One of the best aspects of the game is the decisions you will be making, there is no good or evil, you just have to pick whichever seems like the lesser evil and hope what you did was the more justifiable action. Another surprising aspect of the game is that some villains you can really sympathize with and are saddened when you are forced to come to blows.Which brings me to the combat. It is like Fable but somehow worse. You can dodge, parry and use magic along with swinging your weapon but it just feels very flimsy. Especially when you use any weapon that is not a sword, the range of it will be insanely low and half the time doesn't connect. There is a combo system that grants you more mana and a higher chance for critical damage the higher it goes and it is the only way to regain mana.  Unfortunately there are only four spells in this game and none are particularly interesting.  The way you upgrade in this games are through combat/missions and will be rewarded points for the skills you've used be it magic or melee. The noncombat skills like fast talking and plant lore use the same points as combat which I found to be a nice way of making you decide which you should upgrade first. Not much to say about the graphics, they are serviceable. The environments look okay, cities are worn down, refugee camps look absolutely miserable and swamps have a certain air of dread. There are not really any memorable places you go to, they all seem to blend together minus the swamps. Character models are fine but the animation for walking and fighting feel off. The sick people do truly look like they are on the verge of death with some grossly irradiated skin that looks like fire wounds. The enemy variety is good and enemies differ from area to area.The story Demonicon is trying to tell is interesting enough to play till the end but it can end up being quite comical at times due to subpar voice acting. I enjoyed the music, it was epic when need be and pretty catchy during strolls through town. The NPCs spout the same dialogue each time you pass by which can be pretty annoying hearing the same guy trying to unsuccessfully seduce a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ since the start of the game. One of the games biggest problems is the lack of manual saving, imagine finding all of the hidden loot, assigning some of your points to your skills, bartering with merchants and the game crashing before you reached the checkpoint erasing all of that progress. It makes it feel much more linear than it should be.Overall Demonicon is an ambitious low budget game that feels rough around the edges. It took me a bit over 15 hours to complete but I didn't do any sidequests. In my opinion this isn't really a must have title but it is enjoyable for those wanting a decent story full of decisions to make. I wouldn't recommend for those seeking fun gameplay, a fun world to explore or good character development. It is a game whose strength is in it's story not the adventure. I give a sideways thumb :p			"

												Interesting enough RPG; very similar to the first Dragon Age.VERY complicated skill system; points are earned from defeating enemies, completing quests or solving skill challenges.  Using magic during fights converts some of the earned points in to ""gift points"" that can be exclusively spent upgrading magic abilities. The remainder of points can be spent on combat special abilities, skills (up to rank 5 of 7), stats that improve 2 skills, or stats that effect your combat capabilities.  Investing in skills early is a sure way to earn ongoing dividends throughout the game.Story was... interesting.  Well crafted universe with plenty of detailed back story, however the game does expect that you the player will memorize it.  Just learned a complex, multi-sentence incantation? Better hope you remember it precisely when it comes time to enter it because the game provides no ""your character knows this, so click here for the correct option"" which is a bit jarring given the ""follow the blinking quest marker to the hidden clues"" hand-holding presented at various points.Largest complaint: No manual saves. I understand that this is intended to actually invest you in the choices you makein the context of the Role Playing aspect by removing the ability to trivially alter your choices, but it can also be somewhat obnoxious when exploring large areas to have to find the next thing that triggers a save point.  Luckily the game saves after every fight and provides enough 3-6 minion skirmishes at various points that you're never terribly far away from a save point.			"

												Playing this game is like watching the storyboard of a film that you can see will be good when it is done. Hopefully there will be a sequel that will be suitably polished. Gameplay wise, combat is essentially a modded version of the Witcher 2. The storyline is engaging although at some points it borrows heavily from other stories.... cough cough, Highlander. My one major problem with the game is that the choices that you make don't have an effect on the game. Demonicon is satisfying to play through but I would wait for it to be on sale, $10.00 would be a reasonable price for this game.			"

												This game was amazing. Not perfect, but not the trash a lot of the reviews try to make it out to be. I'll make a Pros and Cons list and try to be as honest as possible with this review.PROS:-Very in-depth and immersive story-line. Very well thought out and it will hold your attention from beginning to end. -The dialogue is perfect. From the serious encounters, to how people act during the Dragon Age style questioning for information, to the comedic relief. I find it amazing how in the most serious and despair-filled sections, this game can still make me laugh my♥♥♥♥♥off while staying completely appropriate to the situation at hand.-The voice acting is just wonderful. Really backs up the already awesome story-line and dialogue.-The fighting is no spam-clicker. You don't just press one button to win. The combat is about combining fighting abilities with magical powers with dodging with parrying with hack-and-slash combo chaining- while leaving out button mashing by making the chaining work in a rather unique way. (You wait to swing til after your first swing is done, otherwise the chain breaks) I really love the combat in this game. It's very good at making you feel like a badass as you slaughter a horde of 50+ bandits or 20+ thick-skinned lizard wolves that are spitting poison at you. The difficulty in combat doesn't even exactly scale. It's very much skill-based, bosses are always harder of course, but it's not like you go from one area to the next and suddenly the enemies there apparently know how to fight 40x better. Very realistic in that manner.-The graphics are pretty darn good even for today. It's no Witcher 3, but it's still good.-The sounds in this game really help create the setting. From the very beginning of the game you will easily notice what an astounding job they did creating the sounds for the game.-The music helps set the mood always at the right moment. Get in a fight? The badass music kicks in. Running around collecting plants? Nice peaceful music to accompany.-Very detailed skill customization system based on AP you can put into fighting skills, attributes, and story-opening abilities like fast-talk (persuasion), Locksmithing, and Legend Lore (Really comes in handy in some convos.)-Pretty darn good crafting system for the enchanting/poisoning/upgrading of your items as well as crafting potions and poisons to give you an edge in battle.-A magical skill system where you earn GP (Gift Points) that you may spend on upgrading your current spells, or unlocking new ones, from four different categories.-Very appealing set of characters. I have not met one character in this game that I considered to be ""bland"" that I would not remember if i thought back on this game. They're all very memorable and very well thought out.-Replay-ability value. The game's story progresses with the choices you make, so you can always give the game a second shot and pick the choices you didn't the first time and experience a very different game.-Length of the game. 9 hours into the game I was so amazed I was still on chapter 1 (out of 5 chapters). This game gives you a very in-depth and lengthy experience for the money you pay.CONS:-The engine is not very compatible with AMD-based equipment. I occasionally get some randomly screen flickering, tearing, and sometimes the graphics become hazy/messed up.-Not multi-GPU compatible. If you run multi-GPU with this game you receive a lot of stuttering, making it impossible to play. (This may only be with AMD Crossfire however.)-You cannot save the game. You need to rely on autosaves. The game does save at all the right moments (almost) and holds on to enough saves in case you'd like to go back however.-Lack of free roam. You run into invisible walls all the time, breaking immersion.-Lack of free roam x2. You cannot re-visit old areas at whim (say if you want to pick up something you missed or talk to an old character.) You can only move areas when the story allows it. So make sure you know what doors you're going through and make sure you get everything you need before you move onto the next area.FINAL VERDICT: I give this game a solid 8.5/10. This is a really good game, definitely worth picking up. It's not perfect by any means and there's definitely some RPGs that could out-due this one and many more coming out. But this game is definitely worth the money, full price or on sale, and I'd definitely recommend getting it.			"

												This is a really fun game. I'm not even sure what else I can say about it I've enjoyed the game and will continue to do so until I beat it. It's worth playing for sure.~Edit~Having just beat the game, On normal mode I can honestly say this is a game worth playing. Choices between right and wrong, good and evil, will change the story, A very strange and different kind of story line. Reply ability without a doubt. I highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys RPG's such as Dragon Age, Mass Effect and so on. The game is just filled with story plots and twist, side quest and more. Build your character how you would see it being and see the difference between a solidly build warrior and a carefully crafted mage. It really was a lot of fun. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.Good luck.			"

												This game is very entertaining if you take it without any prior experiences with adventure RPGs in mind. It feels as if your stuck in a closed storyline with the illusion of choice always present. However the game turns this into a positive towards the end, and builds you up into making careful yet definitive decisions that influence each summary of the type of person and world you are creating for the future. The mechanics weren't the best, a bit clunky for sure. However the storyline is rich in real life problems saturated with just the right amount of demonic lore to keep you wondering why America is not voting Bernie Sanders.			"

Although I myself am a mediocre guy so for some reason, I liked this game.It was nice to go back to the Dark Eye universe,back to Aventuria.Still longing for a proper Drakensang game.I can recommend this game to those who have no high expectations,and can lower it a bit...to that mediocre level to be precise. This ARPG can deliver some fine playing hours,it has some good moments. It was OK for me. Giving it a mediocre thumbs up. :)			"

												I've seen a fair amount of negativity surrounding Demonicon since its release - which is what has kept me away from the game until a recent sale. Having just beaten the game this morning, I feel very comfortable recommending this game to RPG fans, or anyone looking for a unique and enjoyable story.Demonicon's strengths lie in its commendable use of The Dark Eye universe, it's RPG & skill systems, the creative and thoroughly engaging story line, the focus on narrative and characters, and a well implemented choice system that affects the story and game world.The Dark Eye ruleset may not be represented to the degree that you see in Drakensang, but Demonicon's skills, spells and combat abilities are very well implemented. Its a joy to play a game that puts such high focus on character skills, such as Perception, Fast Talk, Lock Picking, etc. I highly recommend focusing on skills and spells (and less so on combat abilities) if you play the game. I also do recommend playing the game on Hard, as it is quite easy.Cairon's tale may not come across as truly unique in the first half of the game, but those who play all the way through to the end will enjoy a well paced and fairly well written tale that delves into Barboradianism. I've played a lot of RPGs, and I will always remember Demonicon's story - it is the game's standout feature. I really don't want to touch on the story line much, as I feel it is best for the player to delve into it with as few preconceived notions as possible. Suffice it to say that the plot synopsises and game descriptions do not give it justice. Demonicon places a lot of focus on character interaction and player choice. You will spend a siginificant amount of time in conversations with other characters, and in several points throughout the game what you say and decide will affect the game world, the characters and the story. The interplay of the strong, unusual story with the choice system that allows the player to shape how it develops and ends is quite gripping.Cairon may come across as a stale lead with poor attitude, but he develops well across the story, and I ended up being quite fond of him by the end of the game. He also has the distinction (late game) of wearing what is easily one of the coolest sets of armor I have ever seen. I was constantly taking screenshots of Cairon in his end game gear - it is exceedingly creative and morbid.Another factor that helps to amplify the impact and appeal of Demonicon's tale is the well realized game world. The graphics may be dated, but the locations throughout the game are distinctively bleak. Demonicon possesses its own imaginative, sepulchral take on The Dark Eye universe that extends from impressive locations, atmosphere, mood and detail to outright kooky and disturbing events and supporting characters. There is a heavy fixation on the undead, necromancy, demons, suffering, plague, prostitution, and damnation - and I believe it was handled in a way that elevated Demonicon into something quite unique among RPGS.I believe you play Demonicon for the kooky and imaginatively morbid storyline, the immersive game world, and the well designed choice & rpg systems. These are all wrapped up in dated graphics and sloppy combat - but I find most old school rpg players are quite accustomed to that by now;  the graphics and gameplay fit like an old shirt that brings back memories.

												I really wanted to enjoy this, but I can't. It's just not what it could be. This feels like the witcher 2, with less of a budget and less polish. It has the makings of a good game, interesting mechanics, not the worst story line thus far, could have been pretty cool, but the animations are stiff. The voice acting is mediocre at best. The combat is slow, clunky, and quite literally impossible not to take some damage somewhere from BS. If it had  CDProjektRed's budget, this could have been a really good witcher 2 knock off, in a good way. As is, it's an unpolished clone. If you've played witcher 2 and know what to expect from that sort of game, and still have interest after this review, pick it up on a sale. Otherwise.. just stick to the witcher, or dragon age. This is just a lower budget version of those games at this point. I'm not gonna pick on the devs for having a low budget, I honestly just feel bad for them. If they had a chance to really flesh out this game, it could've been a hit, really. Ah, and, as for bugs and such, i didn't experience any, though i didn't play for very long.			"

												I cannot recommend this game because it is heavily decision based, yet does not allow MANUAL SAVING. That's right; in this day and age you cannot choose when to save and quit at your own discretion. Not only that, but the game itself is only mediocre... it could definitely be enjoyable, but not when you explore and entire level only to instantly die from triggering a trap. Accidently proceed to a boss before finishing the dungeon? Too bad, your save is gone and you can't go back (unless you don't mind redoing the entire current instance, if it saved).Oh, and there's the whole incest plot line that starts really early on.Game is worth 15.00 max, if you like the genre.

The Dark Eye Demonicon – the German RPG based on a popular board role-playing game which long time frightens us by the emergence. Developers from Noumena Studios promised much that interesting. I held the breath…As you already likely guessed history, events in game take place in the Universe of The Dark Eye. There isn't a lot of games on the Universe, generally it is the projects focused on old audience of gamers to which give the deep I will give a ride, a heap of dialogues... The Demonicon project the company of developers constantly had difficulties. The project of 10 times was on the verge of life and death. Some years later, at last it appeared. With a sinking heart I started it. Let's look...The history narrates about destiny of the brother and sister, their lives appeared in whirlpool of terrible events. Plague presses people, darkness, necromancers zapolonyat the lands which are once belonging to elves, gnomes & people. The young soldier his sister the warrior, try to obtain citizenship in the last big city of people.The plot of the game The Dark Eye Demonicon not the most original, but here at least is available an intrigue. (I love such things)Their father didn't think up anything better, than to give out the daughter for one grandee who had to provide them accommodation. The sister doesn't want under a wreath. Her brother tries to bring to reason the sister, but she starts having to him absolutely other feelings. The history twists, the sister of the main character is kidnapped by one witch the Elf who speaks about a terrible event.Spoiler! We learn that they not the brother and the sister, not relatives. They are given rise in the temple, in certain incubators where allocated them with special force and named ""Awakened"". In total such people seven to make a prophecy they have to meet in fight where only one will survive. And he will also become the only paladin who will become at the head of the church granting to people the world and rest. The main character tries to find answers in attempts to remove this damnation and the beloved. When it finds it, the damnation already finally captured soul of the girl and for her rescue the main character goes to other world. But the prophecy says, there will be one. one of lovers endows himself to seal angrily foreverGameplayThe Dark Eye Demonicon not absolutely classical RPG, It isn't similar not the last game on this Universe of Drakensang at all: The Dark Eye. In it the hero's choice isn't provided to players, it is impossible to choose neither a hairdress, nor a floor, even there is no accurate specialization on which usually divide players into classes. (Soldier, magician, scout). You are given one character, and here it can already be developed in due form role-playing games. The fighting system is also exotic, you can't get just like that the weapon and beat it anywhere. It is possible to use it only in fight and only on strictly taken away sites and only on certain objects. In addition game in was guided by consoles.To a huge regret of an open and free world in game won't be. Everything in it is presented 5 heads, in each of which the player will be able to investigate on some game locations. And very modest by the size. To return to initial locations, on end of the head most often it is impossible, game at once warns about it the small message. Something like it was in the Lord of the Rings: War in the north.Role systemAs I already spoke, only one character is presented to The Dark Eye Demonicon. It has own set of initial characteristics which can be improved further. Role system not difficult, it classical. In it the system of distribution of points of experience, as well as in recent Blackguards is used. That is the player receives (Points of adventures) for which the main (basic) and minor skills, and also receptions are pumped over. No levels are present. Further you will receive points on fighting magic. Of course to giants, role-playing games to it not to reach. The same TES, oblivion which left in 2006 has much more flexible system of development of the character. Interesting feature of this system is the general indicator of experience on all skills. the player should learn to observe balance, but not to develop blow force. The hero, of course will be strong, but as a rule for the rest (a potion cooking, charisma and dialogues, ability to find hiding places and traps), he will be full zero and consequently won't see good ammunition and the weapon.Fighting systemThe Dark Eye Demonicon we will be only in certain situations. It is impossible to bare the weapon just like that. After fight you is started, it is possible to tell, you appear on a certain arena (and locked) to leave which it is impossible. No combinations of blows are present. You simply press on the attack button, the character skillfully swings a sword, being automatically arranged under enemies. Blows magic also pass under a car. Fighting skills are applied due to endurance and also caused with the machine gun. The even strengthened blow, game on the opponent. At the beginning, enemies can be killed with simple attack, and here already in the middle fighting skills, blocks and evasion will be necessary for you. System of fight simple, but very interesting. The further you go, the will be more interesting and more intense than battle with the enemy. It can be written down safely in game pluses.Stock, weaponThe main character has a bottomless bag in which he can put everything found on world open spaces. In total there are five tabs.The weapon which - is pricking, cutting and which is splitting up the weapon. And also modifications and improvements to it. Armor – protective ammunition including improvements. Jewelry – all rings and necklaces which the hero can wear. Ingredients and potions – herbs, powders, health potions, and also poisons. The junk and subjects – unnecessary subjects which can only be sold, and also  aren't on sale). The quantity of types of weapon, armor, potions in game isn't enough. Even at detailed studying of game and full passing, is problematic to count even five sets protective an armor or more than 10 types of weapon. Graphicsthe graphics of The Dark Eye Demonicon at a low level, First of all hurts the eyes terrible animation. All characters and enemies as dolls, everyone has on two-three positions in which they talk. These hands crossed on a breast simply kill! Secondly, specification of textures the very low. Has a cheap appearance. In total on the screen it is so unnatural as game came out at the end of 2013.Further, completely there is no physical model. The environment absolutely not online, everything statically and looks horror as it is unpleasant. Corpses right there disappear. I was surprised by scenery, they very saturated. Sometimes simply you stop to look round. All these underground landscapes with the shining mushrooms, halls of churches and locks, beauty … Dynamic lighting perfectly draws in detail accurate shadows, SAO.Conclusion: The The Dark Eye Demonicon project is technically weak developers promised the best execution. It is possible to tell even it absolutely other game. And despite all shortcomings, I passed it with pleasure. This graphic marriage didn't prevent me to take pleasure in remarkable history. (only the history forces to pass game)I give - 4\10

												This isn't as bad as everyone makes out, okay, so it has the feel of a console game, but it plays well enough, there's enough choices to make along the way, the combat is simplistic, but better than many games i've played.  I waited years to try Drakensang as I had read some negative reviews, then i finally got it and loved it.  And Demonicon has a similar feel to Drakensang.			"

												Surprisingly good. Picked this game up knowing nothing about it and was impressed. You need to give it an hour or so to really get into it but once you're in it's a really underappreciated gem. Very reminiscent of The Witcher and The WItcher 2 with hints of Dragon Age so if you like those games it's a definite buy.			"

												This is a good game. I bought it on special and played it for 1 week, few hours a night. Firstly, I would ignore people complaining about choppy graphics on their useless video cards. Play it on something decent, I have an i7-4790, 32gb RAM and a GTX980ti, no problems at all. Combat is great, you can add your 4 favourite strikes Magic/Combat or a combination of them all. Timing is important. You cannot just mash the buttons and hope for the best. Dive, roll away, throw a ninja star and follow up with an ice lance then a Mighty Strike while your opponent is frozen. I really liked the decisions in this game, everything you do has a consequence, do you save 6 people or let a killer go free? I am surprised they havent been sued by the people who made Highlander but I wont say anymore, you will need to buy the game to figure that one out.			"

												It's a real time, third person, action role playing game. You control one character throughout the game.IMO it's not a classic, but it's just as good or better than Dragon Age 2 in terms of creating a believable fantasy setting. There are a lot of missed opportunities from the developers, but it appears to me that it was due to a limited budget, rather than ill intentions. You can spot a lot of love for the fantasy genre if you read between the lines as you play.The combat starts out being rather boring, but it gets a lot better after you acquire some new abilities. At the end of the day, I'd give it a high 6 out of 10, quite close to a 7. I'm surprised it seems to have a small fanbase, as it's far from being a bad game. If you can get it for anything below $20, I'd say it's worth it.It's a shame they didn't put more work into making looting feel better. It just feels anticlimactic to disarm a max level trap to reach a chest that only contains some healing potions. Your gear hardly changes appearance until at the end of the game.It took me 21 hours to complete and I generally had a good time.			"

												I launched the game, changed the graphics settings, and it crashed. I had to do it again. Waste of time. Then in the boss fight with the cannibal, he froze at 25% health and I could not inflict any damage on him. Game-breaking bug and supreme waste of time fighting for something I could not fix. I could relaunch the game and try again to see if he will not freeze, but the game is clearly unstable and not worth its full price. I do not want to play only to encounter more errors along the game.I got this game in a bundle, and even then, it is not a good idea. The animations are wonky (they cut suddenly from one dialogue to another) aside the instability. One can buy Dragon Age (for the animations) or Shadow of Mordor (for the hit streak system) with a discount and pay a similarly low price for a much better experience.			"

												Not a half bad game. Sure it lacks a little on the freedom of choice and while that's a big sticking point for me it's also got some things that I do like. It's sort of like an RPG and the original Drackengaurd had a lovechild and this game was it. I'm not too crazy about it but it's not bad, so on a scale of one to ten this game rates about a 6 or a 7 of 10. Don't pass it over if you're broed and want to play, but don't go out of your way to get it either.			"

												Demonicon is a decent action RPG, unfortunately weighed down by some obvious flaws.The best part of Demonicon is the story. It starts off a bit slow, with the player character Cairon's sister Calandra being forced into an arranged marriage to a wealthy noble. But towards the end of the first chapter things get much more interesting as you learn about an ancient demonic ritual where seven children were given dark magic powers.Sadly the story is undermined a little by the dialogue, which is at times poorly written. Sometimes the dialogue choices don't flow like a natural conversation and several attempts at humour just end up being wierd. Voice acting is also low quality. Calandra is okay, but Cairon just sounds bored most of the time, and the supporting characters are poor.Combat is fast paced and can be entertaining, especially when you unlock a few abilities. Most of the time you are alone, controlling Cairon in 3rd person, against waves of between 6 and 10 enemies at a time. You have melee attacks with either blades or blunt weapons, special melee power attacks, throwing knives for ranged attacks and four magic spells - freeze (mainly used against a single target), fire (radial damage perfect for when surrounded by multiple enemies), speed/damage buff and poison (which I didn't try because I put all my points into upgrading the other three). Its like a lower quality version of the Witcher.There is some variety in enemies - Human rogues, mages and warriors, spiders, lizards, fire demons - enough to make me change up my tactics based on their weaknesses and abilities.The level up system is based on a German pen and paper ruleset called Dark Eye, which I've also seen in Drakensang. You don't gain levels as such, but every fight, quest and many non-combat actions gives ability points which can increase stats (strength, constitution, etc), melee power attacks, non-combat skills (crafting, lock picking, etc) and magic. You can spend the points at any time as long as you have enough. I like the system because it feels like there is alot of freedom to build Cairon to suit your playing style.Level design is mostly linear with some small side paths to find extra loot. There is more freedom during quests, many of which give the player a choice how to resolve. The save system is checkpoint only, but most of the time they are quite frequent. Controls are fully rebindable and work nicely with mouse and keyboard.There are some problems on the technical side. I sometimes noticed some stuttering while running around, and some slight framerate dips during combat. I also crashed to desktop twice on the crafting menu.Overall I think Demonicon would probably only appeal to dedicated RPG fans. If you can be in a forgiving mood and you've played all the better games, there is some enjoyment to find here. I finished the game in 16 hours, so I wouldn't recommend picking up at full price. I bought it for 75% off, which considering its flaws, seems like a fair price.			"

												Demonicon is an excellent 3rd person RPG game with some minor flaws. Its' strengths are it's story and in particular the dialogue that is very well written and in combination with excellent voice acting really draws you in. The choice system is also done excellently, where the decisions you make give you different cutscenes or dialogue interactions from start to finish. In addition, there is moral ambiguity to most of the decisions you make, meaning there are rarely black and white choices to be made. The music and ambient sound are also done superbly, and compliment the atmosphere quite well. Another well designed system is the character advancement and skills. Instead of experience points and levels, you are granted Adventure Points that can be spent at any time, on any specialization you choose, giving you a nice degree of customizability. Unfortunately, this clever design is marred somewhat by an endgame where most if not all of your skills will be maxed. The other drawbacks of the game are it's fairly uninspired combat. While the controls are easy to use, and there is fair variety of player attacks and combos, the enemies are not particularly varied or dynamic. Some acts will have you facing the same 3-4 types of mobs ad nasuem for a couple of hours before you face a new type. Although it improves as the game progresses, and the boss fights are relatively interesting, more variety would have been welcomed. Also in need of improvement are the environments that while stunning in their art design and relative size, are often mostly devoid of npcs. This leaves some areas feeling strangely barren and artificial. The most glaring failure of the game however, is the itemization. While the crafting system is well implemented and useful, the graphic design on weapons is very mundane. This is particularly strange for a high fantasy title featuring magic and demons, to have such low fantasy weapons for the majority of the game. The developers may have wanted to underscore the humble origins of the protagonist, but even then, the art direction was dull. I never felt particularly excited by any of the loot. This problem is further exacerbated by the fact that NPC vendors without exception sell the best gear, making loot drops and chest finds vendor trash. Despite these flaws, Demonicon is a triumph in storytelling and one of the best RPG games of 2014. For fans of the genre, this is a must buy.			"

												This was really a tough one.I wanted to like this game, i really did, i just could not bring myself recommend this game to anyone.The first major flaw which i found to be HUGE was the improper loading, crashing and glitching of the game. If i wanted to load the game sometimes i would have to start the launcher three seperate times, using task manager to close the unresponsive instances inbetween. MAJOR pain in the rear. To make matters worse, sometimes the game would just decide to crash, just randomly. The only saving grace there is that the saves are frequent................but..................The save file is singular, and by that i mean that any progress you make will overwrite your current save. That means if you screw up and pick the wrong choice, go into an area that advances the plot before finishing a side quest etc, you are stuck. The game will have overwritten with the furthest progress and you will have to start the game over to fix it. Not exactly something you like to see in an RPG were supposedly your decisions could effect how the story unfolds................but about that one................Your choices dont matter. You are given the illusion of control of the characters destiny. The only things that will chance are slightly different cut scenes and your fetch quests will be given by either faction A or faction B. It just felt weak.In terms of gameplay, there is some fun to be had there. The ice spells and the demon aura were quite good for stunning opponents and speeding your attacks. I found the Fire and Poison spells to be worthless, fire spell is point blank so you will get stabbed 100% of the time before the spell goes off and the poison spell burns through your magic wayyyyyyyy too fast. The attacking was done by simple chaining of your attack button (X for me since i used a 360 controller), the higher your chain the more magic you get back to refreeze your enemies. It got bland after about 15 hours in, which is not bad considering the whole game took me 18 hours and i did almost everything there was to do in a single play through.The money in the game quickly becomes absolutely pointless. The only thing you will use it for is to buy potions and enchantments for your armor. The enchantments also get pointless as you get the ""Final"" set of armor at the end of chapter 3 (There are 5 chapters). I put silver enchantments in the armor because they were the best enchantments i had at that point in the game. Then in the next two chapters you get gold enchantments..............but no armor...........whatsoever. Since enchantments are permanent.............ya i was kinda screwed at that point.The story starts out with good potential in the prologue and builds well in chapter 1 and 2 (chapter 2 was very well done). After that............meh...........just meh. Chapter 3 went in a direction i just did not care about and chapter 4 and 5 were just absolute crap. It felt like some other games i played where they started out with plenty of money and good ideas and then got rushed and had to wrap it up quickly and on a budget.The bottom line is, i just will not recommend this game to any individual period. Between the software problems, weak story and mediocre gameplay, i just dont see anyone getting very much enjoyment out of this game.			"

												It's far from the worst game out there. This game is quite mediocre and kinda ok. But combat is way to repetative and kills my enjoyment of this game.Enviroment and physics seems a bit ""clumsy"" and I find it quite annoying that I can't jump. The technolegy for this game seems to be 10 years old.I will give it a plus for story, which seems to be just as good as any other RPG. However I've not played this game through, and doubt that I will. So I can't tell if the story will be that great throughout the game.To me this game is just mediocre, and I expect far more from an RPG made in 2013.			"

												The RPG framework is good.  It's some oldschool RPG using the Dark Eye system.  Parts of the story are fun and there are some choices to make along the way.  Incest, undead brothels, demon summoning, evil mages - great stuff.  The action gameplay is atrocious.  Many levels and areas feel unfinished, almost randomly  generated with poor attention to detail.  Gear and consumables are bare-bones with little variety.  It could have been great.

												This is not the worst Dark Eye game on the market. That distinction goes to a platformer whose name escapes me, and the less said about it the better.But this is certainly the 2nd worst Dark Eye game out there. It's saving grace (if you're going to be generous) is that there is a modicum of Dark Eye plot content, some of which is quite interesting because it involves Borbarad and a geographical area of Aventuria that the other Dark Eye games (Realms of Arkania 1,2, and 3 and the remake of 1, Drakensang and Drakensang River of Time + Phileasson's Secret, Chains of Satinav and Memoria, and Blackguards 1 and 2) don't explore.Without going into details, the other games take place in areas to the northwest, west, and southwest of Gareth, the capital of the Middenrealm. Demonicon takes place to the southeast of Gareth.All of the other Dark Eye games (apart from the un-named sidescroller and the two adventure games use variations on the Dark Eye role-playing system. The two adventure games (Chains of Satinav and Memoria) don't use the RPG system because they're (surprise !) adventure games, but are brilliant and poignant additions to the Dark Eye tradition. The whole point of a Dark Eye RPG is that it is supposed to be an exercise in tactics and party management, elements which are conspicuously absent from Demonicon.Demonicon does not use the Dark Eye roll playing system. It's a first person slasher that reminds me a bit of an Asian console game. I generally avoid this kind of game, but the only one that I ever really played (and almost liked) was Joan of Arc, and Demonicon seems to share a lot of game conventions with it. My approach to the combat has been to set it to easy and hold my nose and just do it, but I must admit I haven't been too successful in overcoming the gag reflex. I'll give it another try at some point out of academic curiosity, but this is most certainly a game that you only buy when it's been deeply discounted.So I wouldn't go so far as to say it's crap, but it's not good and an unfortunate experiment to expand the genre made by people who probably didn't understand what the genre was about.It's possible that someone might play Demonicon and enjoy it, especially if their idea of tactics was zipping around a battlefield clicking a lot. That doesn't appeal to me, and it's unlikely to appeal to anyone who is interested in the world of DSA and the Dark Eye.			"

It felt like some other games i played where they started out with plenty of money and good ideas and then got rushed and had to wrap it up quickly and on a budget.The bottom line is, i just will not recommend this game to any individual period. Between the software problems, weak story and mediocre gameplay, i just dont see anyone getting very much enjoyment out of this game.			"

												Simply put, this game isn't good. It's not the worst game ever made, but it's pretty bad.Where should I begin? Story: The story is dense, very dense. The plot is intricate and full of surprises, but was also highly predictable. I should have known that I didn't just start an incest relationship with the character's sister. Because a few hours into the game, you find out you're not even blood related. The story was actually kind of good. But that's the only good thing this game has going for it. Cairon, the character, is gifted with a power after he 'exchanges blood' with his 'sister'. They were in battle together in some cave and both were injured. They also make out and have the urge to bang, but Calandra, the sister, is set to be married to some ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Well, to stop this, Cairon decides to join either the guard or the cartel in order to expedite citizenship to the city your father fled to with you and your sister. Long story short, there are choices in this game that really have no effect on the game. Without spoiling the story, the only choices that matter turns out to be the very final choice in the game and whether or not you leveled up your fast talk enough. Seriously. Every other choice doesn't matter. After the final choice, the game ends and there's no epilogue conclusion type cut scene. Very disappointing.On the technical side of things, this game is just awul. Animation sucks. I mean, I can animate better and I know I'm a terrible animator. Every motion was just so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ robotic, aside from the fighting and in game running around. The cutscenes and dialog animation was just... it was painful watching it, honestly. People's arms would move up and around for no apparent reason. Shoulders would bounce up and down from breathing. Obviously everything was hand animated with no assistance from mo-cap, but a note to the devs: video tape yourselves for your next game as reference. It'll really improve your animation skills. I mean, the walk cycles were just so bad, I wanted to throw my monitor, buy a plane ticket to Germany, and compalin to the devs in person. But I'm broke dammit. That's why I'm writing this scathing review.The dialog is awful. I might just let that one slide, though, as I'm betting they wrote it in German first, did the lipsync in German. Then translated it to English for us Yanks and Brits and maybe tweaked the lipsync as a different file/animation, and left it at that. Let me go back to the walk cylce animation. SPEED IT UP! I MEAN JUST ♥♥♥♥ING SPEED IT UP! I could have ran to the bathroom, took a dump, and ran back before the camera changes scenes. The direction is also just ♥♥♥♥ing awful. The in game cutscenes look like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ film I made in college. Thank god they outsourced the CGI cut scenes to some other studio. They actually looked okay. But what resolution were they!?! 1280x720? Ugh.Plenty of bugs that will make you want to vomit. Textures are bland as hell. Models look okay, some were decent. Houses looked nice, but the textures were still terrible. Combat consists of pooping out one button and sometimes using your magic power, which involves either (controller used here) holding the right trigger/right button and either a/b/x/y. I died a lot. Leveling system was odd, took me a while to see the extra options on the options. Inventory can get bloated real fast, where can I store my♥♥♥♥♥♥ What kind of RPG doesn't let you manual save! MANUAL SAVE! THERE'S NO BLOODY MANUAL SAVE!?!? WTF?At least it was very short.4.0/10			"

 Positive + Probably the strongest aspect of the game, the graphics are good enough for an RPG. The textures on the environments are high-res and smooth, and the framerate only really dipped a little at times out of combat (where a solid framerate isn’t a big deal). Although the character animations in conversations are repeated often, and the models could do with a little work, the graphics are easily the best part of the game+ While the skill trees are nothing exceptional or innovative, you gain plenty of AP throughout the game to level up the aspects of your character that you want to (whether it be skills, magic or stat gain), which is perfectly fine for a linear RPG+ Story-wise the premise is interesting enough, with plenty of rich dialogue and notes littered throughout the game to read and absorb. The choice system, while nothing new in gaming nowadays, does have a minor impact on the story overall (similar to The Witcher, where you can decide on which faction to join, though on a much smaller scale here). Negative - Now when it comes to the combat, this is probably a deal breaker for most people. The combat is extremely repetitive. While it does have the basics for most RPG combat systems; including blocking, parrying, physical and magical skills etc., every fight you are essentially somewhat mashing (there is a timing and combo aspect to fighting) the attack button, and later on spamming spells and skills when you’re able to. For a linear RPG this is standard, but it’s still undeniable that the gameplay in this game will become tedious very quickly; and considering some spells are incredibly strong later on in the game and easily spammable, the game is rarely challenging at all (unless you bump the difficulty up). Considering the game is around 11 hours long (on Normal difficulty), if you don’t enjoy the combat in the first hour, it’s not getting to get any better as the game progresses- Also, to comment on other weak gameplay aspects: there is little need to trade items or even explore the environment for new items, as equipment makes negligible differences to your characters stats. Lastly, but not least, there is no manual-saving at all in the game, which isn’t really a concern to me considering the game is extremely linear, but not having that option may put off some players- The sound design in general is quite poor. It seems as if some parts have sound clips missing (or put simply there’s no sound at all, such as when a boss makes a visual scream yet nothing comes out of their mouth), forgettable music, and mediocre voice acting at best leaves much to be desired in the sound department- While I positively commented on the graphics, in terms of different locations, there are very few. In fact, you visit the starting dungeon three times throughout the course of the story. Yes you heard me right, three times. You can definitely see where they had to cut corners in this part of the game- Lastly, while for the first three chapters of the game the story is solid enough, once you hit the later stages of the fourth chapter and the finale, the game feels completely rushed. The final boss and ending especially are wholly underwhelming and definitely feel like a weak climax to the overall experience. Verdict “Feeling like a poor man’s RPG (at £30 no less), The Dark Eye: Demonicon is an average and linear Western-style RPG with some redeeming qualities. If you are a big RPG fan and want something new to play, there are plenty of better games out there. But, if you can get this game extremely cheap, and have exhausted playing the best RPGs on the market, this is a solid middle-of-the-road one to play.” 6/10 TJBs  "

												The game is not open-world, this is fine. The problem arises when you start playing and the same scenarios are over the game, over and over... The same empty city and the same Mountains scenario. In addition, the sets armor are horrible very bad desing, the only weapon decent and appraising that you get over the game is the last one which you can play for 10 mintues. But anyway, the gameplay is decent and the story is good... However, there are more cons than pros in this game and that is why we have to take care when we are buying a game and be sad about our money lost in this uncomplete game.			"

 It does not worth the price.

The are no face expression. So imagine this:There are two men talking, suddenly one gets angry and start screaming.I believe that you imagine an angry person, with a frowning face.But, actually, in this game, that person will be with a poker face (and screaming).ConclusionSo, I think that they could turn the game better just making some ajustments. The combats are very slow and boring.By $39,99, it doesn't worth it at all.For me, this is a 5/1O.			"

												The graphics are dated and gameplay is a bit simple but the mature intriguing story line is a rarity amongst video games - much less fantasy RPGS. The game's lore draws extensively from the Dark Eye universe and expands it further by delving into its demonology. It is a selling point for Dark Eye fans who have played previous games such as Drakensang and Drakensang 2. It is helpful to think of this game as a far better Risen 2. That game has terrible graphics and gameplay, a simple progession system and is buggy but it had a lot of humorous dialogue and a decent story line and lore continuing from Risen 1. Demonicon similarly has some humorous dialogue and a simple progression system but has a more complex and intriguing story line, a richer lore and passable graphics and gameplay. For $10 its worth it but not at full retail. *PS Watch out for a certain Grand Magus. Best dialogue in the game. Some of the dialogue come across as stilted and unevenly paced - however the guy playing the Grand Magus pulls it off brilliantly.			"

												The combat system can not be over looked, the slow attack speed mixed in with the fact you cant roll out once an attack animation has started only hurts this game even more. The story dose not let you have any choice nor do you feel as if what you do in the world matters. There are a lot of holes in the writing and in the way the game as been put together as a whole. There are far better games out there, don't waste your time with this one.

												Demonicon looks like it could have a good story, but the gameplay is just so lackluster that I doubt I'll keep playing for much longer. Exploration is mildly infuriating because the world is littered with skill-gated loot. You need Plant Lore to loot plants, Lock Picking to loot chests, Blacksmithing to disarm traps, etc. There are 8 different skills to level up to unlock all the types of loot. The skill points for exploration skills are shared with combat skills, so if you want to be good at combat, you have to accept that parts of the world will be completely inaccessible to you.Combat is frustrating because it's so random and independent of player ability. When you try to Parry, you have a skill-dependent chance of actually parrying, then a skill-dependent chance of having the ability to counter-attack. Whenever you take a hit, you feel cheated - you as a player were good enough to press the block button, but your character failed you. In conclusion, if you like the sound of Demonicon, you should just play Risen instead. It's the same kind of game, but with much more fun gameplay.			"

												Well I picked this up before realizing that the license to use the Dark Eye name had been picked up by another company. Expected it to be a classic Dark Eye experience like Drakensang and its sequal. Its nothing like the afformentioned games at all and has about as much to do with the rules system in which it takes its name as D&D 4e has with Dungeons and Dragons (okay in fairness perhaps Demonicon is even further divorced). What I found was a poorly executed diablo clone with a storyline so divorced from Aventuria and the Dark Eye as to be unrecognizable. This is another example of a developer using a familiar name in classic rpgs and using it only for marketing purposes with little or no regard for the IP they are mutilating for profit. To be honest even if I had been looking for a diablo style action rpg this game is just pitiful. Slow response time, awkward animations and voice acting, and sadly even the story and character development are lacking seriously. Please spend your money elsewhere on a game more deserving than this one.			"

												I played the Drakensang series and loved them so was excited when I heard a new game would be released. Then I was annoyed because I wasnt going to be able to create a character or play as a female so I decided not to buy this game. A few years later I have picked it up fiarly cheap off steam and am very glad I didnt play full price.It is a rpg with some choices in how you level your build but really not too many choices, you need a combination of skills to really be at your best. So I mostly used long sword and spells.I felt the whole demonic thing was very aggravating and confusing at times, while the story was simplistic in ways I didnt always understand why my choices resulted in certain outcomes. Then I also couldnt reload and replay a decision as this is a check point game and I sure didnt want to replay a whole wadge of the game for each decsion. I think for rpgs where you get to make choices you should NOT have check points.Loot was plentiful but not so useful. There was little variety or excitment in the armours and weapons too.The romance was simplistic and fairly shallow. Howver there were a couple of funny moments in the game. Im not sure why they didnt make the great quality rpg that we are used to from this developer. I wouldnt really recommend buying unless you get it on sale.This game could have been so much more,			"

												The game is not good. It's not the worst game I have played but it is not worth your time. It has a terrible combat system. It is basically a button masher with a bit of ""magic"" thrown in but it doesn't work very well. The animations are very slow and clunky.  It's like swinging your weapon underwater. I was fighting one of the bosses and he would dissappear and reappear behind me and the camera would bug out and change views everytime. Really frustrating to deal with. The graphics, music and voice over are OK but lack polish like the rest of the game.Why do these people  bother making a game if you are going to come up with something that is so lacking. If you don't have the talent or budget to make something that works and is fun, just don't bother making the game. I tried to overlook the games issues and enjoy it but after 8 hours  I uninstalled it. Good thing I didn't pay much for it. Unfourtunately I wasted time that I could have been playing something else much better.			"

												At the current price of $20 it is not worth buying this game, but at $5 or less it might be worth it. The storyline is pretty straight forward and the choices you make, good or bad, mainly influence what hidden achievement you get and does not really affect the final ending other than some dialogue differences. For achievement hunters this game will require multiple playthroughs as the hardest difficulty is unlocked after beating the game. The lack of a manual save might be a deterrant for some people, but the auto-save does appear after each fight ends, and there are some pre-set auto save points to get the other hidden achievements if you wanted to make another dialogue decisions, but it would be better just to start a new playthough on the hardest difficulty if you're aiming to be a completionist.The leveling system is pretty straight forward and there is no real grind as monsters do not respawn in the areas you defeat them unless it's a new story progression. By endgame you will get most of the AP stat point skills to maximum, but the GP will be limited and at most you will max out two skills with GP. Overall I give the game a 5.5/10 as the gameplay can be monotonous and the parry system is almost redundant by the end of the game and relies more on dodging. It's a decent linear RPG but going from point to point and backtracking is what made the game longer than it should be when doing side quests and main quests. Some of the puzzles do require you to memorize some obscure sentences that might not be obvious as well if you skip dialogues or lore.			"

												OVERALL SCORE-  2/5the GFX are ""clean"", textures decent. best described as tolerable. but faces are dull, and almost 'doll' like. movement and animations are very basic.the most redeeming quality of this game is its character development.it has all the depth of a D&D like system. you get 2 diff experience type points to upgrade skills and spells.you get to see gear when you equip them, the detail is decent, but upgrading armor for me in the time i have played has only been slight alterations each time i found new armor. weapons look decent, and it seems there are numerous types, like blunt, swords, daggers, etc.combat at best is a button masher, with some strategy in rolling and blocking, some times you cast spells too. but it feels pretty sloppy overall.but the major buzz kill here is the game DOES NOT have a manual save!!! to add that to the games overall medium low quality, it makes the game untenable for me. unplayable overall. my most recent session with it, had me logging out, saying to myself, ""i will never play this again"", and deleting it.let it be known, it was not a rage quit, i almost didn't even care enough to be mad. it's almost as if, if you loved a game, THEN you would be mad when it disappoints you. but when a game is of poor quality like this, you are not surprised at all when you finally decide you have been wasting your time.the best way to compare a game style like this would be to compare to a game like Game of Thrones. if i hadn't played either games and they came out on steam and i was trying to decide which to buy, they would both seem equal, but GoT has a MUCH more rewarding game and gameplay.where GoT could be considered a little rough on the eyes, and some of the systems are a little clunky, the voice work is perfect, the story and lore bits you find are very enjoyable (especially if you enjoy the GoT show or novels), if you don't they are still enjoyable to gamers who like lore and journals in games like Dragon Age. the combat is VERY strategic and fun. maybe GoT doesn't have as many character development options but it still has many options for crafting and designing your characters paths. i hate to call any game unplayable, or unnecessary to even try out, but like i said, the lack of a manual save just put it over the edge for me. its basically, a game, with a well thought out character upgrade system, in an ugly static world, with a story that's hard to care about.

												A quite interesting game, with a slight twist on the 'good guy' theme.Nice system for character growth and 'lore' section; I liked much the way you brew potions, as it differs a lot from usual RPG-like games.The combat system is, to me, somewhat strange but enjoyable all the same; the use of magic is nice and not so complex as in other similar games .The story was interesting and even surprising, at some point, and you can find a few not so obvious turning points that kept my attention up.All in all a positive experience, even if I would have liked it more if it had been a bit longer.Cheers!

												A game which does not belong in ""The Dark Eye"" collection, I'll explain.Demonicon is well drawn, the screen furniture and cutscenes are great - the game mechanics and even the combat engine are quite good - the combat mechanics are clever, but sometimes a little frustrating despite being intuitive and pretty.What will make me want to buy the game? A desire to play a linear hack, slash, push-button a lot game. Unfortunately I'm not that kind of gamer anymore, so it gets a big ""not recommended"", for 2 reasons alt-tabbing away may halt your system, and the characters are really not that likeable, the dialog is out of place and plastic and well. There is just too much dialog fora game that revolves around clicking the mouse on monsters a lot. Demonicon is not included in TDE for practical reason its published by Calypso. Not even woth £7 unless your really really want this game skip it.			"

So if you like 3rd person adventure games like gothic 3 or the risen games then i highly recomend this . Also it has full controller support witch is a must for me in these types of games .

												An unexpectedly great game. Reminds me a lot of the Gothic trilogy.A dense dark atmosphere, consistently well done. Graphics are a bit outdated, but the combination of graphics, music and effects still feels very real and immersive.The story is the strongest point of this game. It's original, well-paced, and has a lot of depth to it. Especially interesting for players with a background in the Dark Eye (whether from other games or the tabletop RPG), but also works fine on its own.Recommended for anyone interested in a story-driven RPG that's a fair bit darker than usual. Strongly recommended for any Dark Eye fans.			"

												TLDR: Decent closed-world single character action RPG, which doesn't offer the free roam of open world RPGs (different genre if you ask me) but story reacts to your choices. Pretty good voice acting and dialoges, decent story, acceptable combat. Skill tree gives you some options, but you are pretty much stuck with being mage-warrior. It is quite fun and kept me in front of screen til 5 AM the first day I played. Lack of manual saves is a little annoying, but the games is saved almost on every zone entrance. When we are talking about zones, there are not that many and you will be returning to the same zones, but it offers enough variablity to not become dull. In conclusion, very enjoyable 20+ hours. If you can get it below 10 EUR, go for it, and if you are a completitionist, start on hard difficulty so you can unlock the next one after you finish the game.			"

												Probably one of the best third person RPG/Fighting games i ever played.The Story is great with many turnarounds. Nothing will work as expected. There is no need to know the world of Aventuria, but fans of the black eye will find a great story accuracy.Nice Fighting mechanics with hitchains and special skills/spells can make up to any modern high title game.The Skill customisation works fine and is done like in the black eye-Pen and Paper rpg.That beeing said, the game has a few little flaws. There are very few weapons in the game, your main weapon is either a sword or a club, your ranged weapon are throwing knifes. You get loot in the game, but as there are pretty much 3 weapons for every story chapter, you dont really have a choice what to equip and to use. Armor is dropped and looted, but the best armor in the game is given to you in the story, TWICE.For everybody considering to buy it, pls remember that this game is meant to be played with a controller.9/10 would buy for full price again, 10/10 should buy it when in the steam sale.

												Demonicon...Demonicon...an anagram for what? ummm ....medioc....nearly except for that infernal r (and those other missing letters). Anyway...the game is RPG lite, story modest, trope happy, and blithely straight forward. It's one part Witcher, some elements of Dragon Age, rather humorless and the rest indifferent. I played it all the way through and it was harmless, unstressful and rather predictable, with a capital P. The story isn't flat feeling though I give it that, characters are decent if nothing really special, the philosophy of Baradanianism is vaguely interesting,  and the gameplay is mildly fun. My suggestion is get it on sale for perhaps $10 and it will feel more or less worth it. The three Fs - fun, fay, and forgettable.			"

When i first loaded into the game the beginning was enough to catch my attention through the story but my first impression waned a little by the odd first animations (mainly the walking animation) but after playing the game further i found myself immerged playing for hours on end of time I did not have. :pI would recommend this game if you are a true RPG fan and would like to focus on a decent story.

												Good game, and I do suggest any RPG fans give it a try. It's honestly tough for us RPG fans. We could be waiting in three year, or five year stretches for a game series or game.I don't like JRPGS. So if you are like me? It is even harder to find something to play, once the game of the moment has been completed.   The genre is also cursed with being expensive to make, which in turn makes is hard on independent developers budget wise, and that makes publishers nervous. As most RPGs outside of the Elder Scroll series, Dragon Age series, sell above average at best. I simply bought Demonicon, because I was tired of waiting for Dragon Age 3, Mass Effect 4, Shadows of Mordor, and Witcher 3. Very glad that I did. It is a very decent game, with a very decent story, and it fills the void perfectly. I'd give it a 7/10. This game could have gotten higher marks, even a 9, but it suffers from a fatal flaw for some -- the combat sucks and animations can be clunky. I liked the story enough, and the world enough. That I could suffer through the problems with combat, which is usually a deal breaker for some RPG fans.The graphics are also on par with the original dragon age origins (whos combat also sucked for some), so they aren't as bad, as some say, no deal breaker.But this is a good RPG, that could have been great with better combat. It's an IP with a bright future. Even at 40.00 I think it's worth picking up.			"

												Demonicon is a pretty good second tier RPG the graphics are fair nothing earth shattering. You will spend a lot of game time talking with other people and the acting is pretty good. The game is very plot driven and you’re not really free to go off and do whatever you want, most of the areas have some small mini side quests that you can do. The entire game took me about 28 hours to complete so not really a long game. The decisions that you make don’t seem to have any effect on the ending which is kind of a bummer and the game ending is the same cliché ending that seems to be the norm now in RPG games; hopefully this is just a setup for a sequel. So I give it thumbs up as long as you can get it for less than $20.			"

												This will be my first review, generally I do not do reviews, because I am lazy, but this game is so much fun, that now I have to start. I bought the game on sale for 6 euros, it is worth some more, and a lot more of you collect Das Schwarze Auge games.So far, I did not finish the game so everything I say is based on the first 30 something percent of my progress.First of all, I read earlier that Demonicon resembles the Witcher. It is true but only concerning the graphics and the cartoon cutscenes. Demonicon is much more immersive, though more linear. Whereas I, in both Witcher 1 and 2, had to take huge pauses when playing through - because the story was not too interesting, and I got bored at some parts - here I played through the first 27% of Demonicon at once, if I remember well. The point is that the story is dark fantasy, and is as immersive as in Dragon Age, only with much less sidequests. The side quests are there rather only to show that this game has sidequests, but that is not its strongest side. This game is rather about one great main quest, which fits the DSA universe very well.It is NOT true that without the Dark Eye background the story is senseless, or makes very little sense to an outsider. In the in-game codex there is plenty information to get acquainted with the DSA setting.The German voice acting is also okay, nothing wrong with that.The graphics of the better parts resemble to Witcher. However, there are worse graphical parts, mainly when you meet with non-talking NPCs. At those points this game resembled to another dark fantasy rpg, Hunted. Apart from the main, important characters, the less important characters are not too living. They are very static, which could be theoretically good, but in Demonicon you cannot talk to most of them either, which gives a bit of a dead feeling (""lifeless environment"", but on the contrary, the sounds are very living). And also gives you the hint only to concentrate on the main quest.I have to say as well, that the sizes of the city of Warunk are so proportionate and so realistic, I think it beats everything so far I have encountered. The city, and its districts are neither too big, nor too small. I assume in the medieval time we had the same sized towns. It feels good too go on the Warunkan streets. For comparison, the Dragon Age Denerim is highly disproportionate.STORY: Again, the main quest and story is as good as in Dragon Age, with moral choices, which field is the best one ever invented in an rpg, according to me. M&M Dark Messiah also came to my mind as a comparison.GRAPHICS: Graphics are similar to Witcher and Hunted.IMPORTANT: You have to shun this game if do not like linear games and prefer the free roaming style. You can free roam, but only a little bit, within a smaller place usually, and also it is not worth to do it too much - you just rather proceed with the story.One additional fact concerning the skills. This game has 8 or so non-martial skills. I felt when I distributed the skill points, that they are not a waste, because I could make use of every skill, including the Legends and Lore, each of them were important. Also this game made me think that even in a pen and paper rpg you do not need more non-martial skills than these 8 (legends, plant caring, persuation, spotting things, disarm traps, open locks and two more). If there is more of them you will use only a small percentage of them, so most points you spend will be a waste. Or, you will not be able to spend sufficient points to each important one of them (to the ones you really need)			"

												Unfortunately this game does not live up to the The Dark Eye universe, in fact it probably does more damage than good.  Unlike the excellent Drakensang series which is set in the same Dark Eye world, Demonicon takes the action RPG route though it seems evident this wasn't originally how it was going to be.The combat element takes you out of the gameworld - you know when a fight is going to happen as your perspective changes and fight mode commences - its just a big miss for me, especially with this sort of format.The dialogue is atrocious, possibly due to translation.

This is a good RPG game but I would only buy it on sale since the price has not dropped and it has been out for a long time.There is no incest or anything taboo at ALL. if you want to play a game that has incest and Taboo then just go play ""Kingdom Caligula"". your welcome.

												This game is rubbish and a complete waste of my £10. I wish I have read the reviews and follow their advice, which is DON'T BUY! The only game on my list that is worse than this is Realms of Arcania: Blade of Destiny, which is a total con. You cannot save the game (it only saves automatically whenever it wants), the combat system is bad, the interface is even worse, the graphics are rubbish, the voice acting is average and the story seems just ok - I wasn't going to waste more than the 3hrs I've already spent to find out if it was better than the other aspects of this game. The 'puzzles' are ludicrous, (e.g. how do I open this door? Oh there's a lever next to it!), the maps are small and 100% linear.On top of that the game has crashed 4 times in 3hrs for no apparent reason and the graphics/movement are so bad that my eyes get tired after a few minutes of play time...So save your money and buy something decent instead. Needless to say that the £29.99 price tag is a bigger joke than the game itself.			"

												After 14 hours into the game, there comes this fight against a guardian. All fights until this one had been already difficult enough (normal difficulty setting) and I saw myself practically forced to choose that hit that throws the oponnents all around a little back, but that fight? Come on, I adapted quite fast to the rest, but this guy not only has the advantage of his armour and my laughable weapon, he is faster then he looks. I tought I could outsmart him by rolling behind him when he throws his slow attack, but then he instantly faces me and gets me. I'm not someone who gives up easely, or likes too easy fights, but that fight was the end for me. After trying several times, I always got too many hits because after such a slow blow, the soldier stands facing me instantly and hits me, even rolling away. So... I gave up.			"

Posted: July 19, 2015
												Edit: Commenters have told me the price of the game has been halved. Because I wrote the review when the game was fresh in my mind (it isn't anymore), and the issues I had with the game still exist, I'll leave the written review unchanged so people can see my complaints. However, from what I remember of the game, $20 is a much fairer price for what you're getting. So, I think I can now recommend it.I want to clarify first off that this is not a bad game. I'm not recommending it not because it's a bad game, but merely because it offers nothing over other games in the genre. It is, in almost all respects, perfectly average and mediocre. Were it priced a little more reasonably I might recommend the game in spite of its shortcomings, but $40 for something that I would only describe as ""painfully average"" is a bit too much.One thing I think is worth praising is the story. Apparently this is based on a German tabletop series akin to DnD. I know nothing about it, but the game does seem to have a great deal of backstory and lore that is only barely touched upon within the actual game, and that does breathe a little life into the story. Not everything is explained within the context of the story (you'll probably spend half of the game wondering just what in the hell a Borbaradian actually IS), but the game does provide a fairly robust codex that describes things not expounded on in dialogue. And the story itself is fairly interesting. Many of the characters were also enjoyable. I especially liked Feodor, Argus, and Solus; it is a shame that the last two are only available in the last area of the game.That is, however, where my praise basically has to end. You're given several choices during the story, but it doesn't really seem like that has any impact on how the story plays out, at least not to an appreciable degree. Most of the choices are binary, and the only difference is whether you're a♥♥♥♥♥♥about what you're doing or whether you're not a♥♥♥♥♥♥ ""Banish him"" or ""execute him"" result in the exact same ending plotwise; the character is gone and has no impact for the rest of the game. That's basically what every choice boils down to. Which of these characters do you accept as your father? Doesn't matter; either one has absolutely nothing to do after the choice. The worst of anything is the ending; I had hoped for a little more variation, but it's just another generic, binary ending. To be fair, this is not a problem specifically with Demonicon; many RPGs suffer from a similar problem.Combat is monotonous and dull, made at times even painful because of a lack of lock-on. I can't count the number of times I cast an ice spell and Cairon threw it in a direction I wasn't aiming at towards an enemy I didn't care about. He does it with melee attacks too, which is especially egregious. If you're not going to have the character attack in the directions I'm inputting, at least give me a lock-on so that he doesn't roll across half the screen to hit an enemy I have no reason to go after. There are several points in the game where you'll face summoners constantly bringing in new enemies and all you want is to kill them but Cairon keeps going off trying to hit some damned small fry who's just going to be replaced even if it dies. And that's awful.At least, however, that adds some element of difficulty. I played through on Normal and the game is just pathetically easy. I apparently got an achievement for not using any potions throughout the entire game; I wasn't even TRYING to get this achievement, there's literally just no need for the things, at least on Normal. Doubtless the game is harder in one of the other difficulty modes, but it should bear mentioning, shouldn't it, that throughout the entire game I didn't need even a SINGLE healing potion? Perhaps allowing Cairon to heal by attacking was a bit too much. As long as your combat multiplier is high enough (hit enemies without them hitting you, basically), every attack heals Cairon for a fairly substantial amount of health. Since almost every enemy in the game has hitstun from being hit, and Cairon can roll indefinitely and is invulnerable during these rolls, it's child's play to rack up a large combat multiplier and just heal, heal, heal.The camera, for the most part, is fine, but there are a few sections where it gets in the way. There was one section in a building in Kreutzer Alley where the camera was so bad I literally could not see what I was doing and nowhere I could move to fixed it. I simply had to mash the attack button until combat ended and then I was able to move to an area where the camera was not so screwed up. I have a feeling this was due to the relatively low ceiling in the building, and this WAS the only place in the game where the camera screwed up to such a degree. As I said, for the MOST part, the camera is entirely serviceable, but when it screws up it's very noticeable.I honestly can't remember any of the music except for the battle music. That means it didn't stick out, which means it was neither offensively bad nor enjoyable. I actually did like the combat music at the start, but since combat takes so long and there's so much of it I tired of it a few hours in. The sound direction is also fine, although there were a few cutscenes in the game where the sound cut out entirely. It did fix itself once the scene switched, however.I would have liked some greater ability to customize Cairon's equipment. Early on you have a fair number of choices and you can mix and match them, but later on all you seem to get is equipment sets which cannot be broken up; you either have to wear the entire set or none of it. It's a little disappointing.  There are only two weapon types, bladed and blunt (axes are, for some reason, considered blunt weapons, which is as mystifying here was it was in Oblivion). There are also throwing weapons, but I hardly used those as there was little point using them over your ranged ice spell. There are some interesting weapon and armor designs. You can use weapon/armor enhancements to beef up your equipment, but so far as I can tell there's no way to remove them.I do have a bit of a problem with how often you're sent running back and forth and how often environments are reused. About a quarter of the way through the game you're given access to the Market and Kreutzer Alley; learn to love them because you'll be running back and forth between them for the next few hours. You start the game in Moloch Mountain, about halfway through the game you're sent there again (and you have to open all of the gates again; who closed them?), and then at the end of the game you're sent there AGAIN. And you have to open the gates AGAIN (although there is a reason for the gates being closed this time). The monastery, the last original area in the game, has two main sections and a courtyard between them; you're sent running back and forth collecting gems and I began to truly despise that courtyard because of how often I had to run between sections. That entire area felt rushed, actually.The last thing I want to mention are the bosses. They're major letdowns. Only one boss in the entire game killed me, and that's merely because he heals himself four times throughout the fight. This is largely a symptom of the general easiness in combat I mentioned earlier; you see the boss's attacks (of which they generally only have three or four, all heavily telegraphed), dodge them, and rack up your combo multiplier allowing you to heal directly as you deal damage. If you use Demonic Aura, increasing your attack and movement speed, it becomes even easier.At $40, I  just can't recommend the game. I bought it for a heavy discount during the summer sale, and I wasn't ENTIRELY dissatisfied with my purchase, but if I had spent $40 I surely would have been. If you're hard up for an action RPG, this isn't the worst choice...but it's definitely not the best, either.			"

												Hello everybody, my name is Shaun Meyers (Kyo Akiara) and I'm the writer of a game review and article website known as Universal Gaming Reviews. This is my review for Demonicon: The Dark Eye. The game has an interesting leveling system which I enjoyed quite a bit, lots of collectbles to find in the world that are based on a certain skill, like lockpicking and legend lore and the storyline is fairly intriguing. The game does however have quite a few issues still in-tact and I ended up taking a point off due to these issues. There's still many glitches in conversations, I ran into one after the boss battle with Ghamat that prevented me from leaving the area, textures are really low resolution and it's noticeable throughout the game (not a big issue for me to be honest though, I still play classic games so I'm used to stuff like this haha, it's worth mentioning though). There's also no option to save the game and it relies on an autosave checkpoint system, which is a bit annoying as well. There also isn't a lot of armor and weapon choices among other things I could say lol. The negatives far outweigh the positives but even so I've been enjoying it for the most part and have put 10 hours into it already, I'd recommend picking it up when it's cheaper in price if it interests you though as it's not really worth 40 bucks in my opinion. Happy gaming folks.You can read our full review here: http://www.universalgamingreviews.com/game-review/demonicon-dark-eye-overview-review/ "

												It's very clear that this game was following in the footsteps of giants, it's most definitely trying to be Dragon Age: Origins, however it is not. The combat is very clunky, the skill system is un-imaginatve and very VERY limited and the stats are not very well thought out. They opted to have 2 seperate stat trees one for combat and one for immersion/crafting, while I think it's nice there is almost 0 reason to even touch the combat stats(str,agi, etc...). The combat early on makes you want to put points in stats to take more hits, but once you unlock the skill tree of your choice there isn't a point, I had maxed out all of the talents like haggle (merchant prices) and perception (seeing traps and treasure) before I had more than a few points in some early combat stats. However with all that game isn't really all that bad, the story is interesting enough and many of the choices you make force you to think for a moment about what you are doing, which is refreshing.                                                      Truly the biggest issues I had with this game were clucky combat, limited skills, worthless stats and how every area was so isolated, it didn't need to be open world but the overall content of the game was smaller than most, oh and that every weapon upgrade came from vendors, only ever used one weapon I found that wasn't from a vendor, which kinda spoils the immersion factor since this is an RPG. But I'd still say this game is overall not bad, not great, but not bad. Worth it when it's on sale for $10 or so. Personally I'd like to see this developer try their hand at another RPG, but one that is longer and better thought out.                                                                                                             Overall I'd give it a 6/10.			"

												Das Spiel ist einfach ein schlechter Witz und hat außer mit dem Namen und ein paar Andeutungen im Spiel, absolut gar nichts mit DSA gemeinsam.Alles was DSA so großartig macht, wurde aus diesen Spiel gestrichen.Hier nun meine Liste warum das Spiel ein schlechter Scherzt ist:-Schlechter Sound, hat teilweise aussetzen (zb im Kampf)-Dialoge der NPC´s auf der Straße wiederholen sich ständig, hört sich an als ob ein Tonband eine Endlosschleife abspielt-Die NPCs quatschen oft in die Quest-gespräche rein, zb man spricht gerade mit einen Auftraggeber einer Quest und der NPC im Hintergrund labert sein Tonband Endlosschleife runter-Nerviger Soundtrack, ein paar Stücke sind zwar gut, aber leider wiederholen sich die Soundtracks ständig, und es kommt einem so vor als ob das Spiel nur 3-5 Soundtracks beinhaltet-Schlechte Grafik, total öde,  triste und lieblose Gebiete, Städte, Einrichtungen usw.-Tote Spielwelt, die NPCs stehen alle nur steif auf ihrer Position, es herrscht auch so kaum Leben in der Stadt oder den Gebieten-Schlechte Effekte-Schlechte Animationen, bei den Dialogen führen die Charaktere immer die selbe Körperbewegungen durch, und die Kampfanimationen sind auch nicht besser, als Beispiel nenne ich nur einmal das Intro-Video des Spiels (diese Schlachtszene)-KEIN Charaktereditor wie zb in Drakensang-Der Held ist eine Hypridklasse, der Nahkampf und Magie kann aber beides nur durchschnittlich beherrscht, eben so was wie in The Witcher (solche Charaktere mag ich nicht)-Zu wenig Zauber, es gibt nur 4 verschiedene Zauber die man ausbauen kann, wo aber jeder ""neue"" Zauber exakt der selbe ist nur mit mehr Schaden oder längere Effekte-Zu leichte Bosse, habe einige Bosse (die Necros in der Stadt, oder den Ghul) mit nur einen Schlag (Eislanze + Hammerschlag 2) getötet-KEINE Partymitglieder wie in den anderen DSA Spiele-Schlechtes Inventar, bzw Ausrüstungssystem; WIESO liegen meine Waffen, Rüstungen usw, die ich ausgerüstet habe immer noch im Inventar rum ?-Total schlechter Konsolen-PC Import; Kampfsteuerung bzw Tastenbefehle der Fertigkeiten, Zauber und Tränke total kompliziert und unvorteilhaft, es ist mir oft passiert das ich mich verdrückt habe-Fehlende Beschreibungen und Bezeichnungen in dem Charaktermenü, zb gibt es keine Kategoriebezeichnungen-Total geringe Waffenauswahl, es gibt nur Schwerter, Äxte, Knüppel und Wurfsterne, nicht mal Zweihand Äxte, Schwerter, Hämmer oder gar Schilde gibt es-Bei den Rüstungen sieht es nicht viel besser aus, noch dazu sehen alle Rüstungen und Waffen total gleich aus-Absolut kein Wiederspielwert-Schlauch Levels-Instanzierte Gebiete, Welt-Zu kleine Gebiete-Nervige Bugs, Quest-NPCs verschwinden plötzlich und man kann keine Quest abschließen, Charaker bleibt oft wo hängen oder läuft gegen eine unsichtbare Wand-KEIN DSA SPIEL-Total lange, sinnlose Laufwege-Man wird ständig in die selben Gebiete geschickt-Es gibt in dem Spiel kaum Waffen oder Ausrüstungen, ich habe nur 4x die Waffe und ca 4-5x die Rüstung gewechselt-Gewisse Rüstungsteile kann man nicht wechseln bzw mit anderen Rüstungen Kombinieren, da wird automatisch sofort die komplette Rüstung ausgewechelt anstatt nur ein Rüstungsteil (Brust, Hose, Arme)-Viel zu wenig Ausrüstungslots (Es gibt nur Brust, Arme, Hose, Amulett und 2x Ringe) Ihr mögt euch nun fragen, wo die Liste mit den Positiven Aspekte des Spiels bleiben, ihr fragt euch das auch zurecht, meine Antwort darauf lautet: Es gibt Keine, nicht mal die Story, die ich auch nicht wirklich besonders gut finde, hebt die negativen Punkte wieder auf.Das Spiel hat absolut keine 73% (laut Gamestar) verdient, das Spiel würde von mir eher 45%-50% bekommen und ich empfehle es auch keinen weiter.Mich wundert es daher gar nicht mehr das man in der Entwicklungszeit kaum etwas über das Spiel erfahren hat, wahrscheinlich haben die Entwickler sich schon selber gefragt wie man so ein schlechtes Spiel programmieren kann.Das Spiel wurde total lieblos programmiert anders kann ich mir diese leblose, öde Spielwelt nicht erklären.Also an alle die noch am überlegen sind ob sie sich das Spiel kaufen sollen; Kauft es bloß nicht, und wenn dann wartet auf eine Aktion, den die €30.--€40.- was das Spiel momentan noch kostet, ist es auf keinen Fall wert, gut das ich dafür nicht so viel gezahlt habe sonst würde mich das jetzt sehr ärgern.

												this game starts off strong.introduces you to the game and teaches you base mechanics such as skill point allocation, skills magic etc and has active blocking and throwing daggers etc, all in all a great start. then however once you leave the beggining area you get thrown into a desilate ugly town with reeeeeaaly boring narrative and lots i mean LOTS of it i spoke to all the boring people and SPOILER ALERT kept trying to stop the main characters sister having sex with him. thats right the first thing you have to do in the story is choose wether your going to bang your sister END OF SPOILER.at this point id spent over an hour and a half talking crap doing fetch quests havnt progressed further.as of now its a negative, but if i summon the inner strength to play it more it might supprise me			"

												I dont give too many bad reviews but if you like choppy graphics and to die around every corner every few minutes then this is the game for you!! I like the Darkeye universe but it seems like sometimes the games are good like Blackgaurds or Drakensang, and sometimes they are low budget unplayable waste of a download games like this Demonicon or Realms of Arkania blade of destiny which suck!! time to uninstall this to make room for better rpgs......

												UNACCEPTABLE, UNPLAYABLE, BROKEN!! On my MSI laptop if I move the cursor near the bottom of the screen, the system switches out of the game and into the Steam app, and I have to click on the game icon to get back into the game. With other games this is a minor annoyance.But Demonicon causes a total hard system crash if one leaves the game and then tries to resume or alt-tab back into it. CTL-ALT-DEL doesn't work. The only solution is to power down and reboot. Hard crashes can damage the directory.I've looked at the discussion area, and others have encountered the same problem. Not worth my time!			"

												I bought this game by mistake (thinking it was another game) when it was on special for a couple of dollars. I thought I would hate it, but decided to give it a go anyway.To my surprise, I'm really enjoying it. It reminds me a lot of Gothic I and II - but with much better combat and a much more linear world. Like Gothic, the graphics aren't fantastic, it's a bit clunky, but the story and characters are very rich and involving. Definitely worth picking it up if you can get it on special.			"

												Overall pretty good RPG on the rails. It is very dark, most choices are between bad and worse. It breaks many taboos - sex, violence, religion - perhaps unnecessarily too many, some just mentioned between lines, so they are disturbing yet not developed enough to be really touching (incest is the more mundane part of it).Although it is overall fine game, it has many issues. It is underdeveloped in both design and graphics. Also pacing is not the best - it starts slow, gets good and ends very dragged out - there is talk about urgency while you are running back and forth in vast monastery, and while character development is mostly over. Combat is more tactics than action, and once you get your combo worked out you just keep repeating it. Looting and gathering is mostly useless. and that includes secrets, locks and traps.Get it for the story and less frequently seen setting, Story is best in the middle game, where everyone is little scheming ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, while towards end it is mostly heroic fantasy with some black sprayed on - get it on sale and feel free to quit before end.

												((((((Warning the first area in this game is a bland tutorial nothing like the Main game)))))))Play the the first 30 to 45 minutes through a linear quickly thrown together tutorial, then get to the excellent main game. This game delivers what fable promises, every action a consequence, if you don't believe me watch my video.

												Well, lets be honest,game looks like it was made 7 or 8 years ago, animations are poor, sounds are not too bad, mediocre voice acting. But under all of that there is a very interesting story, i have stayed up to 3 am playing it because i wated to see what happens next. Plus it has a decent combat system, specially once you gain higher ranking powers and attack moves and learn to combine them. This game is obviously not a tripple A title, it was made by a small indie developer, I think its their first game, I can say its not a bad first game at all. If they keep their stories as interesting and polish up all the visuals, we could have a mini Bioware lol			"

												The game is not perfect and the ending feels rushed; but the gameplay, although simple, is enjoyable; yet it is the story that is its real saving grace. It's fairly unique, as far as games go; unafraid to take risks that most games would shy away from. If you have the taste for the dark and mature, and if you're immature enough to appreciate a good sense of humor, there's a good chance that you will enjoy this game. Just don't go into it expecting perfection. It feels more like a budget title. A B title, if you will. A damned good one; but still.			"

												This is a game that I picked up rather randomly, with the only intention being to pass the time with...that turned around into getting ""into it"" and finishing it over the course of this week. The first thing worth noting is that I wish that the steam review system allowed for Neutral Reviews, because this is one particular game that I feel falls into neither one side or the other, but kind of in-between, depending on the player.That said, I won't elaborate much on the story, because I feel that the game's description does an adequate enough job and I prefer to avoid spoilers. However, worth noting is that the story is one of the stronger points that this game has, it's interesting right from the very beginning and hooks you in. It's a shame though, because it kinda falls through near the end, I personally didn't like the ending, but that's just me and I think the game would have benefitted from more choice and consequence dialogue options, beyond the few choices you get to make at critical points in the story. Then again, maybe I'm asking for too much and should go play a Bioware RPG then? Regardless, what choice and consequence options there are, are pretty interesting and thankfully, aren't simply a matter of ""good or evil"" and instead, as previously stated, choice and consequence options. For example *SPOILER ALER!!!* the first such option has you deciding between letting a cannibal go and saving his captives, with the obvious conseqence of letting him run free and keep eating humans, or killing him, which at the same time, will kill his captives because they are bound to his life by a spell. I actually had to give this decision a few moments of thought before deciding, and when a game makes me stop to think, I believe it's done something right.Moving on to the gameplay, the core of it is typical Action/RPG fare. Standard attacks, skills and magic are your options in combat. Standard hack and slashing consists of stringing together attacks into combo chains, the higher your combo chain, the higher the chance of scoring critical hits and after a certain amount, you start recovering hit points every time you hit an enemy. Also at your disposal is a dodge function and skills that you can learn with Adventure Points (AP) which you earn through combat and completing quests among other methods. Magic is learned using Gift Points (GP) which is strictly earned through combat and tied to how often you use magic. Finally, there are more geenric skills that are helpful throughout the game, such as Blacksmithing, which allows you to disarm traps and upgrade weapons, Lock Picking which allows you to, well...Pick Locks, Fast Talking which opens up optional disalogue choices and Lore which allows you to gain extra insight into people, places, enemies and so on, in the form of more information being unlocked in your journal and it also opens up more optional dialogue choices. Complementing everything, is Alchemy Crafting which allows you to brew Potions, Poisons and make Balms, unfortunately I cannot comment on that feature, as I mostly ignored it, because I went for the achievement for completing the game without using any potions and Blacksmithing, which allows you to upgrade weapons with components that you buy, or find in chests or get as rewards for completing quests. With gameplay in general, I had a few issues, while combat is easy to grasp, it also felt too simplistic and while some of the skills and magic are definitely useful, they didn't really stand out for me in terms of being ""fun to play with"", also, one of the things that immediately come to mind when I think of an Action/RPG, is loot, lots of (hopefully) varied and fun to tinker with, loot...most of the loot in this game is generic and not really interesting, and I hate...let me say it again, I HATE, that the game only has two different melee weapons: Swords and Clubs...I mean, really? Oh, wait...no shields either. Finally, the end fight disappointed me, it was a push over and probably the easiest boss fight in the entire game.Graphics and Sound...probably where this game fails at quite miserably, wallows in the mud and then gets stomped on by a passing horse. No, really...it's THAT bad. Graphically, this game looks like it belongs in the early 00s, while the atmosphere is spot on, giving the game a less ""Fantasy"" and more ""Realistic"" setting, the graphics are bad at best. Adding insult to injury, a lot of the animations during cutscenes are cringe-worthy or plain don't exist, like an NPC handing the main character an item and the main character supposedly examining it, which is suggested, but isn't animated, unless you use the imagination and imagine it. What animations are there, are mostly cringe-worthy as I mentioned before, like the main character awkwardly drawing his sword and looking as if his about to fall backwards because of it's weight. Another complaint is the design of the game world, while the atmosphere is great and lends itself to the plot quite nicely, at the same time...it doesn't have a whole lot of variety and not much in terms of interesting things to see. Finally, generic music and sound and mostly awful voice acting, some people have praised the voice work on this game and I guess to each their own, but in my opinion, it's horrible.Final thoughts: This game had a lot of potential, but instead was ruined. The game is rather short, the first chapter itself spans about half of the time you'll spend playing this game, which gives you false expectactions as it sets the stage to make you believe that each chapter will be similar in length, but their not. More interesting side quests and less linearity may also have helped, but most of all, better graphics, at least for a game that came out in 2013. Oh and is asking to be able to skip cutscenes too much? <_<Ultimately, I recommend the game, why? Because despite it's flaws, it's still an enjoyable game, if you can get it for 75% off, as it's NOT worth the full asking price.			"

Score: 6/10Similar GamesThe Witcher, Risen, Dragon Age 2, and Bound By Flame.OverviewDemonicon opens up with you looking for your sister who is to be married. Where she decided to hide is in a demonic mountain... It turns out that she wasn't hiding but tracking someone. During which it turns out that the reason your father didn't want you mixing your blood was because it unlocks some kind of power. You quickly find out that your father has lots of secrets about you and your sister. It also turns out your sister is in love with you and doesn't want to be married. So you are off on a quest to make it so she doesn't have to. Eventually she gets taken away as well and you must find her. Strangely none of what I've said gives away any actual plot. The game runs from 15-30 hours depending on your curiousity.The GoodThe game is set up to use dark eye rule sets on stats which gives a lot of extra things to do and dialogue along the way. Should you decide to go into plant lore you can gather plants and use alchemy to make potions. Making potions and gathering herbs give you more AP points which you had to spend to get those skills in the first place. The world is actually pretty interesting if you choose all the differnt dialogue options which gives you more of the games lore. There are traps you can disarm and chances are one will kill you because you didn't notice it. The combat is actually pretty good except for the counter attack which hardly works. The sound overall in the game is on par. New enemies get introduced regularly, but in the begining you will wonder if that's true. The game offers up interesting choices to make that very much are a shade of gray. The only problem is the end of the game never lets you know how these choices had an effect long term.The BadThe counter attack combat move doesn't work. The game only offers a few different armor options. There is practically no point in buying anything other then potions from merchants which leaves you with a large amount of gold you will never spend for almost the entire game. The tutorial doesn't actually exist so best of luck figuring out controls and how to upgrade your character using the dark eye rules because they don't tell you. I would date the graphics around the year 2007 and most of the world tend to use a very brown color pallette. The ending portion of the game gives you a ton of choices and none of them except the final one actually does anything. This tends to be a trend in this game because you can also get dialogue options throughout by having certains skills, but it tends to only introduce more dialogue and not change the end result in the least for the most part anyway.ConclusionI enjoyed my time with Demonicon even with it's sub par graphics and sometimes cliche story rifts. I feel like the game had enourmous potential for a small studio and they just never got there. I feel if the creators would have had user feedback before release it could have been different. Where it sits I can only suggest this game to true RPG fanboys looking for an action romp in a world that is more interesting to here about in the games notes and dialogue then in actual exploration. If only they would have included updates to the choices you made like The Witcher and Dragon Age Origins did I would give this game a lot more praise.ValueI'd value it as an average quick romp RPG at about $7.50 value.

												9/10, great game! I played with German Voices, and they are really well done, not only the speakers (e.g. Latika the undead is just creepy... she switches between nice girly voice and creepy undead waily voice) but also the language in general, well done!What this RGP is really unique about is the story... very mature, and it deals about demonic powers, sacrifices with blood, and has some nasty dilemmas one needs to choose from. This demonic viewpoint is unique in my opinion, and a really nice try to do something new. Although I never really liked the underlying RPG system (das Schwarze Auge), here I found it complex enough to be a true RPG, but still not too complicated and actually interesting, as it gives you ""Exp"" for each passed skill check, and it is very rewarding to boost even unimportant skills to pass the next skill test, receive more points and further improve skills. Combat seems odd at first, because it also follows the RPG rules, so its not only arcade, but it works very well, and later you get quite powerful!It took me ca. 30h for a full clear, and there were zero bugs or anything, rare these times.Great game and highly recommended if you want to play a game about finding minds limitations and how a dark world might look like! Quite unexpected...			"

												The best way to describe this game is to say that is is basically a fantasy RPG, and thats it. There is nothing wrong with the game although there isn't anything about the game that stands out either. There is nothing bad about it, just nothing thats great. It's a good, fantasty rpg. I like those kinds of games so I do like it. The gamplay, lore, story, characters, they were all good. It's strange to play a game thats just absolute mediocrity. Its like the developers came together and said ""lets make a game thats just in the middle between bad and great,"" and they did. I had fun with it and if you enjoy fantasy rpg style then you'll enjoy it too. If you don't then I don't think you'll care for this game as there is nothing that stands out. I enjoyed it, and thats enough for me.			"

												The combat is pretty stiff but the (few) magics and (few) skills available tend to make it a little better.The graphic isn't incredible but it's still quite nice, same goes for the voice acting, what make Demonicon a good title to buy is the story, I've really loved some of the choice I had to make and the lack of manual saving in this case is better, since you won't be able to simply save, make one choice, reload and make the other, so you will have to think pretty carefully before making any decision.18 hours well spent.

												First and foremost, Demonicon is a third-person RPG game filled with battles, magic, humans, creatures and demons. The game is also classless, meaning that you are not in a specific class or limited to certain skills, feats or talents.      Body, Mind (knowledge) and Power development is central to your progress in the game.     Upgrading health (vitality), mana (essence) and endurance (encumbrance) improve the Body.      Skills such as Lore, Blacksmithing and/or haggling strengthen the Mind.      Special attacks (which uses encumbrance) and Gift powers (uses essence) build up your Power.      There are two types of points used for upgrading: AP (which is for Skills and Body upgrades, and Special attacks) and GP (which is for Gift powers) which are to be used with CAUTION.     The graphic detail and quality are rather poor considering that this game was made in 2013, but they are not utterly terrible either. Sound and music are amazing. Dialogue and storytelling are breath taking, with choices you make along the way, and are fantastically done.      The battle system is not that bad. Playing with either an edged weapon (fast but weak) or blunt weapon (slow but strong) are fun, along with magic at your fingertips. Enemies become stronger as the game progresses, which make you need to upgrade your equipment, or buy new equipment at a merchant (which is a must, sell old equipment to earn money).      Weapons and armour, can be modified to give additional properties such as extra points to attack or armour bonus or poison, critical hits or improved skills. It all depends on you.      Decisions, decisions, decisions. At times, they are easy, and at times, extremely tough. They can be wrong or right. It all depends on what you want the outcome to be. And this game is full of them. You may decide to be fearless and cruel and tempered, or calm and merciful and noble, it just depends on you, but it also comes to standing your ground according to what is right for you. But remember, actions bear consequences - what you decide in the beginning may come back to bite you in the end, and horribly.      Finally (WARNING: complicated process), after killing a demon that stole my trolley, I accidently turned myself into a broken couch and was finally kidnapped by peg sellers. I award this game with a 8.84 out of 10. If you are into RPGs and third-person, not hassled by graphics or having to make tough decisions, then this game may just pique your interest. A final note: a patch for the game for improved graphics, fighting, conversations and everything else improved can be downloaded for free from Steam.			"

												I didn't expect much from Demonicon, and if you go in with the same expectations you might come out the same way I did, enjoying the game for what it is.So what is Demonicon, well it's a mostly linear RPG with a focus on combat. Pretty much all of your time within the game will be spent following the main quest storyline. There are some sidequests that you can pick up very occasionally, but they are very short and easy to complete, a lot of them even while doing the main quest. The sidequests are there just to give you something else to do, but they are not rewarding to complete and none of them even give out any good loot.And that is probably one of the biggest issues within the game, there is no good loot anywhere. And by good loot I mean something cool and unexpected that you manage to acquire by doing something the game doesn't force you to do. Your potential rewards are a weapon equal to or worse than what you already have, some potions, money and junk (various stuff that the game classifies itself as junk by automatically placing it under an inventory tab labeled ""Junk""). Not to mention the fact that noone of the merchants have anything useful to sell, the best weapons and armour they have available will always be on the same level as your current gear. Perhaps you could buy some potions from the merchants, but you find so many yourself that it's unlikely you'll run out and even if you do you can very easily brew some more yourself.The story is very important in an RPG, but this one isn't anything to write home about. It has an interesting premise, and it starts by trying to establish some complicated relationships between the main characters, but the execution leaves much to be desired. In Mass Effect style you have the conversation wheel where you select the next conversation topic or answer a question in a multitude of ways. However nothing you say ever has much of an impact on the progression of the story, the game only gives you the illusion of choice. But the story did interest me just enough to keep me playing, it does try to do something slightly different, even if the rest of it is average at best.So what is it that I actually continued (and finished) playing the game for? Well, I quite enjoyed the combat within the game (although you really should play the game on Hard for any sort of a challenge). It starts off easy and very simple, but it does become a bit more complex as you encounter enemies that don't respond all that well to simply mashing the attack button. And as you gather experience you start unlocking more interesting skills, although none of them are anything out of the ordinary.Demonicon also has something I am probably just a big sucker for, skills that affect how you play the game outside of combat. The skills are as follows (the names might not be exact):- Legend (it allows you to pick up lore tidbits from the game world and occasionally opens up conversation options)- Herbalism (it allows you pick up better quality plants and unlocks more recipes as you skill up)- Medicine (sometimes you can heal someone with it, and it affects how much health you regenerate after each combat and from potions)- Perception (highlights traps and hidden loot)- Fast Talk (enables you to convince NPCs with an additional conversation option when the game offers you that option)- Haggle (lowers merchant prices, probably the most useless skill in the game)- Lockpicking (open up chests for loot)- Blacksmithing (disarm traps and upgrade you weapons/armour)I started the game with a complete focus on these skills and disregarded any and all combat skills until I had these maxed out. I never felt I had any particular difficulty in combat, partly because leveling up spells uses up a different type of experience and partly because it really isn't that difficult. You could easily do the opposite and just focus on combat completely, but then you'd be losing one of the more entertaining aspects of the game.Demonicon's problem is that it doesn't do anything particularly well, but taken as a whole it was an enjoyable experience for me. And for a budget RPG I wasn't expecting anything more.6½ / 10			"

												Engaging story, with hard choices (not simply black or white). Very linear, few sidequests, almost no free exploration.Combat is fun and requires tatics (at least at normal difficulty).Graphics are much better than I expected after reading some of the other reviews.			"

												I liked this game quite a bit, not many games anymore really keep me interested in the story. I found myself wanting to continue playing to just find out what happens next.. That being said yes I can recommend the game for RPG/FPS players surely but be warned the ending is rather bad... The game flows along nicely but the end just feels rushed like they were on a deaddline and just needed to finish the game. The ending left me asking what happened? What happened to the characters? It just feels like there should be more to it.Graphics are decent overall but the character faces are not that great.Sound is ok, I turn music down on most all games as I much prefer just the ambient sounds.The control scheme could have been better, it just doesn't feel very intuitive to me, but you get accustomed to it eventually.You're supposed to be able to make chocies in the game that influence what happens necxt but it doesn't seem to really affect the outcome. Short term they may affect some things but long terms they don't really seem to at all.:::Spoilers:::-There is no incest in the game, they're not actuallly related which you find out later in the game but yes in the beginning it does feel 'icky' with the whole brother and sister kissing and professing their love for each other.  But then again maybe there is as later in the game you meet another guy who claims he's your real father and your sisters father so it is actually incest?! Or not? As you never really find out if the guy is really yours and her father. It's confusing.-The ending is just ridiculous, it leaves you asking WTF just happened? And WTF happened to the characters? It ends like a cliff hanger and for games that's not a good thing I think. If there's going to be a sequel you at least finish the first game, it just very much feels unfinished and rushed. The ending graphics look exactly that same for either choice, at least it did to me. You go through the whole game and the enitre ending sequence is a few seconds and then the credits roll and you're left sitting there like WTF that's it?-The game does seem to leave some questiosn unanswered, like who is their real father, you never really find out. We find out that the first father is 'adoptive' or he actually kidnapped them, and the second guy who comes along and claims to be the father but it's never really confirmed. He just comes up and says he's your real father without any proof.			"

												My first impressions were influenced by reviews and gameplay video. People wrotemostly bad comments and the gameplay looked kinda crappy. But i tried it anyway.First two hours i was cursing because of the saving system.Thing that it wasnt saving before hard fight were upseting mebecause u had to skip some cutscenes collect some things etc.and then u could try different tactic and die again. But when i gotused to it it went very easily. (I was playing it for first time on Hard difficulty.) Then i saw how sophisticately it was created. All thoseskills perks spells etc. At start it was just too much of everything+ dat incest think made me broody about the developers..but everything got explained very well. So im gonna summarize:-the story plot was pretty interesting and was very well explained-all of those rpg elements i like were implemented good (leveling, looting, selling, buying, upgrading etc. )-i was very pleased when i saw the looting system saves a lot of time cuz ur gonna  pick it all anyway-graphics are nice and very fluent-combat is (once u learn to) enjoyable-skills are making u stronger and enemies are getting stronger too, so its challenge all  the time-the deciding matters on your conscienceWhat i didnt like mostly was the autosave system, it saves only at certain points, so sometimesyou have to repeat few more things again and again.+there could be more location, quest, items (more parts of armor, and diferent weapons)But overally this game is solid linear action rpg game with beautifully designed areas and lore.

												Sure it's a little rough around the edges and a lot of people are up in arms about the initial story line, but once you get a little bit in Demonicon turns out to be a pretty fun game. There aren't nearly enough games using The Dark Eye rules and even ones that bend them a bit like Demonicon are still a delight.			"

												This game is special. Yes the gameplay is not as smooth as someone might hope but its a lot of fun for everyone who likes the dark eye. LVL up might be a bit complicated and the combat can be challenging (I prefer playing this game with gamepad - much easier) but everyone who loves RPGs and doesn't expect fancy graphics wont be disappointed. Sad enough we wont ever see a sequel. And the brother/sister subject is a long shot but also something fresh I've never encountered before in a videogame.			"

												Truth to be told, I wasnt expecting much from Demonicon, but it turned out to be fairly entertaining. The story was decent and I liked the dark undertones that were weaved through, though in the end it wasnt terribly original. Gameplay wise, the fighting mechanic was a bit on the clunky side, but served its purpose. Based on the Dark Eye ruleset, the leveling system can be confusing (and this wasnt my first Dark Eye rpg) I would recommend reading up some basic explanations online (some important expanations are missing ingame). All in all, if you see this on sale and you like linear action rpgs, give it a chance and grab it =)			"

												I didn't expect much from Demonicon, and if you go in with the same expectations you might come out the same way I did, enjoying the game for what it is.So what is Demonicon, well it's a mostly linear RPG with a focus on combat. Pretty much all of your time within the game will be spent following the main quest storyline. There are some sidequests that you can pick up very occasionally, but they are very short and easy to complete, a lot of them even while doing the main quest. The sidequests are there just to give you something else to do, but they are not rewarding to complete and none of them even give out any good loot.And that is probably one of the biggest issues within the game, there is no good loot anywhere. And by good loot I mean something cool and unexpected that you manage to acquire by doing something the game doesn't force you to do. Your potential rewards are a weapon equal to or worse than what you already have, some potions, money and junk (various stuff that the game classifies itself as junk by automatically placing it under an inventory tab labeled ""Junk""). Not to mention the fact that noone of the merchants have anything useful to sell, the best weapons and armour they have available will always be on the same level as your current gear. Perhaps you could buy some potions from the merchants, but you find so many yourself that it's unlikely you'll run out and even if you do you can very easily brew some more yourself.The story is very important in an RPG, but this one isn't anything to write home about. It has an interesting premise, and it starts by trying to establish some complicated relationships between the main characters, but the execution leaves much to be desired. In Mass Effect style you have the conversation wheel where you select the next conversation topic or answer a question in a multitude of ways. However nothing you say ever has much of an impact on the progression of the story, the game only gives you the illusion of choice. But the story did interest me just enough to keep me playing, it does try to do something slightly different, even if the rest of it is average at best.So what is it that I actually continued (and finished) playing the game for? Well, I quite enjoyed the combat within the game (although you really should play the game on Hard for any sort of a challenge). It starts off easy and very simple, but it does become a bit more complex as you encounter enemies that don't respond all that well to simply mashing the attack button. And as you gather experience you start unlocking more interesting skills, although none of them are anything out of the ordinary.Demonicon also has something I am probably just a big sucker for, skills that affect how you play the game outside of combat. The skills are as follows (the names might not be exact):- Legend (it allows you to pick up lore tidbits from the game world and occasionally opens up conversation options)- Herbalism (it allows you pick up better quality plants and unlocks more recipes as you skill up)- Medicine (sometimes you can heal someone with it, and it affects how much health you regenerate after each combat and from potions)- Perception (highlights traps and hidden loot)- Fast Talk (enables you to convince NPCs with an additional conversation option when the game offers you that option)- Haggle (lowers merchant prices, probably the most useless skill in the game)- Lockpicking (open up chests for loot)- Blacksmithing (disarm traps and upgrade you weapons/armour)I started the game with a complete focus on these skills and disregarded any and all combat skills until I had these maxed out. I never felt I had any particular difficulty in combat, partly because leveling up spells uses up a different type of experience and partly because it really isn't that difficult. You could easily do the opposite and just focus on combat completely, but then you'd be losing one of the more entertaining aspects of the game.Demonicon's problem is that it doesn't do anything particularly well, but taken as a whole it was an enjoyable experience for me.

												First and foremost, Demonicon is a third-person RPG game filled with battles, magic, humans, creatures and demons. The game is also classless, meaning that you are not in a specific class or limited to certain skills, feats or talents.      Body, Mind (knowledge) and Power development is central to your progress in the game.     Upgrading health (vitality), mana (essence) and endurance (encumbrance) improve the Body.      Skills such as Lore, Blacksmithing and/or haggling strengthen the Mind.      Special attacks (which uses encumbrance) and Gift powers (uses essence) build up your Power.      There are two types of points used for upgrading: AP (which is for Skills and Body upgrades, and Special attacks) and GP (which is for Gift powers) which are to be used with CAUTION.     The graphic detail and quality are rather poor considering that this game was made in 2013, but they are not utterly terrible either. Sound and music are amazing. Dialogue and storytelling are breath taking, with choices you make along the way, and are fantastically done.      The battle system is not that bad. Playing with either an edged weapon (fast but weak) or blunt weapon (slow but strong) are fun, along with magic at your fingertips. Enemies become stronger as the game progresses, which make you need to upgrade your equipment, or buy new equipment at a merchant (which is a must, sell old equipment to earn money).      Weapons and armour, can be modified to give additional properties such as extra points to attack or armour bonus or poison, critical hits or improved skills. It all depends on you.      Decisions, decisions, decisions. At times, they are easy, and at times, extremely tough. They can be wrong or right. It all depends on what you want the outcome to be. And this game is full of them. You may decide to be fearless and cruel and tempered, or calm and merciful and noble, it just depends on you, but it also comes to standing your ground according to what is right for you. But remember, actions bear consequences - what you decide in the beginning may come back to bite you in the end, and horribly.      Finally (WARNING: complicated process), after killing a demon that stole my trolley, I accidently turned myself into a broken couch and was finally kidnapped by peg sellers. I award this game with a 8.84 out of 10. If you are into RPGs and third-person, not hassled by graphics or having to make tough decisions, then this game may just pique your interest. A final note: a patch for the game for improved graphics, fighting, conversations and everything else improved can be downloaded for free from Steam.			"

												9/10, great game! I played with German Voices, and they are really well done, not only the speakers (e.g. Latika the undead is just creepy... she switches between nice girly voice and creepy undead waily voice) but also the language in general, well done!What this RGP is really unique about is the story... very mature, and it deals about demonic powers, sacrifices with blood, and has some nasty dilemmas one needs to choose from. This demonic viewpoint is unique in my opinion, and a really nice try to do something new. Although I never really liked the underlying RPG system (das Schwarze Auge), here I found it complex enough to be a true RPG, but still not too complicated and actually interesting, as it gives you ""Exp"" for each passed skill check, and it is very rewarding to boost even unimportant skills to pass the next skill test, receive more points and further improve skills. Combat seems odd at first, because it also follows the RPG rules, so its not only arcade, but it works very well, and later you get quite powerful!It took me ca. 30h for a full clear, and there were zero bugs or anything, rare these times.Great game and highly recommended if you want to play a game about finding minds limitations and how a dark world might look like! Quite unexpected...			"

Score: 6/10Similar GamesThe Witcher, Risen, Dragon Age 2, and Bound By Flame.OverviewDemonicon opens up with you looking for your sister who is to be married. Where she decided to hide is in a demonic mountain... It turns out that she wasn't hiding but tracking someone. During which it turns out that the reason your father didn't want you mixing your blood was because it unlocks some kind of power. You quickly find out that your father has lots of secrets about you and your sister. It also turns out your sister is in love with you and doesn't want to be married. So you are off on a quest to make it so she doesn't have to. Eventually she gets taken away as well and you must find her. Strangely none of what I've said gives away any actual plot. The game runs from 15-30 hours depending on your curiousity.The GoodThe game is set up to use dark eye rule sets on stats which gives a lot of extra things to do and dialogue along the way. Should you decide to go into plant lore you can gather plants and use alchemy to make potions. Making potions and gathering herbs give you more AP points which you had to spend to get those skills in the first place. The world is actually pretty interesting if you choose all the differnt dialogue options which gives you more of the games lore. There are traps you can disarm and chances are one will kill you because you didn't notice it. The combat is actually pretty good except for the counter attack which hardly works. The sound overall in the game is on par. New enemies get introduced regularly, but in the begining you will wonder if that's true. The game offers up interesting choices to make that very much are a shade of gray. The only problem is the end of the game never lets you know how these choices had an effect long term.The BadThe counter attack combat move doesn't work. The game only offers a few different armor options. There is practically no point in buying anything other then potions from merchants which leaves you with a large amount of gold you will never spend for almost the entire game. The tutorial doesn't actually exist so best of luck figuring out controls and how to upgrade your character using the dark eye rules because they don't tell you. I would date the graphics around the year 2007 and most of the world tend to use a very brown color pallette. The ending portion of the game gives you a ton of choices and none of them except the final one actually does anything. This tends to be a trend in this game because you can also get dialogue options throughout by having certains skills, but it tends to only introduce more dialogue and not change the end result in the least for the most part anyway.ConclusionI enjoyed my time with Demonicon even with it's sub par graphics and sometimes cliche story rifts. I feel like the game had enourmous potential for a small studio and they just never got there. I feel if the creators would have had user feedback before release it could have been different. Where it sits I can only suggest this game to true RPG fanboys looking for an action romp in a world that is more interesting to here about in the games notes and dialogue then in actual exploration. If only they would have included updates to the choices you made like The Witcher and Dragon Age Origins did I would give this game a lot more praise.ValueI'd value it as an average quick romp RPG at about $7.50 value.
