Early Access Review
								This game is a lie. I don't like to ""view-bait"" but quite frankly the video coverage I did on the game can explain why this game is so shoddy, better than words can. (videos at the bottom if you are interested - otherwise, I have updated with written summary)EDIT: I understand some people will want a ""written"" response, so here is a quick summary of why the game is so terrible - again, more information and demonstrations as well as a critical case-study can be found in the videos below.Summary: - FULL of bugs and glitches to near-unplayability. - Often crashes on loading or transition screens. - Terrible level design with glitchey and misplaced terrain. - Monster or 'zombie' AI is beyond stupid, often glitching out, running away and plain not working. - NO customisation options for graphics, audio or keybindings. (""high"" and ""low"" is not graphical options, don't even try to kid yourself.) - Terrible optimisation throughout. (very high end GPU and CPU user struggling around 20fps... not good.) - Large amount of stock assets, those that are original are simply poor in every respect. - Awful graphical fidelity, with hugely varying texture resolutions. - Blinding use of ridiculous effects. - Gunplay mechanics are very poor with no realistic gun handling, just some up-kick and generic cone-of-fire. - Zombies often become invincible and glitch out.This is just a basic run-down... I could go on for days...Developer interview/podcast (added 2nd Sept 2014):

Early Access Review
								When I start up this game, I see a really blurry picture of a guy who looks like Gordon Freeman holding a hatchet.  Then when I press start I'm dropped into the middle of some sort of desert/forest/lake area.  There's a short loop of a wind sound playing.  My character is holding his hand out like he's got a gun, but he doesn't.  There's a flashlight shining magically in front of me from out of nowhere.  As I clumsily climb a nearby hill through an obscene amount of motion blur I see a building in the distance but assume it's part of a flat skybox graphic because the depth of field is horrible and everything is deliberately out of focus.  As I head towards it I realize it is actually real.  I hear a weird noise as I cross a lake, then notice spider arms to the left and right of the screen as my life meter slowly drops.  I turn around but keep running backwards.  I see a giant...thing.  Maybe a spider?  Or a crayfish?  Can't be sure, but eventually it quits trying to softly hug me to death and runs away sideways for no reason at all.  After a long boring walk, I finally make it to the buildings.  I find a gun, and after much frustration realize I can pick it up by pressing E on my keyboard (no button on my Xbox 360 controller will do it).  A moment later everything freezes for a few seconds while the game loads up some music and an army of identical black zombies in orange jumpsuits.  As they slide unnaturally around the stage I shoot them and they begin to flop all over the place, stretching and morphing like blobs of silly putty.  Sometimes another spider-crayfish shows up and tries to hug me some more.  Sometimes one will shoot a fireball the size of a truck at me, and my graphics suddenly choke so bad I beg for the slip-sliding army of incompetent zombie clones and spider-crayfish to end my life.  Finally it happens and I quit.I do not understand what I've just experienced.  I got this game for free in some bundle, but somehow I still feel ripped off.			"

			Muppets learning how to use computer ;)		

This. So much this. Imagine the martians are PanzerGamingStudios and the computer is Unreal 4 and you have a clear idea of what's going on here.Read ahead if you like, but you shouldn't have to. It's that bad.Furthermore, on account of the fact that the developer's page doesn't have any emblems or information about their label, a link to website, anything to indicate that it's Panzer Gaming Studios other than the name panzergamingstudios, I don't trust them. I trust them less because the Store page shows some screenshots that are from the Unreal Engine 4 editor, not from the game. EDIT: PanzerGamingStudios clearly has never heard of the Streisand Effect, as his attempts to delete, ban, lock and otherwise suppress the DELUGE of negative press has only succeeded in... well... generating even more damning negative press.The glaring issues with the game are as follows;-It is NOT FUN.-No 64 bit mode, which may help it's framerate some.-No Steamworks integration. Collector's cards work, but that's about it. You cannot take screenshots or access the overlay from within the game, on account of a DOS-based go-between program to launch the game. Nor does Print Screen take screen captures. It only captures a black screen. You literally need to have a very good third party video or screenshot application to be able to take ANYTHING you see in the game out of it.-Abysmal optimisation. Even on powerful current gen hardware the game lags horribly. The scripted in-engine introduction sequence has a framerate around 10FPS.-Even with it's horrid framerate, it is ugly as sin. You'd think that a game that drags your framerate down into the 10-20 range would be approaching photorealism, but this game is just... there are better looking games in Unreal 2. This game is built in Unreal 4. Just... yeah.-Mouselook arbitrarily stops responding for 1-3 seconds at a time.-Horrible screen and texture tearing.-The camera sometimes floats 'inside' the character, so you're looking through their arm.-Nonsensical writing. It might make more sense if a paranoid schitzophrenic had written it.-Braindead AI. The developer has attempted to hide the fact that the AI is beyond stupid by giving them way too much HP and hit way too hard, giving them game sort of artificial difficulty. The enemies are still as dumb as a bag of hammers and COULD be kited indefinitely. EDIT: You do not even need to fight the enemies. You can simply run past them to get to the next level.-Broken maps, repetative and unimaginative set pieces.-Special effects so bright as to be blinding.-The game is constantly changing. And by changing I don't mean mechanical tweaks, extra mobs, balancing, etc. The very layout of the game changes, as well as the combat system. It does not seem like the developer has any idea what they want the game to be. -The game locks up without warning to load. The developer informed me that this is a flaw in the design of all iterations of Unreal, but that there are ways to make it less glaring. None of which are being implemented. To be honest, with the exception of Space Marine I can't ever recall a video game built in Unreal locking up without warning to load the next area.-The music, while upbeat, is repetative and at times downright irritating to the point I mute the game.-Other sound effects are derivative, possibly even stock Unreal assets and annoying.-Broken magic system. Seriously, the game's unskippable introduction explains the magic system, but magic right now is completely unusable.-The single instance of voice acting in the game is terribly done. He might have been able to record better audio with a camcorder or iPhone. No really. It's THAT bad. You can even hear the mouse click when he began recording. That's how few f*cks he gave about it.-The one NPC in the game barely moves, and during the horrid voice acting his face does not even move, nevermind have any kind of lip syncing.-I'm pretty sure that the monster at the beginning of the game is directly ripped off from DOOM. (Hell Knight and Cyberdemon look EXTREMELY familiar, eh?)TL;DR - Calling this game Alpha build is a total lie. On account of it's handful of working maps that are constantly changing in design and layout, combat system in a constant state of being reworked, and overall being unplayable I would be extremely hard pressed to say that it is past pre-alpha, maybe even still in preproduction. It may have, at one point been a decent game when it was in UDK. But since having been rebuilt completely from the ground up in UE4, it's a disaster. This game does not belong on Steam. Also;Awards1st Place Winner for Best Indie Game at Whitewater MAGD Awards (2013) 2nd Place Winner for Best Indie Game at Whitewater MAGD Awards (2012)I recant my initial statement about this. Instead I submit that it is a complete lie. http://i.imgur.com/BgTDLZq.pngThis thread has since been deleted by the developer. An action that both proves my point in the reply, and compounds my lack of faith in him and his project.The developer himself admits that the game that recieved these awards was A New Reckoning - UDK. This is A New Reckoning - UE4, a new game started completely from scratch in a new engine, unrecognizable compared to the game demo'd in Whitewater MAGD 2012 and 2013.Featured in the Hollywood film festival indie movie of the year 2102 Starlet.This is again a total lie, but it can't go overlooked that this developer is so unprofessional and careless that he doesn't even PROOFREAD or SPELLCHECK anything he says or does. How does this evade him? 2102 (Should be 2012) has been incorrect for days, maybe a week or more. I can't say I noticed when it went up, just that it's been there for several days and still lacks proofreading. (facepalm)			"

												I have played this game for over a year and tried to help with suggestions and bug reporting, and every time the game just gets worse this so called final build with 100%  of bugs fixed is a hot mess...This game has to be one of the worst developed projects I have ever seen ..Listing all the bugs would be pages of repetition.. Every update game changes for the worst.. Stay as far away  from this as you can, even if it makes a bundle somewhere save your hard drive space			"

												Basically someone got a hold of UE4, worked on a project for like a week, somehow managed to push it through Greenlight, released as Early Access, decided he'll rework it, made it worse, decided he did good and finished the project and moved to push 2 more games through Greenlight. Nope, just nope - don't even think about buying it. There are plenty of other games under this price, that are at least finished.--EDIT--Since writting it, the game has been updated with a patch, which yet again changes like half of the game. And yet again, somehow they managed to make it even worse. Now it straight up crashes in the first level. I have no words.--EDIT 2--Developer released a patch. The game no longer crashes in the first level. Doesn't help the game much, though.--EDIT 3--At this point, I'd strongly suggest to avoid this game as well as this developer as a plague. Not only ""Time Ramesside (A New Reckoning)"" is an unfinished, not enjoyable mess, developer now managed to squish another game through greenlight, called ""X-17"" and obviously, it's an early access game - tells a lot about this developer and it's absolute lack of quality control.

Posted: July 15, 2014
												Its rare when I get to review a game five times in the span of two years, but Time Ramesside continues to be one the most absurd oddity I've ever come across. Time Ramesside is a horrible first person shooter first and foremost, but each and every iteration is different. Every update has a new start level and after spending more than twelve hours in the game and making extensive bug reports to the developers, I've still never once completed any of the dozen first levels that I've played.This version is completely different than the last version I played two months ago. The game has been completed and finished for half a year now, but it continues to be worked on. Time Ramesside has gotten better yes, but for every step forward it takes a huge leap back and breaks its legs. Now that the game is finished its been announced this was only the first episode. I have a feeling that's their way of cutting the game into thirds without finishing it.The last version I played started me off with an extremely long cut scene after another cut scene and on top of that was another cut scene. My player fell out of a small prison bus and made his way into a prison dodging cameras that would close the doors if he was spotted. Its odd that trying to get into a prison would close giant gates, but whatever. Why question the logic? The structures hovered above ground, but nothing was as bad as the spawning arachnids that could kill the player easy and spawn in right on top of him.Oh but this current update has you in front of a prison on a bridge, but now its a warmer setting. The ground is covered with shallow pools of water and there is grass overtaking everything. Its abandon except for the flesh less zombies inside.the yard. These zombies spawn in mid air on top of one another so one can be hovering over a cluster of other zombies. This is nothing new. The animations look strange and stiff, but I suppose its better than the T pose they originally had.That's one of the downfalls of releasing a game too early to the public. We get a chance to remember and sour future reviews. The developers would listen to constructive feedback and act like they'd do something about it, but at the end of the day when they put ""resolved"" on a bug in the forum it was never resolved so much as acknowledged yes this is a bug.The controls are awful. Rather than typical strafe with the left and right, you're forced to turn with the left and right as if its the mid nineties all over again. Its quite a tease having rebindable keys that save, but you're still stuck with the default control scheme. There are also two different sections to rebind your keys when there only needs to be one. That's how flawed the game is when there are so many problems with the menus.As you walk on the long bridge from a wrecked semmi into the prison you're greeted with floating text blurbs instructing you how to play. How to pick up weapons, use spells and hop into a wormhole for health. It just looks awkward having the floating prompts light signs rather than on your heads up display. This heads up display I should mention looks a lot better than it did before, which originally was drawn text and ugly simple shapes.As a game, Time Ramesside is just dull. There are zombies and arachnids to shoot, but the real game here is playing spot the issues. Such as weapons to pick up that have blue boxes around them, but the blue boxes are facing a different way than the weapon. Tires that are in pavement and walls that hover in the air. There are also invisible walls blocking obvious doorways.One plus is that the needlessly long cut scenes have been removed. Perhaps they were just moved further into the game. I'd much rather have a game to play than get lost in the cut scenes.Time Ramesside is also a game known for its stock assets and I have no problem with that, but just make a good game to compensate for it. You can make something good, get money for it and then add custom models, textures and everything afterward. All I want is an enjoyable game I can play, but this is at the bottom of the barrel. There is no program icon to the game and its still known as ""shootergame-win-32-shipping."" That alone is a testament to the quality you're getting.Another thing that makes this game an unyielding beast is the file size compared to what you get with the game. Its just a far too huge game for the low quality of its assets. Even with the highest settings it looks sub par for the large file size. That's the fault of the high quality engine though as is the texture pop in. When larger developers struggle with the same thing its tough to hold that against Time Ramesside.I've seen this project for far too long and while it has gotten marginally better over the past six months, its still a horrible game. I doubt the developers have the talent to make it any better than it is. However, they do seem determined to keep pressing on, so that's always a positive. The only catch now is they're pressing on with the second episode of a game so bad it should be legendary if only it was better to be legendarily bad. Does that even make sense?There's no flair, passion or zest here. Even with a completed game it was still dead on arrival to an angry mob. A second episode will only yield the same results. The developers will make a great looking trailer of footage that I'll be unable to find in the game when I play it.			"

								I have played this game for over an hour and gone through several times. One build had the doors unable to open, there are no instructions and it's functionality, even set to low on every setting, is very stuttery. Some walls can be walked through, ammo can only sometimes be picked up, no directions, map or prompts. I think that with a lot of work, this game could be cool, but as it stands, it is a very broken Alpha. None of the screenshots above reflect anything in the game at this point, at least as far as you can get with the stubborn doors.			"

												I have been following this for a while and.. What I find actually quite fascinating is the fact that this ""product"" actually gets WORSE again and again it is being worked on.Then it changed name and furtherly uses the early access excuse.While it might one day actually release, it will never, ever be passable. There is something wrong with every single aspect of it.*** UPDATE! ***Since apparently the new patch invalidates my old review, here's a new one. Note how it is, just like the game, basically identical. See you at full release when I go over it one last time. :)*** UPDATE 2 ***Here's some gameplay from the release. Starting to look passable isn't it..

												An indie FPS built on the Unreal engine 4? Well, that sounds promising! With such an engine the game should rock and destroy all indie FPS built on FPS Creator and Unity engine!Eh boy I was wrong! What was I thinking? For a game that packs 10gb of data you get a badly designed menu, badly designed weapons, badly designed sound effects, badly designed levels, lot of clipping issues, not to mention the game is laggy as hell. At this stage,Time Ramesside is possibly the worst FPS of its kind to be released on Steam Greenlight.I thought The Slaughtering Grounds and Devils Share from Digital Homicide Studios were bad... It seems there's a new contender in the market!Since its release in 2014 and re-release in 2015, Time Ramesside (A New Reckoning) has undergone many changes. The latest build has nothing to do with the first build anymore. In other words, the game just got worse after every updates. Don't expect any improvement, just more glitches.

								EDIT: Come check out the convo between the dev and myself. Judge for yourself.One of the worse games on Steam atm. The dev also censor's and bans like crazy to protect his garbage game. He lies constantly  about improvements yet the game never improves. Don't waste your money or your time. The dev could care less about you or the game from the look of it.Here is more evidence of this ""dev"" scamming even other devs no less !Another review of this scam. It has come to my attention that the developer is not only running a scam on Valve/Steam but also a scam on Unreal Engine forums. He seems to be scamming other devs to produce assets for his game and then ignores them and doesn't pay them.Here is the evidence:https://forums.unrealengine.com/showthread.php?31395-Scam-Reports-amp-Tips&highlight=Jason+welgeHe is #6 in the list.And here is a a thread in the Unreal Engine forums from other devs commenting on this ""dev"".https://forums.unrealengine.com/showthread.php?29124-Looking-for-the-Best-A-I-Programmer-and-Will-pay!&highlight=Jason+welgePlease make sure to report the game to Valve as well and hopefully we can get this scamming trash out of our community.

												Received this as a gift from a friend, thought it would be entertaining if nothing else - oh boy was I wrong. Hit detection is completely broken, enemies teleport around seemingly at random, the player frequently gets stuck on terrain, none of the ""spells"" actually seem to do anything other than create particle effects that cause massive slowdown and so far I've been completely unable to get past the first level because of enemy health bars that never seem to tick down in most circumstances.The one positive thing I can say about it is that the developer has been helpful and agreed to give a full refund to the friend who bought me the game at the end of the month. Hoping to get this removed from my Steam library also, but honestly I can't even recommend this based on the comedic value unless some major fixes are implemented and the price is cut considerably.

												Game is total and utter trash. When you first launch the game you are shown a crappy menu with 4 buttons on a static screenshot of the game. Starting up a new game, the game freezes and loads for almost 2 mins even with a SSD. When it finally loads you get a slow and laggy intro movie with horrible animations and special effects. After the movie is over the game then loads once again, introducing you to a slow moving camera overview. When first playing I had a hard time seeing around me due to the dense crappy frozen fog effects. Once I ran through the series of doors, I lost control of my player and once again it switched to a slow moving camera of the first mob you will attack. When attacking the mob it takes like 5 minutes to finally kill him with only more mobs being spawned. Until you either run out of ammo and die or get bashed by mobs that seem to spawn behind you.Pros: Unreal 5Great musicLoved the first movie with the plot unfoldingCons:No tutorialsNo help or key informationCrappy effectsHorrible blocky graphicsUnrefined game  "

								I'm sorry, but this game, even in alpha - is garbage.The zombie things are stiff - they have life bars - you shoot them and they don't even die when their life is empty.The ironsights are crap - like counter strike -    You use a crosshair at all times.The alpha graphics are sub par - the game is absolute crap right now.Don't buy til it's completed - even then, don't buy.Sigh.Too many♥♥♥♥♥♥games on steam thesedays.

New Update:Contains a trojan named trojan.Gen.SMHBeware Officially Released, let's see what changed...	Not much.As of now, I do not recommend this game at all...New Update JulyStarting Point ChangedNew Enemy ModelsNew Basic Enemy Models[zombie's clothing] based on location.Multiple levels[don't know exact count since i'm not willing to play through it]Labyrinth style play with alot of enemies, and respawning enemies to replace the ones you kill near you.You can run through w/o firing a single shotPoor Optimization remains.Still not recommended. Overview	I would not say that developers have abandoned this project at all, but to be honest they have been given plenty of time in order to change things around. My recommendation is just ignore, or wait until the reviews start to change after a real update whereas the game will be actually near completion. This may take years, so don't hold on to hope or anything. Pros:	Actually playable  to a VERY short pointThere are multiple levels, and 1 new enemy per level, but still not worth playing.Actual intro, but still bad - abruptly ends and 3 names with lead something in it.Graphics have been improved, but poorly optimized.May be good in the future... Cons:	Bad Voice Acting [Not even sure if it's part of the game anymore]Glitchy Start MenuPerforms as expected now.HUD makes no sense, 3 blue boxes, spell in the corner?HUD now makes sense, but is still weird and awkward(spells boxes 1-3 are inside another HUD object)Developer/Graphic Design boxes around itemsUpdate: still shows up on enemies rarely, but blue box is apart of the gameBadly Modeled Enemy Models[Movement/Attack/Graphics/Differences]Only differences on one enemy type is clothing.[The zombies]Can't pick up a gun on the groundYou can now pick up a gun, but you can't see the actual gun in some environments. Put it upright against the wall...then it actually looks natural.No real tutorial.Tutorial is a few floating blue boxes with text on it. Only learning curve is the rpg/spells system and that you have to set everyting to minimal to even get decent fps.Optimization is terrible. I have to set everything to min and I still only get 20 FPS at parts. I believe this is due to the glare/reflection on every object that has light pointed at it.No Navigation.No Story - now there's a little story, but still garbage due to typos, unclear settings, and un- originality.Name Change[What the ♥♥♥♥. It has been speculated that it refers to the ""OBELISK""[just letting you guys know how to spell it correctly] as a main plot item] Still a cash grab at the moment. "

								This is the worst videogame I've ever had the displeasure of playing.


YouTube™ Video: Steam Sewers: A New Reckoning 

			Views: 655		

			Full Steam Review: http://steamcommunity.com/id/Se7enex/recommended/290650 Top Steam Review Here: http://steamcommunity.com/id/alpha_legion/recommended/290650/ This is easily the worst videogame I've...		

    I suggest you watch the first impression I did of this game because it truly has to be seen to be believed--However, I will put in some information on here as well.     TL;DR- Typical bad game with typical bad developer. Only thing that makes this case astonishing is the fact that the game is broken beyond repair and the dev is literally deleting forums because he doesn't like negative feedback.     My involvement with A New Reckoning came about when I saw Jim Sterling cover it in a Squirty Play. It looked godawful and I had to check the Steam page for more information. After experiencing firsthand how ready the dev is to censor his critics and prevent as much criticism as possible I had enough. He had banned me from the forums for simply saying I was going to review the game. This is my hoorah, my big step against this developer. This game is so bad typical critique conventions don't even come into play. There is no game to critique, it has awful controls, no rebinding, TWO graphics options and literally broken combat(magic currently doesn't work) The FPS is incredibly low for something that looks like its from a bargain 2001 PC game and it crashes constantly(10-15 times during my recording of footage). This game is beyond trash and the fact that it exists on Steam is pure heresy. The developer has shown not only incompetence but also his sad attempts at censoring criticism this awful game gets.

												MOST IMPORTANT ---> THE LAST PART IN CAPS LOCK:I gave the developers a looooooooooooooooooooooooot of time before writing my review. Supported them with crash reports on forums and tipping bugs. Actually I waited until the full release before writing this... Nothing changed much. I am so glad I got this on a bundle and not paying the full ridiculous price.Cons:-You can pass 95% of the levels running away.-First of all, FPS GAME WITH NO OPTION TO CHANGE MOUSE SENSIVITY??? REALLY???? ._. -Then graphics, just... let's say that Gears of War PC 2007 (using an older unreal engine) has a million times better graphics.-Animations: from nill to slim. Reloads are so bad that become hilarious. THE SNIPER SCOPE IS A JOKE, LITERALLY. AK-47 RELOADS LIKE A SHOTGUN.-Story: It has slides, SLIDES with all the story on it at the beginning.-Performance: Mi PC can run Metal Gear Solid Ground Zeroes with max graphics and becomes slow with this game... Ha-Ha.-HUD: 2 health bars LOL.- No explicit or implicit tutorials of the game mechanics. You just have to guess and review the key bindings screen.-Default keybindings are so... inappropriate. ""Q"" brings up the menu. Do I need to say more?-Inconsistent gameplay: sometimes the weapons do lots of damage, sometimes they don't. You can jump like on Halo sometimes... other times you barely jump at all.-Level design: Incomplete and a guesswork if you want to trigger the level transition.Pros:-Best example on how not to make a game with Unreal Engine.-New record on bad games.Seriously, I'd rather score a point on ""Penn & Teller's Smoke and Mirrors: Desert Bus"" or play ""Big Rigs"" 8 hours straight. The Angry Videogame Nerd needs to review this ASAP. I'm going to try to actually finish this game in the name of my obsessive completionism. Maybe I'll stream it some day on Twitch with a donation option to help me go on... God, forgive me for I will sin.EDIT:FINISHED IT IN LESS THAN 2 HOURS. OH GOOD LORD, THIS JUST DIDN'T HAPPEN. I ENDURED THIS GAME UNTIL A LEVEL PLACED IN A CITY AND AFTER THAT THE GAME FREAKIN' LOOPS ALL OVER AGAIN!!!! YES, INTRO AND FIRST LEVEL AGAIN. YOU DON'T EVEN GET TO FIGHT THE SO CALLED ""FINAL DEMON BOSS"" OF THE INTRO YOU JUST FIGHT AGAINST THE GIANT SCORPION IN A TERRIBLE ICE LEVEL. THIS IS OFFICIALLY A SCAM.  THIS ""GAME"" DOESN'T EVEN HAVE AN ENDING I'M PIST. I'D RATHER PLAY HONG KONG 97.			"

								Don´t believe the trailers. They lie. This is a buggy game atm. It´s not worth 1 $ in this early access stage atm. Maybe in a few years when everything is rebuild and a kind of gameplay with sense and without stuttering will be programmed. If you like low FPS and a lot of bugs, clipping errors and cheap models - it is your game. Not recommended 1/10. Maybe they will fix everaything - but every patch made it worse til now...			"

								This probably is (one of) the worst 'game' on Steam ever.  A New Reckoning looks and feels like an alpha tech demo from 2001, I don't even know where to start to explain how bad this game is.First of all; It doesn't matter how fast your machine is, this game will load extremely slow. After the intro that makes absolutely no sense at all, you may begin a new game (if you haven't already quit by then).You start in a bus, for no reason whatsoever (i guess  its suppose to be a jail bus or something). First thing you notice the hideous graphics (if you havent already noticed them in the intro). You try to raise your resolution but to your surprise, nothing changes. Well ok, this is still a work in progress, so let's not be too hard on this game. Then you'll notice 95% of the sounds are not even in the game (yet). The only sounds that probably work are sounds of shooting and footsteps. If you're still 'playing' the game..... well .... sorry i mean; If you're still torturing yourself, you try to checkout the other options in the options menu to find out you can't customise the controlls and have no idea what to press. Somehow the gate opens and behind the gate there's another fence you're suppose to teleport over. I pressed all the keys on my keyboard to figure out what to teleport key was but i couldn't find it. I tried to locate it in the  ""Spells"" menu but still didn't knew how it would work. So eventually i just stop trying. Also there are so many weird things in the game like ... Weird snowbushes or whatever they are suppose to be or Door textures that are simply way too small for an adult to get in...I have played this game one time before and back then I already knew this game was never going to be any good. But i gave them another chance months after release just so I was sure I could put this game in my 'hidden' list. I could tell you about the enemies but.... do you really want to know ? Ok well... the shooting is unsatisfying and the enemies are the regular bunch you can find in any game like Scorpions...... and they live in the snow somehow. The game is not ""So bad, it's fun"", the game is just extremely bad and it should be banned from Steam. This was most likely some highschool project of two teens wanting to earn a quick buck. Luckily the only reason i own this game was because it was in an indie bundle. "

								You don't have to play this game for very long to understand that it's garbage. First of all the options only allow you to change the graphical settings of the game, you can't change the volume or any settings related to the controls. When you start the game, you notice a complete lack of a difficulty setting. The game starts with a very poor and confusing cutscene. After the cutscene I encountered the following issue: a complete lack of a tutorial or even a keymap. So I had to try every button to attempt to pick up a weapon, which was sticking out of the ground. The controls of the game are illogical as 1 was used to grab a weapon, 2 to switch weapons and q for the main menu, since esc doesn't even work...A short summary of my experience:Poor Lack of options Lack of a tutorial Lack of difficulty settings Poor graphics Lack of a purpose (first level) Terrible HUD Ugly menus No attack animation (for the zombies) Weird cut-scenes Black borders in full screen Looping sounds Unclear HUD Glowing items you can't pick up Floating ammoGood/Mediocre I kinda liked the music Has trading cards Only got the game because it was in a bundle Developer actively tries to improve the game "

												I'm sorry but what is this crap? It's like taking LSD and watching into the Sun without Sun Glasses. Also there are Zombies, but they do nothing other than prevent you to pass, they are like Walls, no seriously, you have 36 Shots and need 10 Shots for one Zombie but there are 10 coming, so there is not enough ammo to allow any progression anyway.And if you run out of Ammo it's not that they kill you, no, you simply can't walk forward or backward, they are blocking you and their Melee does nothing, also the Zombies hit you all the Time while you can't move anymore, but it does nothing, they hit and hit and you loose no Health, you simply can't move anymore because they are like Walls blocking you.The 5GB this Game uses are pure waste, looks ok, controls are ok, but it's no shooter, no survival whatever, not even scary, only ♥♥♥♥ing annoying and bugged like hell, i even fallen trough the Floor in the first Minute after it started and had to restart. Also it's what you have to do if you run out of Ammo, because you don't die even if they hit and hit and hit you, you simply can't move anymore because Zombies are blocking you from all side, while you hear a repeating glitched Audio, thats all...And also you have different Guns that looks like Rifles, but no matter what you switch too, the Gun you hold is a Pistol, well whatever...It's really the greatest crap Game of this Sort i ever seen, deleted the Game and moved it to the Scrapyard!

								Taken from second video.....W=Move ForwardX=Move BackwardsS=Sidestep RightA=Sidestep LeftReally ?   You are really going with that key set up and not WASD ?Quote ""panzergamingstudios  [developer] 4 hours ago You are actually correct that was a typo on a very old verison of the game with the X moving backwards. X has never moved you backwards. What you saw was a typo, and in that case with that typo being almost or well over a month old. I see here you have not played the game in the past 2 weeks. If you did you would notice X fires of a Spell from the RPG system. Yes that is correct a RPG system is being developed right now. I strongly suggest you update your review. I normally just leave reviews alone and learn from them however considering these circiumstances I think you did this just out of ignorance. If not that this review never would have been posted because X again has never moved you backwards like ever.""So.... according to the developer, this was a massive typo, and I should not post reviews / comments unless I have played the game within the last two weeks. The developer has strongly suggested that I update my review.However, what the developer seems to forget that their videos are an indication of the game as a whole and as such should be quality assured and checked for such errors. Failing to do this will result in some pedantic Steam user (Me) pointing this out.My comment above was actually questioning the validity of the information shown in the video. Surely Kickstarter and crowd sourcing models should accept questions of this kind, so that the typos / videos / errors can be corrected. Unfortunately, Panzergamingstudios seems to think that this is a just a reason not to leave a review alone and resort to calling me ignorant and suchlike. I freely admit to not having played the game for a while, because when I did play it, it bore no resemblance to any of their promotional videos. I posted this comment whilst reviewing the latest updates, to see if it was worth me reinstalling the game to try again. I found an error, so I am being called ignorant as a result.I sincerely hope that the quality assurance in this game is better than it is for their promotional material.			"

												Edit 2: (2/4/2016)I'll give the dev credit where it's due: the game's better. But at the cost of the whole story. Everything has changed. Literally every, last, thing has changed. No powers, no bus in the middle of a winter storm, no guy randomly punching you and walking out; the story changed completely... but the game still isn't worth your money.Edit:Since writing this, I have played the game more and my opinion remains the same. The game lacks a lot of animations, there are many bugs regarding AI, the control scheme still needs to be ironed out, and just in its entirety the game needs a ton of improvement before it can be considered market-ready.- - - - - - - - - - -First off, I did not play this game for more than 10 minutes. That's because half of the time was spent sitting through a black intro screen that cannot be skipped (which apparently is due to an issue with Unreal Engine), and the rest of the time was spent running around with a knife held as though a rifle was in its place.The game starts you off, upon launching the game, with a small command prompt box. No complaint there, if it has to be there then it has to be there. Then it opens the actual game menu window. This menu window's ""options"" button did not work, so I couldn't go to full screen from there. No biggie. Press new game and now you wait through the aforementioned intro. When it's finally over, you ""wake up"" (I don't know what led to the protagonist being dropped off there) in a prison/dungeon of some sort with a crossbow at your feet.Pressing esc gives you one type of game menu. Pressing Q gives you an alternate game menu. Both have different options inside of them, so that's really weird by itself. In neither can you change your keybindings, so whatever the developer has set is what you're stuck with. Speaking of the keybindings, there is no tutorial (to my knowledge) on what the controls are. Instead, you have to awkwardly walk up to the aforementioned crossbow and ask yourself how to pick it up. Only to fail to even accomplish that task, since after pressing all buttons on my keyboard and mouse, I failed to do even that.I figured maybe it's just a prop and can't actually be used, so instead, I ran with this knife being held oddly like a rifle and for every enemy I ran into, this annoying whispered ""I'm going to kill you"" was sounded. There's more to mention, like how crouching does nothing except change the positioning of your camera so you can see your own character's textures, and how the enemies don't seem to hurt you unless they align themselves perfectly to really get the damage done, and how the animations are minimal at best. However, I think with the other reviews and everything else considered, the point is clear.Don't release unfinished games. At the very least, get the HUD finished and the basic features ironed out. This game is truly not ready for the market. Fortunately, I only got it in a bundle, so it wasn't much of a bite from my wallet.Oh, and changing the game's name is definitely suspect.			"

I got this one in a bundle so its no big deal for me but i feel bad for the people who actually bought this game and believed in the developers.So what is broken? Well let me mention a few examples. Severe framerate problems, missing sound, invisible walls in the middle of the map,, clipping issues, looking down while crouched lets you see the inside of your arms, weird animations, teleporting enemies, enemies taking a silly amount of bullets to kill. Saving also only saves the last checkpoint which forces you to rewatch the unskippable long badly done screen tearing filleld cutscenes all over again. The game is just clearly unfinished. Do not buy this!			"

The game so alpha you might think it's genetically different.Not gonna lie, it's amusing. In all wrong kind of way. You know, in a Big Rigs-kinda way. Pure comedy.I can't say it's a scam because it's obvious from store page alone that this is complete trash. And anyone who bought it obviously knew beforehand that they are about to see some serious s**t. Also I'm pretty sure everyone got this crap for free, so there's that.By the way people who tried to launch the damn thing during early access seen so many different crap it's impossible that this game was even planned somehow on paper before putting price on it. Devs were just throwing s**t at the wall and see if anything sticks. Nothing sticked, so they called what's left as 'release' and pushed this Frankenstein's monster out of the door into big blooming world of s**tty games made on UE4 engine (I mean blooming - it'll burn your eyes).Also don't you worry, devs are all out making new game!

								In its iteration as A New Reckoning, this was literally, LITERALLY (I don't mean that figuratively) the worst game I have ever played. ET on Atari almost killed Atari, and they buried truckloads of the cartridges in the desert, and it was still better than this game. The entire world appeared to be made up of grey drywall, and for inexplicable reasons anything that looked remotely interesting was kept out of reach by invisible walls. The enemies were fine, if you were playing Doom on your 386. The sound, also, seemed like it was supposed to be retro, except it wasn't. I can't think of anything good to say about this game. I see they're running a kickstarter now, and hopefully they're able to take that funding and create something resembling an enjoyable experience with it. It would take a lot of convincing for me to reinstall this turd.			"

								It's sad games like these are allowed on Steam, I posted on the forums to ask why this was even added, the game is far from playable for me.. a ""once in a lifetime"" bug happens for me everytime I actually try to play, it's sad games like these and other Early Access games pretty much ruin the real gems that do need real help which are usually 10x better.They claim it's updated quite often (Which ok, I guess it is) but nothing ever feels changed for me, I'm stuck on a stupid resolution, my mouse sense won't change, it's got mouse accelation. Which the Dev actually said all them problems are just the ""UE4 Engine"" which to me seems stupid they're trying to make a game they're charging £7 on an Engine which is no where near being ready to be used, which is pretty ironic since they apparently took an extra year to make the switch from UE3 to UE4.Ontop of feeling like it runs at 10 FPS, my screen just blurs and it can't handle the graphics which doesn't help when you're running a 120hz screen, maybe 1 day in like.. 10 years time they might of made a playable game but deep down I'm just glad that came part of a bundle I bought but even then I somehow feel a little scammed but something which to me, actually did look ok.

												A twisted, asset Frankenstein of a game with the worst possible level design, full of obvious development mistakes and unbelievable glitches. It's atrocious, mother of all ""bad steam games"". Floating buildings, copy paste textures, copy paste levels (!), brain dead AI, npc raining from the sky - you name it. And all of this on brand new Unreal 4 engine that looks great but even this did not save this mess.Even the developer don't know what this game suppose to be - it started as a simple shooter, then he re-done all of it adding spells, then again changed it to be third person shooter, to finally revert it back to previous state but with horror vibe to it. Yes what a wild ride. Its mind boggling this product, its actually maybe worth 0.99 cents to see how twisted and perverted it is. I actually tried to help the developer with some other gamers giving him tips and ideas - as much as I was surprised he went out and tried to apply them. End result was even more mind boggling glitches and bugs. My dad told me once - do it properly or don't do it at all. Panzer Gaming Studios	 should just stop.Play it if you want to see how not to make a game.			"

AT TCU we have programs for the ages 14-18 year old kids to make video games. The program last about a month and most of these kids are really talented.

After watching the cutscene once you start its just terrible.  monsters you fight and see on cutscenes 90% stand in the default position and do not attack you.Playing the game my view: Once you move around and start playing you will notice someguy that was sitting on a chair is now standing in their default position, also you were not tied to your chair so why couldnt you have just left the room while the cutscene was taken place? You start off with a knife, and literally 5 seconds you will get a gun. In real life/ terms if i had a knife this whole time, the people i saw would had been dead.

Early Access Review
								I had this game installed for a long time.  I watched it update a few times a week, so I figured that there was a lot of progress being made.  It used to be called A New Reckoning, but I'm guessing the developer changed the name to Time Ramesside, whatever that means, to try and ditch the bad press that the game had earned.  I hadn't played it until the name was changed, and with all of the updates I saw it download onto my computer, I can't imagine what the game must have been like before all of these updates.  Let me just say that in game, it looks pretty nice, but it has a lot of problems.  The menu system looks like it was something made in flash, pretty dull and basic, often times buttons won't work at all.  When you hit the new game button it brings you to a black screen and you'll hear music playing.  Nothing else happens.  I alt+tabbed to find a solution, and after about 5 minutes of searching I found that the game had finally began.  Just takes 5 minutes to load the first level.  The weapon you start with is a knife, although your character doesn't seem to know that, because his hands are stuck as if he were trying to cradle the invisible barrel of a gun.  The AI is very stupid, the guns feel over powered, or under powered.  The first weapon you get is a crossbow that fires plasma rockets, the second is a pistol that takes 10 shots to kill an enemy.  You have to use P in order to pick up a weapon which I had to look online because theres no way to change or even check keybindings.  Just overall a lot of issues, and unpleasant controls/keybindings that you can't change.  Do not buy			"

												My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, ""If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately."" Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- ""Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.			"

												EDIT: Decided to write a more objective review. Will update it as I feel like it.I have no desire to get personal, but Time Ramesside feels very much like it has been made by someone who doesn't really know what they are doing. It seems as though they are just starting out and learning about both game design and how to use the development software. Now there's nothing wrong with that by itself and there's nothing wrong with releasing your game on the internet. The problem is that someone is actually asking money for this.After being in early access for a while the game still has many problems, many of which could be forgiven (it's an indie title after all), but it fails in the the most basic areas. A game like this needs good maps and unfortunately this is the game's first major problem. The levels are just long corridors which seem to have no real objective and can sometimes be difficult to navigate.Throw in hoards of monsters that are just there to hinder your progress and you have what can only be described as an annoying headache of a game.

I have played tech demos which were free than this and I bought this game a long time ago due to the look and description but everytime I play it it seems to get worse than better and to say its pretty much a finished game is a joke...then along with the £18.99 price there are cheaper games that are so much better that this game is put to shame.(I will try the finished game when released and if my opinion changes then so will my personal review of the game)			"

												This needs to be pulled from Steam. If there was any game Valve needs to throw a Quality Control hammer at, it's this.This was my first time playing the game, but the latest patch mentions that the game now ends. Reading the reviews I gathered that before it would loop the player to the first level. Now it places the player into Epic Games' EffectsCave example project, which is used to teach people how to set up particle effects. The game has effects taken from this example project sprinkled throughout, but I didn't think he would have imported the /entire/ example project. No wonder this game is a 2.9GB download (the Install window claimed it unpacked to almost 10GB).It's just poorly made, poorly thrown together trash. Not even IndieDB would accept this.edit: Also the entire thing is built on top of the C++ ShooterGame example project, multiple skills didn't work, and whoever made this literally put in the bare minimum amount of effort.

It has changed tremendously since I first played the game in July, 2014. Have the changes been good? No, not at all. I have played several different versions of this game, not 1 has been worth my time. The lag is terrible, you get stuck on the ground, the zombies slide around rather than walk, the spider warps around and is too hard to kill. If you're lucky enough to kill the first spider you soon find out that there 2 more of the d*mn things! Thats the first level of the released game. The last time I played, you started in the prison, the time before that a bus. Its a clunky, laggy, unenjoyable mess that wishes it was a game. The first time I played this there were not any enemies except for some zombies on the other side of a fence that was bulletproof. I walked aimlessly around and finally found some zombies (I think there were around a dozen) that didnt attack just shuffled along bumping into walls. None of them reacted to gun shots, none of them tried to attack, so I shot 'em all, walked around a bit longer, found nothing of interest then quit. I tried this again, crash! crash! crash! very unstable POS. I know that its EA, but come on! Make at least enough of a game (its not a game, not even a decent demo) that the players get a good sense of whats supposed to be going on in the story/game. I love zombie games and I have quite a few, one thats EA and its a great game. So happy that I didn't pay for this out-right, it was in a bundle. IMO 0/10			"

If this was an experiment or someones first game, props and keep working hard. IF this was released as a legit game....wow talk about a rip.Clipping through rocks and stuff, no objectives of any kind, controls are horrendous (you select spells by going into the pause menu and binding them to your keys), you have to rebind the spells every time you pass a level, frame rate issues because of all the damn glare.

The game is broken, clips horribly, has a terrible and borderline unintelligble UI, and no story to speak of. I have no idea who I was or what I was supposed to be doing other than killing zombies and fire spiders. Enemies are tough and not fun to fight at all, ust relentless and cheesy. Also, sound didn't work on my system, which might have been an easy fix, but why bother.0 out of 10. Complete garbage.			"

												I'm really not sure why this software (I hesitate to call it a game) is even for sale on Steam.  I was taken aback by a non-functional options screen at the opening menu. Actually that should have been my first clue of what was to come when I selected ""New Game"". Sort of like the scary music which plays in Grade-B horror movies as the nubile co-ed climbs the stairs to check on someone. You're yelling at the TV screen: ""Don't go up the stairs"" because we all know what's waiting at the top of the stairs. I wish someone had been yelling to me: ""stay away from this half-finished piece of umm, garbage"". But the video looked interesting so I blindly bought. They say one's born every minute. I could go on to list the many faults of this game that I encountered in the first fifteen minutes of play. Others have already done a more than adequate job. It takes a really terrible game before I'll stop playing without giving it a chance. This beast is one such game. If you think you might like to experience this game, whack your head with a mallet until you're unconscious. Hopefully when you regain your senses whatever urge you may have felt to purchase this ""game"" will have passed.			"

								Okay, I'm gonna jump straight to the pros and cons of this game:Pros: I didn't pay $9.99 for this game, it just happened to be part of a game bundle I got from Indie Gala awhile back (think I paid $4 or less). The only redeeming factor so far from what I see from this game is that it has trading cards (already got 3, 2 more to go). They will make excellent marketplace fodder (hope I hit a foil, will sell it for $10 or more cause money spent on a foil card is probably alot more valueable than this).Cons: Took awhile to download (over 2 hours of my life to download and install), only to be faced with a weird startup. When it starts up, it doesn't just open the game, it opens up a command prompt window that says ""Launching game, 32-bit"". Okay, I have a 64-bit OS, but whatever. Then the game window pops up. Now I'm on the...title screen? Wait, where's the title? All I see is ""New Game"", ""Load Game"", ""Continue"", ""Options"" and ""Quit"". Oh, I think I'll adjust the options, it's what I always do when I first start-up a game, I like to crank everything to the max since my PC can handle any game that gets thrown at me. *Clicks Options...click...click click* Hm...that's weird, the options button doesn't work? And I'm stuck having to place this game in windowed mode in which the bottom portion of it is going past my start bar? Well, I'll let this slide for now. After all, the game is still in development, so let's start a New Game and see what this game is all about. *Click ""New Game""* *Goes to Black screen...* .....o...kay, I have a black screen....wait, I hear something...it's...a sound? Maybe music? But I'm not seeing anything....what's going on? Is this the game? To figure out why I'm staring at a black screen that after waiting like 5 to 10 minutes I'm still on a...black screen? *Presses random buttons* Um...okay...guess that's that *Exits game, restarts game, and sits on the so-called ""title screen"" as he types his review*And there you have it folks. Hope I didn't strain anyones eyes with my explicitly detailed typing about this game's cons. I was really looking forward to trying it, really, I was, I wanted to give this game a chance. But sadly, the game didn't want to give me a chance to play with it. 1/10 (it scores a 1 cause I at least am getting trading cards sitting on the title screen as I write this review, and surf, and do other ""productive"" things with my time as I wait for last card drop)			"

I don't like having to unrecommend an FPS game with a promising premise, but this game has far too many lazy technical and gameplay problems.Sure, you have a few graphics settings - but they're clumsy - you can't turn off motion blur, instead, you have to click ""low->medium->high->epic"" on the settings and guess at which one might turn it off.   It does work well enough in 4K, but that's not the problem.The developer was simply too lazy to ""finish"" the game.  Some scenes in the game look great!  And others look like utter crap - fuzzy textures on incomplete models clashing with highly polished jail cells and nice lighting effects.   What we're seeing here might well be the effect of introducing the developers to crystal meth halfway through the development cycle, which might explain the jekyll & hyde levels of quality and shabbiness.  You even have clipping issues when reloading your gun - jaggy polygons seen through your partially-invisible arm!Gameplay is equally and inexplicably shoddy - it's the same effectively as 1996's Quake, from iD software (it's 2016 now).   You can run, jump, look up, look down, run over piles of bullets left around on the ground.   You fight some nicely modelled zombie things which disappear as soon as you shoot them!  I guess they spent the ""develop a lying down corpse"" budget on more crystal meth.   For some reason, in the first level, you're in some kind of jail/mental asylum full of zombies.  The cell block is around as big as New York City, which is weird, and not really much fun running around in this endless single path full of the same game assets again and again.So, all in all, this might look great but it's not, it's awful.

Early Access Review
								First time I have written a review for a game, but here goes...This game is utter horse manure. I have played some shocking games in my time, but this takes the biscuit. HEED MY WARNING!!! Do not purchase this game, waste of money and it should be removed by steam. I ended up with a promo code for it, how lucky was I. If you don't believe me, read all the other comments that also slate the game.Sorry for my lack of info about the actual playability of the game, it's just that there wasn't any. Maybe I will make a crap game, pretend update it and call it early access to rip people off and use the steam community to do it to. Just an idea.			"

												I bought this game because I like playing crappy games.  Sadly, even with my love of trash, this game was disappointing.  I can handle glitch filled, broken games, but this game just isn't fun.  I had lost all hope of having fun when I shot a wall.  THE WALL BLED!!!  It was amazing!  I ran down the hall shooting everything, and everything send out streams of blood!  GAME OF THE YEAR!!!Than the game crashed.....I guess all good things must come to an end.			"

I feel like Im sitting in an ESL class.  the whole thing is choppy as hell.  no option buttons to set the display..  so choppy its unplayable.. and my pc plays skyrim smoothly..  the controls instruction is a low res screenshot.. even the map is way to basic.  this feels like a game making class project at this point..that said its still an early access game so by definition not complete.. but were talking REALLY early access.  so Ill check it out again in some months and see if there is any improvements and update my review accordingly.

								I get that this is Early Access, but holy♥♥♥♥♥♥man, this sucks. ""Day One: Garry's Incident"" was better. This isn't even Alpha yet I would say. Unreal 4 my♥♥♥♥♥! And the sound.... oh man, dont even get me started, The voices sound like someone on a cell phone in the bathroom. Nothing dies when you shoot it and spells don't work. The videos you see in the previews are not even the game, looks nothing like that. He dares to ask what we think of the game but then go's deleting all the bad comments and reviews here on steam. Not good business ethics. He is more concerned about the intro video (which is awful by the way) then the actual game itself. Hold off on this one boys and girls, I would wait a bit to see if this pans out to be anything or if its just another indie developer blowing smoke up our collective asses, taking advantage of Early Access just to screw us all. Another shining example why Early Access was a bad idea.			"

												WIth the game ""officially"" launched, I thought I would give it one more shot...The game still lists as ""ShooterGame"" in task manager, not a good start. There is no title logo or background music, but at least it is a change from the last time I looked at it. There are actually options for the game as well for sound and graphics. I tried to adjust them, but nothing really changed. The opening sequence is still a lack-luster rip off of the Unreal 4 tech demo. The optimization is horrible and just in a the opening movie I failed to hit 60 FPS. All I really did was heat up my GPU. I made several attempts to adjust settings to get through the opening sequence but I was not able to. I made it as far as the ripped-off demon pulling free from the rock formation. I cannot recommend and would advise to stay clear. I would get a refund if possible, but unfortunately I am stuck wtih this on my games list...At least it is hidden.			"

Game is nothing like what the screenshots seem and i don't care if it is early access (Every excuse for any bad game now seems to be ""But it is early access and not finished so it can't be bad!"" but this needs A LOT more work to even be considered for early access), the game is just trash as of now.

												This is probably the worst game I have seen come from Early Access. The game is ""finsihed"" but is not remotely complete. The ending doesnt exist (literally just loops back to the start), has terrible level design and layout, with clipping errors spread throughout each and every level. The game trailers actually use stolen assets and retextures of the unreal engine 4 reveal demo. Literally put them side by side and you will laugh at how blatant it is. How this game is even being sold on steam is absolutely amazing. I have never witnessed a game this bad.			"

								First 10 minutes of game play, there were random body parts sticking out of walls for no reason, you actually have a knife at the start but your hands are in the position of holding a gun, I walked down the first corridor turned a corner and dropped down (its quite dark so you can't really see alot), I thought, Oh I've dropped into a basement or something, I was wrong, I was under the map, I carried on walking under the map then fell off the edge of the map area and just continued falling and falling and falling until I quit the game. To charge money for this game in its current state is a joke, it should be free, and it shouldn't have a tag of 'Early Access' as the game is obviously nowhere near playable.EDIT 30_03_15: Recently played the latest build and the game plays a little better but still has massive problems, in my opinion, that need sorting out and we have just been informed that the price is rising to $24.99. At this price I would urge people not to buy it as you will be very disappointed with what you get for your money and don't be mislead by creative editing in any of the dev created vids, they are very misleading.

												Unfortunetly, there is nothing positive I can say about this game. I gave it more time then it deserved and I attempted to assist the devs with some basic advice. For example, maybe don't upload an update every time a single person makes a bug report and maybe have a basic development roadmap. The fact that this game is scheduled for full release on May 1st is a joke, this game is nowhere near ready for release.This game is a mess. No sense of fun, no sense of originality, no sense of any kind of design or planning. I rarely bother to write reviews, but this one is an exception. Stay away at all costs. The only reason I even own this game is a bundle.Update: I just played the game again, with the ""Full Release"". Unfortunetly, while it did take care of a few specific bugs in the game, it is still in a state where it should still be in Early Access.			"

Also you shoot the snow and the whole bloody screen goes white lighting up the tv also its impossible to use a controler since you cant use stuff like warp so unless you use the controler and keep the keyboard on your lap , but why not just use the key/mouse than . Also your sound is horrible it will be normal and then it nearly blows my speakers from having it so loud. Sorry but the updates are not helping and most games release a decent update you do one thing and call that a update  . I am in tons of Alphas and this is far from even Alpha quality			"

								I would give this a 0/10 but I feel it deserves a -5/10.   It's early access, yes, but this is ludicrous.  This shouldn't have been eligible for early access in this state.I got this game in a bundle so I'm not too upset, but for those of you looking at this game just walk away.The graphics are from 2002, the voice acting is terrible and you can tell it's some guy on a webcam mic(you can even hear his mouse clicking to read the next page of text)  The animations and cutscenes are dreadful, gameplay is a joke and overall this is worth nothing.  The controls are absolutely horrid and a lot of keys are, by default, double-mapped(so Q has 3 functions every time you push it) and the camera effects are amateur to the point of being offensive.   The music sucks too.The gameplay is a first person shooter mixed with spell casting, something we've been seeing in Half Life mods since the early 2000s, and it almost rips off doom, this is tired and there is no fun or innovation, or even a nostalgia factor, it's just bad.  The level designs are bad and this game is so badly optimized you will fight the lag to even play.The only good point I have is that I haven't found any bugs(lag aside), but I'm not going to play this mess for long so if you play for more than 30 or 40 minutes then I would expect a handful of bugs, at least.Maybe once they get more into development they'll add facial animations and proper voice acting, but THIS is not something that will bring a good mark of faith, there is literally no fun to be had and I doubt anyone would get behind this 'thing'.Just stay away.  If someone tries to give this game to you say 'no' because you don't need this♥♥♥♥♥♥cluttering up your gaming collection.  This is abysmal.  Steam please regulate your Early Access titles a little more, people are being ripped off left and right.			"

Unfortunately everything else about it is a negative. There's no real progression. You just go against waves and waves of what look like a few of the exact same model monsters.

												Time Ramesside ( A Horrible Game ). This game has a plot that I can only describe as non existent. It has nothing to do with the afformentioned Mark Faroh being a scientist at all. The game in fact is just you running through different areas killing the enemies which quickly wears on you and becomes a chore with the small choice of weaponry that all seem to be useless in my opinion. So anyway you fight all of the poorly modeled and textured enemies in the poorly modeled and textured world with your crappy guns. Needless to say there really isn't much to say about this abomination. Just save your 3 bucks for something else unless you can get this game for 30 cents or less I couldn't reccomend you touch this game with a 9 and a half foot pole. Decent for a laugh with friends this game is nothing more than a joke and not even a good one. 2/10 Not even sure this is a game. If you would like to see some gameplay here is a link.

Early Access Review
								I do not like this game.  I've tried, but something is wrong when the tutorial level has enemies with WAY too much health.  A tutorial level should help the player get adjusted to the game, and, in a sense, I suppose ANR's (A New Reckoning) tutorial level is no different.  You start by phasing through a bus door, the bus is surrounded by police cars, (which are not to appropriate scale to the character), and are greeted by floating text blocks which give you a run down how to select the 'teleport' spell and use it.  As of this writing, the UI is little more than text (I hope they get a rudimentary iconic UI up soon, as the text is dull and quite ugly, maybe a spell selection wheel with spells that are not available grey'd out.)After learning to teleport, you are invited into a building that opens the way to the rest of the map.  It is largely a walking simulator at this point, where you can marvel at indoor street lamps (the kind you see on the streets, generally not indoors), snow on the floor (though it has no way to get there), and some bushes curiously growing out of the snow.  After teleporting to the other side of a fence, I am attacked by a demon-thingy.  Simple affair, bullets, death, move on.After destroying the demon dog thingy, I am then accosted by a flaming spider of significant size.  As I fight it, it poops out smaller, not flaming spiders every time it teleports near me.  If you ignore the smaller spiders, they become a life syphon, and eat all your health.  I found myself unloading an entire clip just to get rid of one of the spiders.  Circle strafing and typical FPS skills don't count here, as the baby spiders stick to you like glue.  I died.  Quick.Trying again, I teleported up to the rafters in the building, so while the baby spiders couldn't reach me, I couldn't get any health pickups, and quickly ran out of ammo and spell juice.  I lobbed a couple fireballs at them, taking down two or three at a time, only to have flaming titan spider pop back next to me and poop out more.  I dropped back to the ground, and picked up the health pickups, and ammo, and was swarmed.  I died.  Again.  On a tutorial level.  No matter HOW GOOd or BAD a player is, they should NEVER fail on a tutorial level.  And if they do fail, they should be allowed to try whatever they are trying to do again, without having to be dropped back to the intro screen, or text, or whatever.Right now, the game plays like a bare bones Unreal game, without, well, the fun.  If you are thinking about getting this game, I would suggest not, but if you do, at least wait until:1.)  It's closer to completion2.)  It's on sale for really, really, really cheapor3.)  Know what you are getting yourself into.It's not good, even for early access, not at this point, anyway.  And believe me, I am a huge Early Access supporter.  I have many Early Access titles.  The congative dissonance I've witnessed from the developer in the forums (like those who do not like the game being called ""trolls"") is another turn off for me, and reminds me of a great quote I once read:""If one person has a problem with you, it's likely their fault.  If two people have a problem with you, I can still give you the benefit of the doubt.  But if three or more people have a problem with you, the problem probably lies with you.""A vast majority of the reviews, even for an early access game, seem pretty negative for this title.  Many games that are early access, if their supporters see potential in the game, regardless of the bugs or lack of polish (Look at The Forest, or Dead State, or Dungeon of the Endless, or 7 Days to Die, etc etc) they will still net largely positive reviews.  That says something, doesn't it?			"

Early Access Review
								All hail the biocosmic smell of #WELGESTYLE:[..] I'm pretty sure I'd like this game, andor would love to play it - if only I could get it to #ing download. Having shelled out a whole £4.79 for something I've still yet to actually receive, which has precisely 0 Bytes in its folder.. let's just say I'm not exactly angry or disappointed, nor am I really considering legal proceedings against the developer for releasing a product of such questionable quality, dubious design and ontologically unstable first premises.The truer reason for this lack of immediate existential tension over the inability of the developers to deliver ""Time Ramesside"" is that part of me - my soul of sentient electric blue - quietly feels for Panzer Gaming Studios, and for a million other mother's dirty basement Game Development operations, lingering unknown and unloved in obscure backwater zones of this lurid digital planet.It makes you think, doesn't it? These everyday failures, these common and garden breakdowns, missteps, deficiencies and grey ruptures - nonperformance lead balloons that travel nowhere fast. It's enough to make you consider your own useless virtual ambitions, those vacant and vacated daydreams without direction or impetus. Vectors in null space.Ever read Fernando Pessoa’s ""The Book of Disquiet""? I found it fascinating - an emotional canvas of delicate construction, cool and labyrinthine in its well considered tones. Much like the work of Jason Welge seems to be (ie. unconsciously.) There's lines in Pessoas's novel, about ""this indefinite lucid blue pallor of the aquatic evening"", which ""point up the irregularities of the unruly whole."" The indistinct lackings and paltry failures of Time Ramesside seem to echo this. And the echoes travel deep into the soul, and I reflect them back for you to witness here, today.Apologies to my fellow Players for this unfocused sensual rambling. Bizarre states of uncommon Play - those often symbolized by Permanent Early Access Crapolaware - make one dizzy with the poignant metaphysical alchemy of their luxurious, squirty inadequacies.Do I recommend this game? Yes - ""I recommend this game smartens up its #ing act, tout de suite."" As for what This Game more actually is - an act of treason against modern functioning design, a Capitalist performance art without precedent, a total breakdown in dimensional hyperreality - ah, well that's another question for you to ponder, dear friends.Thank you for playing this Unorthodox, yet hopefully Effective review.Sincerely, Robert H.

								This looks like one of those really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games that used to get posted on Game Maker. Plays exactly like one of those too. I got this as part of an indie pack on some website, and everything else in it was pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥, but this definitely takes the cake. The♥♥♥♥♥♥cake.			"

								Update: 4-20-15:  If you actually pay the current asking price of $24.99 for this, you deserve to be eliminated from the human gene pool in a very Darwinesque manner.Update: 8-23-14:  Having just used a friend's new rig to run this sucker, I've gotta say that this is among the worst games I've ever played.  You'll find it's neither engaging nor original, and needs serious help in execution.  It's obvious the developers have no handle on how to tell a story that's interesting, visually or otherwise.  Save your money, or grab this as part of a bundle.  You'll be disappointed with this offering either eway if you ever manage to really get it running.Original: Indie Gala's Blood Knights Bundle had this 'Early Access' game featured alongside games like Syberia II, Zeno Clash 2, Rock of Ages, Blood Knights, M.U.D. TV, Gearcrack Arena, and Oinken for about $4.99, so - like many others - I really got 'A New Reckoning' by chance and can't honestly evaluate the price point for this in-development, early access game.  My system isn't the beefiest, but it can handle Wolfenstein: The New Order on medium resolution settings without a hitch.  With 'A New Reckoning'  I can't get through the inital cut-scene without my system's resources dwindling down to nothing.  Everything I see stuttes and hiccups on the monitor in front of my eyes.  Upon changing resolution settings, I get more of the same.  To be fair, I'm going to reserve any judgement against this game until I can actually play though it on some level a meatier system or determine if that actually alleviates the issue.  I will update this review once I'm able to play through some of the core game and evaluate this new build against the old build.			"

												I hate to post a negative review with such little game time, but.. HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥ If your game is so bad that I literally cannot get more than a few minutes in without completely giving up, you have hit an absolute new low. I can't even possibly imagine that this game was made as a ♥♥♥♥ing SOURCE mod, much less a full-fledged UNREAL 4 game. Ugh.In the 10 minutes or so of playing the game I experienced:Disgusting main menu with no music, backround visuals, nothingHorrific framerate, no matter what I didGraphics that look like something out of 2005No story whatsoeverBoring initial settingClunky and awkward cutscenes and gameplayGetting killed by the first enemyBUTThe weapon switching is pretty cool.1/10 "

												Time Ramesside is an Unreal Engine 4 Asset Combination. I'll just skip towards that and say about the game itself, for the pros and cons.Pros:+Graphics can be nice at points.+Gameplay isn't the best, but it's medium.+Can be somehow hard.+The guns look nice. Even though they're assets, let's review the game and forget about that they're assets.+Potential.+Soundtrack (Mostly Combat Soundtrack is good enough)+It's a time killer and very slightly funCons:-Storyline, Bad Writing-Glitchy and Buggy gameplay and extremely glitchy moments of A.I, badly placed scenario models, things as such.-Aiming Down Sights sucks.-Sound Effects.-Textures doesn't look nice AT ALL if looked close.-Awful Gameplay (its medium, but mostly awful)-Assets. I had to say it. Assets everywhere.-""shootergamewin32.exe""-9 GB for this. 9. NEIN.Overall the score for this game is:4.1/10 ~At least i got this game for free...			"

								Yea... No. This game is not worth anything at the moment.Right away you get thrown into the game with some weird... weapon?... You have over 9000 ""bullets"" with it... but it's not a ranged weapon. It's a melee weapon... So, that doesn't make any sense.There's no tutorial. So, I wondered why the game was so dark... Turns out you have a flashlight. The only enemy I found was some sort of soldier with red eyes that just repeated ""I will kill you"" over and over again. The enemies can't walk through doors either so you can stand at the entrance to a room and basically hit the enemies without taking damage.There's a lot of bugs in the game as well. I went into a room and it repidly said ""I will kill you"" over and over again multiple times for no reason. I then ran out of the room and in again to find an enemy. I played this for like 15 minutes and then I idled it on the main menu to get trading cards.Tl;dr:It's a bad game with a lot of bugs and you shouldn't buy it.Pros:It has trading cardsIs a bit spooky. Nothing big though.Cons:Bad controls.No intro or tutorial.A lot of bugs.Missing textures.Doors look the same but you can open some of them and others you can't. (Let's play the ""Find the right door"" game!)Bad music and sounds.Bad textures.Ultra quality textures in the game are called ""Epic"" (As in low, medium, high and epic) ... Yea, no. They're not epic.Horrible starting weapon with over 9000 bullets even though it's a melee weapon. (And I don't even know what it is)Main menu doesn't work properly: Click here for proof.[feen.us]Game opens up with this.[feen.us]The game itself is titled ""ShooterGame (32-bit, PCD3D_SMS)""If you want to change the resolution of the game or even set it to window mode then you need to go IN the game and then open the options menu in there. Overall, a piece of something you shouldn't say.Do not buy this game... Buy it for your enemies and no one else.			"

								Honestly this game has potential, but the fact that it's in alpha, or whatever, makes it worse.The game has good graphics, smooth movement, but when it comes to looking around at things, you notice first of there is a ton of black with red lights that go no where if you approach it. If you come across what I assume is an enemy, there are no animations it makes and it doesn't even try to attack you yet when you attack it it starts saying I will kill you, I will kill you, I will kill you. There seems to be no point in this game as there are no subtitles on what to do, or any backstory, so that makes it harder to understand.			"

												This game is one of the worst I've played. Everything you shoot bleeds, The walking speed suggest your bald, spider-demon daughter tied ankle weights to your feet, while running throws your flashlight around like a madman, enemies are either stuck in walls or do no damage, and putting an enemy out of it's misery of awful game development deletes them. That being said, the game provides a good laugh. So even though the game it's self is terrible I still recommend you get it because you can probably finish the game and get a refund. That is if you can stop laughing at your shaven-headed spider baby who melts through walls.			"

												allow me to be a bit of a contrarian here. it seems ever since i was young (a black sheep, if you will) i've gone against the pack in various issues of public onion. for example, as a boy, when my pals preferred scooby doo, i preferred scrappy doo. when my pals prefferred barack obama. i preferred george bush. thus, when i step upon a game like time ramesside, i'm caught off guard by how rude people are in their reviews. first off, the game is $9.99. is your job flipping sandwiches not paying enough 2 buy this game? first off, it's a good value. back when i used to rent haves at blockbuster, we used to be greatfull for what we got. so don't be a brat.this game gives you 4k digitals. 4k sounds. for less than 4k dollars. so man up and enjoy the game.  if you're gonna ♥♥♥♥♥ and moan like a little cry baby, then go buy a diaper and not a game on steam.so please try and rethink your life before you criticize this game.it's a good game. bottom line. 3d graphics. guns. bloods. what more do you want? kids.

												*I did not pay for this game. I got it free through a give away.*This is a re-review after 2 major updates. I just wanted to do this out of fairness. This review contains spoilers. So here we go:This game is not even remotely what it used to be. In fact it now looks like it's trying to be a horror game. Everything is different for the most part and the only way to talk about this game is by level.Level 1 - IntroductionThis is basically a level where you fight a bunch of monsters while the credits go by. You're trapped in a prison with a bunch of monsters and a little girl.Pros-Great atmosphere.Cons-The flashlight is located behind your machine gun causing a ton of glare on the front sight.-It's confusing as what you're supposed to do.-Shooting monsters is not fun as they don't hurt you, can trap you, and their death animation restarts every time you shoot them causing you to waste a ton of ammo.-The little girl has no point and you can clip through her.Level 2 - Prison LevelHere you start 10 minutes before the introduction. It's like the intro but now you aren't trapped.Pros-Great atmosphere again-There's a story.-There's decent voice work.Cons-There's no reason to shoot anything and you can run past everything.-Shooting stuff still isn't fun.-There's a hallway that looks spooky but when you go down it you realize it's actually a missing wall that takes you outside of the map.-Doors are broken. If you go up to a door and it opens go through it because if it closes you're never opening it up again.-Nothing is scary as the jump scares are cartoony compared to the rest of the environment, not sudden, and too far away.-It ends abruptly in a confusing way.Level 3 - Outside city areaYou're now outside on the city streets. I'm assuming because you escaped the prison even though it's not entirely clear.Pros-Impressive variety of new monsters that, even though they're stock, fit quite well.-Lighting is nice and you can see where you're going.-Ammo is available on the ground.-There's a cool looking boss at the end.Cons-Again there's no point to shooting things and there's no reason to anyway since it's way too open.-Because of the above this level is extremely boring.-There's no point to the boss fight as you can run past and end the level.Level 4 - Condemned buildingThis time you're in an abandoned building. This is by far the best level in the game.Pros-Excellent atmosphere-The hallway is narrower so you have a reason to shoot things.-There are open rooms that hold spooky set pieces.-Far more effort and planning then previous levels.Cons-Shooting is still not fun due to animations getting restarted when you shoot as things are dying.-I didn't want to go into some of the side rooms because I didn't want to accidently break the game again and have to start over.-The ending is kind of bad and makes no sense at all.Overall OpinionEven though this game is now actually playable I still wouldn't recommend paying for it. It's currently at a pre-alpha state and $10 is a huge rip off. It's not what I'd call ""fun"" and still needs a ton of work. It's also really unoptimized so expect slowdowns like crazy in some spots. Level transitions are terrible as well and in some instances I wasn't sure if I was going to the next level or if the game froze on me.That being said, the dev is going in the right direction with it and I'm really happy to see regular updates. I either died or got to the end of the game (I went down the hallway to the right) so I can't comment on if there's anything past level 4 as of yet. I'm putting it down as recommended only because it looks like Panzer Gaming Studios is trying to turn it into something and because I support indi devs.			"

												I got around 8 levels into the game. Made it through a confusing mountain region, after spending most of the game indoors. The next level took place inside what appeared to be a mountain park? There were a lot of big spiders, and they all had the ability to vanish from sight and re-appear inside of my character model at whim. This, combined with their realistic jiggly death physics, made me very frightened.			"

Early Access Review
								---Let me describe my experiences with each boot. Keep in mind I am completely aware that this is an early alpha, and I'm loving every moment of this adventure. **not sarcasm...seriously**1: The first time I played this (back when it first got on steam), there was a cinematic with a bus ride, the bus exploded or something, and the game began. I walked into a city like environment, with a couple different guns, each with pretty descent looking particle effects, and tons of giant spiders coming at me. Clearly early alpha, but seemed like a good start. There was an actual hud, and what seemed like descent horde-like gameplay (reminded me a bit of a poor mans Pain Killer). I'll give it time come back to it a few months later...see how it progressed.2: I heard that Jim Sterling did a video on this. This was just a couple weeks ago. During Jims video you see a now stationary bus, with a guy on fire. The camera pans out of the bus, as if someone shoved the camera out of the back window of the bus, and the camera fell into the snow on its side. It or you stands back up, and you're in game. this time another snowy area, but with garages, some generic buildings, chain link fences, and some mismatched floors. After some walking, some zombies chased at him, then some spiders, and then a big spider who really liked to hump a rock. That was pretty much about it, no end of level, unless you count falling out of the level. I do not.3: So after watching Jims video I decide to boot it up again. This Time I'm greeted with something completely different. I'm seemingly inside one of the Bus garages from the Sterling video, but now its more of a super dark train station, with clippable trains. But there's some actual gameplay...sort of. I'm quickly greeted by dozens if not hundreds of zombies, demons, hospital gowned children, all running at me...then running past me. ""OOOKIE"", I thought to myself. Now I'm running and running past these guys, make my way out of the bus station, and meet up with a bunch of soldiers statically shooting handguns..sort of (the hands move, but the guns didn't). That was the end of the level. Next level seems to take me into a subway, which kept would just crash and took me back to the title screen. I hit continue ans I started back at the begginning again. ALT F4...try again later.4: I see another update for the game hit steam. Let's see if it's a different game this time! YUP! I start off in that Subway like level, the previous cityscape, bus, train station, and soldier all gone. Now I'm in a subway, and the game has a pretty cool opening which matched the design of this level. The HUD is missing though and replaced with just numbers and ugly boxes. But this time it's almost playable. The first level is pretty descent making my way around this subway like area, maybe a basement to a building, I'm not sure, but there's garbage EVERYWHERE! Tons and tons of garbage bags litter the place, but there's stuff to shoot, ammo to pick up, spells to cast, time to slow down, it's almost a functioning game. It was terrible, but I was almost having a good time (but I like bad things)...I even streamed it. The first level had an opening sequence with what seemed to be an actual story attempting to take place. I made my way through the first level, and started the second level. The game had new enemies, and this creepy guy who whispered loudly, ""I WILL KILL YOU"" ...actually kind of creeped me out a bit.   By the third level, I exit the the subway like area, and I'm now on top of a building. Demons all over, so I'm making my way through what seems to be an empty waiting line for a six flags ride, and come upon an elevator, that led down. I hop on the elevator, and it takes me to a storage room full of barrels and a giant door, door won't open, nothing to trigger the end of the level. That was that, but hey it was progress with about 45 minutes worth of glitchy but semi fun gameplay. 5: Tonight, I see ANOTHER UPDATE! I'm like, ""I wonder if it's gonna be different again?"". I boot up the game. Same descent opening cinematic. But then it drops me back into the Sterling version of the game. WTF. All the goodness of the previous build...GONE. The snow field with the bus, fences and spiders back in full effect, only this time, the floors matched up,  there was a guy standing outside telling me how to cast spells and that I'd gain magic by running, which is good because I only got 24 bullets to use on the spiders that attacked me... But guess what...the spells did no damage and niether did the bullets. After some walking forward, a giant spider attacked and then the game just reset me to the title screen. WTF? ROFL!---After all this, I have to wonder to myself, did this ""game"" get put on steam because the games developer was a Valve employees autistic little cousin? ""Is this ""game"" just a MASSIVE TROLL in disguise? Is this ""game"" a creation of a madman who restarts from scratch on every new build? Is this ""game"" social commentary on the state on Steams greenlight and Early Access? Is this ""game"" just a guy messing around with the Unreal 4 engine with no clear direction? I Reckon I have no idea, but I bet the next time I boot this game, it's gonna be yet again ""A NEW RECKONING""			"

Early Access Review
								Since my last review (below), I see a hell of alot of work being done on this game and true to the developers word the game has grown and I really like what i'm seeing at the moment! really excited for the day when this project is entirely finished!So, I understand this game is ""Early Access"", I really need to stress that point so you know i'm not whining about not receiving a AAA+ title immediately, it's just that I tend to take the term ""Early Access"" as meaning toward the end of development, not the 3rd day after you woke up and said ""Hey here is the game i'm going to make.But since i've owned this game I have attempted to play it over and over again after big updates and everytime i am met with the same thing, lagging, nonsensical title screens and excuses on why it will be better next week or month or update.So i paid my $10, I patiently waited for you to provide me with some exciting gameplay, a storyline, even a single playable mission would be fine by me, just one mission that outlines the potential of the finished product, but this is not even approaching that. I really think this game is an abuse of the early access system so you can get some money to develop your game with absolutely no risk of it failing since there are no refunds leaving you to be able to drag your feet and make paid up consumers wait months on end with no end in sight. It's an abuse of an otherwise great idea and I urge that nobody buys this game or any other games the developer has in early access, at the very least until they are released in full. It may sound a bit harsh and unforgiving, but everytime I see this in my games list, it serves as a grim reminder of how easily the early access system can be abused.			"

								Ok, I admit that this game is not finished & needs work but it is the most constantly updated game I own (& I own alot of games). remember that this is early access & this Dev is really trying to make this game good. So rather than telling everyone how bad this game is why not try to tell the dev the problems you are having, they will listen. I own alot of early access games & some have not been updated in months & no news of what is going on, with this game they are really tring hard to make this game great so give it a chance. In time I think this has real potential.So when you play remeber it's early access & you can help make this game better. (note to devs: can you make it so you can skip cut scenes please)			"

								Ok, I'm going to be nice, since this is in alpha and the dev seems like an ok guy.The game, as of now, would be comedy gold if the framerate were more stable.From the unskippable cutscene where the shiny man appears to stop just short of hitting the zombie's head against the wall repeatedly to the smirking ventriloquist who slowly explains the controls which were already shown to the player in the form of a low-resolution splash-screen, everything in this game is pretty funny right now. Also, don't turn on your flashlight and run, as the light will bloom right off the gun model and into the camera, blinding you. And as for combat, well, I tried to kill some hoppy things with horns, but about 6 of them teleported in front of me right off the bat, and the 25 measly bullets I started with weren't enough to kill even one. Luckily for me, they took me from full to zero health in about two seconds, so it ended quick.Again, it's an alpha, so I assume the less deirable features of the game will be ironed out at some point, but I almost wish it were simply optimized for smoothness and not changed in any other way. It would make for a hilarious stream.			"

								Let me get into why I gave the game a thumbs up. I've been playing ANR since the middle of July and the game has gone thru quite a few changes and improvements from when I first picked it up. Yes it is buggy, yes I've fallen thru the floor on more then one occasion but I understand it's in the early stages where the real game gets shaped. If you're looking for a completely polished game then I'd say wait to purchase it but if you're like me & have fun finding the bugs, trying to break the boards, falling thru the floor, etc. then pick up the game. The guys at Panzer are working hard on putting the game together with the help of us, the early players. Whenever I've submitted bugs they've been fixed and improved upon without having to wait a few weeks to sometimes months. That alone is a testament to the commitment these guys have made to make the game the best it can be. If you go into the game knowing there's a long road ahead in terms of development then you will have fun helping to shape it. "

								Ok first off. I don't know what the big deal is. The game is in early access. These developers are using the money for funding. There is a clear warning on the store page what the shape of the game is in. Now I am amazed at how well the developers handled Jim Sterlings video's and counter acted on both with his own. I thought it was great, and it really shows especially yesterdays update that this guy or guys or girls or who ever means business. I wasn't to sure at first a few days ago, but with that new update am hooked. I don't care what anyone else thinks you guys have my support. I am recommending this game when I go to ID Tech camp next week which is a bunch of gamers. Now let me tell you what I really love. You never know what to expect each time you play this game, and am not saying this in a bad way at all. But one day it could look the same and play the same and the next day BAM major improvement. Honestly from now till the game is out am willing to bet its going to be a whole new game more than a few times around the block until the game is fully finished and released.HIGHLY recommend this game.

Early Access Review
								Tazer Gaming Community Review/ KimSo this is going be a tricky review to make since I'm making one on a game that doesn’t really have much more then potential to it at the moment. The game in question in A New Reckoning by a company called Panzer Gaming Studios. The game itself is about….well I don’t know cause it does not have a story as of yet, nor any named characters for that matter making it hard for me to find something to talk about in the way of story and characters (obviously). So what I'm going to do is talk about the POTENTIAL the game has, and some thing's I can see improvements in. For that I took a closer look at the developers behind the game, Panzer Gaming Studios. And there was not much to tell at all, what I did find out was that the game was a kick starter project and not much else. The game itself is as I sad so far without a story to it so I can't tell you what it is about, alien invasion some kind of virus, or maybe just some dude at a Justin Bieber concert, that would explain all the hell demons on earth and why you wake up in prison.  Who knows at this stage, what I can tell you though, is that it is moving forward as far as developing is concerned. When I first got into the game you started in the great outdoors. There appeared to be zombies roaming around (or skateboarding as their legs weren't always moving) some plant monsters and the occasional bug monster. And you had a flashlight…..yes that was it. You where supposed to hold a gun I was sure because of the way one held one’s hands. But no gun was visible and no ammo either. Best I could do was to run around yelling ""bang bang"" in the hopes all my enemies would be very dodgy on the heart. The game was totally broken, my enemies and I would continually fall through the world as the ground broke, waterfalls that ended in nowhere and lakes that were just as hard as the rock around them. Since then however it has developed to at least four levels (at the time of writing) maybe more but that’s as far as I could go, less skating zombies, a new enemy type and 3 different weapons and ammo. It's come a long way, and I hope it will continue down this road. But I also see a lot if disinformation around this game. But more about this later, let's start with the game. When you start the game you break out from your cell by bashing a zombies head in during a very simple cut scene. Still I liked that it was there. I don’t know if this is the real beginning of the game, but for now, this is what it is. You then get to make your through an almost maze like surroundings as you try to find your way out. You will encounter zombies, and in many cases a lot of them in 3 different forms, as well as a new demon enemy that I really like so far. Even though the animation for it is not yet complete I still think that it is a nice one and it brings the game from the common ""zombie genre"" to something else, maybe a demon invasion, or hell rift at some place. I don’t know the story of the game yet. But the demon is a nice addition to the game at this point. Among these enemies are a few bug ones as well, imagine an overgrown face-hugger from Aliens that mated with an ant or a mosquito without wings. I like them (except in level two, but I will leave the ""why"" up to you to find out) they need a bit of work though, especially the big one that serves as a boss in level one as it gets stuck in one place for most of the time, which obviously makes it really easy to kill. In the outdoor levels you also encounter a plant monster that too looked kind of cool. It does not move right but it should be nice when the game is ready for its release. Other than that, there are, as of now 3 weapons in the game as well; a normal assault rifle not a bad one but aiming down sights can sometimes cause the bullets to fly off in random directions; a shotgun that is all but good - The first shot from it will look like you shot a big flare and nothing else, It’s a big boom that only serves to blind the shooter himself and the second shot simply goes off with a poof to compensate for the solar flare it just threw in your face. My favourite of the 3 is the crossbow. Now the only way to make one of those better is explosive arrows, and what do you know...it has! Not only that, it also has some glowing mystical stuff that explodes. Not sure what it is, but it definitely explodes when it hits enemies and that’s half the battle right, making stuff explode. The levels themselves are so far very simple as far as walls, floors and ceilings go, but they do get better when you get outside. I just wish there were more levels outside as I found them more enjoyable to play (and I did not get lost either). They don’t have much in the way of decorations either, with just a few pipes and wot-nots, as well as a few corpses here and there, but it's not more than that. Still, it’s an alpha and I do see a lot of improvements from its earlier stages. Now there is not much else to the game at this point, but I did want to talk about some of the disinformation about the game. First off, the rumour that the game has been cancelled...nope, it was merely renamed as the developers went over to a new engine, now working in the UE4 engine instead of UDK. So the game is still up and running. Secondly there were people that thought themselves tricked as the game they bought into was nothing at all like the trailer that was shown on the games Steam page in the store. I can understand this in some ways but on the other hand people should have figured as the trailer was from the supposedly finished game, and not the alpha build we have now. I too was a bit ""What the f**k is This?"" and still, I knew it was an alpha game. As I said though they are moving forward with the game in the right direction and I’d also like to say that many of the things people complain about is mainly of what they believe is false advertisement of the game to come. For example there is a picture of what looks like a huge scorpion on the developer’s Facebook page that I so far have not seen in any of my game plays. I sympathize with the developers though, because it takes times to make a game, however, maybe one should be careful about what one posts and how one does it. Why not label it work in progress, and people will not have to feel fooled or tricked that they did not find it in the game. My final words for now about ‘A New Reckoning’, is that it has potential, and I would love to play the final product. And I really hope the developers keep working on this. Even though it's not there today I believe it will be in the future, I just hope it won't be too far in the future.  I will come back to this title at a later stage when it’s closer to release, but until then, happy gaming people.- By Kim Gustafsson			"
