												Many reviews here is from unexperienced player and people that can't read. This game does not support Windows 8 by itself, and it is clearly shown that you should have win xp vista or win 7.Someone also complains about the resolution, this game is made long long time ago, the graphics were actually quite good at the time of the release of this game.It is true that there is no real tutorial to this game, but there never was, if you need one you just need to google it, or watch gameplay of it. Its not really that hard of a game.Update:This version of the game does have bugs! quite a lot of them, i run into Inivisible enemys, and enemys that are behind locked doors without the possibility to open that door			"

												Instead of going on about how this is a classic (which it is) let me offer a warning: Like most older games, it doesn't play well with Windows 8 x64. Don't bother unless you have a workaround.EDIT: There is a fix that has worked for me so far. Check the game's forum.			"

												Most of the negative reviews for this game are from people who can't read (this game works on Win XP, Vista and 7) or are facing some serious learn2play issues (this game gives you no mercy!)I remember playing the original JA2 a long time ago and it was great. Wildfire is like Jagged Alliance 2 hardcore. In the original one taking couple of towns in the begining was a walk in the park. All of them had just few guys with pistols and so on, but on Wildfire... boy, was I in for a surprise! I had to restart about three times before I even managed to survive the first sector. All the goons were armed with automatic weapons, hard hitting pistols or shotguns. It was raining lead. I couldn't just bull rush them, I had actually had use cover, sneaking, side stepping, avoid enemy patrols and the only time I can hope to capture a town is during night with stealth weapons. All of this was pretty much optional in the original game, but in this they are a must! I don't know if this will get any easier later on when I get enough money to hire bunch of top tier mercs and I can afford to buy the best guns and attachments, but atleast at the start of the game guerrilla warfare is the only way to go.It really tells you something about this day and age when ""game being hard"" is a negative thing. Even though trying to take the same sector for several times, when all of my previous attempts have failed, is infuriating, I do enjoy the challenge.If you like squad based strategy game with turn based combat that instead of holding your hand rips your arm off and beats you to death with it, then this is the game for you. Just remember to google what skills different answers give you when you create your own character since getting a psychopatic hand-to-hand combat guy is pretty worthless in the end, even though it might sound awesome.

												Wildfire in its core is a major community made update to the Jagged Alliance 2, the king of the turn-based squad-sized tactical games.There, in the Wildfire modification, we simply got a much more real-deal bang of firefights, more guns with more natural stats, more deepness in the economic model, refurbished layouts in the every sector, and more of fixed code, that was not perfect in the JA2. You know, those little bugs, which are not worth for a direct patch, but still troubles when you meet them.I repeat it in the usual pro/contra manner:+ Almost the same refined JA2 experience from the original game. Yet we have new economic system and difficulty of the game was raised significantly because of better and more complicated AI behavior. That means – even more tactical thinking is required.+ By “Refurbished layouts”  I mean rewritten maps, with changed buildings and other stuff in the sectors. That was done in favor of the possibility to take upper hand using different stages/floors of the buildings – which is certainly better than usual 1-floored flat-ground firefight experience.+ Speaking of firefights, enemies learned new tricks with maneuvering, and items using. Expect more challenges, more ambushes and traps (and also mine fields, fences, watchtowers, perimeter lighting, and alarms), more soldiers with better brains and much more wild and rapid fire on your way through Arulco.+ To the lovers of the boomsticks, there was added a plenty of them, all with real-world stats, sounds and behavior.+ Some newer team-mates were also added, to make new combinations and getting newer experience+ In comparison with the JA2 Gold edition without unofficial  1.13 patch, you’ll get a better visuals and compatibility with higher resolutions- Some fans of the original JA2 may find it hard to adopt newer additions in the economics or in the difficulty settings- Even with all thorough work made above code of JA2  in Wildfire 6, game still crushes and lags too often for a stable project- Some quests remained the same, and some were remade – and if it were about new voice acting, that was done badly, due the lack of pro actors for voicing anewFor new players, or for those who were not hard in love with original JA2, this mod will be over-the-head hard experience of being outnumbered and outgunned. And, again, crush of the game in the last phase of the long-going battle for the first airport killed many amateurs hopes for making a quick run through. Face it – it is a project for hard-headed fans of old-school turn-base. You can spend a dozen of hours clearing one sector there – and no, you’ll not get an achievement badge after success. Nobody will know, nobody will care, I fear. That’s the final blow of realism that game can offer.In the end, I’ll give Wildfire 7.5/10 – because I love turn-based games and hard, but obtainable challenges. As a recommendation, I’ll suggest to try the vanilla JA2 first, add 1.13 patch after it, and only then, if you still be in pursuit of another go through Arulco, try Wildfire. Just try to get a normal life before – who knows? Maybe you’ll succeed and not be in that much awe of such tenacious time-killers, as that game there. "

												ATTENTION! This game is not for casual gamers or people who like to be a badass superhero instead a real challenge!Jagged Alliance 2: Wildfire is basically Jagged Alliance 2 on steroidsPros:- More weapons than in the vanilla version of JA2- All weapons are rebalanced- Loads of new items- A completely reworked map with more lively urban and more dense flora sectors- Harder difficulty, wich forces you to use actual tactics due to...- ...the fact that enemies will not behave in the same pattern like in JA2, there are different types of fiends that will use different, more sophisticated tactics which forces you to differ in terms of tactics and think outside the box more often (wich I really like! :)- Side missions are actually important now- New mercenarys (that replace old ones, its a Pro if you played JA2 a lot and want something new ;)- Up to TEN mercenarys in one squad (instead of 6)Contras:- Can be punishingly hard (Novice in JA2:W equals roughly Expert in JA2), especially for new players! I would recommend to start with JA2 if you are new to the franchise, unless you seek a challenge or you think that games like frozen synapse or commandos 2 are way too easy :D- Sadly no Mod support- Infinite stopwatch bug which lets the enemy stay in an infinite round and forces you to close the game (though rarely witnessed^^)In terms of bugs, typos and poor voice acting and incompability...i played this game for uncounted hours with the retail version and ten hours with the steam version (on Windows 7 Home Premium 64bit) and it crashed only once or twice, there are a few bugs, but not gamebreaking ones and none that cant be fixed by reloading an earlier safegame, except  the infinite stopwatch bug which only occurs rarely :PThe voice acting is quite amateurlike but in a likable way, afterall this is basically a Mod plus, the voiceacting of the vanilla JA2 isnt good either but afterall very likable and characteristic and...this game doesnt take itself too seriously all the time whatsoever, the overacted dubbing, borderline stereotypical characters and the sci-fi setting are proof enough for that ;)So overall, this is a game for fans of the franchise, the genre, a challenging experience or strategiefreaks :)If it werent for the 1.13 mod for JA2:Gold, i would say that Wildfire is the best installment of the Jagged Alliance franchise...at least in my humble opinion :3I Hope this review helps somebody to decide if you should buy this or not :)			"

												This game is for JA veterans only. A first timer does not stand a chance... Positive: Much more gear, although a lot is useless. New, larger maps (but it's in the negatives as well)Negative:- Difficulty set for the kind of people who don't mind re-trying 200 times the same map: Very, very few characters starting with a decent gun. Enemy who snipes you with handguns while your entire team can't manage to get a shot on him with assault guns. Really stupid cover system, way too random (Especially the roof bonus), every map from the beginning is very large, and you are massively outnumbered from the very start. That is the easy mode..... If you like having fun in your games, forget it. This one is only for people who enjoy pure challenge and don't care about the game itself.- The re-voicing of some characters absolutely pathetic. Dialogue changes are made by people with no writing talent whatsoever. You already loose a lot of what made JA2 so great.- The game feels like a very amateurish mod. Patchy, inconsistent (new items and faces have a totally different style of graphics compared to the old ones etc), terrible balance and difficulty management. Calling a quasi-undoable mode 'easy' makes me think to these arrogant teens who plague the MMORPG.- The maps are so large that you need HOURS just for the very first steps of the game. Exploring the map for loot is as fun as washing every single car in a large parking lot.- The high resolution graphics, as usual with the amateur mods, only makes everything much, much smaller. Better not have eye fatigue issues.... Come back to the original JA and it all feels soooo comfortable suddenly despite the late 90's graphics.- The original graphics are dated, but they were proper graphics. The new stuff (especially weapons and the map) uses a better resolution, but look really silly (The new guns are blue?? Nope, it's to show a reflection effect. Are these multicolor LEDs on the guns??? Nope, bad reflection effects, again). The portraits could be allright if they were not in such a different style compared to the ones from the original JA2.- The characters personnality lost all interest with the new guys. They are just a caricature of the existing content, clearly made by people with no writing skills.- Iimagine your team in a good ambush position being slaughtered by a few underarmed sitting ducks... It does not always happen, but it does happens regularly. - If you don't know already every game mechanic by heart, forget it... You won't learn them because you will be slaughtered in no time.- Nothing more frustrating than a very addictive game making you mad because of some really stupid ideas that ruin everything... Not only you rage-quit, but you rage-quit a game that you want so much to play. Well, forget it unless you think that the original JA2 is way too easy, and you don't care about anything else but a harder version of JA2 with new maps.			"

												This is quite unique blend of strategy/rpg and it holds quite well to this day. I has quite nice replayability, thanks to various ways you can build your character/interact with other NPC's, even though it has its limits. The humour is quite nice as well, I chuckled few times while playing this. Only thing I kind of dislike is that in this version, plenty characters are replaced. R.I.P.

												I bought this for the (normal?) price of $6.99. Two days later, it's on sale for $0.97. My timing stinks, but the game rocks. I know lots of people prefer the 1.13 style, but Wildfire keeps all of the challenges of the original JA2 and steps it up a notch. I can breeze through an experienced game of 1.13 JA2, but not so much with WF. Glad I ran across this on Steam, I just wish I'd waited two days to buy it.			"

												The best ""remake"" of Jagged Alliance 2 there is...Numerous Games have tried to ""copy"" the style and feel of JA2 and have failed miserably.Even the official brand name releases like Jagged Alliance Flashback, Online, Insert Name Here,...., could never reach the class of JA2.  Wildfire did it... by changing only small things in the game and making giving it some higher resolution textures.The Mercenaries are as funny/mean as they were in the Original...  Realism has been tweaked, more guns are available and the difficulty has risen by a notch.For me this is the best version of Jagged Alliance out there for now.A must for the lovers of the Original.Newbies could be put off by the high difficulty but if you give this game a little time and try to learn the ""physics"" and little funny things it sometimes does, you will become addicted.An all time classic wich I play at least once a year.Be sure to check out the Tech Requirements since this game is old and has been ported to work on Windows 7.There now also is a MAC OS Port.

												I've only played this version a bit - but I put several hundred hours into JA 2 - ( not Wildfire ) and this is the same game - with some enhancements and bug fixes.  I'm really not into RPG generally but I love 3rd person tactical play which this does very well and it makes a nice combination.It's a long game and even on easy it's hard so choose accordingly  as it cannot be changed mid game - some tips for playing - make sure you get ""Steroid"" the Arnie imitiation is the best voice character in the game.  Choose plenty of guns for a wide choice.  And if you liked the movie ""Them"" make sure you choose Sci-fi on.  Thats opens up a whole quest involving the mines and what's down there.   The end game is incredibly hard as are the inbred hillbillys if you shoot at any of them.   Watch that your mercs get along or you'll have problems later.			"

												When I bought Jagged Alliance 2 Wildfire, I wasnt expecting much. When I got into the lore and backstory of this game, I was impressed. What amazes me about these older games is just how much they place into the game. Modern RPGs might advirtise open world, and an interactive world, and years earlier, games like this where already doing it.  The game is hard, like XCOM hard. At times you have to wonder if attacking with the mercs you have is a good idea, or if it is better to wait for you soldiers to heal up. Unfortunatly, the game is not meant for Windows 8. I got frustrated with the game, not because it was hard, but because of how long the opponent was taking thier turn. What should take 5 seconds takes a minute. Then you have to wait for the civileans to take their turn, its just a mess. That being said, this game is still a gem. I highly recomend this for any one who is into RPGs, strategy games, sim games (I forgot to mention each merc has a personality. Some Mercs like to work with some mercs, but not others), and table top games.			"

												Well it's JA2 with new weapons, some new mercs and more realism (no more barrel extender with a steel pipe and some glue). The story is basically the same but Miguel has an awful new voice for whatever reason. The cities have new spanish sounding names (?).There are no new quests so don't expect that. I encountered several bugs later in the game (some game breaking but I was able to load).I only recommend this game to hardcore JA2 fans though most of them most likely already played it when it was still just a mod.For everyone NEW to Jagged Alliance I highly recommend the original - also on Steam. It's actually my favorite game of all time and I play it at least once a year since it was released. It aged okay.			"

												Wildfire was my intro to Jagged Alliance, I have not played vanilla JA2. I have played around 80 hours at the time of writing. I have not completed the game, but I have progressed fairly far and have cleared many towns/mines. I'm writing primarily about my opinions on the difficulty and some of the frustrating aspects of the title. Wildfire is hard, unforgiving, even on the novice difficulty I'll find myself restarting a sector 2 or 3 times to get a decent clear. The learning curve is steep, however once you find the flow of the game it is extremely rewarding. It is possible to clear sectors with minimal/no damage taken. This is not a game for everyone. Wildfire rewards patience, forethought, discipline and punishes lazy tactics and unrestrained movement without remorse. Expect dead mercs if you go parading around corners, it is easy to get someone killed in a matter of seconds. Understanding the interrupt and action point systems is absolutely critical. The increased difficulty of Wildfire is welcome in my opinion. The health/bandage/wound system is very cool (once you learn how) and the increased damage really makes you fear the lead, getting shot is a big deal. Fighting well equipped enemies is much more exciting than in some other tactics titles, and leads to extremely tense situations that I have not experienced elsewhere. The presentation of the game is almost the exact same as vanilla JA2. I have read that there are changes to the merc roster that are controversial, and the actual sector maps are different. I cannot make any fair comments about the changes given that I have not played vanilla JA2. I won't comment on the rest of the presentation because it is easy to read the reviews for JA2 or watch a bit of gameplay to get an idea of what the game is like.I will say that the goals/missions in the game are extremely vague. I think for my first 20 hours of gameplay I didn't even know about the rebel hideout in La Omerta. This means that to truly progress in the game you might need to look up a guide as far as what objectives you need to complete and who you should talk to. Many of the in game systems such as healing, setting a destination on the big map, training milita, and training you own mercs are not intuitive. There is no tutorial for these things, so you might need to consult the web for help. This should not be a big deal to anyone who has played classic games before.All in all, a great classic title with epic turn based gunplay and surprising depth. I prefer games that dont hesitate to break your arms and leave you stranded, this is not a title for those of little patience. Save often!			"

												Jagged Alliance is a very fun game if you like old school squad-based action that takes a good amount of skill and preplanning.Upon starting, you create a character and have enough funds to hire a couple of mercenaries to accompany you on your missions. When recruiting, you can select whether you want a mercenary to join you for a day, week, or longer. You can also choose to outfit them with their preferred equipment, or equip them from your own stock. Each mercenary comes with a specialized role and relevant skills (+ equipment if you choose to pay for it).I've played a lot of Fallout, especially Brotherhood of Steel, and I am fairly adept at those games.In Wildfire, not so much.Action points limit how far you can move/shoot, etc per turn, and fog of war prevents you from spotting any enemies outside of your party's field of vision. The feedback for weapon accuracy/chance to hit is very helpful, however, it should be noted that on Windows 7 and above you need to manually patch your game in order to fix the bullet drag animations (it is REALLY slow otherwise). Aesthetics provide a good deal of nostalgia for veterans of older squad-based games, and the comments each mercenary makes when you are attempting to hire them adds nice flavor. The learning curve can be a bit rough if you are not already familiar with playing squad-based tactical games, and the tutorial definitely does not hold your hand. Character death is brutal, as there is no way to revive your downed teammates.Character skill upgrading is pretty diverse, allowing you to completely remove skill from an area if you do not care about it (ex: putting first aid at ""0"" will effectively make your medkits useless).Recommend giving it a try if you want a real challenge and do not care about dated graphics.

												The best tbs game imo. Combat and management systems are both very realistic and hard to master. No tutorials, no tooltips no nothing. Just your guts to tell you what's what and how to run your squad. Instead of pumping graphics devs spent their time on content which make for a big game exploration wise.New XCOM games came close mechanicaly but still its for mass player i.e simplified. No camo decay over time, no weapon rust in water, no stats decay, movement speed/noise base on your ststs. Don't get me wrong, XCOM1/2 are very good games (playing 2 on ps4) but JA2 is hardcore. It's DIFFICULT. Which isn't something devs are trying to implement in their games now. Now its all about sales and availablility to mass market.This one has great replayability, because of its open world, lots of mercs and random fights all over the place. What a great game.			"

												As a reboot of the original Jagged Alliance 2, Wildfire is a a must for die hard Jagged Alliance 2 fans. The game comes with all new maps that are an improvement on the originals but are also likely to be quite challenging for players new to the series as they include much more enemies even on novice difficulty.Therefore this game can only be recommended to veteran Jagged Alliance players. Those new to the series should get the original			"

												I recommend it because I didn't play this game when it got out, so still on these days, it has captured me into some matches and I've really had fun with it (although it's really, really hard). It feels like playing the origin of turn-based/squad-based strategy games, so I think I liked the challenge just because of what it was on its days.			"

												This game is only for extreme diehards of the original. The difficulty setting is set way too hard. It does not ramp up as it should. Worse, the game seems to autolevel the opponents. Start the game with some wannabes and your opposition is chaff with mostly pistols (still super tough since they will hit you more than you hit them and they are more numerous). Come in with some vets on short contracts and suddenly the enemy all has shotguns and hand cannons. You seem to get punished for strategy. The most infuriating thing about the game is that your best mercs can't hit♥♥♥♥♥♥ 96% accuracy you say? bah, you'll be lucky to hit 1 shot out of 10. This leaves you too much at the mercy of the RNG.I'm a huge fan of the series and even the original JA2, but the play balance is completely off in this game for me to recommend it.			"

												Worth the 97 cents I paid for it, but not a whole lot more than that.  This appears to be a modified version of the original Jagged Alliance 2, and uses large chunks of the original.  Many of the changes are nice, such as the expanded squad size and changes to how some things display, but others are so poorly done they're cringe worthy.  Spelling and grammar errors abound, and while you expect the whole ""English isn't our primary language"" feel through the game, because of the game setting, these new errors are pretty obviously unintentional, and the result of poor writing.  The new, added and changed dialogues with NPCs are also very poorly done.  It's quite obvious the person recording them was reading from a script.  The pacing is forced, the it's done in a monotone, a few words are badly mispronounced, and the speeches leave you feeling like you just saw an act from a high school play. The IMP survey is especially bad.  It's been lengthened considerably, so much so that you find yourself wondering if it's ever going to end, and by the time it finishes you find yourself sitting there wondering ""WTF?""  The choices, in most questions, are utterly horrible.  They look like they were written by a 9 year-old who failed English class, and quite a few of them make no sense at all in the question asked and the answers given to choose from.  I'd strongly recommend avoiding IMP altogether, which is a shame, since it was one of the better aspects of the original.tl;dr: If you pay more than a dollar for this you'll regret it, and you'll probably still regret it if you don't get a handful of change back from that dollar.

												Not particularly enjoyable. This game could have really used a copy editor -- typographical errors are everywhere. While it's not unplayable, it is pretty hard to get the hang of, and the controls are about what you would expect for an old game like this. That said, the interface is complicated and unintuitive, and I don't want to be mired in keyboard shortcuts for everything.Also, the learning curve on this thing is STEEP. I got completely murdered in the first several encounters. You should probably only enjoy this game if you enjoy things like running face first into mines (which is not explained anywhere) when there are no enemies around and presumably you're in a safe environment.I feel no regret about buying this for $0.70, but I'd recommend you pay not much more than that.

												Very bad Windows 8 support. I got performance issues (as if it is 1999 all over again. It slows down so much, mouse is barely controllable, turns take a lot of time) and game crushes if you minimize it. Best game ever made, but unfortunately, it is unplayable on Windows 8 :(Ok. Today is 10/12/2014. I read all the comments and decided to try again. Installed it, found .exe file of the game, set compatibility to WinXp aaaaaaaand it froze. Black screen. Not responding.  To be perfectly clear, game is great and I have spent a lot of time playing this game (in the past). If I have to go and modify files, set affinity or do something else, then this is a bad service. Bad service by steam standards. If you are reading this, keep in mind, that 1/3 of all helpful reviews about “the game won’t even start”.Game is great but this particular issue is a sad attempt to cash in on a great game. Honestly, they should fix it first.			"

I mean who want to listen buch of teenage voice overs for characters?!? Especialy Miguel get me as he look like man in his late 40's (original from JA2) but sound like coky 15year old LMAO.Well only good thing on this game is that is for 69p at moment so you wont spend much and if you survive that very bad teenage re-dub you esentially have JA2 with some mods.However as I do like JA I cannot recommend this to ANYONE who like TBS or strategy in general.

												Such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t version. When they mean harder enemies they mean regular soldiers that can spot out your camoflauge guys at night, while your guys are prone, a mile away. Also 90% of the time their guys will always get the jump on yours. Their bases have mines that won't get picked up even by the best explosives expert. So trying to avoid the main gate is not an option. The enemy also has ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ shooting skills that will hit your guys at a  distance with handguns. Would not recommend at all.

There is no ""intro"" or short introduction into the game - its starts very hard (even on the lowest difficulty level). You get busted with auto-rifles as soon as you start the game. Fundamental mechanics are not explained and it´s just a nuisance when you begin with the game and everywhere are mines which kill your people if they step on it (you can start a new game afterwards ...)In Real-Time there a big flaws too as your own people will walk around and for sure find another mine to get killed.

												No. Dude, screw this game I purchased it because it honestly looked semi-decent. I installed it on my Lenovo laptop and  when you boot the game up for the first time it asks if you want to run a JA2.exe and you have to hit ""Yes"" if not you get a message from Steam saying ""Game failed to start"" so I tried to install it on my Desktop and play it and what do you know the game did not start. Save your time and money for something else.Pros:The un-install feature works great.Cons:The Game does not run.			"

												Not compatible with Win 10 64bit, Radeon R9 Card.  Just black screens until my monitor shuts off, card coils wail like a b**** when running.Tried compatibility modes, tried gfx card settings (manual is in german, implied some issue with radeon settings that no longer are in the control panel) I'd get a refund, but I paid $1.60 for it, and I kinda want it to work. So mabye it will get a patch or some acknowledged fix???Real joke is I had to stare at the black screen for the 5 min quota to post this ""review"".Also shame on steam, blantant compatibility issues should be have those reviews a little more visible.  I'd also love to see a refund request % stat.			"

												Great game with guns and grins. They just don't make'em like this anymore. Like most people willing to cough up a dollar to play a game from the 90's I cant help but feel cheated by steams lack of oversight selling a game that doesn't work on up to date windows.If it doesn't work why sell it? What a let down to your consumer base, steam.But calm down, take a deep breath, and ponder what you'd do if you had that dollar fifty in your hand right now. Use it for bus fare? A parking meter? Maybe use it too buy an energy drink to hype up your next anonymous review.. There are work arounds listed in the forums so it may not be a total loss. and if it is?Hey, you could always go buy that energy drink and write a better review.			"

												To play this game, you're assumed to already know how to play everything.Clunky controls and system - not fun wasting time figuring it all out; need to lookup too much on the web.Also, how do I restock vital items such as medkits and ammo? There doesn't appear to be any possible way to do this until AFTER you complete some important sections of the game - too bad if you're already out of medkits and ammo (with half or all of your team dying) and therefore can't complete it!Merc's with no ammo are totally useless! The game implies that you're supposed to be able to run in to stab and punch enemies, but try doing it in practice! You're gunned down quickly before you get anywhere near them! (OK, this bit is realistic, but doesn't make a game! lol)Oh look there's a guy standing up on a rooftop who keeps shooting at my Merc's, but no-one can shoot back at him, despite him being clearly visible to all.Stupid game. Don't waste your time.Deleted.			"

												I can't really say if I would recommend it or not.  To be honest, it looked cool, but after having it not open at all for an hour only to have it finally open into a square window that left out about 1/4 - 1/2 of the playable screen I got fed up.  Specs are below so that you can avoid if they match.Lenovo y510p.Windows 8.1I tried a number of the forum fixes to no avail.  Good luck.			"

												This is a good game.  It is not what I would call ""user friendly.""  I think the reason they don't make games like this is because they have improved on the formula.  They have tactics games now with all the depth, interest, and challenge, but are actually playable by modern standards.  This game was probably amazing when it was made.  It was well written and quite funny, but I'll stick with modern X-Com and the like.			"

												Well, played it long time ago before it was released in steam, and kinda disappointed because of the game resolution. Other than that, it's as good as i remember back in the old days :D.*2015 update : I just realized that there's many mercenaries replaced in this version. I kinda miss Scope, Len and Gus.PS : Anyone know how to maximize the game resolution? Please tell me if you know.6/10 because of the resolution tho.			"

												why did i down vote this game? idk havent played itserious reviewEven if the regime is totally inept and corrupt, don't suppose for a moment that you as the liberator will be greeted with open arms. JAGGED ALLIANCE 2: WILDFIRE brings you back to Arulco. The population is being terrorized by a reckless army; in the meantime the main export goods are drugs. Subversion and fraudulence has infiltrated all levels of local government and the ever-present Mafia has his fingers in many pies. You are working undercover on behalf of the US government and your goal is to destroy the mighty drug cartel. You'll need a skilled hand to put together the right team of mercenaries and the negotiating skills of a diplomat to get the sceptical population on to your side. You'll also need the strategic genius of a general and the fighting tactics of a guerrilla. Should you fail, your ""client"" will deny all knowledge of your existence.			"

												The game as a whole is horrible. The controls are glitchy at best. There are no tutorials, so have fun playing the first mission ten times as you first learn how to use a medkit to stop bleeding, then a second time to learn how to not moonwalk into enemies (yes, your move options makes you face backwards as you walk forward), then a third time to figure out what the heck the IMP questionnaire is for and do, and mousing over stats does nothing. There is no visible shoot percentage so when you aim at the cost of one AP, so you cannot even tell if aim is worth it. Giving me a wall of text is not going to do anyone any good; this is why games eases players into more mechanics by SLOWLY introducing more game elements.Sure, this game is groundbreaking in the days and players who have played the game know what to do, but as a new player, this game is obsolete. The game should be difficult, not difficult to play.			"

												I play JA2 1.13 mainly But not gonna lie. If you want a better than vanillia experience play this. The Wildfire maps are great. Not as good as the ones you can use with 1.13 but still pretty amazing. Not to mention this game in general is the best of it's genre.			"

												Horrible ""update"" of the original JA2 game.  Changes were only halfway implemented (mismatches of old and new labels), new voice acting sounds like a middle school project, and every civilian in the whole country is now a pawn of the drug lord (even after you kill him).Instead, get an old copy of JA2 or JA2 Gold somewhere, then search online and install the ""v1.13"" mod, and then again search and install the ""Bigmaps"" mod (I'm trying out the ""AIMNAS"" flavor of Bigmaps, seems good so far).  There's actually good support for that online (and it's in active development), although you may have to dig through a lot of forum posts to learn some of the mods' new features.			"
