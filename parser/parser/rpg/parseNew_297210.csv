												This is a simple roguelike game. It's a good game to play for a few minutes, assuming of course you can force yourself to shut it down; it's rather addictive.You can only carry two items at a time, which means you will sometimes have to go back for items. You need a key to get to the next level, but be careful when you pick a key up, as it takes up one of the two valuable item slots.There's no option to change the graphics or sound. The graphics is in a vertical column, as you see on the screenshots above. The sound is always on and at full volume, which is a pain if you want to watch TV at the same time.I would recommend this game to anyone who wants a fun and simple roguelike game.I would not recommend this game to anyone who wants a highly detailed game full of roleplaying and complexity.

												Famaze is a fun little old-school game.You explore dungeons from back scenery view, while fighting monsters and picking up loot.If you explore the labyrinth long enough, you will find several beacons that will light a certain area, preventing monsters from spawning there.The player also has a minimap that updates itself while he explores. You will often need to find keys to unlock doors to other areas. Keys are usually scattered in places hard to reach, guarded by enemies or traps.There are 3 classes you can choose from when starting the game: Wizard, Thief or Knight. The Wizard specialises in spell-casting and thus is a good choice for ranged combat. The Thief has a chance of disabling traps so you can easily reach a place without having to take the long way. The Knight has the most HP and deals most damage.The combat is turn-based. If you're playing as the warrior, don't expect to not be hit at your turn. Also, everytime you move a space, so do the enemies, making your plan route different.Pros: +old-school dungeon crawler;         +exploration of the map;         +the classes and leveling up system;         +usage of items;Cons:+could've been more complex, in terms of gameplay;         +it gets repetitive after a short while;Personal rating: 70/100 - Good			"

												FAMAZE is the simplest rogue-like i know. Originally made for phones and the browser FAMAZE was a really fun little rogue-like that was perfect if you only had 5  minutes or so. The goal of FAMAZE is to find a key and to get to the end of the dungeon. In most rogue-likes, when you move, the monsters move too but in FAMAZE most monsters are stationary. They just block your way. Attacking monsters causes you and your foe to lose 1hitpoint. In order to stay alive you need potions that refill your life. The catch however is that you only have 2 inventory slots. This mechanic leads to alot of strategic thinking. FAMAZE also has a rather interesting lightning mechanic. If the light touches an enemy it turns into an healing item. This is an easy way of defeating your foes. So FAMAZE is a fun little rogue-like that is perfect to play while downloading a huge game or so ;D. If you want a strategic rogue-like that is really complex look somewhere else(ToME is perfect if you're looking for that;D) Simple but fun!			"

												Famaze is a unique, casual sort of dungeon crawler that borders on being strategy and planning. There are two halves of the game, the top and bottom. The lower half shows a 2D side view of you and everything around you. The top shows the mini map. This map is what you'll really be paying attention to. You move north, south, east and west by moving up, down, left and right. This is why I say you'll be paying attention tot he map, because the bottom of the screen is a 2D side view of the action. Right and left on the side view isn't always east and west on the map. So if you're pushing left looking at the bottom of the screen and you can't head west on the map, you won't go anywhere. The object of the game is to find the key and get to the locked door. There are a certain amount of randomly generated mazes to get through, where you then see your statistics and get an ending. Its not about the finish though, its about the journey. With the randomly generated mazes, every play through is different. Every death means a new dungeon to explore.The map is a maze of hallways, with no rooms. On the map you see the halls, walls, your location, enemies in red, items in dark blue, rutabagas in sky blue, treasures in yellow and sleeping enemies are dark red. You can see these things a certain distance away from you so you can plan to avoid things accordingly. Some enemies will move, but treasures, rutabagas and items will not. Your map starts out dark, but the more you explore, the more of the map gets uncovered.These enemies are easy, you don't fight them so much as bump into them with you both dealing damage to one another. To fight, just walk in their direction on the map. Its that easy. You can stand in front of a foe without them attacking. There are a variety of enemies with different habits. Purple slimes will blot out some of your explored map. Skeletons will rise up after you walk by them. Ghosts will steal your items. Wizards will chase after you. Cycloptic floating heads are asleep in the dark until you light up an area near them, then they'll wake. There are of course standard attackers like paroling spiders, goblins and the more difficult fat red trolls. You can run from most enemies without them following you.When you start the game, you select from three classes. The knight starts with a health potion and can use a charge attack. The thief can see and disarm traps, and has a teleport potion to almost completely avoid combat. The wizard can transmute an item and has a powerful fireball. This fireball plows through enemies on your map. Even enemies that you're not fighting, the fireball travels straight down the hallway destroying lesser foes in its path. Its effective, to make up for the wizard's low attack power. The only problem is that the fireball counts as an item and can only get used once before its gone.You can get XP from defeating enemies and lighting torches in order to level up and make combat easier. The torches lit are worth far more XP than enemies you defeat. After the first level, its difficult to increase XP, so it becomes worthless in my opinion.There are no weapons or armor. You have what you have from start to finish, so this isn't a traditional dungeon crawler. Less micro management makes it easier for casual players. Instead, it is the items that mix up the game. You can hold two items at a time, to use them, hit the number keys. Potions refill your health. Flares light up a small part of the map while killing nearby enemies and turning distant ones into rutabagas. Even if an enemy walks into the light, they will transform. A teleport potion will let you transport yourself to anywhere on the mini map in the upper half of the screen, but not the full map. The key counts as an item, so it takes up a slot in your inventory to make things more interesting. There are several items and objects littered through a maze. Dare I say almost an item for every enemy depending on the map.Along the way through each maze, you'll find all these items, but you'll also find torches, lights or lanterns. Whatever they are, when you light them up, the map around the area brightens up. Much like a flare, but a larger size. So active enemies turn into rutabagas, cycloptic heads wake up and traps now show up on your map. That's right, Famaze has traps, so if you spend your time completely avoiding enemies and running from them, eventually, you'll find hidden traps. These traps only damage you and without the light from a stationary torch or a flare, you won't see them.The entire story revolves around the rutabagas, the mad king has turned them all into monsters, and you need to turn them back. So the real object is to hit lights, that turn the enemies into rutabagas and then collect them. These rutabegas give you health for touching them, so it leads me to believe, you're actually eating them. Eating the things you're trying to save. It is probably a lot easier to transport them in your stomach than to carry them in a sack. It doesn't matter though, it all goes to statistics at the end of each level and the end of each game.As for the treasures, they are nothing more than a score at the end of each level and I'm sure add up to more at the end of each play through. You'll find standard treasures and treasure chests. Sometimes the chests contain more gold for your score, other times its spikes. Risk and reward. There are even health floor tiles that refill your energy just once and teleportation tiles that send you to a different part of the map. These all blend together to make the game more interesting and engaging beyond what I find in deeper less casual dungeon crawlers.Also in the maze are seven collectable artifacts. I'm not sure if all seven are in each play through, but I was able to find the first two on my first play through. Then I found the rest in following play throughs. I think it is a way to extend the life of what is an hour long game. On top of that, you unlock a harder difficulty after completing the default quest.Between each level you'll see a random charming scene over your treasure and rutabaga score. Its a nice addition to what could have just been a score screen.The lower half has a great 8-bit art style. Charming sprites without much animation. As the game progresses and you go maze to maze, the backgrounds and music both change. New enemies get thrown in, so I feel like there's a good sense of progression. The music itself is good and fits into a dark chip tune feel of wandering through a dungeon. Yet, the music doesn't loop it just stops until you find the key. Maybe less is more, but I wish the music would loop or something.Now for the downsides. The game is vertical since it has a top and bottom half. I feel like its meant for a smart phone and not a computer screen. Double clicking the game will make it full screen windowed, but it does nothing for the resolution. Its just a black screen with the game in the center. The game has no mouse or native controller support. I'd much rather play the game with a controller especially with how simple it is.With everything said, I can recommend it. Maybe its not for hardcore dungeon crawler fans since it feels more like a strategy, but people that want an easy little pick up and play game that strays from the norm. While its a charming, easy to play game, I don't think there's enough fun here to keep me in it for that long. It would be the perfect game for a phone.			"

												I got the game for $2.49, and I was fine paying that for this. I think I played for about 30 minutes, and it was probably worth the $2.49. I'm very much a classic Rogue fan, and this was a fun rogue-like. My biggest issue with it would probably be the addition of the bottom graphics caused a little bit of confusion as I kept trying to navigate with it rather than use the pixel map as you normally would with a rogue-like. Plus, I think I picked the hardest class to start with (mage), and since you can only hold two spells at the beginning (one if you have a key on you), I was getting pretty rocked. Still, it was entertaining for the little while I played, and I found it pretty cute.			"

												It's fun so far, but I can't get to the end because the game keeps crashing. However, my PC is a dinosaur, so it might not be the game's fault. Apart from my technical problems, it's a good and simple dungeon-crawler. Nothing revolutionary, but for fans of the genre, it's nice to have a decent dungeon-crawler for free.			"

												OK where to start?The idea of the game is simple, make it from one randomly generated dungeon to the next, collecting loot and many useful items along the way, but there are differences from this game and other similar titles which I would like to explain. Firstly; you will notice that the screen is cut into two sections, this reminds me of old style DS games, which; I may add, this would have felt right at home on.The bottom section of the screen displays the player at their current location within the dungeon, the items that they find and any encounters and fights that they may have,While the top half of the screen shows the local map area, with darkness covering the unexplored sections and colored squares to represent the player, the enemies, the loot and the items.You will likely find yourself looking mostly at the top section; as the directions on this map directly relate to the up, down, left, right keys that you will need to press as you explore the Mad King's dungeon.The items that you find play a crucial role in being successful in your quest, you cannot simply run in and bash the enemies willy nilly, you will need to think a little about what to use and when to use it.An example of this would be the use of teleport orbs, these are used to move from one part of the dungeon to another and in early levels this would seem to be just a formality, but on later stages it is important that they are used wisely; in order to avoid contact with the nastier denizens that lurk within the dark, dank, stench filled halls (Especially the ones that stand still and hit hard!)In my opinion it's that the fact that this game is just as much a puzzle/brain teaser as it is a roguelike sets it apart from other games in the genre and make it a very refreshing challenge.So to sum up:I'll be honest with you; when I first saw this game I was unsure what to expect, there are so many games available on STEAM nowadays and I find that many of them seem to range from mediocre to terrible if I'm being truthful, so it can be a bit of a lottery as you never quite know what you are going to get, but for free I felt it would be rude not to give it a go.Well let me tell you that I am glad that I did as I have been plesantly surprised by this game, the graphics are adorabe in all thier retro, 8-bit, pixelated beauty and the simplicty of game mechanics makes it easy to pick up, but hard to put down, with later levels sure to prove a challenge for even the most hardened RPG or rouguelike fans, I think it has enough appeal to keep most gamers coming back for more.I highly recommend this game to one and all, why not try it for yourself?And; as a free to play game you really have no excuses not to.

												I like this game, but I just don't really understand what I need to do in it. When I'd finished it, and please note that what I'm about to say would be somewhat of a spoiler, I was told that I had found the Book of Truth (I think that is what it was called) and that there was this recipe. But then I was told that I had to find the Gem of Truth, after which I was led back to the menu screen.This game, I found, was somewhat purposeless. I discovered that all I had to do, or at least what I thought I had to do, was to find the key in each level and use it on a locked door (a square with a keyhole on the 'minimap').			"

												This is a very basic and plain roguelite game (yes, I'm inventing words). Basically you just wander around some kind of dungeon with more or less useless character:- knight - has a special attack that deals 3 HP damage to enemies adherent. This attack reloads very slowly after killing enemies- rogue - has a chance to disarm traps - seems useful enough- mage - probably has some special ability, but I couldn't unlock itYou have like five items in this game:- potion - restores all of character's HP- key - allows descent into next level- teleport - allows one time teleport to any square in the minimap region- flare - provides some light and turns enemies into turnips (?) that you can eat for 1 HP each- fireball - shoots some damage dealing line that can turn into corridors and leaves some light behing- some coins and treasure chests that add coins which do nothingYou can encounter astonishing tiles along your journey such as:- crumbling ones that deal 2 HP damage when you fall into them!- healing tiles that heal all of your HP!- spike tiles that deal 1 HP damage, terrific!- normal tiles that you just walk on untill finishing this game!- beacon - well, this one is pretty useful as it provides light to quite large area thus turning enemies into turnipsSo on, so forth...Combat is very simple - you stand against some enemy that won't even chase you if you back up (except ghosts and probably skeleton mages) and you deal 1 damage to each other. Player character has some chance to deal critical 2 damage to enemy. That's all. Using an item does not count as an action, thus if you have 1 HP you can use your potion and continue fight. Believe me, it get's pretty boring pretty fast. You better play Desktop Dungeons, at least there are some unlockables.Overall this is a pretty shallow game. Pixelart graphics are nice, true, but this won't fend off long agains boredom that stabs you in the back like some rogue in Dungeons & Dragons after 15 minutes into the game.But still, this one is free, go and check it out for yourself.EDIT:Okay, after some thoughts this game is not that bad. It's ok if you like to play some light games that doesn't require much time to dig into. I just can't recommend this one in comparison to other games that are out there, but still if I would give a dollar for this one I wouldn't regret that.Surprisingly, playing a rogue in a roguelike game is... interesting.EDIT 2:This is indeed a fun little game. Just playing knight and mage makes it is so dull. Try a rogue instead.Really, when you play as a Knight it takes like about forever to charge your smite attack and you need to actually beat many monsters to gain levels. Usually you also trigger many traps and lose many hp. Playing as a mage you have one useless ability that seems to transform teleport orbs into fireball item only when you find one particular Transmute Tile where you can transmute those items. Also, mage levels up really slowly and gets into like every traps on the way. This game is somewhat not balanced at all. If you want to have a nice time just pick up rogue, he'll level very fast and has ability to disarm traps which gets really useful pretty fast. Alternatively, you can also try playing as a knight but this may be a bit tedious. Mage imo is unplayable at all.This game is also a bit buggy, if you want some proof then take a look at discussions page.---------- For anyone interested in joining in on completing your own backlog; check it out here - http://steamcommunity.com/groups/completingthebacklog/discussions/5/530645446320364338/ "

												A lovely little morsel of a roguelike. You pick one character from a selection of 3  - warrior, thief, or wizard, each with a single unique gameplay mechanic - and traverse a maze in search of a key to take you to the next level. Along the way you encounter treasure and single-use items that enhance gameplay, beacons to light up the world, traps, and enemies. There is an xp collection mechanic. Levelling up increases your hitpoints by 1. For every hit you land on an enemy, they land a hit as well, so to beat them in an encounter requires you to have more hitpoints. If a beacon is activated, the surrounding zone of the maze is lit up; traps are made visible, certain types of item-giving blocks are activated, and enemies are turned into a cute collectible. Activating beacons however become a very strategic action later on when you encounter an enemy that is actually woken up rather than eliminated by light. Most levels seem to have two exits, so it adds a meta-game exploration aspect to the game (from my experience, there is no way to go back to previous levels).The graphics are very simple; all movement happens in a normal 2d maze - seen in a top down view - where everything is represented by blocks; you, the enemies, collectibles, items of interest,  and traps. There is a simple 8/16bit pixel-art projection/representation of your character's journey beneath the actual maze you navigate, but this projection is only 1 dimensional, so in the projection your character only seems to move left and right along a very long corridor. This I found a bit disorienting at first, but you get used to it.The music is wonderful! The game hyperlinks you to a website from which you can purchase it. I just wish it was made available through the Steam Store though. PLEASE make it available for purchase through the Steam store, because that would greatly simplify purchasing it!I very much enjoyed this game. AND IT'S FREE! So win win! You should download it.			"

												Famaze is a pretty neat indie game, I dont know how to describe it really apart from what you can learn on the store page. I was able to complete the game on normal and collect most of the artifacts in around 45 minutes, so the game is pretty short, after you beat normal mode however you unlock a harder difficulty, so the game could last you quite a few hours. The game feels alot like a rougelike game so you probably wont get tired of the game a second time around if it held your attention long enough to complete it once.  Famaze is free on Steam now, so I hope if it looks interesting to you you will take the time to try it, its simple and small, and if you like retro games you're sure to think its pretty neat.			"

												Spent about 5 minutes with it and that was all I could stomach. Why is the resolution locked like an idiot recording video on an iPhone? Don't you people realize that nearly everyone has a 16:9 or 16:10 monitor these days, not 9:16. On top of that the game felt pretty pointless. Wander around a maze killing spiders and turnips. The 2D perspective makes no sense at all either. The maze goes N,S, E, & W yet my little idiot just hops back and fourth. Due to direction changes in the map not properly matching with the ""action window"" I often found myself attacking a goblin that was in the opposite direction my character was facing. This is just a sloppy game that should be avoided at all costs. I got it in a bundle for $1 and that was still too much money.			"

												It is now free on Steam, as it should have been to begin with. Given this, I am willing to recommend this game for the few hours that it may be enjoyable. The business tactics for this release on Steam may have been gritty, but at least it concludes well (other than the people who bought this game on relase, in the groupees bundle, or was gifted this by that person on your friends list that hates you).  I am satisfied now, 5/10.OLD REVIEW: http://i.imgur.com/Ii1Fy82.pngQuick answer: do not buy this. It is a minimalistic maze roguelike, which sounds like a pretty good idea, but ends up lacking in so many areas:+ The hard difficulty is challenging+ It is a good ""I have nothing to do"" game+ Traps, units, and items are decently balanced+ Decent soundtrack= Minimalistic= It is fun for the first few hours  = It is indeed roguelike by every means= Uses their own assets, but they have also sold them, so the game ends up looking generic.- Repetitive- Lacks options. How so? No options at all. Also, it has no key rebindings.- It is nearly impossible to lose on the easier of the two difficulties and requires a lot of time and luck to get through the harder difficulty- One mistake on hard can easily make you restart the entire maze- Way overpriced for what it is and can currently be played for free (w/ ads, etc.) at http://jayisgames.com/games/famaze/  (Currently this game has NO differences from the free version other than slightly larger display and no distractions around the screen.)- Edit: http://www.agame.com/game/famaze- Too simplistic- It is basically a glorified maze with roguelike elements that turns into more of a perfectionist puzzle than a roguelike.In conclusion, it is in your best interest to stay away from this game. If you are really interested in a luck based challenge, a strategy intensive puzzle game, or an extremely easy roguelike with RPG as minimal as the style, than this game can be decent. Overall, it is lacking so much to be justified as anything over $1  or your equivalent of nearly free. While I personally like the minimalistic style this game chose to go, I do not feel like it offers much in comparison to other roguelikes of the same price.			"

												Famaze is a casual dungeon crawling RPG. You move up, down, left, and right to navigate a map in the upper screen. In the lower screen you will be given a representation of the characters and the environment. You can attack enemies by walking into them. There are a small variety of items to find in the mazes. You can hold two items at a time, but they will respawn upon use or loss so you'll never be out of supplies. There are traps that make the mazes hard to navigate safely, as well as monsters to fight. You can gain XP through that or lighting large torches. Shedding light on most enemies will turn them into items for bonus points. Gold is also around for points. Some enemies, however, will be awakened when you shine light upon them. There are lots of litle ins and outs of the game depending on the situation you get into with the randomness, but it's overall incredibly simple. Your main goal is simply to find keys and use them to open up the next level.Honestly, I only played a bit of this one and it got boring and repetitive pretty fast. It's a time waster. It's easy, casual, simple, and fun in short bursts. However, in the sea of games on Steam, it doesn't have enough to stand out, nor is it more worthy of your time than many other games. The only reason I can recommend it is that it's free. It's not a bad game, but much too simplistic and repetitive for my taste. The visual style is neat, the concept is okay, and the music is cool, but it's just not enough to keep me coming back for more. Famaze gets a 3 out of 10 for being a neat little free game that can kill some time, but ultimately isn't worth wasting your time on unless you truly have that much time to waste. But hey, it's free so try it for yourself.			"

												Simple.  Casual.  Fun.Scale: 1=despised 2=negative 3=could go either way 4=positive 5=lovedGame design: 4/5 It's simple, but effective.  There's a mild learning curve, very mild, but it's funner than most casual games and less intimidating than many rogue-likes.  What I like most is that it's honest, what you were expecting is what you get.  Not that it's necessarily predictable, just honest.Tone: 5/5 Apparently this game uses some kind of sprite pack.  Maybe I can assume that the music is royalteesed as well?  Regardless, it all works really well.Personal skew: 4/5 I love retro, I love exploring, I love games I can get into casually and they still have some kind of a point or story.  I'm all over this game.			"

												So I'm usually pretty lenient with free games, but for this one there are a few too many purely quality of life issues that make the game abrasive to play. The graphics are pretty nice, and you can easily tell what everything is, except you can't navigate based on any of the nice graphics because sometimes up is right, sometimes down is right, sometimes both are left, you navigate purely based on the minimap in the corner as opposed to the more pleasant visuals at the bottom of the screen. The music isn't half bad, for about 5 minutes, then the lack of volume controls in-game mean you have to tab out, open the volume mixer and either mute it entirely or try to turn it down without making it impossible to hear if you're an in-game audio purist.Enemies lack any interesting strategy, being reduced to raw numbers as unless you have an ability/item/spell to either kill them for you or simply teleport behind them there is no way to dodge or block damage, if you hit them then they will hit you guaranteed even if you kill them with the swing. This becomes exceptionally annoying as you run into ghosts who steal your items and slimes who erase parts of your map if they hit you.If you're just looking to waste your time then go for it, but if you're like me then this game is nothing beyond a waste of time, and I can think of a dozen more enjoyable ways to waste away my life.

												UPDATE: Game was bundled in groupees bundle on 14 May, a mere 9 days after release. I don't feel glad I supported this by buying it on initial release on steam. I feel like I've been kicked in the teeth by Oryx. ------------------------------------------I really want to mark this neutral- half way between recommend yes and recommend no.First of all, this game apparently used to be free on the web at the official web site, but now it links to steam instead when you click to play. The game is available here though:http://jayisgames.com/games/famaze/...and playing it will give you the best idea of what it's like.The good parts are that this is a charming, simple game with pixel art sprites, nice chiptune style music and a polished feel.The bad parts are the complete lack of options which means you have to play in a window approximately the height of your desktop (at least on my 1920x1080) and a third of the width. You can't redefine the keys, which is unforgivable. For the record keys are cursor up left down right, 1 and 2 to use objects, m for map, space for pickup, q to quit and esc to cancel.It's also a bit weird that Oryx are using their own sprite set which has been sold to a lot of developers, making their own game look generic in the graphics department. It's also a bit disappointing that this, unlike the other games using the sprites, isn't a true roguelike because you're not moving freely about on a 2d grid with monsters chasing you and so on. If anything this is a ""1.5D"" roguelike game.			"

												The Game Itself (fact):This game was developed by an all star cast of great composer Disasterpeace, successful pixel sprite artist/programmer Oryx, and the electric rennaissance man Reckahdam (programmer, musician, and much more).  Content-wise, this game has about 15 levels in linear order.  Not worlds- levels, and this number includes the five or six bonus levels that have about 20 aquares in them.  There are only three characters all available from the start.  It does not fit a computer screen properly.  Each real level will take, at most, ten minutes to complete, and can each be completed in under a minute.  The game has branching paths to choose between that the player must go down in separate playthroughs to collect pieces of a magis stone, which is close to artificial lengthening.  This game has a few bugs, including that when the spacebar has multiple functions it decides what it wants to do, like activating a trap that will harm the player instead of going through a door, or going through a door instead of using a special attack.  A bigger bug makes the character disappear when they collect the last magic gem shard, making it impossible to see the true ending.  In hard mode the game may become literally impossible to beat, which will force you to resart the game (although it won't take long to get back to where you were or get stuck again).  The music has been hailed all around, as it is made by the critically acclaimed artist Disasterpeace and it is available to purchase for the exact price of $4.99.The Game Itself (oppinion):The presentation could have been entirely redone for full screen by putting the maze-screen and action screen on the left and right and making them bigger, and it seems lazy to only allow you to see what monsters and items are when they are two squares away from you, when the screen also lets you see three sqaures.  The developers for sure knew about these and probably other bugs I haven't discovered, and were even told about them, but left them in when they could ""break the game"".  That the game is so short is a problem, especially since these levels seem so simple to design.  The gameplay is also very simple (explore until you find a key, then find an exit while hitting monsters to subtract on hit point from each of your health bars, and use items+plus your characters special ability to stay ahead of the game), even though the variation of monsters and items is perfect for this very short experience and the three characters are each interesting and well-balanced, the general strategy will always be the same (only use items when necessary, save health for traps, and locate the way out quickly but try to last long and gain points/xp).  Some will like the small variations (like myself), while others will be totally bored.  The soundtrack is truly wonderful, I have not seen a professional review that does not complement it, and I bought it separately, but this game is only on par with a very good flash game or a good phone game, and does not include the soundtrack for a download, so it should cost less than the music.  Also, the music does not repeat in most cases, which is a wonderful artistic choice, but then you are left in silence until the key is found or you decide to go to the next level, which could have at least been filled with some simple beats from the other incredibly skilled musician on the team, Roger Reckahdam Hicks.  The sound effects could at least have more variety, each character makes the same noise when the hit a monster and move.Overall, this game is very fun and a great concept, but short, incomplete, bugged and flawed.  Because an all star cast, a dream team, put it together it is horrrible and unexpected that it ended up like this.  I voted for it on greenlight thinking that if success on Steam was in the developers vision they would go back to work and make this game great, but as soon as they got in they released this title before even putting steam acheivements in it, then raised its price by 4.99 and deleted the free version!  This is just plain old exploitation of Greenlight and the people of steam, along with a dishonorable rejection of making art as opposed to making a profit, however small- this is an offront to the romance of independant development.The History:Those three indie titans got together to make this game way back in the 200Xs.  They were going to make it for phones, hence the strange shape of the game and arrangement of screens.  They carried on for quite a while, but the game was generating less and less interest from the public, no income, and the developers had many other projects looking more hopeful (the Famaze soundtrack was created  at the same time when Disasterpeace made the Fez soundtrack).  It was put into Greenlight, but wasn't being voted for, so it was put into stasis.  Eventually (2013) the game was released in flash for free on Oryx's website, where I found it and loved it, and Disasterpeace put the soundtrack out for sale.  That would have been a very sad end to Famaze, that it would die with a wimper on Oryx's page, but then Steam started Greenlighting 100 and 50 titles at a time!  Was this it, was Famaze going to find some fans in the Steam Userbase?  Would the developers sit down together and expand it to something wonderful like it easily could become?  Absolutely not!  It was made downloadable, the price was raised, and it was dropped into the Steam marketplace with all the pomp of dropping a banana peel into the trash!  The developers cast aside all of their honor and integrity as artists when they put this unfinished product here, and insulted every one of their fans by expecting them to put money into it when it is just a flash game- they insulted you!  Even if the game itself sounds great, when used like this it is soiled and turned entirely into garbage.F2P Update:  All of the developers were confronted at the time this was written, but none commented back or replied.  I do believe that I might have been slighty harsh in my delivery, and even made an apolagy, but until we can hear how it ended up how it was from the mouth(s) of whoever published this, it is right for us to be upset about what happened.  It was pointed out to me that this game was put into a bundle a few days after it was released on steam, and was recently in a bundle just before becoming free (which means some were cheated out of their cash, again, but it is a step in the right direction).As said in my apolagy, all people go back on their honor, so the publishers should only be treated as if they made a mistake.No matter what has happened in the past, even recently bundling right before going F2P, the game is free now, as it should be.  This controversy should be over.  On the other hand, I have not heard from any of the big three, so we have no idea if this was not thought through entirely, or a cold hearted bussiness plan.Lastly, because there has been no dialogue, we cannot know if the publishers have learned from this, or would do it again.  We need to have a public statement to clear all of this up.  A youtube video could be made, and the comments turned off, if you do not want to see hundreds of people insult you (as is the case with the internet).  I truly hope that I have been fair.			"

												Unique gameplay, but gets boring really quick.I can only recommend this to people that are looking for a nice rogue-like timewaster.			"

												It's exactly what you assume it is! A small little treat for some sixty minutes. Too bad the super hard difficulty level only unlocks after that one…			"

												This is a fun little game, and although it doesn't do anything particularly innovative, it is refreshingly fun.			"

												2D Roguelike, fun and with good music. It's okay for playing once in a while.			"

												Games too long for you?Ever loved RPG games, but don't have the time to remember plot devices?Or perhaps you just don't have the time to dedicate yourself to one game anymore because you're no longer that young adolescent tween that had all the time in the world, where you could just go to class one day and say ""Yeah! ♥♥♥♥ this class! Imma play me some games!""...???Then come on down to Famaze! Where you don't need to remember anything, mash arrow keys and the occasional ""1"", ""2"" and space, and finish the game before you have to go back to whatever the hell it is you were doing 30 minutes ago.

												A cute and interesting RPG. would love to see some achievment integration to this game, but it was pretty fun as is. Some of the things could have been explained better (or at all) but I figured out the items and mechanics and had fun. :)			"
