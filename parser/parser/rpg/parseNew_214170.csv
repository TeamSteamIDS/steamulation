												Like leaves on the trees when the autumn comes, I peered into the prodigious ravine they call the Steam Store and found this diamond in the rough layed out before me. ""$2.00"" it whispered into my ears and I was sold - I knew I had to get this; boy was I delighted with the treat I found in stored for me.Many claim they can see the end of times upon them with this coming era but I stayed vigilant. I gave hope to the fallen kings of men and entered a realm unknownst to any before me. It was this day that I found out what it meant to be the Chosen. My journey started like any other - I was weak, heedful of my surroundings, aware that any danger I find may soon be my very last. Destiny called however, and I knew my place was among the Gods. I stepped forward into a brave new world and accepted the very fate thrusted on me.Orcs struck, evil mages lashed out with their foul magicks, knights that knew no loyalty saw fit to bring me to their knees; yet I stood firmed. I slayed everyone and everything - from friends to tyrants. None shall stand before my blade and see the light of day again.""Monster!"", they yelled at me. ""♥♥♥♥  you"", I said in return as I stuck the tip end of my weapon up their haughty buttocks. Tyrants and dragons alike would fall to my sleight of hand as I became the all-powerful, omniscient being the prophets themselves had called to pass.In my final hour I would lay waste to the Lord of Chaos. His reign was over and my destiny, fulfilled. Men shall not know the end times again as long as I breathe. With one final sigh I gazed back behind me...What have I done.In my wake, nothing was left. I had saved the world but at the cost of the world itself. I was but a lone God overseeing a world with no one - how could I ever be the Chosen when there's nothing left to protect? I fell to my knees and cried; there was only one thing left to do. I pulled out my trusted blade that had been by my side this entire time and made some potions out of the nearby red mushrooms.			"

												After finally finishing this gem of a game I can only but recommend this game to any RPG lover out there. Beneath the now dated graphics lies a sound game with a complex world, rich lore and funny little gameplay gimmicks that made me smile a lot.The good:- Rich lore, decent story (if a bit cliché by now)- Plenty of content (Took me appr. 70 hours to finish)- Pretty extensive and flexible RPG elements (create whatever character you like as you go)- Easy to get into, but challenges along the way- Lot's of little tricks and secrets hidden in the worldThe bad:- A couple of the dungeons look mostly the same- Some rare and random game crashes- No tutorial in the beginning (some actions in the game could use explanation)- Addicitive- Rare side-quest breaking bugs (hint: keep a walkthrough at hand)Divine Divinity is a RPG that is focussed around hack-and-slashing and that is something you do a lot.The world is littered with all kinds of different enemies and dungeons and all have something special. That is mostly because of the lore and quests that even challenges you in small ways you could easily miss. For example: there are many books to find and read, some of them contain hints for quests and how to complete them.In roleplaying terms the modern gamer will find various ways to develop his or her character. The game starts with the choice of three classes: Warrior (Fighter), Survivor (Rogue) and Mage (Wizard). But don't worry, once the game is underway, all skills are available for the choosing so you can create any character you wish. For example, I created a powerful mage with great bow skills because I like to keep my distance in combat.In terms of loot and interactivity in the world this game surprised me. Pretty much every object that is not stuck to something can be picked up or interacted with. Haven't got lockpicks with you? Just drag the closed container to your inventory and open it later. Found a closed door you can't pick? There could be a switch hidden behind some stacked boxes. Looking for a hidden dungeon? Try under some barrels. Are you out of potions? Use your alchemy skills to create a potion from a plant, etc, etc. There is also plenty of loot. There are the usual magical weapons and armor, but also item-upgrade runes, may different potions, spellbooks, and countless miscellaneous items.The game's difficulty level was okay. If you stick to the story, especially in the beginning, you get balanced combat situations and will have plenty of opportunity to find your own style. Enemies don't scale with your level, but have fixed levels and are found in fixed places in the world. If you stray from the path as a level 10 character, get ready to be insta-killed. But don't worry, as you develop your character you get to kick more and more♥♥♥♥♥Note: most of the game you are a lone wolf. The only companions you get are the ones you magicaly spawn yourself. In many a situation I found that some tactical thinking is required to get through combat as a wave of 10 or more enemies at once is not that rare.Lastly I would like to mention the technical aspects of this game. What surprised me is that I was able to play this game instantly after installing it. Older games often have trouble on a powerful 64bit machine.I found the graphics to be charming and 'oldschool' and the sound decent for it's age. I also liked the voicework that was both fitting and refreshing at times (you have to read a lot).I only had a few crashes but when you save often that is only a minor problem. Warning: this game requires manual saving! No automatic checkpoint system that holds your hand as you play!I hope you found this review helpful. Have fun with this awesome game!			"

												Stupid title, fantastic open world action RPG.  Not an easy game though.  Right from the start you will be very easy to kill.  Fair warning, the first few hours can be very difficult and quite frankly, a little boring.  There are ememies you'll be better off avoiding than fighting (and coming back to slaughter them later is pretty damn satisfying).  Upon completing that first dungeon, the game opens up and you can go pretty much wherever you want.  It doesn't get any easier though, so staying too far from the story, right off the bat, is a good way to die.  That story is pretty interesting and evolves over the course of the subsequent games, but I wouldn't go in expecting a story on the level of Baldur's gate 1 or 2.  If you want a solid action RPG that requires a bit of tact and is more Neverwinter Nights than Diablo, this is a solid choice			"

												As a fan of Isometric CRPGs, I'd give Divine Divinity a big thumbs up. I spent many hours playing this game and I enjoyed 90% of them. The rest of the time is the trouble I had with Alt+Tabbing, OP bosses, not knowing where to find NPCs and being overencumbered while exploring.Positives:+ Good voice acting+ Large, detailed maps and multiple areas to explore+ Secrets/references/easter eggs+ Heaps of weapons and armour+ Heaps of quests to complete and heaps of enemies to level up from+ Levelling up feels like actual progress+ Game makes you feel like exploringCons:- Cliche storyline- No real quest guidance/hard to find NPCs in areas- Sometimes the camera really sucks- Enemies hard to target- Get♥♥♥♥♥♥tonnes of dosh and buy literally everything, so money doesn't matter to an extent- Some skills are pointless and you don't need to put points into them at all- Somewhat buggy cutscenes - The final cutscene of the game spawned halfway through the boss battle, and then my game ended.

												Beat it 100% using a Warrior.It's a great mix of Diablo and Baldur's Gate.  Very non-linear but enables you to complete all the quests and also to build your character to do pretty much what you want it to be (warriors can cast spells, pick locks just as well as Survivors etc.) Main issues with this game were bugs - there are some bugs to look out for that can make the game uncontinuable/unbeatable. To avoid this, accept every quest given and do not sell or drop quest items.  I have a relatively new computer and had a few speed issues but they weren't too big of a deal. Alt-tabbing can also be an issue.8 out of 10.			"

												They say that old is gold and I find that this proverb rings particularly true with the hack and slash fantasy role playing game Divine Divinity that was released in 2002.I'm not sure why I didn't get my hands on this game until now. And I probably wouldn't have played it still for years to come if I hadn't received it as a gift from a dear friend of mine. The best way to describe Divine Divinity is that it's a mix between Baldur's Gate, Diablo and Skyrim. Chances are that you'll love this game if you've played any of them, or better yet, all of them. However, one thing that you should know before diving into this game, is that it's pretty hard and requires quite a bit of dedication and perseverance. There will definitely be moments when you might want to give up and ragequit but try to hang in there and give it a chance because otherwise you'll miss out on a fantastic RPG experience.You can play as either a male or a female human and there are three classes - survivor, warrior and wizard - that you can choose from. Depending on which gender you pick, you receive certain starting attribute bonuses, for example, the male character has more strength and the female character is more agile. At the beginning of the game, your character wakes up in the cellar of a house in the small town called Aleroth that's home to several healers. Before long, s/he finds out that the leader of the healers has gone insane and s/he is, as might be expected, asked to find a solution to this problem. The story begins to unfold from there. Pros:- Divine Divinity has definitely aged well, although I believe that the art style that's been used in the game is pretty much ageless anyway. Furthermore, various patches have enabled DD to be played in widescreen and higher resolutions. The textures are crisp and spell effects still look pretty damn cool. All in all, as far as graphics go, I believe that DD could easily measure up to any point & click action RPG that's been released in recent years.- The soundtrack fits the eerie atmosphere of the game down to a tee.- The storyline is gripping and cohesive. It sure kept me glued to my screen for several hours at a time!- Odd, yet welcome, comical bits that pop up here and there. When I first encountered one of these random humorous encounters I felt slightly confused because up to that point I'd been under the impression that the game was very dark and serious. As I progressed through the game and started seeing these goofy bits more often I just got used to it and dealt with it, so to speak. - Lots and lots of sidequests. Some of them are pretty straightforward, others require you to do a bit of thinking, solve some puzzles or do a bit of research.- Familiar fantasy setting with various races like elves, dwarves, orcs, etc., that makes it easy for any RPG fan to immerse themselves in the world and maybe even grow to care about the characters that they meet.- Although the game has three classes to choose from, you can learn almost any skill that you want. For example, if you've picked the wizard class because you love to use magic but you really want to use a bow as your main weapon, then you can totally do that!Cons:- Overdramatic and cringeworthy voice acting.- Some very difficult boss fights that might seem impossible to win if you haven't levelled your character properly.- The font becomes very small with bigger resolutions and it's hard to read books, manuscripts, etc., unless you're sitting very close to the screen. To fix this, download a font enlargement patch.- The interface isn't very player friendly and it's quite awkward to use until you grow used to it. I think that it could have probably been handled a bit better. You can only map spells/skills/potions to the F-keys which means that you've only got 12 keys for all the stuff that you wish to map, and it isn't exactly natural to press those instead of the usual 1 to 0 buttons. - There's no button to make your character stand and attack on the spot during combat, so if you prefer to use ranged attacks and you misclick, then you can accidentally run into a horde of enemies and get yourself killed.In conclusion I'd say that if you're an RPG fan who hasn't played Divine Divinity yet, you should definitely give this game a go. Perseverance will be rewarded!			"

 “If it waddles like a duck and quacks like a duck, then you can probably surmise it’s an imp in disguise.” Divine Divinity represents a classic and very enjoyable action role-playing game, with a lot of charm and great love for detail. Each level offers a unique atmosphere, creative quests, humorous dialogues and vast amounts of different (and sometimes pretty though) enemies. The exploration of the various dungeons with all the loot, treasure chests and secrets will definitely keep you motivated to check every corner. Another strength of this game is the character development, which offers plenty of flexibility and freedom in terms of skill selection. Once you have reached a certain level, you can basically pick and increase any kind of ability. For example, a warrior swinging a two handed hammer while casting a freeze spell and throwing deadly scorpion traps is just one of many possible (and very effective) builds. The limited voice acting and repetitive (sometimes uninspiring) music should be mentioned as the disadvantages of this classic rpg.Overall, Divine Divinity can be considered as a rough diamond within the role-playing game genre, although there are some rough edges that would have needed more attention, in order to give it the finishing touch. Amusing quotes:  “You have a near invulnerability to lightning-based attacks. You can wear a copper helmet and stand in a vat of water on top of a church steeple during a storm, shouting ‘All gods are bloody ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s!’ with impunity.”  Trivia: Do not attack a cat! Otherwise every other cat will try to tear out your eyes! Must be some kind of telepathic link of demonic nature between them.

												Think of Diablo II, but open-world and more role-playing elements. Engaging story, practical skill sets, and intense combat make for a long and great campaign. I searched pretty much every area of the game (minus a few things) and got about 60-70 hours out of it. Be warned: Do your research before playing on things you should know before starting up.			"

												One of the best RPG I have ever played, it's a real gem that every RPG lover MUST play.In my opinion it's a 10/10, you have to consider this is a 12 years old game (it came out in 2002) so I'm basing my judgement on that, but if you want to compare it to a more recent game, I guess we all agree if I say it's a 2D Skyrim.The main quest is quite short if you just rush it to the end, but you can't, the game sidetracks you from everything you are doing with sidequests, exploration and fights. Don't be mislead by my playing time, it says 16 hrs but I played a lot in offline mode and it doesn't show, I think it's 70hrs more or less and I havent finished all sidequests.Let's now talk about specific stuff, shall we?***Graphics -  9/10 Considering the game age I'd say. Your character's equipment is pretty detailed and so is the environment, you almost never have the feeling of visiting a place already seen, not a single room is like the other, the only exception is for cave dungeons, these have always the same dark rock tiles and walls, and it gets boring after 15 mins, also it's so dark that you have trouble finding levers to open the doors.***Sound - 10/10 The music is just perfect, calm and sweet when you're travelling the forest but dark and deep when you're facing demons in the depths of the earth. Voice acting reminds me of theatre plays and maybe someone could dislike it, however it's really good. I had just one problem with sound, which I couldn't get rid of, it was like a scratch sound that played randomly at times, hopefully not too often, I guess it's some conflict due to the game being played on modern machines, but still, nothing to worry about.***Story - 10/10 Main quests and sidequests are pretty awesome, there is everything, from monster slaying to the only-talking quests. Some of them are very VERY long and sometimes you find out that completing a quest helps you in another one. There is even room for humor which is quite nice, and this is everywhere in the game, from dialogue answers to stats description, try reading then when values are low. Just once or twice I found myself baffled by the deus ex machina that comes at the right moment to save your skin without a serious explanation.***Gameplay & mechanics - 10/10 (unless you break it on purpose) Apart from the chaos of the menus, which is scary at the beginning, everything is just fine, you can build your character the way you like, pick up one of the classes (rogue, mage, warrior) and do whatever you want. The only problem is that there are 2 skill that are game breaking, one is frost and the other one is trap: steel scorpion. The first one makes you godlike by freezing your enemies for a lot of time and the latter one lets you summon minions that inflict an amount of damage that is simply unbelievable, if you also have the ability to charm them so that the scorpions follow you, then you can sit down and let them kill everything. So, don't do that and enjoy the game without these 2 skills, you have many others.***Replayable -YES. First playthrough I built a rougue-warrior, but I'm curious to see what a mage looks like. So this is a plus in the overall score.*** BONUS *** Steam version allows you to modify the resolution, otherwise you end up losing your eyes.TL, DR  it's 1,69€ on sale and 5€  full price. Just buy it and shut up. I said SHUT UP !!! BUY IT !!!			"

												I LOVE this game! Besides being an old RPG which is my thing (and I'm sure many other people like it as well, for games aren't really made like this anymore) it also has a ton of stuff that many other games don't.1. Good story and quests;2. Good fighting system and skills (even if you choose a mage, in-game you can still learn any skill of the other classes, so you're not stuck to just being a mage yourself. Any character can learn any class skill);3. Amazing world to explore, non linear (you can find secrets even in far open forests);4. No respawning enemies;5. Very long gameplay, around 80 or even 100 hours, depending on how long you take to do things or in the difficulty you chose;6. Great humour and voice acting;7. It's actually one of those games that makes you get so into it, it actually ends up making you hate or have compassion for certain characters. Not many games do that.8. Great story/plot9. Unlimited storage options (no squary inventory thing)10. Controls are similar to Diablo 2 but c'mon, Diablo doesn't compare.11. Old games ROCK!			"

												This game is fantastic.As simple as the graphics are, your mind fills in the blanks. You get a sense of the world you are in without the need for better eye candy.The quests are fun. The dungeons are challenging. There is plenty to steal. There are mysteries, easter eggs and all manner of mayhem. The hours I have logged from Steam came about when I was between mighty desktops and needed a game to slake my thirst in the interim. This one fit the bill: low sys requirements - obviously. Quite honestly I didn't expect to become as immersed in it as I did.Wonderful stuff. And damn - .89 USD during the summer sale.You would be a fool to pass it up - even if you only had a modicum of interest. Hell. I would even consider buying it for you. Just buy it. What. Are you some cheapskate that enjoys missing out on a good opportunity to pick up a great game?!? What is wrong with you?Buy the damned thing. It's good. Man are you thick in the head. ADD IT TO YOUR CART ALL READY.			"

												An early 2000's RPG, Divine Divinity appears to be trying to capture the success of the Diablo games. As a top-down action roleplaying game it is along the same lines as Diablo; However, it seems to have a more comprehensive conversation system in place, allowing for branched conversation trees. You can also develop your character according to your own personal play style regardless of the class you choose. This is actually not a concept found in many earlier RPG's, which gives Divine Divinity an added layer of appeal. All in All I thought it was fairly well done. It is an older game, so the visuals are not what you have probably come to expect, but the game still has charm and is still interesting and has a well thought out storyline. The background ambience is a nice touch, as is the changing music depending on where you go. I think if you are a fan of old school RPG's you will like Divine Divinity. Good choice for the RPG fan out there.			"

Underrated gem everyone should try, though with some potentially game breaking bugs. Play with guides listed below to avoid them.Divine Divinity was released in 2002 and the massive popularity of Diablo II around those times was probably what blocked its possible rise to the fame it deserves. Both games are focused on hack and slash combat with similar systems, like isometric camera, random loot generation or skill trees, though Divine Divinity being a singleplayer game allowed its world to be built much larger than Blizzard's game's. And Larian Studios did just that. ---Introduction to the story (spoilers for the beginning part of the game):The game tells the story of a man without memories who awakens in Aleroth, a town of healers, the leader of which, Mardaneus, has gone crazy and the player is asked for help with finding a source of his madness deep in the catacombs below. The main plot starts after Aleroth, once the player levels up and is able to leave without being in significant danger from nearby monsters. Saved from a dragon riding assailant by a wizard Zandalor, the player learns he is one of the three Marked Ones and they're the only people being able to stop the Black Ring organisation from summoning the Lord of Chaos to their world. To do so, they must gather the Council of Seven - most worthy representatives of all races, who together could help defend the land of Rivellon.---Positives:While the main plot itself might not be the most original out there, the world of Divine Divinity is huge and well detailed and its questlines are amazing, especially when compared to what games usually have nowadays. Players aren't held by their hand at all times, they will receive quests wanting them to enter areas filled with higher level monsters, they often have almost nothing to follow and must complete puzzles in order to advance. Some quests also feature more than one ending. There's also a lot of secrets in the maps, which might reveal great treasures to people keeping their eyes open.Players aren't restricted to any classes. In the beginning you get to choose your model - a warrior, a mage, a rogue (available in both male and female form), with each of them having some different stats and starting skills, but from now on you're not restricted in the slightest - want to be a sneaky thief summoner who wields a greatsword? Go for it.Personally I love both the game's art design as well as the soundtrack, both being pleasant to look at or hear. Give the Main Theme a listen!Bonus points to the game for Larian Studios' sense of humour - little jokes are placed here and there through the game, be it in notes, quests or animations. I'd love to share a few of them, but that would mean spoiling the fun and surprise.---Negatives:The main problem with this game are bugs. There's a bunch of situations during which you can accidently break many quests, including the main ones, simply by forgetting to do something or even denying a side mission. Fortunately, there are guides which list said quest breakers and let you know how to avoid them, such as the spoiler-light ""Avoiding Quest Breakers"" by Xendarii.Another thing players have to watch out for are the skills. Some of them either don't work at all or are useless compared to others. For that we have the ""Skills"" guide by Sir Percival.For an overall guide (with spoilers) featuring maps, quests, character building information and so on, I can recommend GameBanshee's one.[www.gamebanshee.com] "

												Many people say Divine Divinity is a clone of Diablo having in regard the implemented combat system. Well, they're right. But except that the game derives many features from classic cRPG games which makes it far more complex than enjoyable, but still very primitive in gameplay Diablo (1&2). If You really want compare Divine Divinity to other well known games to have some reference, then I must say this game is an offspring of Diablo 2 and Baldurs Gate 2. It inherits the combat system from Hack&Slash, which makes fighting very fleshy and satisfying. Other characteristic features are random loot placement, limited class selection (warrior, mage and rouge) and no companions. The story telling  on the other hand is a classic cRPG. Destiny places our protagonist in the wrong place in the wrong time, entangling him/her in fight for sirvival, initially for his/hers own life, but eventually for the sake of whole world. And the world is really BIG in this game. You will visit villiges, big cities, wander forests and impenetrable darknses of dungeons. In that time You will meet many interesting NPCs which You can speak, trade and fight, accomplish about 80 side quests not necessarily involving fighting, and even solve puzzles, some involving the physic engine implemented in the game! Did I told the player can even make a camp or decorate his/hers home? No problem with that in Divine Divinity.I could write a whole article about this game, but instead I encourage to play it on Your own. The best two recomendations I can give are that Divine Divinity was listed among the ""Top 100 PC Games Of All Time"" by PC GAMER in 2012. The second one is telling You to listen to the game soundtrack composed by Kirill Pokrovsky, especially the ""Drunk with dwarven mirth"".Have a nice game ;)			"

												I'm still very, very early on in the game, but as I'm now on my fourth character start, there are some things I'd like to tell myself from two days ago: Save the game, you moron. Save it often, else when you die you have to redo all the things.  The game will not help you on how to play it. Go read some guides and forums to figure out how the game works. Even if that's not ""doing it right,"" it is how YOU will have more fun. You like solving puzzles and quests; not puzzling out how your stats work. Yes, I know you like playing blaster mages, but you'll soon learn that you like playing blaster mages when you have another player acting as a tank to keep the enemies from all rushing you. You will be terrified of everything and die a lot. While Survivor and Wizard look like cool classes, they are harder to play. You have no strategy yet. Go play a warrior. While the female warrior is off putting in a chainmail bikini, you will soon pick up more armor and therefore be clothed. In reference to the above point, it is in your best interest to steal everything you can get ahold of when no one is looking. There are no negative consequences to stealing if you don't get caught. It is okay to go outside of the village without having finished everything there. In fact do so, kill some orcs, level up, and then go back to the catacombs. Your fears about the graphics looking bad are baseless, since you've barely played any computer games in the past decade and this is still what you expect computer games to look like.All in all I'm greatly enjoying myself. I love exploring everywhere I possibly can and this game greatly encourages that.			"

												Well written, and vivid, characters give an additional spunk to a very good story portrayed in the game. This is complemented by a variaty of side quests, each rewarding in it's own way. Yes, even washing the dishes!Impact of the class choice is mostly reflected in a special move your character can perform. Other than that, there are no restrictions to learnable skills. This very freedom may be impairing for the newcomers to the genre. Namely, investing in utility skills, very early on, could make the combat tiring and the game less enjoyable. That said, you are highly likely to focus on developing your playstyle during the early part of the game. Once you are confident in your platsyle, you will find yourself exploring the game world and adventuring by your own compass. This, in itself, changes the feel of the game from interesting to compelling.The music is rather good and helps create an immersive atmosphere. It is a shame that characters with strong local influence are not voiced, for it could have provided the game with an edge. While I did experience a couple of sound effect bugs, restarting the game solved them.I found the graphics satisfactory but couldn't shake the feeling that more could have been invested into visual effects of spells.Dig through game's local content to find the manual, there is no link from library :(I earnestly recommend this game.

												Though it shows its age at times, this game is engrossing and challenging, and sports a wicked sense of humor. The only real complaints that I can level at this game are that some of the skills are buggy, and there is a strange audio glitch sometimes. Other than that, this game is a 10/10, with an excellent soundtrack, to boot.			"

												I've played other rpg's in the past.  Mostly jrpg's, fallout, and elderscrolls type rpg's.  This was my first isometric crpg and I loved it.  From the story line, to the gameplay.  I loved the simplicity of it.  The story hooks you in right away.  I also love all the other little stories they had from the books inside the game.  The beginning of the game can be a little hard if you don't place your skills just right.  But later on it gets more customizable.  Beat it and loved it.			"

												Great retro RPG game.  I enjoyed working my way through the quests while roaming around the land.  Quests in the main story line must be completed in order but the game doesn't push you to complete the main quest (although you will want to do so, of course).By the time I really attacked the main quest line I had uncovered the entire map and completing almost all the side quests.  Most of these are found by speaking to NPCs.  ""My son has been kidnapped, please help me find him"", for example.  Sometimes a clue is given to lead you to the right area; sometimes you stumble upon the area in your travels.  This brings up the only negative aspect I'll mention.  You can break quests by clearing areas before  you get the quest for that area.  Since these are aways specifc locations (cave, house, tree, person, etc.) all you have to do is to avoid a location that looks like it may hold a quest item/person.  Find a spider cave in the woods -- leave it until someone gives you a quest that involves a spider cave.Nice character development aspects as well.  Graphics are old but still crisp and easy to watch.  If you want a good romp through a nicely laid-out land, grab this game.			"

												based on logging 90hrs I would definitely recommend it. I can never understand how someone plays a game 70+ hrs and doesn't recommend it. The game has aged well (played first time 2016) , and is kinda a cross between diablo,dungeon siege and even a hint of the older ultima series. until the end, the economics work, always feel there is something to buy or work farming for. Questing is fun too, with a few of the quests taking a little time explorering and interviewing npcs.  Few notes.. works fine in windows 2010, but you need a patch to support 32bit color, as well us software render instead of directx (really) so cut scenes work.  You can probably live without watching most of them, but there is one place you will be stuck until you switch to software render. I noticed no difference in graphics quality or performance between the 2, so I would just set it from the get go. I haven't made it to original sin yet, so I cant compare it.. With a ton of action rpgs available now, it still is on the top of the list for must plays			"

												Remember when everybody called this a Diablo clone? It's actually an Ultima clone. Keep that in mind while you play and I guarantee you'll adore this game.Encounters aren't really thoughtfully designed, and worst of all the entire last three hours or so of the game is a mindless slog of spammy combat. Almost everything else is superb, especially after the first couple hours when the world opens up. I personally put it right up there with Ultima VII and Gothic II: Night of the Raven as one of the most fun open-world RPGs ever made.			"

												Divine Divnity is a game that was lost under the massive shadow of Diablo 2's release. While the game is similar to Diablo in its isometric, hack-and-slash type mechanics, there's a lot more to the game than meets the eye. There's a lot of dialogue, RPG elements, quests and non-linear story progression that you can find in the game.You can pick between three (technically six) classes: Warrior, Mage, and Survivor (aka thief). You can play as male or female, and each gender starts off with different abilities. Despite the class system, you can build your character any way you want through attribute and skill points. If you want to be a warrior that uses two-handed swords and casts spells, you can do that. If you want to be a character that's balanced in all three aspects, you can do that as well.The story, for the most part, is told well and written well, but it's not particularly gripping. You play as an adventurer who wakes up in a basement in Aleroth, a village full of healers. The town's leader, Mardaneus, has been afflicted with Alzheimer's -- I mean, he's been possessed by an undead mage and he's gone crazy. After braving the village's catacombs to kill the jerk that bewitched Mardaneus, the player can explore outside of the village. The story has pretty cliche elements: an army of orcs is going to attack the human kingdom, dwarves don't get along with elves, evil wizards plotting in the background, etc. That being said, there's a lot of easter eggs in the world, and the game can at least be light-hearted and make fun of itself.Combat is straightforward, but it can be exhausting at times; you'll be literally clearing through dozens and dozens of mobs in order to get to a single objective, and then you'll have to backtrack all the way through a dungeon to get to the next part of a quest (This is magnified tenfold in the final stages of the game). In addition, the game sometimes struggles with enemy balancing. For example, when you leave Aleroth, you will occasionally run into an orc that is at least ten levels higher than you. After a while, enemy level does not become an issue, but the problem is still prevalent early on in the game.Despite a few quest-breaking bugs and sometimes repetitive gameplay, I liked Divine Divinity. It's a good game for a cheap price, and it's a refreshing change of pace from the AAA crap that is spewed out in 2016. Give it a try.			"

												My all time favorite isometric RPG.Divine Divinity is a classic 2D open-world RPG game. The freedom to do everything you please makes this game feels like a classic Skyrim. You can ignore quest and kill everyone, or be the hero and save the world. Everything is yours to decide.One of the best thing in this game is the ability pick any object that can be dragged into your inventory window. Let say you want some chest or barrel to store your item, you can drag it on your inventory window and when you arrive at your house, you can drop it and store your items or gears. The chest/barrel will stay in that place for the rest of the game so it's safe to use.Did I mentioned house? Well what a surprise! You can actually customize your house by picking objects on your travels such as plants, chests, decorations, chairs, foods, fruits, gardening tools even small objects like knife and seasoning salt and drop them in your house to make it livelier.

House full of objectsAnd when you're done decorating your house maybe you need a quick nap? Well you can do that in this game. You can drop the teleportation item for quick access to your house so you can sleep in your bed to recover your mana and when you wake up you'll be ready to kill skeleton warriors again.			"

												Divine Divinity is Diablo with heart.This 2002 aRPG by Larian Studios, that somehow managed to survive its name and go on to spawn a series that's still running today, differs from its inspirations in ambition and scope, if not execution. Instead of attempting to ride on its mindless, shoddy combat Divnity manages to keep itself at least somewhat fresh with a healthy amount of non-combat activities and quests. This doesn't excuse the combat, a repetitive near-grind of slaughtering the same few enemies wearing different skins with auto-attacking clicks and the odd skill, but it does make it somewhat palatable. Biggest gameplay issues is that the skill system, while open, requires an absurd amount of investment in order to be useful while still expecting and demanding experimentation. I'd half recommend keeping a save editor around, just because to hell with that one quest requiring Telekinesis 2.Every point to make in Divine Divinity's favour comes with a matching caveat, a con that pushes it towards mediocrity. It's open world (moderately, very large maps to say the least), but with the wholesale reuse of assets and utter lack of interests mean that being open world adds absolutely nothing, quite a bit less than conventional tight level design would. Wandering, indistinguishable mooks that may as well be the same enemy with different skins and stats don't help. There's hidden chests and barrels in the dungeon that contain items, but all the equipment is randomly generated along with shopkeep inventories, meaning that you just statcheck against your current gear, then sell or move on.""Diablo with heart"" - me, 10 seconds agoPulling the Diablo-popularized ""single evolving sprite"" of character progression may solve aesthetic problems, but not when the lack of variety highlights every unfavourable aspect of the sprite itself. A giant grey great helm does not mesh with brown plate armour and itty bitty hands. Art design itself is fine - nothing exciting, somewhat gritty, but the 3D rendered models blend in with 2D scenery seamlessly.Character progression focused RPGs are the ultimate in escapism. Ultimately Divine Divinity achieves this, character progression being palpable without being ridiculous and reasonable without being misers with power.Writing is what drives this game, not the one-note gameplay - and the writing in Divine Divinity, from the questlines to dialogue to the story, is wholly satisfying. The setting, while entirely Tolkien and not winning any points for being so, manages to stay engaging through a novel amount of lore and a healthy dollap of political chaos. Comedy, notably, is tasteful as it is comically relieving from the mind-numbing gameplay.Divinity has quests, adventures, stories, instead of just a series of thinly veiled errands. But after clearing out the umpteenth corners of empty open world maps, fighting mooks and watching that EXP bar grow as my tired eyes clamored for that Skinner Box feedback loop, the writing mattered very little. During brief periods of lucidity, maybe. The one wholesale positive point of the game, washed out by the rest of it.Ultimately, Divine Divinity is a lukewarm recommendation to a very specific - or somewhat desperate - niche, but a recommendation nonetheless. If you're clamouring for escapism, to ignore your horrible life for a few days and just exist while wanting a product that's more ambitious than the norm, then Divine: Divinity is what you want. Don't expect it to change your life, but do expect it to help you forget your life.			"

												Decent action rpg, feels oldschool, similar to Diablo 1. Has a load of interesting quests and characters. It has quite a steep learning curve at the start, if you're not familiar with this type of game. The plot whilst cliche, is still interested to play through in some parts, and apart from the graphics, the game stands up well compared to other new rpgs. Of course a lot of people care about amazing graphics, which this game really doesn't have, but you'll see from the screenshots if you like the style or not. Personally I love these types of isometric style action games. Other points to note are the music track, which is quite atmospheric, the many sidequests which make this game worth the price, especially on a steam sale where you can pick it up extremely cheap.

												Excellent game, which easily gave me 60 hours of good old-timey-rpg fun. It's got a light-hearted storyline and a lot of very original side-quests (which I must admit I enjoyed more than the main quest line). You will encounter situations where you'll go ""oh, snap"", admiring the ideas thrown in and it really shows that the developers were having fun making the game. The graphics are beautiful (for 2d fans) and didn't feel dated at all to me. The soundtrack is enjoyable, although it may sound a bit low-budget. The only remark I have is that if you decide to do every side quest in the game, you'll get crazy powerful and the late game will bore you. I found myself just skipping around the mazes and ignoring the enemies in the last level, just because it felt like a chore to kill the minions, which were no challenge. Last boss was a 4 second piece of cake.8.5/10. Not as good as Arcanum/Baldur's Gate or the other timeless classics, but a must play nevertheless.			"

I did however have alot of the issues in the negative reviews- slow framerates, long loads, and freezing/crashing of the game- UNTIL I did a little research. When you first launch this game go to the configuration screen and set it to Software rendering, set your resolution to 1024x768 and click the smoothness box. Problems solved. It's an old game but still looks decent enough with the resolution. The storyline and game play more than compensate for the graphics. Enjoy!			"

Posted: May 15, 2014
												Divine Divinity is a game that I discovered after playing another excellent game developed by Larian called Divinity: Dragon Commander.  At first I thought it looked like a Diablo clone, but it differentiates itself from Diablo in many areas.  My playtime clocked in at 40 hours. I ended up skipping a lot of content not because I wanted to but because my character had become practically invincible by Act 3 and that the game simply does not care whether you fail a side quest.I played the game on a 1024x768 resolution that was stretched to fit my monitor with black borders in the left and right.  Text does not scale well to a 1920x1080 resolution.  This is an artifact from the time the game was created.  The text for dialogue and item descriptions on higher resolutions was not unreadable or blurry, but it was annoyingly small.  Another reason for using the smaller resolution is that the game uses a sight range statistic. This mechanic means that enemies out side of your sight range are not visible even if you can 'see' that area of the map around yourself. Enemies pop up practically next to you when your sight range is low.  This was jarring for me and the problem was fixed with the lower resolution.Why would you play a game like this? Because it offers so many different ways to play.  Abilities are not set to any particular class. Every ability can be used by any class and can be leveled up five times.  You gain one skill point per level and every five level you gain an additional skill point.  This system  forces one to make deliberate choices in what skills to acquire and upgrade to create a powerful and versatile character, but there are many successful paths to take.  A lot of the fun in playing an RPG is discovering skill sets and items that work well together.  Divine Divinity succeeds in providing customization.There are mechanics in the game that are not explained well.  I highly suggest reading the manual before playing because I stumbled a few times. Items in the environment can be moved by left clicking and dragging it away from its initial position.  I believe that there is check against the strength statistic and the weight of the item to see if you can move it. There are many secret passages and items that are found behind piles of crates, barrels, rocks and haystacks so keep an eye out.  In order to equip runes to gear that has 'charm x' quality, you need to skill up an enchant weapon skill in the warrior tree.  Runes are key to improving resistances and stats your character is deficient in.Combat is simple hack and slash and provides ample opportunity to kite tougher enemies.  Left click on an enemy and auto attacks happen until it either it dies or you die. Abilities and spells are performed with right clicks.  The game lets you hotkey spells, items, and potions to the function keys F1, F2, etc.  I used these to toggle between melee weapons and ranged weapons and to change my spells.  Selecting a spell through a hotkey sets it for use on a right click.  The game also has a pause function that allows you to change your spell at your leisure.  There is a lot of combat and it is mediocre at best.  The game throws different enemies at you that require different strategies to be effective against and some of the bosses are brutal without preparation.The graphics for outdoor environments are highly detailed a nice to look at.  As you explore the musical score fades in an out so you can traverse the wilderness listening to background noises of the forest, fields and cities.  Dungeons are darker and blander.  There are four large overland maps that are littered with quests, monsters and new places to discover.  A few multilevel dungeons give the game its Diablo like feel.  It is a good mix of overland exploration and dungeoneering.Voice acting is limited  and what exists is woefully terrible.  Despite that, I could not get enough of my character yelling “Fantastic!” every time she leveled up.  The game throws you into a hornets nest at the beginning.  You are level one and the entirety of the starting area is surrounded by level 9-20 enemies.  Discovery of the first dungeon and figuring out how to navigate it efficiently is a key facet to understanding how the game's exploration is supposed to play out.  Progressing to the point of being able to destroy enemies that gave you a hard time is always satisfying.The final dungeon was not enjoyable.  It was too long and had too many enemies.  When the time comes, you can run through most of it to get to the ending. There is a lot more I could say about Divine Divinity but if I did this review would end up being a tome.  I hope that the review has shown a slice of the depth there is to Divine Divinity.  I can not give the game a blanket recommendation for everyone even though I had fun playing through significant portions of it.			"

												Divine Divinity is a fantastic old-school RPG.  There's a little bit of everything here in one aspect or another: Ultima VII, Sacred, and the great Infinity Engine games with some Diablo hack-n-slash action thrown in--though most things not done quite as well.  The graphics (again, like the Infinity Engine games) have held up amazingly well and the game is still beautiful, boasting a soundtrack just as much so.There's a vast, incredibly detailed above-ground and subterranian world packed full of secrets, quests and treasure for you to discover.  The skill system is filled with useful abilities, very little filler and doesn't restrict you to your class skills; even if you start as a mage you can pick up some thief skills along the way if you desire, and chances are you'll want to.  Combat is satisfying and the difficulty seems just right.  Not much point in playing as multiple characters due to the open skill system, but the game already packs dozens of hours.  Same price as GOG, so don't hesitate to buy it if you don't have hangups about playing older games.			"

												Well all in all its a quite enjoyable game but its the first part and the game world is not that big. I also had a bug that prevents me from saving as soon as i teleport in specific regions. Sadly this bug occured in the last main quest where you have to get the council of the 7 togehter. Because of that wasnt been able to finish this game. Pros:- good old rpg- a lot of skills- powerful hybrid charaters possibleCons:- Sound-bugs- Save-bugs- Only a few in-game vendors- not enough high level enemies One last tip for good equipment: Quicksave before you kill bosses and re-roll - that can make your life a lot easier especially when you play on hard-mode.

												It's kind of like Morrowind invaded Diablo II. It's a very open world ARPG without a terrible amount of guidance or quest markers. The only handholding this game will do is the occasional place mark of interest on automap if something is mentioned in dialogue thing. Quests are usually straightforward enough, but some require some critical thinking, exploring, and secret finding.You can choose between 3 classes (Warrior, Mage, Survivor) with male and female variants, both starting with slightly different innate skills. You can also mix and match your character with other classes' abilities, and make a warrior-battlemage-paladin-thief if you so desire.Combat: You got your standard left click on enemy physical attack, character auto-attacks it until it dies. Your spells: Shove lightning bolts up enemies asses until they die. Then you got your Stealth: Lay traps, sneak around, backstab, and poison enemies until they die. Exploration: Being an open world game, there's a lot of land to cover, but what I didn't expect this game to have is some RTS elements, like fog of war, and being able to pan your camera anywhere in the current level by holding shift, and you can even pause the game to piddle about your inventory to take a potion or whatever. There's also several large overworlds connecting to the main one, and the way you enter them is you walk up to the black-wall-of-nothingness-end-of-level and it asks you whether to proceed to the next area or stay in the current one, reminds me of S.T.A.L.K.E.R, speaking of marked one...Then there's the teleport stones and teleporters. Teleporters are much like waypoints in D2, in that you just find them and click on them to activate them. However, in this game its not that simple, you need specific teleporter activation scrolls to enable them. Like a couple of waypoints will require a human scroll, and some will require a dwarf scroll, etc. These scrolls don't expire and are simply needed to activate the teleporters, and can be found in various parts of the world, mainly from NPCs that will give them to you if they trust you enough. The teleporter pyramid stones are much like a Farore's Wind, except they work anywhere. Lay one down one place, and lay the other one down another place to make a two way portal. You can also just use the one in your inventory to make a one way teleport. Ideally, you lay one down in an area with merchants (like a town), bring the other one with you, and use it to go back and forth to offload your loot and get supplies and the like. You can lose one or the other pretty easily if you don't remember to pick up the one you travel with back up after teleporting back. Man, talk about being anal about using a town portal. I love it.Other: There's a metric ton of containers to loot, deposit items, and even put in your inventory to bring back with you to make a little home-made stash in your town of choice. As well as a lot of books and manuscripts to read, some being lore, or an illustration, a recipe, something completely random and silly, or something important to a quest.There be tons of baddies everywhere to kill, and like a true RPG, some are incredibly overleveled and OP near the earlier areas, until you get swole and take revenge on their never respawning sorry asses. Yeah, it seems enemies never respawn, at least for the most part. This game remembers literally EVERYTHING. So if you're an elite OCD person, you could kill every enemy, merchant, guard, civilian, defenseless forest critter, loot every item, lift every rock (literally), and stuff every container down your trousers, and the game remembers it all. Save files got absolutely huge near the end of the game, somewhere around 50-70 MBs a save, that's pretty insane.There's quite a lot of sidequests to take on, aside from the main quest, and at least most of them are pretty interesting and fun to solve.Technical:The game runs well enough on a modern OS (Windows 7), but it did crash a couple times, and then even worse, a large handful of times a random burst of static played, then after several seconds the game looped the last .3 seconds of sound over and over like it froze, but the game continued playing fine until several more seconds passed in which the game slowed to a crawl and held my CPU hostage constantly using 50% until I ctrl+alt+delete ♥♥♥♥♥smacked the process down. It's like the game's sound gets confused, and randomly holds my CPU at gunpoint. Quicksaving and quickloading after the burst of static seems to prevent it from hanging, preventing a reboot of the game.Overall I give this an 8/10, an overlooked gem I wish I had discovered much earlier.

Product received for free
												Never played this when it come out in 2002. Just finished it.The game is very immersive. The graphics are isometric 3D, simply but they do the job. The music is weird. You can't called it good music, but in a way it is because it adds immensily to the immersiveness, with a lot of ambient music, and it sounds otherworldly. The characters and dialogue are pretty good, but not in a serious way. This game is not at all serious and you might be disappointed by the lore, the voice actors (very funny) and the discussions IF you take the game seriously. So you shouldn't in my oppinion. There is alot about Tolkien here, cause its high fantasy, but also some winks (like the dagger that shines when orcs are nearby) and some references to Terry Pratchett as well if I am correct. Also some insider stuff like the AA Gent scroll. The world map is quite large and pretty good, maybe a bit too much of the same though.The battle system is relatively simple but basically like Diablo. I found to be challenging in the beginning but in accordance with the name of the game, you become godlike towards the end (health and resistances and stats begin to skyrocket with the use of gems). Also, frost is utterly broken, broken! Because of these things the game becomes too easy towards the end, even on the highest difficulties. So maybe it's not a bad idea to not use frost weapons and less gems. On the other hand, you can make so much potions that you can full heal like 99 times. In short, there are some balancing issues to this game, but they can be avoided if you so choose. There are quite alot of sequence bugs in quests as well and that kind of sucks.Overall, I was happily surpriced by a game with Diable battle mechanics, a lot of questing and exploration and quite alot of humour, it is really a funny game.So, I give a 7.5/10. I would have given a higher score if not for the bugs and overpowered stuff in the game. "

												This game has some of the best music in the entire gaming world-- beautiful, haunting, atmospheric, memorable in a lifetime. Beneath the old school graphics, the gameplay is excellent, there are interesting skills and vast amount of lore. Your actions and words have consequences. NPCs have personality and top-notch voice acting. This game also contains some super hilarious dialogue. I believe the game was developed by a rather small team, with many members doing multiple roles. Well, they totally beat some of the larger studios with this incredibly thoughtful game. Bravo guys!

												As someone who doesn't really go out of my way to try new games, especially if I'm under the misconception that I'll be frustrated by it, I'm so, so, SO happy I tried out this game. The music is great, the sound effects just pop out at you, and though I occasionally get a weird static sound because I'm on Windows 7, that one little thing doesn't keep the game from running great on my trash laptop. Loot is one of my favorite things in RPGs, and it is freaking glorious in this game, and you can get skills like enchanting, identifying, and repair that makes it so much more fun and rewarding. Speaking of skills, if you were perhaps a bit more ""casual"", as in you haven't played older RPGs, and feel intimidated by this, or maybe you like games like Skyrim that let you use any weapon and use magic as a big buff axe-wielding barbarian, this game is for you - any class can use any skill - a pickpocketing wizard, a lightning-slinging warrior, a thief in heavy plate. It's easy to pick up, and ridonculous amounts of fun to master.			"

tl;dr -> I rolled a mage and felt bad that my weapons would break quickly whenever I ran out of mana so I decided to go the hybrid warrior route. 11/10 worse decision ever - battlemage not OP.I won this game in a giveaway and was excited to try it out because I've always loved isometric action RPGs (aRPGs). I was satisfied with my gameplay experience.If you like isometric aRPGs, exploring a lore- and loot-heavy world, and fantasy elements, then you will enjoy this game. It reminded me a lot of the Diablo franchise (1 and 2), 2 being the game that I still have played for the longest in my entire life (2 entire summers). The aesthetics are good - the amount of detail in the massive game world is very nice. The different effects for spells and skills is numerous enough to keep things interesting. Extra lore is provided in the form of readable text like books and pages, adding to the well-written story. I liked that the characters in the selection screen actually speak out their bios (and that they were actually different for each hero, even though they were simple male/female variants of the mage, warrior, and rogue/survivor). The music and sounds are good, adding to the fantasy atmosphere. Controls are easy to familiarize yourself with, but may take some time if you are not experienced with aRPGs. There is no tutorial, so a new player's start may progress slowly at first. The learning curve is minimal to moderate depending on your familiarity with aRPGs - because the skill tree allows you to select from all three heroes' routes, it is possible to roll/develop a character that is horribly underlevelled/underpowered. I strongly recommend you save often, and in multiple slots.Gameplay consists of you moving around the game world, with attacks hotkeyed to your left- and right-mouse click. For example, I can have a weapon (dagger) assigned to my left-click and a spell (fireball) assigned to my right-click when using my mage. Before you begin your game, you will be able to select a character from 6 options - male or female mage, warrior, or rogue. You cannot customize how they look, but you can change the character portrait. Each character starts with different stats (ex: warrior is combat oriented and has more health than the other heroes), however, you have access to the entire skill network, so it is possible to select abilities from the mage and rogue trees when you level up and are playing a warrior. This allows you to experiment with different character combinations to suit your playstyle. The heroes also have different special attacks (ex: mage can teleport a short distance). When you level up, you can also allocate skill points to your base stats like constitution and strength. The game world is fairly expansive, and there are plenty of opportunities to explore hidden areas and dungeons if you are thorough enough. These extra locations are great for farming levels and loot, however, be sure to bring a lot of potions. There is a minimap that you can toggle to help with navigation. Combat is typical of your standard aRPG - spam your attacks and spells/abilities until your opponents are dead. Enemies will sometimes drop loot like gold and weapons. Feedback is given whenever you hit or are hit, indicating how much damage is traded; experience gain is also shown. Overall, the game is a very good aRPG, and anyone interested in the genre should definitely give it a try.Recommend!Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews "

												This game is a lot of fun. You explore a huge world, gather tons of loot, and you can spec your character for melee, magic or both. Have tons of summons, or nuke from range. The graphics are of course dated, 12+ years later, but they still don't look bad. The story is ok, but the game does not take itself seriously. A few jokes actually had me laughing out loud. Imagine Diablo if you could spec your character anyhow you wanted, the world was more interesting, and there was an epic story.			"

												The game looks a bit like Diablo 2 (isometric) but plays different, instead of holding the mouse to attack you can just click once to keep attacking. You can pause the whole game (with spacebar) to relax and take a look at your potions and equipment. Health (and stats in general) doesn’t increase so dramatically on higher levels. Also the whole world is not infested by demons (like in diablo) and you will meet a lot of friendly NPC's in the world. It's a lot bigger than you would think judging by first glance, there are caves and underground areas and there are always people around to talk with that can give you something to do, despite some of them having trivial problems. I'm level 23 for god sake and slaughter orcs in almost two hits, I don't care about your lost kitty little girl! But then again some of these quests do have a more suprising outcome.The game does not give you any visual hints of where to go and what to do regarding quests, you should just read the note in the quest-log. The main plot also gets a little bit lost when you are running around trying to get quests and level up. So you might end up not really knowing where to go and just wander into uncharted territory hoping to get something useful. At least that is how I go about it.Do however note that the game gets a little cryptic at the end you might just wander past stuff you were supposed to be doing something and by pressing alt (to see items etc.) you can't find everything you need all the time. It had me search stuff in the internet otherwise I would've just been stuck a whole lot more times, maybe old fashioned game design is to blame here.Overall it's a really fun game despite the flaws, worth the price if you like to play isometric RPGs. I also have to say that I find the combat in this more satisfying than for example titan quest. Though it does sometimes send enemies at you that are way too strong but which you could just defeat later on.			"

												Divine Divinity is described as a ""2D Skyrim"" in the advertisement video; however, I honestly think that's selling it a little short.  It's a much deeper game with much more customization available and a lot more hidden things to discover.  It's an ARPG in the sytles of Diablo but where Diablo focused on gameplay and had a tight/rushable grinding experience Divine Divinity spends much more time in the ""Roleplaying"" section of the ARPG namesake.  The pace is slower, you can customize your character in much greater ways to build one that's truly unique, and the narrative of the game is more story-centric and focused on taking you through various towns that you can explore that are populated with many different NPCs to interact with.  There are a lot of quests and many different hidden secrets and eastereggs to discover, so one of my favorite features is actually allowing you to place a personalized marker on the map to remind yourself of something you'll want to come back to at a later point in time.I loved exploring the world and interacting with the characters.  The game is quite large, so there are several bugs and a few quests that break, but nothing that really detracted from the game for me.  Except the framerate.  I played the majority of the game on Direct 3D rendering mode and the framerate suffered.  Like, really suffered.  It's a testament to how much I enjoyed playing Divine Divinity that I continued along when every time poisoin clouds were being rendered or a lot of enemies were onscreen the engine slowed to a crawl.  When I switched to the Software renderer at about 50 hours of gametime in the framerate increased dramatically and I no longer experienced slowdowns.  It does break video cutscenes and doesn't look as nice but if you're aggravated by the framerate like I was give that a shot and swap back when you need to.If you like ARPGs and would like to experience a living world around one don't pass on this game.

												You want that potion? Take it. That chair? Sure, it'll look great in your new house you just decided to move into. That chest is full of treasure, just shove the whole thing in your inventory. You'll be rich when you get back to your merchant buddy, George, he'll give you a discount if you slip him a freebie. Now, should you save that farm, or go find that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ troll king? Both? Later! You haven't eaten in ages, grub and a pint at the Dwarven Bread Inn then! You know, I hear you can find a good fight there too...This is the best open world RPG I have ever played. A timeless classic with unlimited depth and freedom. I started writing a personal  walkthrough 12 years ago and still haven't found everything this masterpiece has to offer.			"

												Never heard of this game before, and when I saw it on Steam, I checked the screenshots, and I did not like it very much, it looked ... messy.Then I went to the forums to read about it, and after seeing how people praise this game, plus the really cheap price, I bought it.And my God, this was my best Steam purcashe ever! - ImmersionI was suprised to find myself reading every book, and every manuscript, that I came across. I usually skip through books, and conversations in rpg-s because most of the time, they are just so generic and boring. Not in this game! Everything so far was interesting, cleverly written, and sometimes even humorous. The same goes for conversations.- Sound / MusicSometimes the audio glitches, and makes a loud hissing sound, but other than that, the sounds are OK. The music is fantastic! Again, I was suprised, that instead of the usual generic medieval stock music that most rpgs have, Divine Divinity starts off with an amazingly beautiful main menu music, and so far, I found all the tracks interesting, and memorable.- GraphicsThe screenshots don't do this game justice, I don't know why the store screenshots made me think the game looks messy, when you are ingame, it looks perfectly clear, yet artistic, and just plain nice! Everything looks like so much care and talent was put into it.tl;dr Good game, buy it!			"

												A marvelous gem among the RPG genre! The game, even though it's pretty old, boasts a number of features not commonly found back in the day when it came out. One of which has to be the insane amount of environment interactivity that enables you to pick up, take with you or move/throw pretty much anything that's not nailed to the floor. Story-wise, it's a classic good vs. evil theme where you play a role of one of the chosen ones (yup, you're not a lone... well, not in the beginning at least :)) and you need to help a wizard stop the crazy Black ring cult from summoning the Lord of Chaos.For all you Diablo fans out there - Divine Divinity pretty much takes whatever made Diablo II great and implements it perfectly within it's own concepts with a few extra tweaks to make the game unique. There are lots of armors and weapons and the vast palette of skills ensures you to craft the character to your liking. Wanna be a magic wielding warrior? Or a two-hander fighting mage? Not a problem in Divinity.Steam version of this game is actually a re-release with enhanced graphics and fullHD resolution support (16:10 formats included!) so the game looks awesome, packed with details bursting out of your screen. I'm a sucker for 2D graphics but Divine Divinity really looks and feels warm'n'cousy all the time. Especially while visiting taverns with lots of NPCs to talk to, warm fire flickering in the corner while a local drunkard is trying to woo some poor waitress...The game is packed with side quests and tiny details like NPC dialog that help you finish or find more quests which are never set in a way that holds your hand. Instead - You need to explore, ask around and find out for yourself everything that has to do with the current mission that you're on.Unfortunately, the game has some bug issues most of which are patched or easily avoidable - but there are a few game breaking bugs you might run into. For example - looting an item way before gaining a quest that tells you that the same item belongs to a person and you need to return it. If you've sold it - you can't finish the quest. Or a specific NPC that's vital to the main story that bugs and disables you from teleporting further.Luckily, the Divinity community is still very active and actually all bugs have a way of ""un-bugging"" them either by workarounds or simple ""cheats"".As a huge RPG fan, this game is probably somewhere in my top 3 RPGs I've ever played.

												Divine Divinity is in essence a fleshed out version of  Diablo 1 & 2, with a mixture of Baldur's Gate thrown in for good measure. The game boasts an amazing soundtrack, gorgeous visuals, (for it's time), and an indepth and interactive item system. Nearly anything and everything in the game can be used, sold, bartered for, or combined. That goes for jugs, barrels, mushrooms, and so forth. The game, sadly, only makes use of about 3 classes, but makes up for that loss with an impressive array of skills. Any skill found in the game can be used by any class of character, (although as a Warrior a Fireball skill isn't necessarily that useful). All in all, Divine Divinity will provide a lengthy and interesting gaming experience for a low sum of 6 dollars.			"

												Everything is right in this game. I got it very cheap in 10/2005 from a gaming magazine and played it a lot. The CD is scratchy now so I bought it on Steam.  * Best fitting game soundtrack I know (you can download it for free)* Easy to understand control* 3 male + 3 female player classes * Extensive skill system, but not too complex (unlike P&P)* Classic epic storyline with main quests and lots of side quests * Some humorous elements to lighten up the mood* You can amongst other things steal, sneak, break in, lockpick, perform magic or use brute force* Big open world with many diverse localities and different races, secrets, caves, dungeons...- Due to its age, the Steam overlay won't work, so you can't upload screenshots without using complicated workarounds.Be prepared to get disorientated at the beginning. It takes a while until you know where you must go. Just enter the darkness, talk to everyone and make use of the saving option.			"

You can find a comprehensive review of the game below the pros and cons, as well as a summarizing conclusion right at the end.Pros+ Overall nice main plot+ Up to 60-70 hours play time+ Great and varying quests+ A vast number of weapons and items+ Mostly coherent atmosphere+ Good soundtrackCons- Outdated graphics- A bunch of bugs and technical issues- Weak last story chapter- Some world design inconsistenciesGameplayDivine Divinity has intuitive controls, a clear user interface (although this does not apply for the inventory) and offers some comfort features like hotkeys, a minimap and a great quest log. The battles are simple, but can get a little bit confusing when you're surrounded by many enemies or have to fight behind obstacles. Also, there's not much tactic needed (and possible) - you either end up clicking opponent after opponent to smash them to bits or do the same thing from the distance with arrows or spells. The game's pretty challenging especially at the beginning though, when you're low on health and don't deal much damage, but gets a lot easier once you've got good armor and a powerful weapon (or spells, if you're playing as a mage). Divine Divinity perfectly evokes your drive for more and better items and constantly satisfies it, since enemies often drop useful things and there are chests full of great loot around every corner.The huge downside of this game is that it's got a pretty weak technology. I experienced regular crashes or hang-ups - sometimes without an accountable reason, sometimes when I tried to open a book or pick up an item. That's annoying, but can be compensated by saving often and on different savegames. What's worse is that some core mechanics are either buggy or completely inoperative. There are some skills that don't have an effect on battles even if they're expected to, others are extremely overpowered and you can break several quests by entering certain areas earlier than intended by the developers or using the (unapparantly) wrong speech options. This worsens the overall impression and tempers the gaming experience constantly.Story & QuestsThe storyline is key to every good role-playing game, and while you certainly cannot expect Divine Divinity to have the greatest plot ever seen in the gaming industry, its golden thread is enjoyable and sometimes even a bit exciting. The presentation isn't always perfectly well-made, however - some dialogs seem clumsy, some core parts of the story are treated too hasty and the last (and fortunately short) part of the game is pretty boring and doesn't match up to the rest of the game. A huge strong point of Divine Divinity are its quests. They are almost always specific in one way or the other - be it because of an unexpected turn, very bizarre characters or a good portion of humour. The game keeps the typical ""Bring me 25 red flowers"" or ""Kill 20 orcs"" quests within a limit, but provides lots of side quests to stop you from following the main quest nevertheless.While the game's general atmosphere is quite nice and consistent, particularly in certain areas like Aleroth, the village in which you get started, or a huge forest in the south of the game's main region, there are a few things that sometimes take you out of the illusion to be a part of an authentic and comprehensible world. The bettermost example for this issue are the elves, one of Rivellon's most important races, who can get very old, and therefore could be expected to reach wisdom and calmness in the process, but instead mostly act like pubescent humans. Things like these may be dependent on personal preferences, but are one reason why Divine Divinity can not quite match up to the real RPG greats.Graphics & SoundIf the graphics are the or at least one of the most important parts of a game for you, you definitely should beware of even thinking about playing Divine Divinity. I mostly liked its style and wasn't bothered about that it doesn't even look exceptionally good for a twelve years old game, but that's something every player has to decide for himself by looking at screenshots or watching videos.The situation is different with the sound, which is some kind of a two-edged sword. On the one hand, the effects aren't anything to speak of and I experienced a very disturbing and loud noise interference on some rare occasions. The music, however, is always enjoyable and the score has got some outstanding pieces that are capable of adding a lot more atmosphere to the situations they accompany.ConclusionDivine Divinity might not be one of the greatest games in history, but it offers many hours of an unfeigend and nostalgic adventure that will make you want to come back to the lands of Rivellon whenever possible and stay as long as you can. The game offers a good mix of story elements and battles to make sure that both Hack and Slay as well as RPG fans will get their money worth and will entertain you with around 60 hours of fun (given you take your time to discover every corner of the world and solve all the side quests). There are some flaws, and some of them aren't negligible, but if you aren't addicted to amazing graphics and don't get frustrated by games with some rough edges, you certainly should not miss out on an exciting journes to this fantastic world.

(Not sure about 7) When I say lagg I mean like 5 fps it’s kinda dumb but other than that and a really annoying auto noise that happens every 10 minn or so the game runs great. (There are patches to fix this but the 3D setting is like 2% quality so just turn it off.) The best way I can describe this game from my experience is Diablo meets Baldurs gate.I would highly recommend if you like CRPG/Hack and slash games.			"

												At first glance it's similar in a lot of ways to Diablo 2.  Much more world-interaction(objects can be combined and manipulated and moved in the world).  Much more RP(a lot going on with NPCs, dialog choices etc.) to allow u to play an actual character with a personality u choose.  This is NOT a game where u can blindly click forward!  Can't believe I missed this one all these years; it seems to be a real classic RPG.			"

												A game that would've been great 15 years ago, and was surprisingly okay for nowadays.  The game play is a bit like the old Ultima games.  The world is pretty vast.  There are enough different abilities to keep it interesting.  And the plots and sidequests are intriguing.  It still has some of that old world adventuring - looking for hidden entrances and solving mysteries in addition to the more typical 'get me some herbs' adventuring that's overdone nowadays.  If you don't mind the older graphics and style, it'll be well worth playing.Also, don't get too turned off at first.  I found the first 15-20% to be much less interesting than the last 80%.  Give it time to get going!Additionally, if you love Divinity: Original Sin, you might enjoy this anyway: although neither is essential to the other, they are set in the same world, and you get loads of backstory here.  The only caveat: Beyond Divinity, the middle section of story, is much less playable.  I'd suggest playing Divine Divinity, then reading about what happens in Beyond Divinity, then playing (or replaying) Divinity: Original Sin. "

												It was late, just past midnight. After hours of skulking around in the farmer’s field I had found my target, an orc who had carelessly wandered away from his fellow bandits and their camp. I stayed low and crept close behind him. Distracted by the farmer’s dog he didn’t stand a chance, I pounced. The blade of my dagger slid across his fat green throat and he squealed like a stuck pig. I couldn’t help but smirk at the carelessness of this buffoon as I looted his overfed corpse, another victim to my insatiable desire for blood and gold. I wasn’t able to admire my handiwork for very long though, just then the brush began to rustle up ahead prompting me to make my escape. Barely avoiding a confrontation with his friends who had heard his scream, I watched them howl in anger and grief as they suck out whoever had slayed their friend. But alas I had eluded them. I snaked my way into the farmer’s barn where I laid low and made my bed in the hay. While lying in the hay I could hear the snorts and howls of the orcs echo in the distance, their sorrow would soon be quelled because tomorrow night it would be their turn…Divine Divinity is an excellent CRPG that any old school gamer would easily be able to lose hours of their life to. I recommend it without reservation to anyone looking for a classic and unforgettable RPG experience.  "

About demons, heroes and cats.Divine Divinity is most likely one of the greatest isometric Hack-&Slay-RPGs of all time, including a well written story about demons, necromancers, heroes and cats. The land Rivellon is torn apart by war, civil unrest and greed...a group of fanatic villains and madmen created ways to bind a divinity for the sole reason of destroying the world. The tortured divinity managed to escape and blessed the upcoming hero with her divine light.What will happen next is for the player to decide. Rivellon is a very large land that contains many side stories, quests and characters. The player is able to choose out of six different heroes - warrior, mage and thief, every class has a female and male counterpart - and can further customize the hero with several skills, lots of weapons and many clothes. The graphics did age well and the combat is simple but enjoyable.I recommend Divine Divinity to everyone who likes Baldur's Gate, well written oldschool-RPGs and cats.			"

												In Divine Divinity quests are not as simple as going to the target on the map . It is one of a kind world full of creative sidequests,secrets,traps,humor, interesting characters and much more . However not eveything is self explanatory . You really have to use your brain and pay attention to the clues or you won't get very far .Please excuse my playtime because I beat it many times on my CD copy (this game is just $1 on sale so I wanted to support it) It takes around 40 hours to beat it and 60 to explore .There is no Post-Game so you should fully explore the game before going into the portal to the desert .In a way it reminds me Elder Scrolls but in 2D . You can randomly run into a talking animal that needs your help (they probably got it from this game) My favorite moment is when I picked a ""Cursed Weapon"" I played for hours with my health draining down and only after looking up online I realized that weapon that I was using was actually CURSED .This game has open skill system which means that you are not locked to a specific class . Sadly there is a lot of balancing problems and some skills become completely useless . Still I like the freedom that this game gives to player's choice .Some people call it Diablo2 clone but it is a lot more complex and focuses more on story and puzzles rather than grinding (enemies do not even respawn so you can only grind so many items) You can Save/Load the game to abuse drops though ;) You will probably wanna do it a bit because high loot enemies are very rare .Score : 9/10 . This is a very smart RPG game that rewards curiosity and exploration . It is not very accessible for a new player do to complicated puzzles . If you are tired of by the book grinding RPGs with no intellectual challenge then give this one a try .			"

												My rating: 4 (maybie 5) out of 5 stars.Positives:A very good and fulfeeling deeb-story RPG with many interesting quests and various game mechanics (i.e. you can throw rocks to your enemies, you can relocate chests and other containers to setup a home-base storage area for your character, you can combine a pillow and a blanket to make a portable bed, you can posses the body of a fallen enemy and fight with it and its abiliities while your original body is laying down 'sleeping' etc). [[EDIT: I tried again in my recent game to combine pilow and blanket with no sccess... combining strow to make a bed is working, as does the unique portable bed of the game.. I recoment searching on the internet to see details about portable beds at the begining of your gameplay]]The great variety of the gameplay of each class, combined with the variaty of skills available (that all classes can aquire), results in great replayability. Playing a thief that depends on Feigh Death to avoid been hit by monsters and to traps to kill them himself, can require quite different strategies than a thief focused on poisoned arrows mayhem... a wizard can focush on necromancy or enemy-possesion approaches, or can use the common 'fireball-lightnigbold-fireball' approach.Humor is well embended in the serious-dark-gothic story quests. An example that reminded me of old time RPGs I have loved at the past (i.e. Fallout, with its Monty Python Tim Wizard bridge random encounter), is the humor in the descriptions like ""Lightning Resistans 10: Your resistanse to lightning is pathetic. You should not insult the gods during stormy weather.""Exploring the world and finding out about the conspiracies and the stories of the variousu NPCs was quite fulfilling for my taste. The storylines kept me awake quite a few nights.Negadives:The game starts as a simple Hack-&-Slash diablo clone, so some gamers that are looking for the deep RPG gameplay  could get a bit bored at the first couple of hours. Resolution possibley has to be set manually at the ini files fos some PC configurations. I found out that I dindt like the small characters at 1920x1080, so I am happily playing with the resolution set at 1600x900.Initial 'view distance' is bery short. It was OK on the old screen resolutions, but now at high resolution settings I definetly prefer my character to be able to see the enemies that are halph screen away. Fortunatelly, the view distance is actually a stat of the character that can be boosted with xp, so I used a mod from the begining of the game, adding to an item I am carrying the ""+12 view"" bonus. The open-world strucure can lead to some broken quests, so better to check comunity guides on the matter.			"

												Divine Divinity is a lot like Diablo II, in some ways it is even better. The storyline is actually quite short, but very difficult if you don't sidequest a little. A downside to the game is that some bosses are almost unbeatable if you do not use the skill deadly gift. So somewhere around level 30 you should spend a skillpoint there. While most people argue that warrior is the best class to play, mine is the wizard, since earlygame it provides with a little edge towards levelling, you'll have to find out how to yourself. The sidequests are a great addition, sometimes you have to delay finishing one until you have explored some more territories. Some sidequests give hints to main quests, for which you might otherwise have to consider a walkthrough. Using a walkthrough on your first go would be a shame, since there is so much fun to be had finding everything out for yourself.I rate this 9/10 since even though there is only one campaign, there still is a lot of replay value to be had.

												Did you like Diablo but are looking for more of a rich story based RPG? This is your game. The big positives in my eyes are the class-fluid skill system, great graphics for the time, and incredible music. Minor negatives include uninspired voice acting, occassional huge blocks of texts in conversations, and slightly flawed pathfinding. This game is well worth the price if you're looking to explore a meaty RPG world.			"

												TL;DR - If you thought Diablo II was too small and needed more freedom in character customization, you'll probably love this game.Divine Divinity is an isometric action RPG in the style of Diablo but with some unique differences. First off, the world is fairly large, with open areas to explore and an impressive number of side quests to complete. Dungeons are typically expansive as well - the first major dungeon being at least 3 spawling levels with some sub-areas thrown in too. A number of environment pieces can actually be moved (if it has a weight noted, it can be picked up), which allowed for a nice way to hide items/areas without resorting to locked/secret/illusionary entrances all the time.DD has you choose a class at the start, but you can select spells/skills from anywhere as you progress, allowing you to hybrid to your heart's content. One of DD's strengths is customization - between charms, stats and skills you have a lot of control over how you want to play your character. That said, there are a few skills that are strong enough to warrant including in any build (and a couple that are required later on to finish some quests), which somewhat detracts from the mix-n-match customization as a whole. One rank each of Repair and Polymorph can let you handle almost anything, and one rank of Pickpocket is needed to pass an initiation test later.For the most part, the game is non-linear so you can complete and explore as you desire, but you'll find that many locations are way above what you can handle at lower levels. At one point I scoured the countryside killing mobs basically to farm a few levels, which ended up being about 2 nights of gameplay. It was a little annoying that I wasn't working on any major quests at the time, but the map features tons of little interesting areas (most with a small quest/story of their own) which broke up the monotony of level grinding.There's a fairly large amount of history/lore to back up the main storyline which was adequate and heroic, but I was disappointed with the game's ending (assuming there's only one) as it was a little vague... though I guess that was intentional to allow for sequel potential (which seems to be the case).Overall Divine Divinity is a solid title in the genre and provides many hours of open-exploration, quest-completing, monster-slaying, loot-obtaining RPG goodness.

												I first played this game when it was in a Games Magazine in October 2005. I've I first played this game when it was in a Games Magazine in October 2005. I've loved it ever since, and It's still my favourite game. Being released in 2002, it obviously can't hold a candle to any new game in terms of graphics, but I STILL love it's looks. I've played it through 4 times before, and just had the urge to play it again, and thought ""I might as well get it on steam"" and am now writing this review while it downloads ^^There are two main aspects that make Divinity to my favourite Game of all times: The First is the incredibly deep World and characters it provides, the quests you receive tell you about their lives, be it the soldier who asks you for a feign death potion, to go home to his fiancé, the Orc who tries to right his people's wrongs, or the ♥♥♥♥ing Brat who asks you to do whatever♥♥♥♥♥♥he can't be bothered to. All of these define the characters more than Skyrim for example did. Also the two Skeletons that explode upon Philosophizing about how they're held together without any flesh or muscles.The second aspect is the Music. In Divine Divinity, as well as Divinity 2: Ego Draconis, the music (composed by Kirill Pokrovsky)  fills you with excitement and tension, always fitting the Area you're in. In fact, my most played song on Itunes it ""On the Brink of Defeat"" from Divine Divinity.  I can only say that Divine Divinity is a game you HAVE to play, if you're a fan of RPGs in which the focus lies in the story and characters.			"

												Fantastic old school RPG. It's a little rough around the edges, even for 2002. Things like item descriptions are lacking or even none existant. Some quests absolutely require you to look up the steps online.Because it uses an old version of Direct X it has some compatibility issues with steam overlay, which isn't a biggy. Resolutions a little funny to set up.Putting the game in software rendering mode fixes some issues and improves performance.Those issues aside, fantastic game and a must have for anyone that calls themselves an RPG gamer.7/10 even in 2016.

												My first RPG back then when I was only 10 years old. Now I'm almost 20, and I'm still playing it.It's also (without any of my nostalgic feelings) simply a great game - even today. As long as you don't mind the 2D graphics and the fact that you have to read nearly any dialogues in this game.In Divine Divinity, you play a lost and wounded wanderer, who finds himself in a great battle. A mysterious organisation, named The Black Ring, wants to evoke the Lord of Chaos, an evil and abandonded existence, to surpress the whole country an its population.In fact, the plot is quite exciting and does have many turns. You can visit four great areas and a lot of dungeons as well. You can act very detached from the main quest and spend as much time as you want with side quests or many easter eggs. Also you can feel free to kill almost everyone in the game, as long as you don't mind to be hunted down by the local militia.Fights are turn-based and you are able to pause the game, which is highly recommended in some of the harder fights of the game. Many bosses do have resistances against special kinds of weapons or magic, so you have to be prepared, otherwise, especially in higher difficulties, you will die very often. Every difficulty is possible and the game is, in my opinion well balanced.The graphics are, in fact, not quite good. Even for 2002, there were games with better graphics. Some of the dialogues are spoken, but you will have to read most of them.The soundtrack is a great piece of art by the russian componist Kirill Pokrovsky. The music perfectly fits with the locations and create an impressive, unique, immersive atmosphere.			"

												A decade after it was first released and the game is still enjoyable.Divine Divinity is a classic isometric rpg with a perfect mix of Baldur's Gate's role play element, Diablo 2's action gameplay with big open world to explore ala Sacred Gold.Unlike most rpg of it's kind you aren't locked to a certain class or skill trees. The only difference between each characters that you can choose is their starting stats and skills.So you can shape your character to be whatever you want.A fighter with thieving skills or maybe an archer with arcane magic.From graphical stand point it looks very similar to Diablo 2. Yeah it doesn't aged well.Battles too are similar to Diablo 2. You can only control 1 character and you don't have companions following you everywhere you go. Sad.You also have tactical pause too. Like in Baldur's Gate. In case you need some time to think and analyze the flow of battle.The role playing aspect is pretty good with a lot of meaningful choices that you can make as you travel the world.The world itself is pretty big with lots of secret and side quest in every nooks and cranny.Overall the game is very enjoyable even though it's a decade old and has lots of bug. FYI, most of the time i ended my playing session with the game forced close on me.Though this can be remedied by playing the game wihtout steam (straight from the .exe file) and set the game to use only one core.Personally i really recommend this game. It's very solid, fun and has decent replayability value.If you are a fan of isometric rpg (and don't mind old graphics), you should play this game at least once in your lifetime.			"

												A Diablo (1)/Ultima (7) mashup that's enjoyable but extremely dated at this point.  It's extremely open but also extremely fragile as a result -- you can easily 'break' side quests, for instance.  Arguably that's part and parcel of the kind of experience the game provides, but some may find it infuriating nonetheless.			"

												A single-player fantasy RPG with top-down view, the 1st title of Divinity series by Belgian developer Larian Studios. Player can make their characters learn any skill regardless of their initial class. It's up to player to when & where to go, what to do. Sadly the latter 1/3 part is somehow tedious because player's character becomes too strong or enemies too weak, but overall quality is high, especially its graphics and music are impressive. With plenty of sub-quests, at least 40 to 60 hours playing is guaranteed. Getting ""Divinity Anthology"" which includes 3 titles of the series (this game and its spin-off ""Beyond Divinity"" and ultimate edition of sequel ""Divinity 2 Developer's Cut"") during sale on Steam saves some money.Some tips: Manual (dd_manual.pdf) and story (story.pdf) are inside the installed folder. 1 sub quest requires some reputation so always try to commit good deeds, there's no merit of committing bad ones. (You'll be arrested by guards or executed instantly!) Some skills make the game too easy, ""Aura of Command"" allows to manipulate all summoned creatures including enemy's, ""Deadly Gift"" allows to use ""Scorpion Trap"", which even tears the final boss apart.(Japanese translation below)==================================================ベルギーはLarianStudios製のDivinityシリーズ第1作を飾る、見下ろし視点の1人用ファンタジーRPG、日本語非対応なので語学力必須です。自由性が高く、いつ何処で何をするもプレイヤー次第、主人公は初期職業の種類に関係なく好きなスキルを自由に習得出来ます。ゲーム終盤は主人公が強くなりすぎたのか敵が弱すぎるのか多少退屈ですが、全体的な質は高く特にグラフィックとBGMは文句無しの出来栄え、膨大な数のサブクエストのおかげで最低40～60時間は遊べます。続編の完全版と番外編を含む3作のリマスター版が同梱されたアンソロジーをセール時に買うと少しだけ得します。プレイの上で役立つ情報：操作説明書とストーリー説明用のPDFファイルはインストール先のフォルダにあります、ファイル名はdd_manual.pdfとstory.pdfです。サブクエストの1つは名声値が必要なので出来るだけ善人プレイを心掛けましょう、このゲームで悪人プレイをする利点は皆無です。下手をすると衛兵に逮捕されるだけでは済まず現行犯でその場で処刑されます。召喚生物なら敵でも自分の手駒にできるAura of Commandと、最終ボスすら容易に引き裂く蠍の罠が使えるようになるDeadly Giftは、ゲームバランスを崩壊させる凶悪スキルです。			"

												A fun little RPG game of the Divinity series, not particular outstanding, but not one of the many boring rpgs out there. You can play as a few different types of characters, warrior, archer, mage, thief, but overall the warrior is vastly superior to the others, easier to play, easier to survive, and in the end he'll have tons of spells and thief abilities anyway. The first 2/3rds of the game is good, the last 1/3 is very rushed and weak so you'll get bored when you start doing the wasteland/ending parts of the game. Plus at that time you usually can kill most mobs in 2 hits so it isn't challenging when you start racking up 3000+ vitality and have all the super armor pieces you need to survive. Plus its pretty easy to cheat in the game with duping/etc so you have to limit yourself from not doing that. Overall, a nice basic rpg thats pretty long, you can get really cheap when its on sale, and will keep your attention for quite a while. A must buy for people who like rpgs, etc.			"

												I can say without a doubt, despite the lack of in-game steam overlay, that this is one of the best Diablo-esque type games of all time, cheers to the developers back in the early 2000's , they knew what they were doing.I've loved this game for years, and I still do, if you like the diablo series, I recommend this game to you. It has the auto attack of diablo 1, and the satisfying hack-and-slash playstyle, free-roam, exploration-driven, quest-riddled, humorous style of diablo 2.This is what a Diablo clone is. 9/10 , 10/10 if they add overlay. This game takes over 100 hours to fully complete, I'm still in the FIRST AREA at time of recommendation, and I'm far from completing the quests , and exploring everything in it. In this game, there are benefits to exploring every little bit of black on your map.Also, I should mention it has a barter system, sure, you can pay with gold, but why not peddle a bunch of crap you're not going to use and take all the merchant's money instead? I have over 100K gold at the moment, in fact, I have 3 stacks of gold coins in my inventory. And plus, you don't play tetris with your items. It's based on your strength, and how much you can carry before you become encumbered, as listed on your statistics.I have nothing else to say but this : This game is addictive. It's amazingly good, given how old it is, and well worth the price, if you ask me. (Also, you can make whatever character you want, pick the warrior class and be spells only, you're not bound by anything.)			"

												10/10This game is so fun that I don't even have proper words to describe it. There are so many aspects of Divine Divinity that make it so interesting. Endless grinding, diverse characters with hilariously bad voices (and some really good ones sometimes, too), a very fun combat system; what more could you ask for? The controls are simple, the class system is expansive and fun. If you want to be a rogue that shoots fireballs, than just like in Divinity Original Sin, you can be that. There are many different weapons, armors, spells. The game just gives off a ""classic"" vibe. If you haven't played it yet, than you need to.Beyond the fun gameplay aspects, the dialogue can be absolutely hilarious at times. Witty dialogue and randomly placed humor add atouch to it that makes you KNOW that this is the creator of Divinity: Original Sin.If you want a fun game that you can just spend hours of your time playing and STILL have fun, then this is the game for you.

												I hadn't played this one when it originally came out, and for an isometric diablo style-ish game I'm surprised it's held up so well more than a decade later (12 years actually). Don't go in expecting the same kind of straight forward clickfest, though, it's a fair amount more complex and there are a lot of mechanics it takes some time (and maybe a little googling) to figure out - such as maybe don't hit barrels with your weapon if you want it to last long durability-wise.I probably won't finish it (being honest with myself) but I've enjoyed the time I put in. It surprised me right off by having more of a lifelike world than I expected  - day turning to night, hunting rabbits for very useful meat, NPCs aware of me pillaging their goods or failing their quests - and who don't just sit in one place. They put a huge amount of work into this. Since the resolution goes all the way up to my 2560, it actually looks really great. I think it stands up a lot better than Dungeon Siege or Diablo 2, to be honest.It's not all amazing - the voice acting, especially for your character, can be pretty weak. The action doesn't feel as intuitive or enjoyable as some other rpgs of the era. The UI overalll hasn't aged quite as well. But overall, especially since you can find this game for 1-2 dollars, it's totally worth checking out.			"

												I love this game. The Divinity series is great in allowing true role playing and this was the progenitor of them all. It's world is huge and deep, with extensive lore and interesting characters. Fans of RPGs that look for something close to the table top games will really appreciate this one. Books can be read, boxes moved, ingredients mashed together in your inventory. You can play as a virtuous hero that lives off hard earned food or a thief that nabs everything not nailed down (and even some things that are). Play as a naive young man that helps everyone he meets or a cunning rogue that beguiles her way through every encounter. Every scenario has a myriad of outcomes. Why fought through a horde of enemies when you can just sneak past them and take their treasures? Can't get a guard to leave his post? Throw one of your teleporter pyramids behind him, drop the other outside, use it to get behind him, do what needs to be done, pick up the pyramid and teleport ball outside leaving no one the wiser.The teleporter pyramids are a great addition that add a lot to game play. Throw them over traps or chasms, leave one outside a cave for a quick escape route, use them to quickly move between shops in a town when trying to game the economy (or sell one merchant's hidden stock to another). This game provides so many interesting opportunities to play your way. Even the newer Divinity games don't quite match this one in terms of variety and options.That said, it isn't perfect. It can be an extremely difficult game, often to the point of unfair, mostly because the combat isn't exactly stellar. This is one area that future games definitely improved upon. Don't come to this game for an extensive and complex combat system. You won't get much more than rudimentary fights. Also, occasionally you will get bad outcomes to quests because you have to do very obscure things just to get given the option to work towards a different outcome. For Example: **Minor Spoiler**One quest involves collecting a magical tree branch for someone. You can find one in the very same town quite easily, but there is no indication that this is the wrong branch. If you hand in this branch you have to fight a very strong enemy to finish the quest. The ""proper"" way to end this quest is to go into a forest in the south, far from the quest giver and find the branch there. This isn't told to you at all and can only be found by stumbling upon it. **End Spoiler**Despite the difficulty and clunky combat, the game is awesome. The most fun you will have in this game is just from wandering around, taking in all the dialogue and flavour text. The stories are told excellently, allowing non-linearity and role-playing but never feeling like it's gone off the rails. The sheer variety of options in this game is staggering, and most everything is open to you from the word go. This can be a bit overwhelming at times, but it really makes Rivellon feel like a real world. In short, the game has its shortcomings, but all the other areas more than make up for them. The game hasn't aged super well, and it has a bit of a steep learning curve at the very beginning as you try to learn the controls, but it's still very playable. Highly recommended, especially to fans of the newer Divinity games that want to see where the series came from. While the newer games are mechanically tighter and visually more impressive, you won't get quite the same experience as this anywhere else.			"

												Originally released on Sept. 22, 2002, Divine Divinity was released with little to no fanfare, media, or reviewers.  In fact, I didn't hear about it until that Christmas, when I received it as a present.  Combining elements from a Hardcore Diablo 2 playstyle, and adding a Personal Honor with every single NPC seperately (which most you can trade items with) and Faction Honor and Reputation as well, Divine Divinity is a RPG that I have still, to this day, never beaten.There are a lot of side-quests, epic loot, a large world with lore and magic, and more.  I have maybe seen a 3rd of the game world and it's environs, and I enjoyed it enough to recommend this game, dispite not completing it.			"

Larian Studios still has their forum up and running for all 4 games. Highly suggest you create an account if you plan on buying this game. You also must have the abiliity and patience for a long-winded game. I'm 48 hours in...and not even half-way through. Minus, all the things above, this game is very enjoyable.

You make decisions based on your own judgment (in most cases), some really hard guys to beat up, awesome skills sets, the weapons and armor are all randomized, many quest breaks (be careful what you do!).

You just dont see these kinda games on consoles these days, and the price you just cant beat. I've only played about 4 hours and i gotta tell ya the graphics are still good. The only real issue I'm having right now is the trade screen (buying and selling items) I want to find out myself rather than looking on the internet but I guess I have to cause there is no tutorial on it in game. That is the only issue I have NO TUTORIAL. You realy have to figure it out. It might mean nothing to most people who have been playing on pc all his time, I think it does matter to people like me who are just getting in or back into pc gaming. So If dungeon crawling,finding hidden levers and solving quests are your thing then i recommend that you at least check this game out.			"

												Just finished the game. Enjoyed it a lot!If you like both Diablo and Baldur's Gate series, you can't go wrong with this one.Had no issues with quests, bugs or gameplay (I didn't finish all sidequests, though).I do recommend playing it at 720p, since the text was a bit too small for my liking at 1080p.Enjoy!

												A surprisingly entertaining adventure for one so old. It gets tedious, however, before it ends. But then, I have never played an adventure game that wouldn't get tedious. By the way - the follow-up (Beyond Divinity) is graphically a total failure compared to this. I couldn't even begin to play it.			"

												The goofy advert posted here--which treats Divine Divinity as a kind of drug that some former gamers are trying to recover from--isn't far wrong.  Honestly, I don't think of this game as particularly high quality, but it's awfully addictive.  Think Diablo-style action, but with more inventive questing, and with a modest dose of silly humor.  This isn't Larian's opus (that's Original Sin), but it's fun.			"

												This is an GREAT game. I have almost nothing bad to say about this game. I have been a pc gamer in the past but went to consoles. Now I'm back to pc and I've just gotta say Wow. You just dont see these kinda games on consoles these days, and the price you just cant beat. I've only played about 4 hours and i gotta tell ya the graphics are still good. The only real issue I'm having right now is the trade screen (buying and selling items) I want to find out myself rather than looking on the internet but I guess I have to cause there is no tutorial on it in game. That is the only issue I have NO TUTORIAL. You realy have to figure it out. It might mean nothing to most people who have been playing on pc all his time, I think it does matter to people like me who are just getting in or back into pc gaming. So If dungeon crawling,finding hidden levers and solving quests are your thing then i recommend that you at least check this game out.			"

												Great game. Lots of replay value. Theres a few annoyences/bugs here and there but they are quickly over shadowed at how addicting this game can be. The story line is pretty straight forward and probably too typical for most fans of the genre. The game can be finished in about 30hrs (if you know what your doing and/or are oppose to extra exploration) but I've spent 70hrs on this game and could easily spend 70 more on whats left to do. If they added some Steam extras to this game (cards/achievements/cloud saves) it would really put this game over the top. It unfortunately took me 15 years to find this gem. If you like isometric RPGs do yourself a favor and play this.			"

												I came into this game not knowing much about it but i found it to be very fun and extremely addictive. After over 50 hours i can say that this is an interesting open world game with a lot to explore and a lot of fun quest lines. There are some sound glitches and game breaking bugs, so it can be helpful to look at a guide to make sure you don't run into those in game, but it didn't take away from my experience. The beginning is also pretty punishing until you gain a few levels but after you get tougher and get farther in the game it gets a bit easier. Definitely a good rpg, and on top of that the game is cheap on steam. It's worthy of your time			"

												I often find myself missing Divine Divinity's inventory system and object-interactions in a lot of the more modern games in this genre.Some have problems running it on never operating systems, but there are fixes for most on the forum.Then there are the countless bugs, a few gamebreaking, but you'll learn about them soon enough.That aside, it's a pretty damn swell game. Not too serious but also not too goofy, and yet it is brutal and lets you fail if you don't pay attention.			"

												This game is hands down, the best RPG I have ever played. When I saw the trailers I thought it looked terrible: abysmal voice acting, dated graphics, reviews had told me it was buggy as hell, and I didn't like the top down aspect of the game. But I still bought it, and I'm so glad I did. The quests are interesting and fun, even the fetch quests feel like an adventure. The fighting style and skills system is ingenius, any class can have any skills and stats, and this means that as well as being able to fully customise your abilities, that you get a choice between generic hack and slash or more tactical spell casting. The game world is large and incredibly immersive, every decision feels like it matters. The plot is fairly generic, but it still feels like an epic journey, and you actually get to feel for the characters, despite the fact that they sound almost entirely uninterested in anything that's happening, (The voice acting really is terrible). This game feels like it should be one of the worst in gaming history, but it truly gives you the feeling that all other RPG's are aiming for.			"

												Simply put, this is a mixture of Morrowind (or Skyrim for those who don't know) and Diablo II (or 3 if you're daft). Combat plays like a very tactful Diablo with time freezing and certain beasts smashing you to death in 1 or 2 hits, retreat is often a required tactice.I once dragged a Giant Orc through three guard camps until I could get the finishing blow.The game requires you to think outside the box and the quests are very Elder Scrolls-esque with wishing wells, Guild politics, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s claiming they are ""da-best"". Often you'll get stumped on how to do something but the game has a nice way of rounding itself out by having quests and locations link.I think if you enjoy Morrowind or want a deeper, more story driven Diablo, give this game a go.

												One of my first computer games. It's pretty good, long loads of fun spending a crap load of time killing things etc. It for the most part is a point and click sort of game, it has some interaction running around, but not much. In the way of story and side-quests this has a lot to offer and is well worth the price for the amount of time you'll spend. Unless of course you prefer the high priced games that are over in a day. There a few awesome features to this game. The first one I can think of is the ability to choose skills from other classes. I enjoy having my Thief/Mage/Warrior. The second has got to be how entertaining the game's dialog/descriptions are. When it tells me that old ladies could beat me up, just makes me laugh.  "

												Overall, a really solid and enjoyable game; great world, great story, and lots and lots of quests, secrets, and odds and ends to explore, basically everything that makes an amazing classic RPG. That being said, if you don't like the elements of a classic RPG (slower pace, character building, lots of text, running around and, of course, older graphics), this probably isn't your game, but if you do, get this game right now.I do have two warnings though. First, the magic system is subpar, or at least the combat spells are. They do little damage, but don't cost too much and cast as quick as you click, so as a mage you just end up spamming your right mouse button until things fall over... consider fighter instead. Second, the game has a few ridiculously hard bosses. I never actually managed to finish the game as the second-last boss was immune to all my spells, could always blind me (I think it bypasses all resistances), and could insta-kill me and all my maxed-out summoned minions. Getting to a high enough level isn't enough, you pretty much have to be following a guide to stand a chance of finishing, and being forced to min/max really spoils the experience for me.Still, those are the only things I found wrong. Even at full price, you really can't go wrong with such a gem; just stick with it through the first quest (it'll feel like a bit of a slog at first), make sure you are following some form of guidance for leveling, and you're in for a great time.

												This game is fakking awesum!Seriously,this is like one of the best Hack'n' Slashes there are,it has good,clear mechanics,slighty dated yet charming graphics(If you don't take notice of the somewhat stiff animations sometimes). And it's by far the most humerous HnS i have ever played,sure i like things like Diablo 2,i WANTED to like D3 but couldn't,i love Torchlight 2..But this game hits a snare i didn't even know i had! And what precisely hit that snare is the amazing voice acting(if not a bit cheesy at times..the beginning..Mardaneus's voice is awesome xD) and the great dialogue.This game's strong point is not the combat(in comparison with say TL2 or even D3 now with RoS out,this game's combat is not that great but hey it's from 2002 so what can you say..well..that it's decent in terms of combat xD) but the dialogue and that is what Larian to this day does best,their sense of humor and clever ways of implementing humor and references into their games(To name an instance,just outside of the starting zone,Aleroth you come across small piles of gold,set in an obvious trail just screen wide away from each other,and if you follow that gold trail to the end a bunch of orcs ambush you and say that you fell for the trick......and then i got horribly murdered because i was underleveld..lol) Also i should note that this game has a fenomenal soundtrack which range from somewhat typical RPG music to..well..Dwarven Tavern Music? i don't even know what is itAnyway,this game is f*cking amazing and you should buy it if you are even remotely interested in HnS RPG's or just RPG's in general ^.^			"

												Actually a pretty good game. Terrible graphics even for 2002 standards. Can't zoom in/out or rotate the camera. Steam overlay doesn't work which is annoying. As usual for old games, gives you terrible directions about what to do. All completed and unfinished quests are clumped together and some you still have to do will be at the bottom of the  page. The quests don't give you good directions.....some mark where to go but there are many markings on the map and some are for quests, others for landmarks, and it doesn't tell whether the marking is for a quest or not and  for what quest. The story is alright but get into the habit of skipping the long written paragraphs. There is a lot of loot but much of the loot I found was for way later in the game and didn't help me. For this reaosn I did not upgrade much. There are rarities but they don't explain which is which and it is hard to tell, because many times blue items are better than most others even though you see them more often than other colors. There is also little difference in how the equipment looks, maybe because they didn't program for many looks or because your guy is soo tiny. All I know is that I equipped totally different things and my character never changed. There were many quests, but not wanting to mess with the annoying system I had to do a lot of grinding for levels. The play time for teh (intentional Poops) game is very long which is nice. The lack of load times are also appreciated. There are lots of spells and you can mix and match from different classes. Why they even need 3 clases to choose from makes little sense as if you can pick any spells from all three classes, the only difference the starting stats and you can fix that later in the game from leveling. Why anyone would go anything but the warrior makes no sense. 7.5/10. Better than I thought it would be and is good for some diablo-style old killing fun.			"

												If you enjoy 2d games, then buy this game because it's not expensive at all. On the other hand if you have alot of other games that you play that are alot better than this one, I wouldn't bother... But if you have a craving for a 2d adventure type game then buy this because I'm sure it will more than fufill that craving.			"

												The Story is excellent from year 2002 when it seems game devlopers still had enough time to care to write and program in a good story though the graphics kinda are very dated of that time and do not look good compared to what you will see in a more morden game for example Divine Dvinity: Orginal Sin also the sound gliches some times on windows 8.1 for no appernet reason which i could find as when i reload the game and do the same thing over again it works without any trouble.I am basing the story on the on disc version of this game as i got it on disc  some years ago and since the disk is locked onto a single computer i had to buy it again this time on steam though it does have a few issues with newer computers the main example is it runs 200+ fps when on Software render but only at around 32~34 fps when in DirectX3D render with all other settings being unchanged. It is a good game just run it on max settings for the few graphics settings you get to change and with DirectX3D render and it should all be fine. I have actually put in a few days into the game but as i cannot migrate files due to DRM protection in steam i have to start over again ... this is my main and probably only complaint about it on steam.

Divine Divinity has huge map, many weapons, three main classes and very good thing is that you can take widsard's and thief's skills when you are currently warrior.In my opinion, Divine Divinity is mix of Skyrim and some RPG game. But Divine Divinity is much older than those.I really say this is 10/10 You don't have to like it, but I love it!			"

												Larian just gets it. They are without a doubt pc gamers at heart and it shows. Divine Divinity is as 'Ye Olde Skool' as any RPG on the market and it was crafted with the utmost care and love. The soundtrack is beautiful and 'Divine'. The graphics (while dated) are perfect for this game and ooze attention to detail with a wry sense of humor that is trademark Larian.The game is TOUGH, and the first couple of hours can be a real challenge - and that's even before leaving the 'safe' starting area. It never holds your hand as it respects pc gamers enough to read the notes, listen to dialogue and to experiment. Save you game A LOT, pay attention, and move everything that can be moved, cause you never know.Make sure to take a trip down to one of the cellars in town to say hi to a really nice guy, he's just misunderstood even while he's ripping your head off. It's nothing personal after all.Make sure to run the game in software mode as D3D support usually crash at start up. Believe it or not, software mode looks just as good as D3D, minus some fog and a few other affect if I am not mistake. The UI is a bit of a bugaboo as well, but you'll get used to it.A very strong 9.5 out 10 in my book! Highly, HIGHLY recommended!			"

The game doesn't take itself too seriously, it has a good sense of humor and is just good old fashioned fun. It starts out pretty hard, but by the middle of the game you'll be destroying everyone in one or two hits, besides the bosses, they are pretty tough no matter what. Anyways, 10/10.			"

												A really good game for a first of a series. The only downside I have seen is the lack of quick slots for spells and items. It sucks. Mages are useless in this game unless you pauve every two seconds to choose the right spell to launch next. And since you are a one man army, you kind of suck as a mage, you don't have anyone to protect you... unless you use some necromancy...That's one of the major good things about this game, you can play good, bad or anything in between. :)			"

												This game was probably excellent when it was released back in 2002 (a mix of Diablo2 and Arcanum), but it aged badly, it is a waste of time now because:* it does not work well with new OS/hardware (you need to use compatibility, software rendering, and it will stutter anyway) * combat is annoying (randomness everywhere, random chance to hit/be hit, random damage, random armor absorb, random loot), * most skills are useless (for example if you start as a mage it is natural to put skill points into spells, but guess what, you wasted them because you can buy/loot spell tomes, so you start grinding; but guess what, also grinding was mostly pointless because as soon as you learn Divine skills you will use only them 99% of time) * almost no combo (the few one are OP, like DeadlyGiftScorpion+CommandAura or Curse+DivineDeath), * the progression is unbalanced (most enemies are trivial, but many will simply one shot you even with max defense), * the story is meek, * the controls are laggy and inaccurate (often they get stuck), * AI is very poor and easily abused, * it is playable but with many bugs (since they are unresolved after 14 years, they probably never will), * the graphic is confusing, * the scrollbars troublesome. Like Diablo it promote grinding instead of roleplaying (with savescumming added), you will need gear to do damage and levels just to hit (or you will kite forever), there is very little room for skill, unless you can call skill using OP perks, savescumming every time you are one shot, hide in plain sight with the Survivor skill, and metagaming. The replaybility is both good and bad; good because you can try another approach (melee, ranged, sneak, nuke, summons), bad because it is havily unbalanced and after the first playthrought you will metagame wildly, abuse the poor ai, go straight to static treasures and the few good skills. The game also fail to explain its mechanics (Diablo at least had the good Arreat Summit site).If you already played Diablo and/or Arcanum this game will add almost nothing, you can skip it.If you never played any of them, Arcanum is IMHO the best, storywise and gameplay-wise. I can imagine the only way to put this game to good use is having an old pc that match the requirements and younglings that never played such games.Are there better alternatives in 2016?If you want a vintage rpg go for Arcanum.If you want a dungeon crawler with lots of grinding and theorycraft go for Path of exile.If you want multiplayer action with a lot of skill/knowledge involved go for Dota2.If you want single player action with a lot of skill/grind involved go for the Dark Souls.If you want a fantasy sandbox go for Skyrim and his million mods.

												Divine Divinity is one of my favorite games. It is the type of game that you would spend hours playing and lose track of time in doing so. Similar to Diablo and Diablo II in many ways, this is a highly addictive and impressive game overall. There are unfortunately numerous dialogue issues, specifically being those of poor grammar, spelling errors, and even missing responses from NPC's. In addition, the cinematics have very low-quality graphics, which is strange considering how that's usually where you find the best. I have found a couple bugs as well, but they are minor problems and don't really affect the gameplay. Outside of that, this is definitely a game worth buying and playing. If you like Diablo II, you'll like this as well.			"

The skill tree is practically amazing, and the replay value is very high. The story is executed very well and intrigues the player to delve deeper until the climax. The side quests are also extremely satisfying. I played this game at least 3 times from start to finish, with a multitude of other options for role playing interest. But overall, a fun fun game that is worth every penny. And, the 2D rendered environments are beautiful.			"

												I've played a bit more than what the Steam record says, and I do think this game has terrific atmosphere and heart. The world-building is superb. I only wish they'd figured out the game balance better. The grind wall is immediate, to the point where you have to start exploiting the game systems outside of what I'd consider normal or immersive gameplay. Past that, you're then over-leveled for everything except for certain creatures that will one-shot you unless you're essentially at end-game levels. I get (and like) having areas that are off-limits until you're a higher-level, but it's all so randomly mixed here and the starting quests already require you to grind - but where, since these are the starting areas? Compound this with skill and magic sets that range from exquisitely useful to worthless, and the balance is just massively off. I don't want to have to look at a guide to see what's useless or doesn't work in a game. For as much artistry as exists in the rest of the game, the gameplay itself is frustrating. It's a shame given the care that goes into the rest of the world.The Diablo franchise never quite builds the world that Divine Divinity does, nor is it ever quite so open, but the gameplay is so much better balanced, so much more fun. Balance counts for a lot.Some will still enjoy the grind elements as a price you have to pay to enter the world. They will enjoy it a lot more than I did. For me, the gameplay is an element to the story and if your gameplay is so ill-balanced, it can begin to amount to bad storytelling. That's what happens here. I can see why many consider it a classic, and I think it is. It acts like a classic, it feels like a classic, it oozes with mood. It just doesn't play like a classic, at least for me. If you don't like grind walls and OCD leveling, avoid this. If you don't mind them or that can be fun for you instead of infuriating, the story and world are richly rewarding.			"

												I'm not exagerating, I've played almost an hour and have no ♥♥♥♥ing clue what the hell I'm doing.I haven't even left the first village yet. I keep going into stores and emtpy houses and taking everything in them, reading random books and petting a cat.

Then he told me to go find some healers, and now I'm running around into random houses trying to figure out who the hell he's talking about.At one point I stumbled into a store where I encountered a dwarf arguing with an elf ( at least, I think they were a dwarf and elf, it's kinda hard to tell. One was short and fat, so I assume he's the dwarf ) about some herbs, and the dwarf was getting shakey.I also came across some dragon statues, so, naturally, I clicked 'em a few times and they spun around. They didn't seem to really do anything other than spin.10/10 would♥♥♥♥♥♥around in the starting town for almost an hour again.			"

												Divine Divinity was a surprisingly good game and well received among fans of the genre back in the 2002.Right from the get-go, you will have to fiddle with the game to get it to work on modern day computers. Once you do that, this game offers an old-school isometric RPG experience akin to classics like Baldur's Gate. However, this game doesn't hold the same status as those old games.It's by no means a bad game, but considering this developer has created Divinity: Original Sin (Enhanced Edition) that offers a true great (and still old-school) experience, while providing many modern day conveniences, it's hard to recommend playing this game today.6/10 ""Okay""			"

												Everyone knows the big-name role playing games: Dragon Age, Oblivion, Final Fantasy, etc. And believe me, I've played them all.However, one of the greatest role playing games I've ever played isn't one of them. In fact, I'll bet you've never heard of it. Even if you did hear about it, you probably never bothered to look at it due to the game's wacky title: Divine Divinity. Divinity is a PC role playing game developed by Larian Studios, released in 2002. The game has everything you could want in an epic RPG: solid graphics (at least for the time), excellent storytelling, engaging gameplay & combat, and incredible immersion. A sequel was released in 2009 which I have yet to try, though I am very much looking forward to doing so.The story of the game is probably one of its greatest assets; never have I played a game so deep and involving. Divine Divinity takes on a relatively dark tone, in which the world is experiencing a lot of instability and turmoil. It's typical fantasy fare, but it contains a lot of twists, epic adventures, and dangerous enemies. You'll really start to invest yourself in the characters and the setting.The game world is absolutely massive, spanning many thousands of screens. Traveling through the world is also very exciting -- there is no simple ""fast travel"" system like their is in Oblivion so you actually feel like you're journeying through the lands. There are teleporter scrolls and stones you can unlock, but you'll have to complete some hefty side quests to obtain them. I actually like this design, since it forces you to earn any form of fast travel (I didn't enjoy fast travel in Oblivion since it kind of spoiled me and brought me out of the world in a way).But the main appeal of this game is that the world it takes place in simply feels alive. Not only is it large, there is so much going on in it, too, and Divinity does an excellent job of creating one hell of an immersive atmosphere that you can almost feel like a part of. One of the ways the game accomplishes this is by sprinkling little events throughout the game world. For example, in the middle of one of the forests there is a series of gold coins laid out in a ""trail"" that leads off the main path; if you choose to follow the trail of gold, you'll eventually end up into a clearing where a large group of orcs will ambush (and likely kill) you. Another example -- there is a random human army outpost in the middle of the woods that seems friendly enough -- that is, until you enter. Once you enter, a mage from the Black Ring cult (your chief antagonists in the game) magically appears and casts a mind control spell on everyone, turning them all against you. Little things like this really serve to immerse you in the instability and danger that permeates the land. Immersion and narrative are the chief things I value in a video game, and Divinity delivers in spades.There is SO much to see, do, and explore in this game -- I barely scratched the surface of this game...you can easily put 300 hours into this game on a single playthrough if you are thorough. There are tons and tons of side quests, and the game almost requires you to do several of them (since they give you much needed experience points). But do not fear - side quests in Divine Divinity are rarely menial, like the typical fetch quests of other RPGs (gather 10 pieces of wood, kill 20 wolves, etc.). Instead, side quests are like mini storylines with several chapters, and they tell compelling narratives on their own. For example, one side quest involved finding the source of a poison that was infecting a town's population; another had me investigating political corruption within another town. These side quests are meaningful and important, and increase your stake in the game world and its inhabitants. Also, most side quests also have multiple endings, meaning that your choices actually impact the game world. This is another example of how immersive the game world is.Adding to this is the game's ""population""; there are hundreds of NPC's populating the game world, and each one of them has a unique personality to match. They all go about their lives in an organic way, waking up in the morning and going to bed at night (yes, the game has a realistic day/night cycle) Dialogue in the game is more free-form (a la Mass Effect), meaning you can interact with them in many ways.Probably one of the only issues with the design of Divine Divinity is that the pacing is a bit off, especially in the beginning of the game. This is partly because, since the entire game world is open to exploration right from the start (save for a few areas) and this world is so enthralling, it gives you the itch to start exploring right away despite the fact that you start the game ill equipped to handle some of the game's tougher foes. I remember the first time I played the game, I opted to leave the village of Aleroth (the game's starting point) since I wanted to see the game's vast sights; however, outside the walls of town, I kept dying easily at the hands of any and all enemies I encountered.Finally, the music score of the game is absolutely awesome; it does an incredible job of setting the darker mood of the game and adds a lot to the immersion factor. Overall, if you are a fan of games similar to Diablo/Diablo II, you will feel right at home with Divine Divinity.Recommended "

												I was very excited to play this game but I start a normal new game and experience a crash already, sometimes after that it went into the game, but from there the colors were messed up.I have spent a good hour or two searching for fixes, but from my perspective (I have experience in OpenGL and that stuff) in order to release a game on a new age platform like Steam the game should be mostly compatiable with newer systems (Directx 3D halves your framerate when selected and just shows that this game although updated and ""fixed"" is not ready to be a full version release).Wish it worked , but to not be able to even enter the game world makes it a waste of money.

												To compare this to Diablo is a miscomparison. The enemy balancing is terrible And this issue is noticable early in the game. Tougher monsters should be introduced later in RPGs when the player is becoming stronger. Sometimes it is noticable when you will be facing a tough encounter but there are monsters in the game that you would never expect to kill you, such as a zombie and orc drummer. I can take down a Heavy orc who dual-wirlds two axes but not a orc who drums. This gives the impression that your progession doesn't have any effect . Very disappointed. Play Sacred Gold if you want a isometric, open-world action-RPG.			"

												This game should be avoided. It has a huge flaw that renders the game into a state of unsolvability. A key quest npc, will attack you. If you kill this npc, the game cannot be progressed. Apparently 1000s of other players have run into this perplexing issue. There seems to be a player created fix for this issue. But, It is astounding that the creators of this game,  didnt set the npc, as an unattackable target.  It is frustrating because it happens when 3/4s of the game is completed.			"

												This game quickly becomes tedious and clunky. I really wanted to like it and at first I found it very fun but eventually the flaws really started to add up. Some of these such as the inconvinient barter system can be attributed to its old age but others have no excuse. The interface is just too inconvenient requring you to go through a slow process just to choose a spell or a potion. In the middle of a battle this slowness really gets in the way and holds the game back. The final nail in the coffin was how tedious the game itself got. Having to run back and forth between towns all the time just to find someone who has the items you need or  to complete the missions gets very boring. It's not the worst game ever by any means but I'm disappointed with it.			"

I updated my Nvidia drivers or something (??) and now the game crashes out all the time, rainbow textures, and on and on.. and i'm not even using the 3d accelerated setup in the game.The annoying thing is, it was running fine when I originally installed it. I can't find any help online about this because the game has such a dumb name which also intersects so many similar game names and stuff. . end up on Jehovahs witnesses sites and crap. What I did learn online is this game has always been hopelessly bugged, to the extreme. It would have been great to play this classic finally, but i dont have time to screw up my entire rig and become my own tech support just for one game.			"

DD is the first game in the Divinity series, lately noted because of the fifth part, Divinity: Original Sin. Someone said DD is a mix of Diablo combat and Baldur's Gate questing, which is not a bad description. The quests are mostly ""fetch me an item"", though, and forgettable. As for the ""depth and story"", I'd like to know what drugs people played this on, since I could probably get 50 hours of gameplay from a match box with that stuff. The actual story is a bit bad, the dialogue is seriously bad, and some of the voice acting is so bad you'll think it's a joke.Overall it's a decent example of a late 90's type of action-heavy RPG, but the combat kind of turns into an endless grind and the story/writing is clumsy, so it's difficult to really recommend. If you like to kill a lot of things by clicking and like random cheap fantasy settings in general, it might suit you.			"

												First off I have to mention that this game is incredibly buggy or at least the Steam version is, since it's apparently lacking a major patch. There are a ton of quests that don't work at all or are partially broken. Some people even said that they can't finish the game because of some major bugs. Also, avoid exploring an area before you have a quest that requires you to go there, MANY quests can be broken by doing stuff before you're asked to.I've played this game many years before but I returned to it now after about 10 years.Combat: You click on enemies once and you also have to spam potions. Spamming potions is mandatory since the developers found it very fun and innovative to not give you health OR mana regen. This doesn't add anything to the game, it only makes it tedious. You only have to spend a few hundred gold coins on mana potions and then you can spam spam spam. Basically, thanks to the game trying to be ""tactical"" and♥♥♥♥♥♥by forcing you to use potions, you have infinite health and mana. As you can imagine the mage class is probably very fun to play. Actually it ain't. There are 2-3 spells that are worth your time and they look like crap. Also, you're going to have to rely on melee/ranged a lot since you don't want to waste mana on the easy mobs. The starting spell of the mage called ""meteor strike"" is a yellow football followed by an ugly looking smoke effect. That's what you're gonna have to use for the first 20-30 levels because most of the other spells are pathetic. The spells aren't satisfying to use AT ALL, it's depressing. The effects are boring to look at, they lack power, and the sound effects don't make you feel like you're actually a powerful mage. You can also cheese the game with Freeze and frost weapons. The quests are actually the best part of the game, they're rarely fetch quests or ""kill 10 sewer rats"" quests but even after you've done them all you feel like you had little impact on the world besides getting special responses from unnamed NPCs based on your reputation level. The reputation system, however, is broken, some quests give you +0 rep and some substract reputation when they shouldn't (you saved that ♥♥♥♥♥ from the zombie? -4 rep for you). Again, more and more bugs.The music is great as well, it makes the game atmospheric, too bad the game itself is lacking in substance.The storyline is simple and boring, you have to kill a cult that wants to destroy the world. The dialogue is so bad it's as if it was written by a 12 year old, they try too hard to make it sound funny and most of the time it's not. The animations are bugged when you play it on a modern system, most animations are running at very high speed and look odd. Only play this game if you just want to waste time playing an isometric RPG just for the sake of doing it. It's literally a big pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ it even has the bugs. It's not even a good Diablo clone, there are better clones out there, like the Sacred series, Titan Quest, Torchlight, Path of Exile, etc. Some people compared this game to the Ultima series so try out those games instead of  torturing yourself with this crap.

												I probably haven't given this game enough play time to really write it off so quickly. But the movement and combat is so clunky. Yes you just click on stuff, but it's not very smoothly controlled like say torchlight. And the graphics are really hard for me to deal with. All the items blend into the background. It took me 30 minutes to figure out how to progress in one level even though all you had to do was push a lever right in front of your face but it blended into the background so well. They really need something to highlight all interactive objects like some other games have. As it is all you can highlight is stuff you can pick up like loot mostly.Other than those major gripes, the story seems good enough, the lore seems like it might have some depth to it. The class system seems lacking and generic. Can't really recommend this when there are plenty of better action rpg types like Torchlight 2 or Diablo 3 and plenty of better rpg types like Dragon Age that are just more fun. Hope the new Original Sin is better!			"

												Poor pathfinding, lack of controls, and enemies that regardless of level and hitpoints, can reduce you to nothing due to being over powered. This is by far a horrible attempt at making an RPG. While being an older game, it should also be up to the standards of older games like Baldur's Gate and Diablo. This, doesn't even come within a fraction of them. This is the worst investment I have made with my money. Wish steam had a way to completely remove a game from your library and list of history.			"

												Meh. It's like a clone of Diablo II. While it might have an interesting plot, I wouldn't know because between screen resolution issues, the lack of WASD manueverability and it seizing up, I couldn't be enticed to play futher. Had I found this game ten years ago, maybe I'd given it another chance. But for late 2014, it's just an old, derivative game.			"

												  Game is completely unplayable. After an hour or two the maps to every dungeon, cave, cellar simply stops displaying. All that happens is my character is shown entering the door from the main map and then nothing else. There is absolutely no support for this game and there are no listings for bug fixes anymore. A complete waste of time and money. I would strongly suggest never playing this game or any others like it.			"

												I originally reviewed this game saying that it looked good but I wasn't able to play it due to glitches. After getting it to work properly, I have to change my review. I pretty quickly realized that this game is basically a Diablo clone. I quit after about halfway through the first dungeon. It literally consisted of nothing but endless waves of skeletons, other than one short and unsatisfying puzzle. In a game where there is nothing but endless violence, there is no point to playing a rogue or wizard. Wizard skills, for example, other than ones that deal damage are useless in a game that is entirely focused around repetive combat. And even then, you're just a hyped-up warrior who has a limit of attacks (limited by your magic points). Rogues are utter garbage when stealth doesn't even work properly. No, really, enemies spot you immediately and backstabs are impossible.Oh and another thing. You don't get to customize anything about your character. You just choose from 6 options: 3 classes, each with a male or female version. Yes, you heard me right. No alignment, ability scores, races, nothing. You do get to pick new skills and assign stat points when you level up, but obviously this makes the game more focused around XP grinding than actual roleplaying. You can talk, but talking is pretty much limited to ""Hey, wanna do a quest?"" And your responses are yes, no, or to ask for more information. What a complex social interaction, right? I would be hesitant to call this an RPG. I would probably call it a beat-em-up fighting game.  So if you're looking for the latter, it's a great game. If you like the former then pass on this.			"

												It could have been one of the best old school RPG, a perfect blend of Ultima and Diablo, but there are three things that ruin completely the game. First: it could happen to get stuck in the middle of the game because you cannot accomplish a mission, and it's caused by a bug (the famous 'red imps bug')! You can only restart the game and hope that you will not encounter that bug in the future.Second: the last part of the game is really boring and flat, like the 'Hell' part of the first Diablo.Third: you will face an enemy that is VERY stressing to fight (Josephine). Why want you to stress yourself that much for a game? And if you don't have the right quantities of potions, and the right skills, you will be just STUCK; not a nice way to present an RPG.Bugged and sometimes badly designed. It's a pity because everything else is good, good old 2D graphics, nice music (except the monotone 'Hell' background music), nice story(ies), varied locations and characters. A pity.			"

												Seems like a sweet game... however there is one monumental, colossal, megalithic, extremely annoying thing that occurs when I run the game at 1080p. Between the transition from the main menu to the higher, desired resolution, it changes, but in doing so it changes the window sizes and placement of all windows on my desktop for every program I currently have open.There is no window mode. You can try find some recent software to run the game in window mode and it may well save the problem, but sadly I have had no luck. I don't like resizing all of my windows everytime I play the game for half hour, etc, so I don't bother with it.Perhaps one day, the devs will kindly patch in a window mode for this old title, so people don't have to ♥♥♥♥ about just to get it to stop ruining the desktop and window sizes.

												foreword, this is from the viewpoint of someone who wasn't around when these types of RPGs were popular.TL;DR:If you're a fan of old school RPGs or diablo type games, or part of the older generation, you might get a kick out of this.if not, then I wouldn't reccomend it as much.the game was on sale and I decided to give it a try after hearing glowing reviews about it.Never have I been so lost in a game before.5 min in, I wake up in a cellar and find out I was unconscious, typical stuff.the guy who helped me reccomend see the elder because he was going insane and I wanted to help.the man gives me directions, and that was it.no waypoint, which is somewhat understandable, but considering that everything looked almost the same, I had a hard time telling if I was on a road or not.later when I found the elder, he freezes some man and I had to help him.he tells me I have to sneak into the Elder's house through his cellar using the well.I went literally the whole town looking for the well, only to find out it was next to his house.it was hard to tell from everything else since it looked more like an abandoned shack than a well.I made it to the elder, talked to him, skipped through most of the dialogue because It was boring me and taking too long to say what I needed to hear, and at that point, I just couldn't stand the game anymore.I'm 20 years old and was born in 1995, so at the time RPGs were more like this, I weren't really able to enjoy them, and I certainly don't enjoy them as of now. either way, for someone like me, it felt like a waste of money, even when it was on sale.

												Overall, the game seems cheap and gimmicky.  Not all bad, but beyond the early game and music, it's mostly bad.Mind-numbing and repetitive gameplay.The spellcasting system is just bad: the faster the button is clicked the faster the spell is cast.Constitution is almost a worthless stat.I haven't upgraded my gear much since about level 10.More robbery than Monaco and fewer guards.There are some completely overpowered abilities.  Without them, parts of the game cannot be beaten on Hard.The dialog choices are stupid: pressing '1' is correct.  Usually, the other choices will allow you to redo the dialog until you press '1'.Interface needs more hotkeys.  I have to use AutoHotkey to automate clicking some of the confirm dialogs.At least two significant bugs: saving a game when holding more than the character's maximum weight (from buffs expiring) causes the save to be unloadable, crashing each time.Clicking on a piece of equipment while the game is paused often causes that item to permanently disappear.

												Divinity: Original Sin is a fantasic game, this isn't sadly. Most of your skills are useless and even when you get them (e.g. herberlism at level 3) you can't actually pick up herbs, and have to wait to level 9. Isn't this fun? The combat in very, very clunky compared to Diablo and other clones, half the times i'm missing what i'm suppose to click.The durability is set, so that litterally in 2 minutes your weapons will break.You will loose health and need to visit venders as well, to get health, and repears (at the start of the game) you will need to do 5% of the dungeon, run all the way back, do 5% more, run all the way back, repeat repeat, repeat. You can use a teleport stone, but that will drop you with 10+ monsters that will kill you almost instantly.Great! In short - a game with good intetions but very, very flawed.			"

												Graphics seem to be from the last millenia. Sound seems good though. Really good song in the main menu!Combat seems really stiff. Not at all like Diablo II which this game is strangely compared to. The worst is that when the character is moving the game stutters!   Run button also doesn't work....It sure is oldschool with no modern questmarkers. Having to talk to people and try different alternatives before you get some options (like quests) would probably not happen in a game made after 2010.Inventorysystem is clunky and having to switch from combat mode to unarmed (sheath weapon) feels like 1995 or something!I only played until I got the mage to thaw his elven friend. Divine Divinity might have been decent back when it was released but today is serves as an example of ancient gamedesign that we have progressed away from.			"

												I play RPG's for the story. The entire premise of the first 10-12 hours of the game is that Healing Magic doesn't work because the ""Source"" is tainted. Well... I can still go up to EVERY SINGLE NPC IN THE FIRST TOWN, and ask for healing. Fwoosh, flash of light, instantly healed--- that's a spell, boys and girls. The fundamental problem of the story is simple not true. That bothers me a lot.I'm playing this game from start to finish for a review for my youtube show, but my god. The first town consists of 6 people. All of them are either openly racist, drug addicts, crazy or just casual thieves. And its supposed to be a community of light-blessed healers. What the heck is wrong with all these people?!That aside, there's a bizarre sexism in the game. I didn't see a female character until about 10 hours in. Also, in the character selection screen all of the female characters make a rather bizarre ""because I'm a woman, X"" statement. I don't really care for the underlying sexism about female adventurers.Also, if you level up DO NOT SAVE and quit. Your skill points will disappear and you can't get them back. You have to assign them, confirm them, THEN save and quit if you like. The game will eat your new skill points if not. That's a huge oversight, 2002 or not!In addition, the bosses I've encountered so far have been PATHETIC for any gamer to come across.Boss #1- stands still so you can one shot him.Boss #2- one-shots you so that an NPC can save your sorry behind and one-shot him dead while you lay there.Boss #3- you can pay him 1000gp and he'll be ""at peace"" (undead) and not fight you, though you still get the XP.There are simply too many problems for me to even give this a passing grade. This is not even a poorly made Diablo clone like some would say-- Its a poorly made GAME!			"

I found it in a Fred Meyer rack and figured it was a buget title and that I was probably one of it's only fans. I've played through the game at least four times. It was only years later that I realized the game had a huge following. I'm so glad that other people enjoy this game as much as I do. It's so much fun and is challanging while never getting annoying. Note, save often as there is no autosave function. I wan't even find words to say why I love the game so much. It was one of the first RPGs I fell in love with. With great comedy, an engaging and thrilling plot line, multipe side quests, and beautiful music Divine Divinity is easily in my top ten favorite games ever.			"

												Can't believe I never took the time to play this sooner.  As far as RPGs go it's in the big leagues.  It starts off slow, and the 1st major challenge is a little much, but the freaking thing sucks you in like crack.  It's smooth cracksmoke sailing from there on out as far as I can tell.  The closest thing I can think of to describe it is Diablo 1 with a much much much bigger world and combat a hair behind it (not much, just minor stuff).  Half of the problem is missing convenience controls like a stand-still-while♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥button, and not-so-much-ease in other combat controls like switching weapons (lots of things you can hotkey, some things seem like you can't though).  The other half is the engine itself: it doesn't schedule work well, so when it gets enough on the screen at once it starts ignoring control input, which engine design should never allow.  It happens *rarely* though (so far only with lots of projectiles in flight), and it may have been fine at release (coulda just been DX6- approaches to drawing that weren't properly dealt with in the update), so it's not a big deal for me.  The issue shows itself in lack of Steam overlay support too, by the way.  Aggravating, but the game is way way worth it.  The story is as big and seemingly non-linear as the world, and the number of quests and quest complexity matches it.  Alongside that is significant ability customization, and different layouts do seem to matter in most ways you'd expect.  It's got the cheeziest humor, so bad it's good, and speaking of that the voice acting is freaking horrrrrific.  The next one in the series better be as bad, I'm looking forward to the (un)intended humor.  Best of all, it's one of those games where you can tell how much the dev team loved it--there's attention to detail all around, and it wasn't rushed out so fast it didn't get needed polish.  All in all, 94/100 for me.			"

												This is one of the best isometric ARPGs that's available, and it has something that most other isometric ARPGs lack in, story. The story is fully fleshed out and full of flippant dialogue. It also can be amusing and intriguing at times. The combat and RPG elements are old school and the graphics give that feeling as well, but surprisingly still holds up pretty well. If you're looking for a decent isometric RPG with a decent story, you can't go wrong at this price. 8/10			"

												Can't believe I never took the time to play this sooner.  As far as RPGs go it's in the big leagues.  It starts off slow, and the 1st major challenge is a little much, but the freaking thing sucks you in like crack.  It's smooth cracksmoke sailing from there on out as far as I can tell.  The closest thing I can think of to describe it is Diablo 1 with a much much much bigger world and combat a hair behind it (not much, just minor stuff).  Half of the problem is missing convenience controls like a stand-still-while♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥button, and not-so-much-ease in other combat controls like switching weapons (lots of things you can hotkey, some things seem like you can't though).  The other half is the engine itself: it doesn't schedule work well, so when it gets enough on the screen at once it starts ignoring control input, which engine design should never allow.  It happens *rarely* though (so far only with lots of projectiles in flight), and it may have been fine at release (coulda just been DX6- approaches to drawing that weren't properly dealt with in the update), so it's not a big deal for me.  The issue shows itself in lack of Steam overlay support too, by the way.  Aggravating, but the game is way way worth it.  The story is as big and seemingly non-linear as the world, and the number of quests and quest complexity matches it.  Alongside that is significant ability customization, and different layouts do seem to matter in most ways you'd expect.  It's got the cheeziest humor, so bad it's good, and speaking of that the voice acting is freaking horrrrrific.  The next one in the series better be as bad, I'm looking forward to the (un)intended humor.  Best of all, it's one of those games where you can tell how much the dev team loved it--there's attention to detail all around, and it wasn't rushed out so fast it didn't get needed polish.  All in all, 94/100 for me.			"

												The title turned me off initially but I am so happy I gave this game a shot! The game still looks great. There are female character choices, which is awesome and rare for games like this. There is a diversity in loot that is pretty much unparalleled, even in modern epics like Skyrim. The dialogue is sometimes cheesy but in a very charming and purposeful way. The music is also fantastic. There is a lot to do, much to explore and many secrets to uncover. The game is pretty challenging but well worth it. Hard to believe it's over ten years old!			"

												An awesome fantasy RPG that is well worth a play-through. The start can be a bit slow and tough, and some would say it's more like Diablo than Ultima, but soon after, it opens up to a huge world with lots of side quests, the right amount of dungeon crawling, plenty of fighting and looting and of course saving the world.

												Divine Divinity is Diablo II made into an actual RPG, but with significantly less polish, more broken skills and writing done by people whose native language obviously is not English. But it's so much better than it sounds.The world is huge and full of quests and weirdos and choices and consequences. There are multiple ways to solve nearly every quest, most of the dialogues have good snarky options and the whole game drips with enthusiasm. It may be flawed, it may be ugly in places, it may be silly beyond all get out, but it was obviously made by people who wanted to make it. Larian are probably my favorite developer; I don't know that anyone else is as passionate about the games they make as those guys.Their games aren't the best. They're often uneven. Sometimes they're even complete messes. Divine Divinity is no different. But it's got a lot of character. It's got a lot of soul, and it set the stage for all the fun stuff Larian's made since.There are games with better combat, with more coherent worlds, with more fleshed-out characters, with more memorable plots, but few games exude the joy and excitement that Larian games do. I recommend all of them....Except Beyond Divinity. That one ain't very good.			"

Only issue is that I must have picked a poor build as I was extremely squishy and realized I'd have to grind and level up considerably if I were to progress. That's why I stopped playing.Bottom line: If you like diablo-like games, then you've gotta play this. Especially if you think Diablo 1/2 was too easy.			"

												Mix Neverwinter Nights mechanics and The Elder Scrolls sense of freedom, then you have Divine Divinity. Over a decade after it's release, it still stands up to recently released RPG titles. And in many cases, it's still better.If you're a Linux user, this game is confirmed PlayOnLinux / WINE friendly. On Ubuntu 15.10 it was a simple matter of installing Steam, and then Divine Divinity via Steam, through PlayOnLinux. It was up and running after the download. No fuss.Near complete freedom. You can cross-class skill trees. If you're a fan of NWN or Elder Scrolls and you haven't played this, get it. Massive Bonus:No annoying repetitive chatter from your character, *every* *single* *time* you click on something. Looking at you, Balder's Gate.			"

												An interesting RPG that is a nice look back at the older style of games. You have to fiddle with your inventory and sort your stuff manually, you can move boxes and bags in the world to reveal secret passages and items, and the game doesn´t hold your hand on your adventure (Meaning very limited transporting and a questlog similar to Morrowind´s, if a but more user friendly).The leveling up can be a bit confusing, since you can take skills from any of the three skill trees in the game (Fighter, mage and  ""survivor"" respectably). This means you have to be smart when picking your skills.The combat can be a bit cluttered, but it´s never too hard. The game also features an easy quicksave and -load system.Plotwise I can´t say much. It seems solid and the voice acting isn´t bad. I´d give it about a 7/10.			"

												Don't let my Steam time fool you, I've done several complete playthroughs, mostly on the Discs I've owned since 2005.Pros-Stunning visuals(For its time).-Amazing soundtrack.-Complete and utter freedom, no hand holding. (Though, this can also be viewed as a con, because the total freedom can lead to actions which break quests)-Complete control over the build of your character, starting classes only determine your appearance and starting stats/skills.-Great humor.-Quests and choices have an impact on the way to world reacts to you, and sometimes the events that unfold, because of your choices, are chaotic fun.-Skills are varied, some useless, but most serving their purpose well. (Telekinesis allows you to steal so much stuff)-Non-leveled gameplay. Some areas are hard as hell for a reason, dummy.-Bad memes and Broken DreamsCons-Sometimes the only solution is violence. What if I wanna be a pacifist??-Bosses become swish cheese, easily. If you know what you're doing.-Story's outcome is not affected by how much people hate you. Lame.-Bad puns.-{Insert lame attempt at a joke here.}-Of course, the quest to poison the waterwell. F**k you orcs. And your camp.TL;DR?Game is fun, recommended if you enjoy a challenge and open ended gameplay. Retro with a touch of innovation for the time. 2D Graphics, look painted on a canvas. Amazing soundtrack.10/10 Would make skeletons have an existential crisis again.			"

												This game was as good as I remembered. Interact with everything, clever little extras hidden all over, (I want to share some but I don't want to spoil it), non-linear, freedom to choose whatever spell/skill you want regardless of class and most importantly no drivelly ""You are the Chosen One"" beginning.  Yeah, you have been chosen, but you can pretty much do as you please, without being compelled to be some goody two shoes quest monkey.  Thank Goodness the intro isn't ""Only you can save Mankind/Elfkind/society from the effect of violent TV shows"" crap that you are faced with before you have even gotten to slay something in most games :D I played this the first time when it came out, I was young, rolled a warrior, good thing too as this game is hard.  Warriors seem to me to have the easiest time surviving.This time I rolled a survivor, and I played like the theiving backstabbing little minx I am.  Justified the fact I like to see what is in every chest , I might not take it, I am just nosey :P  WARNING - the non linear aspect is great, but you can break a quest or even the game if you discover x before y.  And sometimes you don't realise a quest is unsolvable (broken) until much later. I am on the fence about whether this is OK or not.  I mean on the one hand, for example, you nosed around Bad guy's lair and scared him off, so when bad guy's neighbour complains about bad guy you can't take action, 'cos he is long gone (serves you right for trepassing and breaking and entering without due cause, right? :P) but on the othe rhand.. when it breaks the game (main quest line).. Well I would not like to re-roll and glad to say this hasn't happened yet, but if the small quests can still be broken I guess teh main ones can too?  SOME CONSI have lots more pros, but if you are thinking of buying the game, you probably already know these so... on the flip sideRESOLUTION - The game has not been fully configured for higher resolutions.  I played quite happily on 1600 x ? for some time before realising that all the issues I was having with the quests were due to the map being clipped, I was missing the lower portion of the map.  Also whislt the game looked great even with buffed character vision I was only using a tiny portion of the centre of my screen, basically the mobs only appeared when right next to my character, despite the fact I could supposedly see half a mile away.  FIX - I changed the resolution 1280 x 1204.  This made the game look like it used to and fixed all the maps.  (Right click on DD in steam menu and select configure). WARNING - You may feel older (I did :P)BUGGY- A shame that this hasn't been fixed, I mean I know this game isn't expensive, but a few of the old problems should have been fixed.  Some are just annoying (CRASHES), others kinda ruin the game experience.  (Got a weapon with a broken enchantment now everything dies with no effort, yes I should destroy said weapon, but my money grabbing survivor wont let me.. grahhh!)There are very few cons to this baby, she is old, but she is good.  I am going to replay her and the sequels before husband and I shell out for DDBeyond.This was my first review so apologies if I missed something pertinent.Regards			"

If you can toughen up and fight through some bugs and ""classic difficulty"" then you will learn to appreciate all the detail and love put into the game world. If you play it and find it difficult to enjoy, at least play to beyond the first town, because the game does not truly begin until then.Also, expect to travel around manually. A lot.

												This game was as good as I remembered. Interact with everything, clever little extras hidden all over, (I want to share some but I don't want to spoil it), non-linear, freedom to choose whatever spell/skill you want regardless of class and most importantly no drivelly ""You are the Chosen One"" beginning.  Yeah, you have been chosen, but you can pretty much do as you please, without being compelled to be some goody two shoes quest monkey.  Thank Goodness the intro isn't ""Only you can save Mankind/Elfkind/society from the effect of violent TV shows"" crap that you are faced with before you have even gotten to slay something in most games :D I played this the first time when it came out, I was young, rolled a warrior, good thing too as this game is hard.  Warriors seem to me to have the easiest time surviving.This time I rolled a survivor, and I played like the theiving backstabbing little minx I am.  Justified the fact I like to see what is in every chest , I might not take it, I am just nosey :P  WARNING - the non linear aspect is great, but you can break a quest or even the game if you discover x before y.  And sometimes you don't realise a quest is unsolvable (broken) until much later. I am on the fence about whether this is OK or not.  I mean on the one hand, for example, you nosed around Bad guy's lair and scared him off, so when bad guy's neighbour complains about bad guy you can't take action, 'cos he is long gone (serves you right for trepassing and breaking and entering without due cause, right? :P) but on the othe rhand.. when it breaks the game (main quest line).. Well I would not like to re-roll and glad to say this hasn't happened yet, but if the small quests can still be broken I guess teh main ones can too?  SOME CONSI have lots more pros, but if you are thinking of buying the game, you probably already know these so... on the flip sideRESOLUTION - The game has not been fully configured for higher resolutions.  I played quite happily on 1600 x ? for some time before realising that all the issues I was having with the quests were due to the map being clipped, I was missing the lower portion of the map.  Also whislt the game looked great even with buffed character vision I was only using a tiny portion of the centre of my screen, basically the mobs only appeared when right next to my character, despite the fact I could supposedly see half a mile away.  FIX - I changed the resolution 1280 x 1204.  This made the game look like it used to and fixed all the maps.  (Right click on DD in steam menu and select configure). WARNING - You may feel older (I did :P)BUGGY- A shame that this hasn't been fixed, I mean I know this game isn't expensive, but a few of the old problems should have been fixed.  Some are just annoying (CRASHES), others kinda ruin the game experience.  (Got a weapon with a broken enchantment now everything dies with no effort, yes I should destroy said weapon, but my money grabbing survivor wont let me.. grahhh!)There are very few cons to this baby, she is old, but she is good.  I am going to replay her and the sequels before husband and I shell out for DDBeyond.This was my first review so apologies if I missed something pertinent.Regards			"

												Very good but feels stiff comared to modern RPGs like SkyrimGameplay Score: 95Graphics Score ( compared to other games in 2002): 90Story score: 100Difficulty: Moderate, unless you go to fast and then find yourself eaten.Controls: Exellent, the majority of what you will ever need is right in front of you and the pause feature gives you time to do anything.I once had this in the disc form and I played it until the disc actually broke. Then when it came out on Steam I picked it up right quick. It was still fun but was not as fun as it once was, mostly just because it is so old. But for being from 2002 the graphics are good and the game is surrounded with an epic story line that throws a curve at you just enough to keep you glued to the screen. The game is fair and has an acceptable progression of your character. It is a good idea to save often because when you die, you die, no ifs, ands or buts.			"

												POSITIVES:1. Huge game, lots of exploration and details to tiny things that are often ignored by modern RPG games (or for that matter, any game out there)!2. Lots of good loots: you will find good loots and even better ones as you progress, not downgraded loots that you see in games like...say...Diablo 3. *angry face*3. Very detailed quests. Some of them will make you think about what you need to do, instead of just ""go-there-get-that-bring-them-back-to-person"" type of quests that you see now. Some quests are very detailed and requires careful backtracking, which may or may not please you; but it shows great immersion to the story telling that it has to offer.4. Funny characters all over the map.NEGATIVES: 1. Old school game, don't expect gfx to be like Skyrims (obviously)!2. Save a lot. Many quests can be done different ways to get more or less XP or rewards. So try to think before you do them. THIS IS NOT A NEGATIVE, but it may frustrate you for not getting what you wanted.			"

I actually found out that this is a common issue and there´s a script thing to fix it, but I´m too lazy to do it. So I didnt finish it.That been said, I really loved the game, imersive storyline, logical quests, rewarding syste, very customizable character, although a bit unbalanced, (warrior is the best by far) intelligent dialogs...Great game but for that one gamebreaking bug.

												Well, what is Divine Divinity?It is the prove that a hack&slay-style gameplay doesn't mean that you can't have a deep and long story with true roleplaying. It is the prove that choosing a class for your character in an rpg doesn't need to limit your further character development. It is the prove that you can have story, the freedom of choice, open world AND action in one game. And it is the prove that mad magicians can invent words even imps can't pronounce properly...Well, Divine Divinity is a 2D game with isometric view where you controll a single character. The game lets you interact with almost any object in the game, has some kind of crafting system, a story, hack&slay-like battles, a character system where your class only defines your starting skills but everything else is completely open to you. You have moral choices, influence on other characters depending on your choices, different possibilities to solve (or not solve) quests, guilds that you can join, conflicts to solve and a world to save from a great plot of ancient evil powers.It is a game from 2003, so don't expect too much from the graphics, but everything else can compete against most recent games. Divine Divinity was the first part of the Divinity-series (followed by Beyond Divinity, Divinity II (which was obviously the third part) and Divinity: Original Sin and the Spin-Off Divinity: Dragon Commander) and still I think it was the best part of the series.What you can await from this game? Well, at least around 30 hours of gameplay if you only go for the main story. Some very hard and frustrating fights in the beginning of the game, a lot possibilities to break quests or even the game by doing stupid things you are not supposed to do (so keep some different save-files...) and some mad humor when you are least awaiting it. The game requires a bit of skill and intelligent planning. If you have difficulties, it is no shame to rely on a guide on for example which are the skills that are worth upgrading or which things you definitly should not do to not break important quests, but it is also much fun strolling around and experiment.Do I recommend the game? Yes, if you have some frustration tolerance. The price tag is always worth it.			"

The game mechanics clearly place it among the likes of Diablo, Nox etc. BUT the content and much of the quest concepts rather remind of games like Baldurs Gate or Planscape Torment. If u like either of these games, this one might b the right choices. It is cheap enough to try it anyway...			"

												If you're not exceptionally picky about a typo here and there and a few minor bugs that may occur, Divine Divinity will provide many, many (addictive?) hours of entertainment for old-schoolish -- not Baulder's Gate, think Neverwinter Nights era) RPG fans. The storline has some critics, but I loved it....and to me the game is worth it for the story alone. Be sure to read the 28-page prologue. :)  Also, the game is pretty self-aware and somewhat comical in parts, if you're into that.			"

												Love this game! It reminds of UO (Ultima Online) one of my all-time favorite games. The interface is mouse-driven and intuitive, and the graphics are old-school hand-drawn art... but not TOO old-school, as there's been extra care taken for details, adding to the overall enjoyment of the game experience. The storyline is interesting, character development is open-ended and gameplay keeps you interested and entertained.But perhaps what's made me a new Larian Studios fan for life is the Customer Support they offer here on Steam. Their representative, Raze, is always on the forum, ready to help fix any problem you have, if it's in his power... and it usually is. If you have trouble and post your problem to the forum, Raze will answer you within a very short time, offering solutions, including even fixing your bugged character (if you email him your character file). I have NEVER had that kind of Customer Support for ANY game before! As far as I'm concerned, Larian Studios is the best!			"

												One of my favourite RPGs of all time, it has beautiful isometric artwork, fun combat and an intriguing plot with good characters.The artwork is great in my opinion, coming at the end of an era of great iosmetric games and utilising the available technology post-millenium, making me sad that this genre was all but dropped for a decade.Combat is a kind of Diablo-like with left clicking to melee and right clicking to fling spells and a button to lock on to enemies if you need the extra accuracy. I found it a lot of fun, although some abilities are quite unbalanced. There is certainly plenty of scope for roleplaying and building custom classes (there are starting classes but no restrictions on gear or abilities) but you might find yourself using some abilities and skills simply because they're very effective.The plot is interesting, with plenty of intrigue and wonder and it takes you to many interesting places, varied environments and great characters abound. It also has a good sense of humour, without overdoing it, something that Larian are usually quite good at.In summary, this game feels like Diablo got a shot of Baldur's Gate and a taste of Elder Scrolls and I feel it is highly underrated. If you enjoy RPGs you shouldn't miss out on this gem.			"

												You know when you pick up a book, look at the cover and think ""naaah"". This is what happened to me, i looked at this game a few times but i wasnt sure what to think. i then preceeded to watch a video on the gameplay and then proceeded to buy it. i do not regret it. not at all. its hard as can be in some parts but the challenge is well worth it, the soundtrack is an absolute masterpiece sit back and enjoy the beauty that is the OST of this truly wonderful game. the skill trees are interesting and your not limited to just one you can branch out into the other classes skills aswell which stirs up the pot a bit. i guarentee wether your paying a few dollars here or a but-ton at a game store somewhere it will be well worth the  blood sweat tears and anguish it probably took to scrounge up that much coinage.

												I attacked some Dwarven healer's pigs in order to get some supplies and I ended up getting electrocuted to death.......This game brings back wave after wave of nostalgia when I spent days and days as a little kid exploring and hacking my way through the world as a mercenary anti-hero. I haven't gotten to playing this game much but this was one of the best and most underrated RPG classics back then. Divine Divinity gives the player the freedom to go about the land of Rivellon however they choose and customize their character however they want. This game was a contender and a survivor seeing how it was able to set the foundations of the Divinity series. If you're into classic RPGs with a good story, flexible customization, a unique sense of humor, and good action then give this game a try; you won't regret it!			"

												Dungeon-crawling RPG, along the same lines as the original Diablo but quite a bit bigger.  You will do some ""fetch"" quests and some monster-slaying quests for the local people, who will reward you with experience points, cash, and equipment.  You will spend a lot of time fighting monster mobs looking for experience to level-up, and you will be checking corpses and containers for health potions and bigger/badder weapons.  You have a choice of male or female from the classic character archetypes (rogue, fighter, wizard) and each of them has some utility.  The fighter can carry high weight and do big damage from swords and axes... makes the beginning of the game easier.  The mage obviously can cast some devastating spells to wipe out the enemy, but has low survivability and really is harder in the beginning and easier in the late stages of the game.  The rogue uses lighter weapons and armor, combined with speed... good with a bow.  I have not yet played as the rogue though so I won't say anything about how easy or hard it is.  One thing I don't like about this one and its sequel is that once you kill something or open a box it stays dead or opened.  So you are very limited in opportunities to get experience/level-ups and items.  Other than that, this game is lots of fun if you're into dungeon-crawler RPG.Unlike Diablo, you actually travel considerably in this game.  You start in a small village, which has a ""baby dungeon"" below it.  From there, you travel through a forest (inhabited by a bunch of Orcs) and across a bridge (which of course is guarded by Trolls) to reach the part of the world where you will do most of your adventuring.  You have to survive in the wilderness as you travel between several towns and castles, as well as into the sewers and a few other types of dungeons below them.  The story behind the game is pretty interesting, although it's not really great... typical plot for RPG's of the time:  you are ""the chosen one"" and you have to bring the various races together (elf, orc, dwarf, human) to fight against a greater evil.  You'll be aided by a crazy wizard named Zandalor among other characters.  The side-quests are actually more interesting than the main story, although several of them have you running halfway around the world two or three times in order to complete them.			"

												Well, what is Divine Divinity?It is the prove that a hack&slay-style gameplay doesn't mean that you can't have a deep and long story with true roleplaying. It is the prove that choosing a class for your character in an rpg doesn't need to limit your further character development. It is the prove that you can have story, the freedom of choice, open world AND action in one game. And it is the prove that mad magicians can invent words even imps can't pronounce properly...Well, Divine Divinity is a 2D game with isometric view where you controll a single character. The game lets you interact with almost any object in the game, has some kind of crafting system, a story, hack&slay-like battles, a character system where your class only defines your starting skills but everything else is completely open to you. You have moral choices, influence on other characters depending on your choices, different possibilities to solve (or not solve) quests, guilds that you can join, conflicts to solve and a world to save from a great plot of ancient evil powers.It is a game from 2003, so don't expect too much from the graphics, but everything else can compete against most recent games. Divine Divinity was the first part of the Divinity-series (followed by Beyond Divinity, Divinity II (which was obviously the third part) and Divinity: Original Sin and the Spin-Off Divinity: Dragon Commander) and still I think it was the best part of the series.What you can await from this game? Well, at least around 30 hours of gameplay if you only go for the main story. Some very hard and frustrating fights in the beginning of the game, a lot possibilities to break quests or even the game by doing stupid things you are not supposed to do (so keep some different save-files...) and some mad humor when you are least awaiting it. The game requires a bit of skill and intelligent planning. If you have difficulties, it is no shame to rely on a guide on for example which are the skills that are worth upgrading or which things you definitly should not do to not break important quests, but it is also much fun strolling around and experiment.Do I recommend the game? Yes, if you have some frustration tolerance. The price tag is always worth it.			"

It has a compelling story and a good sized world to discover. The one tiny thing that got on my nerves was the lack of autosave. Since most games now have it, I normally don't think about saving after I do something. In this game, you will want to save after doing EVERYTHING. All in all, it's an amazing game and I have already played it over twice.8.5/10			"

												Mix Neverwinter Nights mechanics and The Elder Scrolls sense of freedom, then you have Divine Divinity. Over a decade after it's release, it still stands up to recently released RPG titles. And in many cases, it's still better.If you're a Linux user, this game is confirmed PlayOnLinux / WINE friendly. On Ubuntu 15.10 it was a simple matter of installing Steam, and then Divine Divinity via Steam, through PlayOnLinux. It was up and running after the download. No fuss.Near complete freedom. You can cross-class skill trees. If you're a fan of NWN or Elder Scrolls and you haven't played this, get it. Massive Bonus:No annoying repetitive chatter from your character, *every* *single* *time* you click on something. Looking at you, Balder's Gate.			"

												This game is tons of fun.  It's made by the same people who made Divinity: Original Sin, and the same sense of humor is in this game.  The gameplay is like a cross between Baldur's Gate and Diablo II.  There's real time combat with pause, and the skill trees are really a lot of fun.  My first playthrough, I went as a summoner, and was able to summon 10 skeletons and a strong knight, and a bunch of rats as well.  But you can also play as pure melee, or as a ranger, or any hybrid class you can think of.  My advice: invest in the skill that lets you place runes in your equipment.  You can easily double your base stats this way.  Also, don't invest points in magic, as you can buy magic skill books, and you will have a ton of money as you progress.If you like ARPGs, quests that can be long and hard to figure out sometimes, a bunch of freedom, and a huge open world to explore and develop your character in any way you can imagine, then this game is for you.

For those essentially willing to relearn an RPG from scratch and grapple with a game that didn't age well, you absolutely would not be disappointed. As always, Larian excels in their storytelling and spins a deep and compelling tale once you start to figure out what's going on and how to play the game.

Throughout his journeys the player will get the chance to develop his character as one of six character types(3 Men, 3 women with old classes like Warrior/Rogue/Mage), and meet a variety of people and fantastical beings. By combining the best features of the RPG genre and sense of humor, and introducing a lot of new features, Divine Divinity will appeal to both hardcore/new RPG players.

												Decent diablo-style rpg, good if you're looking for that kind of gameplay. It's also very open ended and the enemies are not scaled to your level, for better or worse. Word of Warning for new players: Weapons and Armor have COMPLETELY RANDOM stats. Even the unique set armor and weapons. The stats are decided when you kill a tough enemy or find the item. I'm not talking diablo-style random where it can have a random value added to str or whatnot, I'm talking totally friggin random. You can find a dragon-armor setpiece (best in the game, at least potentially) with literally anywhere from 2-12 mods, all of which vary incredibly. If you want to get the best gear in this game, you will have to save and reload until you find the best roll. Not that I have anything against random rolls, but the game doesn't tell you about this and it is soooo ridiculously random you could reload 50-100 times and never get the same stats twice (and I would know >.>).

												It may be a good game, but the crash bug,  small fonts make me crazy, it's a old game after all ,so it may can't not fit your PC when you run it. Really! It makes me crazy!after so many bugs regardless, this game is really a great game you can imagine in RPG. if you love the old RPG past years, it can indulge you			"

												This is an incredibly fun RPG / Hack'n'slash game that I would recommend to anyone. Good features:- Attention to detail. Many objects are usable in some way even if they serve no purpose. - Challenging gameplay. Not hard by any means but can suprise you if you stray to far from where you should be.- The story is good but the script can get a bit cheesey and cliche.- Lots of gameplay. There are many sidequests that you can get lost in.Bad features:- Not much direction at the beginning of the game. May take a while to figure out what you are doing.- No respawning. No grinding for better gear just have to keep looking new places if you dont find what you want.- Can't think of anything else I didn't like...			"

												Can't go wrong with Divine Divinity, especially right now - yes NOW! - 'cause it's on sale for like 74 cents, that's cheaper than a condom but can be used multiple times, is just as much fun and doesn't yell at you because it's ""just not in the mood to play right now""Ehrm, back on track: A Diablo-Style timeless hack'n'slay classic with some interesting puzzles in a very interactive world, especially for a game it's age. If you've got a problem with dated visuals however you might be better off with Torchlight 2 instead.Don't let the ingame time fool you, owned this game on disc even before Steam even existed, back when there was only dial-up and strategy books!

												After all these years, i still love this game as much as i did the first time i played it.The soundtrack, the quests, the nostalgia and did i mention the soundtrack.. Seriously the music brings back some serious feels.My original playthrough must have lasted 100 hours+ and plan on spending some time in the steam version when i get the chance to really get my teeth stuck in.I had some trouble running this on Windows10, but running in compatibility mode with admin rights sorted that out.I'm glad the franchise returned to its root with The Original Sin series, the developers havn't lost the love they poured into the first divinity, the only negitive thing i have to say about it it the horrendous name.

												An incredibly enthralling and rewarding experience. Very long to play through, but never feels repetitive or grindy (monsters don't respawn). Works great in Ultrawide HD (2560x1080), which is no small feat for a game this old.There is a few things you should know before you start playing the game.1. BUCK daggers. There is very low variety of dagger weapons, so if you want to rely on assassin's kiss you will be under-powered most of the time. Besides, you can't dual wield, and pairing a shield as high as your shoulder with a dinky dagger makes you look like a retard.2. Craft magic potions to heal yourself. Using the Restoration skill is a lot more resource efficient and handy in combat than chugging healing potions. You will find enough of the latter to use in emergency when your health is too low.3. Skills in the game can be raised three ways- points from leveling up, items (in the form of a skill book) and quest rewards. There are several quests that reward you Restoration, and a book of it you can find at an easy place, so don't waste points maxing it out (max level is 5).4. If you want to reach ALL the loot, you will find the Telekinesis skill useful (I could only retrieve the aforementioned Restoration book with a level 2 Telekinesis skill).5. Scorpion traps are absolutely OP.  Just throw a couple of them at any boss (by using the trap skill) and they will most likely kill it for you.6. Gold will be plentiful. Ignore the Trading skill.7. Save the game often, in different slots. 8. Regeneration is useless. Don't bother. It's too slow to be worth the points and you'll get plenty of potions anyway. "

												Yeah, with a name as repetive as Diving Divinity- it's a decent rpg for its time. Today; it may not be exactly the best, but it offered a few good hours back when I was a child. Mostly nostaliga got me to get it here, and it's rather decent if you don't mind spending a few hours wandering because you have no idea what to do.			"

												When this game came out back in 2002 I had played Diablo 2 for hundreds of hours but this little gem still managed to grab my attention and was the reason I fell in love with Larian as a Developer and especially with Kirill Pokrovsky (RIP) for his incredible compositions.			"

												I'm always looking for good old-fashioned RPGs that challenge me, have more in-depth stories, will pull me into their world, and will kick my♥♥♥♥♥enough so that I need to rethink my approach.  This is one of those games.Great story, great characters, killer dungeons, not so many ultra-linear (easy peasy) quests, and an awesome soundtrack.  Will definitely be playing this game again with the other character classes.Yeah, it's glitchy here and there, but I can deal with it.  Life's rough.			"

												Like Diablo 2 but looking for something with more depth in the world?  Divine Divinity offers a massive and seamless open world (no linear path progression).  You can move and stack objects, choose any skill from any class right from the beginning, go on more sidequests than you can handle, and deeper crafting and alchemy.  It also has an extremely detailed world where you can interact with nearly every single item you see.  Go into someones out and you can do something with every tiny object on the table for example.  Be warned, players may need a notepad to keep track of quest givers as their is no quest tracking.			"
