												Some of us play RPGs to play a game of chess against enemies, others play the game for the story, but with Victim of Zen you'll find neither.This is a really forgettable RPG made with RPG maker. It feels particularly lazy. Not only are there stock assets that come with RPG maker, but the turn based combat system is shallow and default. The enemies just attack. You just attack. Your only focus skill (special skill) is attack twice. It just seems like far less of a RPG than everything else out there. Sometimes the combat will demand that you lose to progress in the game, but other times it will cause a game over. How do you know? Just waste your time to find out. Such as being given a choice, leave through a door on the east or a door on the west. They both lead to guards, but guard on the east will have a game over after you lose the battle. Guard on the west will take you to prison. Hilariously sometimes there are 2 guards on screen and they fight you 1 at a time. That's nice of them. Here you kill my comrade him against 2 of you, then I'll fight the two of you myself. Random battles can seem overpowered, such as level 1 facing 3 enemies that have more HP than you and their attacks do as much damage as you do. So everyone hits 50 HP and you all have 400 HP and they can have critical hits. To top that off, if you get lucky enough for a 1 on 1 battle and you almost get murdered by a critical hit, you can still take your winnings and go to an inn right? Inns cost 17 - 18 gold and the 1 enemy that nearly murders you pays out 10 gold. Games like the first Dragon Quest / Dragon Warrior for the original Nintendo were grind fests, and I was happy for that, because its a great game that spawned a dozen more games with original characters and artwork.There really isn't all that much interactivity or story to speak of other than your male character has been transformed into a female. There is no real sense of character progression, other than you're a girl now. No one seems to care other than 'you're a girl. I'm in love! Will you date boys now? You're cute. You're cute. You're cute. That witch is cute. That girl over there is cute.' If only there was thesaurus for words like cute that weren't cute. Makes me feel bad for the people of this unnamed land. Tall people must hear about how they're tall all the time.Amazingly people comment on the armor you're wearing being uncomfortable. When you go to the equipment screen I literally have nothing equipped or on. One character says 'Will is an odd name for a girl.' Perhaps he should assume that it is short for Willa. Upon breaking out of prison your companion tells you 'let's get our stuff and get out of here.' When I check my inventory, turns out I have all of my items, but I never had any equipment. Whatever.There are a lot of great character images straight from RPG maker, but what I don't like is how the game forgets to bring up character images for some of the characters.The mapping is dull and uninspiring. Everything looks the same and its carpeted the same if not empty. None of the building interiors have windows. The floor textures and shadows have errors and glitches. Such as a shadow not stretching the entire length of the wall. The fact that a lot of rooms you need to touch the side of a space to exit a room or hallway. I wouldn't mind that if it was marked, but a lot of hallways you just need to touch the end of every hallway to see if its a door or a wall. The prison cells are larger than houses in the game. Those are just visual issues though.I would take screenshots, but hitting F12 makes the game exit. The first cave is just vacant with no detail at all and some RPG Maker games can be incredibly detailed. It really feels like someone's first attempt at making a RPG. I hope some of the money goes to putting unique assets into the game to make this game stand out.The game is really based around doing jobs more than it is about combat or some grand adventure. You'll have jobs and view job postings then go do them. Along the way you'll meet people that complain about the work they're doing. Well this is the perfect time to bring up well I'd be willing to do it for a price. But nope, its just typical RPG banter of people complaining about their job and nothing more. The bland dialog just goes no where. It doesn't even hint at anything. Like oh monsters to the east killed someone or I hear so and so lost their child. One job that rewards you tells you here's your reward, but doesn't give you anything. Everyone else gives you something and it tells you what you get. It just seems like an issue that should have been fixed before the game made it to Steam as a finished product. The chicken hunt job seems pretty glitched. You'll see chickens run through trees and fences. Some jobs are broken such as building benches 'grab some wood and get to work.' Then there is no way to pickup wood. I'm not sure if that's a dirty joke or a joke at you're a girl that can't pickup wood or just a bug. Other jobs you can do over and over again.There is a quest where grandma sends you to get a bottle of wine, did she mean the bottle of wine next to her or the broken bottle of wine upstairs on the floor? On your quest you'll meet a girl that tells you to tell your grandma to give her a recipe, but upon returning to grandma, there's no way to tell her to give the girl the recipe. This is the level of questing this game has to offer. You'll take jobs and complete them in seconds with no effort.The game does well enough explaining the controls and menu, but for keyboards and not 360 controllers. The controller does work with the game quite well and some of us prefer using them.If you buy this game, you'll be a victim alright.			"

												UPDATED after the developer got his friends to bad mouth me for posting a negative review!Avoid this dev at all costs! Look at the forums and Metacritic that point out the abysmal plot, grammar, and story telling. Not only are they unskilled at this, but they are unable to handle criticism. If you sell something to the public, it's got to be good enough to play. This isn't.The point regarding the wine bottle is that no one who speaks English says that! You say 'I want a bottle of wine', not a 'wine bottle'. Do you get it now? English may not be the dev's first language, but if it's sold in English, tough.Original review:Painfully clunky and slow in every aspect. I love RPGs, but the direction and story here are simply terrible. First, your grandmother asks you to pick up a 'wine bottle' from the pub. 'I'll be happy with my wine bottle' she says when you give it to her. Every piece of dialogue is written like this.Secondly, you do a quest for an older gent which involves going into the caves beneath his house. All you're told is 'clear it out'. Random attacks happen, and someone throws down a rope. Going back up moves nothing on, because you were supposed to *jump* up onto a cliff face and chase an imp into a smaller cave. You're not told you can jump, or that the quest is up there - but if you don't do this, you'll not advance with the plot.A witch called Xen storms into town and casually turns your character into a girl. This is the whole plot, from what I can tell. There's no reason for the witch to do this, bar she's taking over villages for no particular reason and boom, gender switch. I realise this game is cheap, and I wanted to enjoy it. However, the woeful writing and storyline make it agony to play, and I'm sorry I bought this in a bundle. Avoid at all costs. If you want a genuinely enchanting RPG with a positive plot, may I recommend Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale? It's charming and enjoyable, with many hidden plot twists and character stories.			"

												I got this in a bundle for $1.69 and hoped I was getting a deal on some under-rated gem of an RPG Maker made game. What I got was mediocrity, half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥dialogue and mapping. And a story about as deep as a kiddie pool. I hate to sound like yet another person shaming or negatively reviewing an RPG Maker game. But even I myself use RPG Maker. A hell of a lot better than whoever made this did.I've purchased several RPG Maker made titles and enjoyed them. I've downloaded free ones off the internet others made and enjoyed them. I played ""Don Miguel's Adventure"" that was a test demo with RPG Maker 2000 and had more fun with it than this. And that wasn't even a full game.This. This was a sad excuse for an RPG, a story and a game.This isn't insulting the developers. This is telling them, they could have tried harder if they wanted to impress someone who could make an equal or better RPG Maker game over a weekend then this game. Step it up and have some devotion.			"

												You know sometimes I have the urge to buy games that I know will almost assurably be bad on whim. I blame this on morbid curiosity, The desire of wanting to find out just how bad  it can get. This game is 10/10, would bad mouth again! It is amazing how this even got on Steam to begin with. I have played freeware rpgmaker games that have far superior art, music and story. They also didn't rip out all of their assests from rpgmaker.  Saying Victim of Xen is mediocre would be giving this rpg too much credit. It does not do anything well...to put it lightly. All the characters are one dimensional with very little depth. The protagonist begins the game as a selfish ***** and ends it on the same note. The story is like a bulletpoint of lets take  as  many of the most cliche and trope heavy things found in JRPGS  and shoehorn them in. A lot of the tropes are introduced in way that comes off as being random, with them often making no sense being there.The worst offenders come off as being downright cringeworthy. Some characters are introduced just to put A trope in then are promptly discarded. Gameplay is very basic with few options, and the music is generic stock RPG maker fare.Stay away unless morbidly curious, especially if you are actually paying for this and did not get it as a gift, or part of A bundle.

												Stock art, boring story, boring characters, boring combat, boring everything.  I will say that the story does get better when you get farther into the game.  But the kind of better I'm talking about, is going from ""horrible"" to ""bad"".There were only two memorable things about this game, and neither of them were good:1) Most of the objects you examine in this game, the decription is just one word saying exactly what it is.  If you examine a bed, it says ""Bed.""  If you examine a bookshelf, it says ""Bookshelf.""  Are you serious?  If you can't think of at least one sentence to describe an object, why have a description for it at all?  2) The joke about NPCs that don't like you walking into their houses was cliched, but somewhat amusing, the first time.  When you repeat it in every other house, it's not funny anymore.			"

												I personally like RPGMaker games a lot. You'd never know what kind of an underrated gem you might discover by trying a new one, whether it be an RPG, an adventure or a puzzle game. Yet, there is a small price of kissing quite so many frogs for the sake of finding a prince. For every game that is remarkable and enjoyable, there are 10 games not so memorable at all. Victim of Xen was one of those frogs. No more, no less.Our hero is a teenage boy who lives in quiet and uneventful Serene Town, with his grandmother. When William isn't forced to either help his grandmother run the little restaurant downstairs, or complete menial jobs around town to take in a coin, he sleeps in as much as possible. That is William's life, or was until the titular witch Xen comes to his village to forcefully recruit town inhabitants to army to support a new war with the neighboring country. A comment of displeasure coming out of William's mouth costs him dearly as Xen randomly turns Will to a girl to make an example out of him and leaves to attend the war with most of the male population of the town. From thereon, William's long and insufferable quest to find Xen and convince her to turn him back to his proper gender begins.As you may have guessed so far, this is an RPG and not a great one at that either. The setting of the world has an interesting enough outline, yet it is not elaborated enough to be interesting as a story. There are roaming figures of importance within the story without much decent background or characterization. Our protagonist is practically one dimensional. There is the menace of a war going on, some shady characters with their political plots running about and the appearance of some villains without decent reasons revealed for their acts; and all that Will ever cares about is fetching his body back. He is a bafflingly shallow character, alongside most of his companions, popping into form a party specifically with him, without well-presented reasons. The game has a basic, absurd humor about it yet it fails to present a charm long. Both narrative and characterization lack gravely nearly about everything. There are interesting nuances and plot hooks scattered around, yet they lack foundation without closely knitted backstory. I completed the game, and I see that there was the promise of a fundamentally good setting presented without much work. With some more lore, some more dialogues - without crude sexual remarks, genuine dialogues presenting inner conflicts - it could have been way better.One doesn't expect miracles from display options in an RPGMaker game, yet at least some customization to sprites or some original character artwork would be nice. The game uses stock sprites and pictures that comes alongside RPGMaker so you've probably seen every one of those figures running around within the game at some point, in a different game. That most certainly breaks immersion if you are familiar with RPGMaker games. The lack of any original music doesn't help either. Maps and environment design are somewhat forlorn with vast spaces without much design arrangement. Recurring styles or items, empty rooms, locked doors; all indicate somewhat of a negligence for the setting.Gameplay is also an issue. Combat system is basic JRPG, yet there are not many combat conditions or skills specific to NPCs to make things interesting. Each of your companions has 3-4 skills that will unlock through leveling but you can mostly force all encounters with bashing attack option if you have decent enough weapons. In that regard, character levels are more or less ineffective too. If you have good weapons, the game is pretty easy. If not, you'll get your♥♥♥♥♥kicked a lot. Grinding money is easy though, if you are to catch an endlessly tedious job near your starting area. Actual quests on the other hand, don't reward well and most of them are not really creative. Some mentioned occurrences are never presented as quests while some actual quests present no opportunity of learning more about their occurrences. Odd.By the ending word, I cannot actually recommend Victim of Xen as it is. With more dialogue to portray character depth and background story to visualize the lore of the realm - and less gender humor, seriously! - I'd happily turn a blind eye to the mediocrity of the gameplay. I wish the developer the best of luck for his forthcoming games, and hope for a major patch for this one as it can really improve a fine substructure.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!

												I picked up the IndieGala ""3rd Friday Special"" bundle on a whim, figuring there had to be at least one or two good games in it. Victim of Xen was one of the games in the bundle, and I figured I'd give it a fair shot. In hindsight, I'm glad I didn't pay full price for the bundle, OR for this game.Victim of Xen tries to present itself as having ""a dynamic story set in a rich world"" where the core of the plot has the protagonist arbitrarily gender-swapped by a witch.In that quest for gender reversal, which took me all of six hours to fully finish, I went through a story line that felt like a scribbled bulleted list on a sticky note. Characters appear quickly, disappear just as quickly, are hardly given development or meaningful context, and engage in stereotypical themes.For example, within two hours you're turned into a woman, thrown halfway around the tiny world map in various areas, sneak aboard a doomed ship, get sold into slavery in a desert labor camp, and so on.RPGs can have awful stories but still be really fun. But VoX fails in this aspect too. The gameplay is so shallow it is non-existant. Battles feel tacked on just to give the ""story"" length, and never feel challenging or rewarding. End-game I was still only getting less than 50 experience per fight I was forced to do.And money? The only good source of cash came from sidequests. One (doing something with wood) was infintely repeatable. 20 minutes of grinding later I had two of the best weapons in the game thanks to a nearby store, and the entirety of the game (Djinn on) was a cake walk. No challenge, no good structure, just poorly designed and implemented gameplay. Heck, the final two bosses took me two rounds each, using the same skills I'd been using since the start of the game.All in all, Victim of Xen feels and plays like amateur's first RPG Maker project. Paying money for this, or playing this for anything more than achievements and cards, is a waste of time. I wasted 6+ of mine to end up with this review; you should do something better.			"

												Horrible game.You have no choice. The writing gets worse and worse. You play a schmuck. And you get constantly berated for being a schmuck.EVERYONE insults you for being a schmuck. And taunts you about it.The combat is not just subpar, it is abominable. You do not get access to magic. All you get is physical attacks (you do eventually get a non-magical healer)There is never a sense of just barely able to beat a fight - you either trounce them breezily, or you get crushed.The only way to win is to not play.

												So far this is a first impression's review, so everything I say here is purely out of the minutes I put in this game, but will update this as soon as I can. Ok, where to start? The menu is very basic, you have your new game, load game, and close game, and this game is only fit to one resolution which that is 480p though the game still looks good in this resolution. Their are no options to edit the settings of this game which is kinda of a dissapointment, and the story itself when you first play the game is not all that impressive. It just throws you in with no backstory. You end up going to an old man's house and defeating a creature while a witch from a kingdom turns you into a girl and your friend a butterfly. No character development is obvious. This is though a very fun game, the combat is refreshing (though they could've added a enemy's hp) as well as open world, classic rpg, turn based strategy game; however so far for this first impression, I can not simply recommend this game.

												Victim of Xen is a short, light-hearted RPG title. It might not be the greatest game ever made, but it's still enjoyable enough to keep you playing until the end. There's not much of a story, although the plot is rather unique (the main character being turned into a girl by a wicked witch, which leads to mildly amusing dialogues and events).While the ending is always the same, the dialogues and events are slightly different depending on your choice (to fight or not to fight a ""bad guy"") later in the game, which I think is a very nice touch.All in all, Victim of Xen shows that there can be a beauty in simplicity and while it's nowhere as good as another RPGmaker title, To the Moon, it's very worth playing, especially if you're looking for a relaxing game to play after a long day.

												Victim of Xen is an RPG game, if I'm not mistaken, made with a basic tool called ""RPG maker VX Ace"" The game starts off average, you wake up in your bed and just walk outside to get some fresh air. There you meet some random grandpa that asks you to go down a hole and then things happens and blabla. Then this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ witch called ""Xen"" comes out of nowhere and starts saying stuff about how your village gotta be ready for a war. Everyone starts complaining but you and your friend are the real ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in the story bad mouthing an hot witch, and your friend is transformed into a butterfly. OK good, ""I learned me lesson pls""So Xen decides to be a♥♥♥♥♥♥and transforms you into a girl. Yup. A gender swap rpg. Its like that abomination of a game ""Gender Bender DNA Twister Extreme"" except this time it's not a visual novel, and you go on a quest to find Xen to fix your body instead of trying to enjoy it.  You then wake up in your bed and your character starts screaming ""AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"". This accompanied with only one sound, which is a clock ticking, makes this the most awkward scene i've ever seen. Now this brings up to the most controversial thing I found about this game.You know when a character speaks and there's their portrait? Well, the Author did not make those.These actually came out from a ressource thread in the RPG maker forums, all made by an artist. This should explain why when a character is shocked, they got that happy smile face glued to them.An evidence of this is a scene in later parts of the game, where you gain access to a castle where Xen is located, and another girl dresses you up for a party. When the new portrait appears after you got dressed, the main character eyes color change from green to purple.The main character first form, which is a boy, and his default one before Xen arrives, is actually a character named ""Ralph"" who came from the RTP resource package in RPG maker. Which the author does not own. Most other character comes from threads made by talented artists.I recommend not buying this game for these reasons:-Linear, no exploration-Gender swapping RPG-No back story-Horrible combat system-Default RPG maker resources			"

												I'll admit that I haven't actually finished the game yet (I'm doubtful I'll actually play that much of this, anyway at the rate I'm going) Still I thought I'd comment on my experiences with it now rather than wait on it till I ever get to the end. I think other reviews have already brought up all the major things with this; it's a rather simplistic style RPG Maker game (to the point that it doesn't quite feel like it was really fully tested; the battle system feels off-balance and really not all that interesting. There are also a few other small details like some text boxes with just regular facesets rather than bust not seeming to have a fixed style that I might feel more forgiving about if this were just a free game, though as can be seen, this clearly isn't)The story also might be the typical old-school linear RPG style but it's extremely confusing at points as to what's going on or even why you have to do certain things. Really, nothing in this game's story is given any explanation (though maybe I'll be surprised when I actually finish) including the whole reason why the witch decided to change your character (named Will, but anyone familiar with RTP names will recognize him as Ralph) to a girl (or the character right next to him in on Actor 1 sheet) which is the cause of the game's high-jinx... among other things (I feel I don't really have the same sense of humor as the game designer as many of the lines caused by the theme being brought up are both sexist and stereotypical)I will say some of the mapping is pretty nicely done, but only some. There's still a few strange mapping errors, especially places that could have used some shift-clicking to look just a bit better (but that again might just be me; I tend to hang out in the mapping thread on the official forums) I can't really recommend it, but I'm not going to say it's the worst I've ever played (strangely I probably have, just usually for free where I can feel a bit more forgiving for errors and tolerant about poor quality; paid products, not so much)			"

												Victim of Xen is an interesting RPGMaker title that could have used some extra polish to make it worthy of recommendation. Most of the ideas on display are strong, but their execution leaves enough to be desired that the experience is nowhere near as good as it should have been. Like most RPGs, you begin your quest as a nobody.  The particular nobody that stars in Victim of Xen is named Will, and shortly after directing Will through an introductory dungeon, things get dangerous. Combat's essentials in Xen are familiar to many other turn-based titles. No-frills physical attacks are the standard method of dealing with enemies, while each character has a gradually-expanding lineup of special moves to use. Every offensive move is physical and has a chance of missing, which can be infuriating when the enemies of Xen are very dodge-prone.    The devil lies in the details, and here they take the form of several quirks. Having most items not be usable in combat makes sense from a strict logical perspective and the few which can be used for replenishing characters in a fight thus become much more important. Wildly varying enemy strength is harder to accept though, particularly when the world map only has three types of enemies and one of them will rip the player to shreds without adequate strength.   Visuals are what the RPGMaker program can produce, though the numerous character artwork samples are very helpful in visualizing what the sprites indicate. A few additional images for regular enemies would have been nice though, since dungeons tend to have one adversary show up all the time. A good number of music tracks are present and vary for each location, but are unmemorable. Victim of Xen is merely a competent JRPG.  Veterans of the genre desperate for a new one should buy it.  But if you’re looking to break into the genre for the first time, maybe start somewhere else.Overall 5/10.			"

*Sigh* 7 Hours. One sitting. And all I got was Gender Bender Quest RPGMaker Edition. It was so ♥♥♥♥ing boring. Now, Victim of Xen isn't too bad of a game, rather it is the apotheosis of the run-of-the-mill collection of RPGMaker games.The story itself kicks off at an admittedly gripping start, because the prospect of a fine gentleman (named Will(iam)) suddenly switching genders as the result of a laid back witch isn't something you'd see everyday. To the game's demise, however, the shock dwindles considerably due to plenty of stark blemishes in the gameplay, which will NOT go without mentioned. As you chase down Xen to, put it simply, smack the ♥♥♥♥♥, you will meet a couple of dashing characters. Unless dashing goes with negative connotation, perhaps I am being too flattering, because the game offers truly uninteresting charcaters with such banal personalities and ideals. No interest will be given to these characters also because no information or backstory about them is given to the player to make them hold any regard for them (You never discover how Will met Zahra, Markus ended up in prison, or how Emery came to be one of the Marki Army), which becomes frustrating when one character mentions a previous event the player has no background of, which happens so very frequently throughout the duration of this game. On the character notion, Victim of Xen is a moderately long game for the RPGM collection, yet the writers failed miserably to blossom any development in the characters other than MC's ""don't be the plaything of fate"" rubbish, let alone any chemistry between them. Instead, the writer(s) decided to make the characters here spit out vexatious one-liners that would make even the most jaded RPG fan cringe. Xen was probably the only one that was enjoyable watching. The nonchalant manner she presented herself in was fun, but very seldom you see her in action, though being in the damn game's name!. Horrible is not quite the word to use for these characters, but they are so mindlessly colorless it will be one of the reasons one brings down the game greatly. The narrative is also brought down by it's sub-par plot pacing. The story that goes in an insane velocity becomes an unmitigated mess after the player's arrival at Opress Castle. Soon after Will is sent to the Oasis because *spoiler*, the story becomes sluggish as molasses and difficult to want to follow as a game people would think would be done in about three hours turns into a 8 hour expedition to ""save the world"". Also the ending sucks gargantuan balls, but it's practially suicide for me to discuss how disappointing it was.Nothing is worse than a game with plodding gameplay, and this is absolutely Victim of Xen's first shortcoming, and this is seen most prominently in the first 2 hours or so of the game. You start off as the only member in your party and a very brittle-boned one at that, so if players don't play their cards diligently they will start smacking their desks in anguish. After Markus, party member #2 enters the stage, battles devolve to ones effortlessly simple, lacking in variety, and easily exploited once you acquire OP weapons as the game progresses. Most players won't need to waste time leveling up once you get possesion of some decent gear, so most of your battles from random encounters will consist of selecting the Escape option in the battle menu. Should you not choose to flee, the oher functions pertaining to the battle system are easily the most uninspired aspect of Victim of Xen. The developer did not even attempt to provide something different than the barebones template of gameplay of Attack-Defend-Item-Focus(Fancy word for Special Attacks, which are also not exciting). There is a reasonable amount of side missions, but most of them are fetch/delivery quests which will drain any entertainment you are garnering from the game at a faster rate.  It works for what it is, but in the abscence of remote substance in story is only rational to think other facets of the game will make-up for it. This is not the case whatsoever, and the game suffers from a dearth of these two crucial necessities as the game doesn't even have one of these things.Functionality is important in a game, the most pivitol criteria at that, but they also need to go further in order to impress players and to warrant the purchase. You get what you pay for with this one. I payed 30 cents for a bundle including this, so that statement has an even more ponderous application for myself. Victim of Xen is akin to gazing at the clouds. Unless one spends time scrutinizing the small stuff until you find something worthwhile, it is just a mess of boring material.			"

												Poorly playtested. Except for the first town they drop you in, there's no real indication of what to do, plenty of dead ends, and bugs in the interface that make the underwhelming writing and plotting even less appealing. I played for about 30 minutes and stopped, who knows, maybe it's an undiscovered gem if you play longer. I did let it run long enough to get the steam cards tho.Couldn't get the controller support to work properly either with x360; it worked OK but not great with the steam controller. Got this as part of a bundle I purchased. It was certainly not the reason I bought the bundle!			"

												Now I have played this game for a good 8 hours I feel like posting a review.Victim of Xen is not for everyone simply because a lot of people do not like the art style. The game does not have voice acting, you must read all speech to understand the story, the story is good so don't worry about that. The game is really cheap so it is at least worth a try. There are different islands where you can travel to, you can only do this when your halfway in the game. The reviews on this game are mixed, so think about it. I'll shall just tell the pros and cons.Pros:- Decent Story- Price- Steam Trading Cars- Controller Support- Missions are not repetitive- Good system of grinding- Achievments- Nice music that fits with the game and current events- Playable on any system- Really friendly developer- You can play this game one-handed with the mouse.- Nice plot- Characters with personalities- Good world- Variation of choices- Gets patched when the game needs a patchCons:- Short- Game does feel incomplete- Grammar errors- Bad combat system, but challenging if not grindingScore 7.5/10			"

												This a decent rpg maker game if you can overlook the fact that uses the engine assets.I enjoyed the story although there isnt alot of choices but it still felt like a nice journey nonetheless. The game isn't grindy and the game felt pretty balanced overall.The game also has some nice quests and secret stuff that was enjoyable to find.In regards to the achievements there are obtained by doing the quests, finding the secret stuff and killing some specific enemies.Overall I recomend the game because I enjoyed playing it.

												Your basic RPG Maker game with all the defaults! The item descriptions are extremely lazy, inspect a bookcase to receive the response, ""Bookcase."", this applies to all objects. The Djinn is a sudden increase in difficulty that completely breaks the flow of the game. No quest log, no journal. At least Victim of Xen stays faithful to the RPGs of the '90s, too bad it couldn't have been left there.			"

The levels were fairly balanced & I spent about ten minutes on a fight trying to win before dying & realizing it was scripted.(Did about 35,000 to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) But luckily the health carried over to the next fight with him & took him out in one hit.

It doesn't discuss anything serious nor is trying to make a political statement, just your average RPG. Gameplay is average and suited towards those who enjoy grinding and spending hours playing RPGs. In short, if you like RPGs and just want a light and fun game to play around with, give Victim of Xen a try.			"

												Victim of Xen is a turn based RPG. The main character, Will, gets changed into a woman and sets out on a journey to find the witch, Xen, that did this to him to return his body. Along the way he teams up with some unlikely characters who are all for helping her... er... him on his quest. Gameplay is pretty standard for the genre. Go to different towns, caves, castles, and towers. Talk to the townsfolk. Fight enemies in random encounters and some set boss battles. Use turn based combat, use healing and regenerative items, cast spells for attacks and buffs, defend, gain experience and gold, learn new abilities, get the best gear you can get. In a word: Adventure. If you've played other traditional RPGs, you'll get this one. It's nice in that it's not too complex. The dialogue is a bit bland sometimes, or just not as funny as you might want, but it does a good job of establishing who characters are and getting you attached to them as a player. So that's cool. It's simple. Nothing too complex to worry about here. The story is easy enough to follow, fighting is boiled down to easy commands, and stats are easy enough to manage. There are even a handful of sidequests you can do to help gain some extra coin and experience without it all coming down to grinding. I like it. It has a somewhat retro, simple feeling that I enjoy in RPGs.I guess the story could use a little more work. It works fine the way it is, and I'm not too big on complex story anyway, but some people might want more out of it, so I could understand some people being a bit underwhelmed by that. There's also a few typos and some bland dialogue in places. Not to mention some locked doors that, as far as I could tell, never become unlocked. I get that realistically there'd be places you wouldn't be able to get into, but it's a game and it made me feel like I was missing something by not being able to access those houses. I guess a little more work to get them to be actual places you could go to wouldn't have hurt, but it was probably done that way on purpose for effect. I think one of the most annoying things in this game is how, once you get to a certain point in some quests, you get blocked from backtracking or exploring. Not always by clever means either. Sometimes you'll try to go back for something you didn't do yet, and then your character will just tell you some line about how you shouldn't. Kind of a lazy way to keep you locked into that section, and it sucks if you were going to buy something before getting moved somewhere else. You can come back later but by then you might have something better or know of something more worthwhile to get and not even want or need to get the thing you initially wanted. Not a huge deal but definitely anooyed me the few times I prematurely stumbled into a quest before searching everything. Also a minor complaint, that you can get past with grinding and good gear, is that early on there are assassins that can take you out in one or two hits. This seems VERY harsh to throw at you randomly. They usually run away unless provoked, but they seems very overpowered for the very first section of the game. Oh, and the controls with the controller were weird and... difficult to change. But they weren't too hard to get used to. You have other methods if you don't like controllers anyway.Still, it's a simple RPG. The kind of RPG that I like. And this was a game I got for free in a bundle. A game I didn't have any desire to play but tried out for the trading cards. It reminded me a bit of playing Phantasy Star. This game turned out to be the best thing in that pack. Victim of Xen only costs 3 bucks! That's a pretty good price for the time and fun you'll get out of it. If you like simple RPGs, or older styled RPG in general, you should pick this game up. It's cheap and a good time. Victim of Xen gets a 7/10 for being a solid RPG for a very good price.			"

												Being transgendered, I came into this game with VERY low expectations. While the game is certainly shallow and lacking in any real creativity, and can be finished in just a few hours, if you want an interesting RPG that won't take a hundred hours to complete you might find Victim of Xen a quick diversion. Yes, the focus on the game is on a boy being ""cursed"" to become a girl and his quest to get turned back. That alone was almost enough for me to turn my back on it, but I'm always open to at least giving it a shot. There's some political intrigue and world saving, but we've seen that already in numerous better (and longer) RPGs. I would certainly not recommend this game at full price, but if you can get it for at least half off it might be worth your time. In short, it's a mediocre title at best and a waste of money at worst.			"

												Victim of Xen, here VoX (I like this!), is an RPG where you play a character that gets transformed in various humans by a witch called Xen.As you may know now, you are one of these victims!You have to find Xen and get your actual body back and find out the truth behind the ongoing war in the kingdom.Here is a little hint on how I started the game:After the first incident with the witch I left the city, walked to the very right side of the island to a small harbor where I accidentally found a lumberjack. You can make money by working there, so I made a couple thousands of dollars and bought in the city close to named harbor a very expensive sword for my character. With this sword you shouldn't have a problem taking down the enemies in front of you for a while (I think the sword costs around 1,500).But, you can try something else and maybe a better way than this one, I mean, I got there due to my curiosity and wanderlust, so go ahead and try this game out yourself!

												This game would be alot better if they game was about 2 to 3 times as long, the best weapon in the game wasn't available from the start, which a easy way to get the money required for it, Probably more comedic genderbending then just the main, enemy balancing, more enemies in general, a way to actually switch party members and not just have 4 guys and if some else joins they are automatically a earthbound Ai party member, an ending that isn't so anticlimatic, and exp gain that isn't so limited because you can pretty much fight the final boss at lvl 11, i honestly thought this game would end with me at atleast lvl 30.  The game as is, i'd give a 5/10 it wasn't horrible, i wish it would've been worked on more, seems like a cool game.			"

												Victim of Xen is a indie rpg game made by Smolders, probably you never heard of them, good for you.The game is about the story of Will a random guy with no personality at all, really, who one day he refuses to follow a royal order from the kingdom of Opress and gets turned into a girl for doing so, and his best friend gets turned into a butterfly, so far so good, now you need to go out there and find her to go back to normal, encountering several friends along the way and some funny dialogues too, but nothing is so easy as you get involved in a war and eventually a battle of epic proportions, trying to recover your male body back (i don't think a guy would actually want to be turned back into a guy after being tranformed into such a cutie female but whatever), funny how he totally forgets about his friend and never ever cares about fixing him.The sound is just copy paste from rpgmaker programs, not really that good but it's something, the npcs and key characters have really nice looking art style although they only have 1 model, what a shame, which makes the whole point of having those pointless since they will have a happy or angry expression no matter what they say.Combat system is really bad, the battle are turn based and your skills are stuff like double hit! , or triple attack!, or Hit hard twice! , not really the skill names but you get my point.Leveling up in this game is kind of pointless, except for unlocking your skills, each character haves a total of 3, which makes having to fight a chore, and the random encounter is too damn high , the npcs aroudn the world sell the best weapons and armors of the game, fairly cheap too.The game also have jobs or side quest if you may call it like building a fence, protecting a caravan, chopping wood, etc, no point on doing these unless you want to buy best weapon in the game during the first hour of the game in order to steamroll.For 3$ i can't recommend this game, it's about 2 to 3 hours of duration but even so the story leaves a lot of plot holes and stuff never fully dealt with so in that aspect you'll be unsatisfied, rpg elements are bad as well, only thing worth it are the dialogues and that's only sometimes.

												Ok, let's start, I most recommend this game JUST when is in sale.You can ask me: well so why are you putting a positive review? I'll tell you why. Victim of Xen is a simple cliche light hearted RPG maker game. The creator of this game know that is full of cliché and that's his intention, to joke about the J-RPG games. To be honest the game is very easy to be ""broken"" so you can defeat every enemy on a easy way what is good and bad depends of what you want on the moment.When I played I just wanted to enjoy a stupid rpg maker game with a funny story and don't have to do much effort to progress on the game, and is exactly this what Victmin of Xen give's to you. This game is the type of game that you play when you literally don't wanna do nothing, but at the same time you don't wanna just lay on your bed doing anything .You just play it to enjoy a simple story and be the hero of the day, and that's cool, you can have a little fun and enjoy the game. But if you prefer a more serious games that requires more effort. And that have a deeper and excelent plot this game isn't for you.			"

												This game would be alot better if they game was about 2 to 3 times as long, the best weapon in the game wasn't available from the start, which a easy way to get the money required for it, Probably more comedic genderbending then just the main, enemy balancing, more enemies in general, a way to actually switch party members and not just have 4 guys and if some else joins they are automatically a earthbound Ai party member, an ending that isn't so anticlimatic, and exp gain that isn't so limited because you can pretty much fight the final boss at lvl 11, i honestly thought this game would end with me at atleast lvl 30.  The game as is, i'd give a 5/10 it wasn't horrible, i wish it would've been worked on more, seems like a cool game.			"

												OK.So.... I see every one hate this game all bad reviews.WHY i dont no.For me the game is very good ,yes it is not the best RPG maker game  i should know i played like 500 of tham ahah :) Very BIG fan !But it is really interesting ,Story is simple yes VERY GOOD ,combat is  like of the most RPG maker games ,just ofc ddifferent spells ,enemies ,food etc ... The world is very nice and cute and interesting  ,many many villages and castles,ruins. etc ... The only negative part is the enemies,they are BRUTAL  strong .In like first 20 min of the game  like fuc.. mouse or a rat will doo like 125 dmg  OMG or so and you have like 300 HP ,and you hit like 35 dmg ... So  you have to run many many times to survive,not like in most other RPG maker games where you can fight everyone,you must be looking for tresure and itams all over to survive and to eat to gain HP Overall : DONT LOOK THE REVIEWS ,PPL DONT NO WHAT ARE THAY SAYING AND DOING. Most ppl played  this tipe of game for the first time,and hade no idea what to do. SO DONT READ THE REVIEWS.If you like RPG maker games ,and you are a BIG fan like me ,you re gona love this game <3  Buy it play it !!! And sry for BAD Eng :p 9/10			"

												It's not worth full price, but it's worth playing.  It definitely feels like a first effort - it's inconsistent what you can interact with, the dialogue is occasionally rough, and there isn't really a good reason for the main character to be turned into a girl.  However, I had fun with it; I would like to see what the creator does once he's gotten more comfortable with the medium.			"

												This game shows the capabilities of an unmodified RPG MAKER VX ACE game would look like, this has very few scripts involved (my game that uses it does not have in game cinematics) this one does have the cinematics. It is no leap foward in terms of game developement. But if you want to see the base capabilities of RPGVXA then play it. Also always get it on sale. Its a barebones RPG with a basic plot. The beginning is a challenge if you dont know where to go (hint: do the job first and quickly). Anyone who has used an RPG Maker before knows the controls.			"

												its an rpgmaker made game, which to be honest , doesnt deserve to be a stand alone game even for $2i only got like a few minutes in and already feel like the story isnt exactly well thought out. maybe it gets interesting later on.music is mediocrei think some of the graphics are from default rpgmaker. would be pretty cool if they made their own though. considering its a stand alone. dialogs are extremely boring and the side characters could at least say something interesting instead of a few words.pretty sure people made better games out of rpgmaker than this though, why are those not on sale yet?i got this game for free from a giveaway im quite thankful for that, but it doesnt change the game is just not that good. really glad i didnt spend any money on this game.if a game from rpgmaker suddenly gets released as a stand alone you'd think that this is some sorta classic gem thats actually worth it to be its own game. turns out its not that good :/update: spent around 3 hours in total. some of the parts in the game has ungodly random encounters. you can walk 5 steps, encounter enemies, then after 5 steps, more enemies. there are some weird npc placements too where you can actually trigger an event at certain places, but if you back out and go to another place that has another event, there will be basically be 2 npcs in the same world and you can trigger them however you wish. im guessing this is to prevent bugs that stops you from going on with the story.even after 3 hours in the characters have BARELY any skills. with most if not all characters just pretty much have attack 2x or 3x for their skill with 1 character occasionally have heals and revs.they could at least put in more instead of hitting enemy x number of times.despite the complaints, i have invested 3 hours in this game and i feel compelled to finish this.

												It is not as bad as people think it is... it has some quirky charms to it and some of the story ideas are not half bad.  The story feels more like someone's table top D&D weekend quest adventure more than anything.  The Games biggest flaw feel like it didn't have any QA or testers to the game, and this makes it feel still like a beta.  It is not like most traditional RPGs. In this one, just do the repeatable quest, get a ton of gold, buy the Knight's Sword for everyone in your party and welcome to easy street.The game is incredibly short, and you will probably be in the range of level 10 to 12 when you finish it. This game is worth if you can find it on sale.=^.,.^=			"

												Victim of Xen is a short, light-hearted RPG title. It might not be the greatest game ever made, but it's still enjoyable enough to keep you playing until the end. There's not much of a story, although the plot is rather unique (the main character being turned into a girl by a wicked witch, which leads to mildly amusing dialogues and events).While the ending is always the same, the dialogues and events are slightly different depending on your choice (to fight or not to fight a ""bad guy"") later in the game, which I think is a very nice touch.All in all, Victim of Xen shows that there can be a beauty in simplicity and while it's nowhere as good as another RPGmaker title, To the Moon, it's very worth playing, especially if you're looking for a relaxing game to play after a long day.

												I finished the game with all achievements, turned up every nook and cranny in the game, it took under 7 hours of gameplay. I literally went around clicking every box, rock, etc. to see if there's an item, I talked with all the NPCs.What do you get:+ An RPG maker styled game. See pictures for how it looks like.+ If you like this type of games, the game will keep you entertained while it lasts.+ You won't get lost. The game will stop you from advancing until you fill your party or explore areas you're supposed to explore.+ At some points, the dialogues made me laugh.What you shouldn't expect:- Game replayability. You can't choose a different character or another story.- Epic storyline. Main character leaves his home weak and emptyhanded in order to beat a witch, who singlehandedly transformed him into another gender. The conclusion of this story is rather cliched.- Basic character levelup system and equip management. No party choices, no spells learning.- Some characters/NPCs were just weird and didn't fit into the story at all. Some characters/NPCs and their motives and/or courses of action were not explained.Even with the named shortcomings, I will recommend playing the game, but I will not recommend buying it.Ask yourself: Do you want to spend 3,- € for just 7 hours of gameplay? I think there are much better choices of games. I got it in a bundle, so If you can get it free, go ahead.			"

												It is really good game actually and really enjoyable, i think many of people are used to good graphics but in here it has good graphics for this kind of game, it was really fun to play but it was missing few elements like leveling up skills but to that aside it had not so bad story but ended too quickly in my opinion, i know many of you won't agree with me but this is my honest review.All above said in short: It's good, it's fun, misses few elements(probaly first game they made) ended little too quickly just when you got really into the game and it's story line. for almost 3eur i would say it's really good compared to other games.If and of you who reads this is famililar with game boy advance emulator games on pc will know what kind of game this is :) Well it took me little more than 6hours to complete the whole game ( constantly playing that is ) also feel free to message me for opinions :)			"

												For an RPGMaker game, it's honestly not bad (I bought it for 50% off when the full price was $7 before it got dropped to $4) and the game has interesting bits here and there. The enemies could use more diversity since some areas have two to three normal enemies and then one overpowered assassin which goes down if you stay there and grind for a bit.The audio is pleasing on the ears. Battle and field music is simple and relaxing to listen to.The story itself could use some work here and there but with a bit of polishing I think the game could be better.In short, the main character is transformed into a girl and has to learn to deal with it as the story progresses along.

												RPGMaker games tend to be polarized in quality, commercial ones doubly so.  I have played some really good and original games.  This is neither original nor all that good.  The plot is simple, the graphics generic, the gameplay is standard, but the world portrayed is abysmal!  This is a ""comedic"" game but it is peppered with sexism, racism, warmongering, slavery, and political ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  I don't know if this was intended as farce or if this truly someone's idea of a joke.  It has its good moments and some decent side stuff, but overall I can not in good taste recommend this.  I mean, if it's on sale and you got some spare change you could go ahead and try it for yourself to kill a couple hours.			"

												I had a lot of fun playing this game. The recent update made the game so much more enjoyable. The best thing by far about this game is the sense of humor. It's rare to see that so well done in games these days. The story was good, the monsters were so annoying! I hate you assassin!  And, for only $3, its worth it.I can't wait for them to release the next game!I had a chance to speak with the developer a bit, but I haven't let that influence my thoughts about the game. There is one thing that Smolders would like for you guys to know. They are open to all your ideas. They love hearing from you all, and they want to grow Victim of Xen with you guys. So be friendly and contact them.I made a let's play of this game if you guys are still on the fence. Check it out on youtube ""nightbagilz""			"

It is no leap foward in terms of game developement. But if you want to see the base capabilities of RPGVXA then play it. Also always get it on sale. Its a barebones RPG with a basic plot. The beginning is a challenge if you dont know where to go (hint: do the job first and quickly). Anyone who has used an RPG Maker before knows the controls.			"

												Victim of Xen, a interesting story, having played a few hours into the game, I can say that those who enjoy Final Fantasy 7 repetative grinding and side quests to earn money will get their money's worth, as for myself, I somewhat regret buying it, a demo would have been good.Also a minor spoiler, the game is very easy to break its pacing by doing the job in Old Dock's by playing the game in windowed mode, moving it to a corner, putting some 20+ minute video on youtube, and doing the get wood, use on bench combo,down, space, up, space - rinse and repeat about 400 times, and you should have some 5000 gold, which is enough to buy the Dragon's Sword in Grayve and a Hero's sword which can oneshot most enemies, and help you a lot against most early to mid-game bosses.I still recommend you grind a couple of levels inbetween bosses as they hit harder and harder, and only having Drinks and Food (both heal 25% Energy or Spirit each) inbetween fight will leave you limited in terms of healing untill you get a healer class in the party.So far, its a decent solid game, but very lacking in terms of interaction with the rest of the world apart from NPC's in the city, having some more chests would not hurt either.Overall. A Solid game, 7/10Story, 6/10 enough to keep you interested, but rather unclear and missleading at times, its hard to separate the good guys from the bad-guys.Gameplay, 8/10 combat is even at early levels, and evens out mid-game, my only complain is that some enemies hit too hard, keeping half your team focused on mending damage rather then causing it.Sounds, 5/10 Basic sound effects, the music is soothing and non-intrusive making it easy to listen to even if somewhat repeative, but not too annoying, I would still recommend playing some of your own choice music in the background, you can turn off the background music by hitting F1 and turning it off. As for sound effects, apart from a few sounds in and out of combat, nothing amazing. Worth the money if you have NOTHING better to play and are looking to kill 2-3 hours of your time over a few weeks.			"

												Well, if I was to be honest, I do kinda like the game. Pretty simple to understand the battle mechanics and you can be OP easily, if you farmed Coins from that carpenter job at Old Docks and you bought the Knight Sword from the beginning at Gryvan, or bought two of them.No Seriously.You WILL become INSANELY OP if you do as I say.As for the story part, quite enjoyable. Much suspense, it made me get the uh-ohs somtimes, especially the old man interrogation part at Gryvan. It was quite hilarious.***The only con that I find the MOST DISTURBING, RIDUCULOUS and DOWN RIGHT ANNOYING, is the Steam Overlay.Everytime I did a task that grants me an achievement, the game crashes. This is a (hell of a) total let down for any Achievement Hunters out there, which includes myself. I really want to get those achievements. But doing so will risk me crashing the game.To sum it up,this game is quite a good and quite your average usual game that was made to past the hours. To be honest, I had this thought to recreate this game as a short anime. Yes, I am that serious. The only problem is that I'm lazy.*ehem*That aside, the combat is just easy and not really that complex. Too simple, not much variation on the Focus skills. It's is just almost the same to all heroes. The story is palpable and enjoyable. Nothing more to say.Final verdict: 8/10*I don't play RPG that much. I can guess that the people that gave the bad reviews must have a vast knowledge of the RPGMaker application, stories, anime, games that are made from the RPGMaker app, other RPG games that are known to the universe, so this review is based on of that inexperience of mine that liked the game at first 30 mins of play. So I'm not professional.That is all I wanted to say actually.***This may be caused of Steam, I guess. This happens only in offline mode. I can't play online all the time, so play this to pass the time, but because of this problem, it really gets the nerve. Every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ time.			"

												This is was made simply to sate the desire on the part of somebody to make a game around the fetish of gender bending and body transformation, with the contrivances of a bare bones, barely thought out plot tossed on to try and disguise the fetishistic nature of what it is.The plot does not exist, the combat is nothing interesting, lacking in anything to make it more than a mere chore, something that must be done to simply continue with the farce of a plot. When something actually story related pops up, it's quickly dealt with in such a manner that it contributes nothing at all while leaving you with more questions than anybody involved in writing wanted to answer. It all calumniates in an ending that is equal parts generic, cliché, dull and ultimately, answers nothing at all. It leaves you with an empty feeling inside.The only reason why anybody has several hours in this game is for the achievements, most of which are based entirely around grinding. Without those, this would barely be a three hour game, if that. There is nothing at all for anybody in this so called game; RPG fans will find the plot shallow, anybody who wants easy achievements will find themselves bored to tears and those with the certain fetishes listed above will likely find themselves not satisfied because it's very watered down to try and appeal to a larger audience.If you're still going to get this, do so when it's on sale, because it's not worth the 3 USD.

												I must say: This game didn't have a very strong first impression, but I did perservere and made it to the end.One big lasting note throughout the length of this game (which taking it generally at a medium pace took me less than six hours, which, is downright laughable for an RPG) is that most of the assets seemed to be taken from RPG Maker. Almost no custom work, but I guess that could be excused if the game had a strong story and RPG assets. Does it?Ehhhh no, not at all... and I'll just break it down.- THE STORY -The story was probably the only thing that made me gather any remote interest in this game. Pretty much the story is about a (knight?) guy named William who basically gets to be in a game of body-juggling. On his mission to rid an imp in some elderly guy's basement he gets in the way of Xen, the witch in the kingdom of Opress. She gets annoyed of his friend and for some reason Xen zaps both of them (I honestly have no idea why, Will didn't taunt Xen in any way) changing Xen into a girl. The meat of the story is thrown in your face throughout the first half of the game: You are a girl and you want to be changed back. There's an underlying story of the war that should be stopped but honestly it's put in the background until the last hour of the game.I don't recall playing RPGs where being a girl generates so much negative attention like in this game though. There are a good percent of people in the game that seem to just make sexist jokes towards you. Either way, most of the storyline is pretty cliche, and I honestly forgot most of it even after playing it. I honestly don't even remember most of your followers' names since they don't really garner any interest. There are people who seem to just get in your way for no reason and some of the plots actually never conclude (like the plot between William and his mother).- THE COMBAT -The combat is pretty bad... just laying that out there. I feel like the combat was just taked on for more length because in a game as short as this one, getting to level 10 is an achievement. Most of your partners share the same attacks so there's no variety. Swords are really the only useful weapons (because the five strongest weapons are SWORDS), and if you get the best piece of armour (for only 500 gold), you win.Oh, and should I mention getting those best swords is so easy it's laughable? You can easily wipe through all the combat with one (I assume) missight if you go to the port town at the BEGINNING of the game, go to the wood shop, do the job there countlessly, and earn infinite gold. To put it clearly, I spent an hour doing the job, and earned enough to give my party the best armour and weapons AN HOUR into the game. This made all the combat pretty much pointless. It's bland enough anyway that I just kept hitting enter throughout most of the game and only lost like two battles.One thing though, is you should get good weapons before going off to Unitem (or whatever it's called) because when you get to Oasis, you either need a lot of gold or strong weapons to defeat a boss on the island. I made the mistake of only getting armour to that point on the first playthrough and I was essentially stuck because there was no way to get better weapons and no way to earn gold. Had to start the game over.Now, I know the majority of this review was negative, but it's honestly hard for me to remember any good points of the game. One good point I guess is that there's a lot of side quests (but they're almost all fetch quests that give you gold) and the dialogue is somewhat passible. Either way, I can list more flaws but I'd just rather play a better game in this genre because it's obviously taking roots from other, much better JRPGs like Final Fantasy or the Zeboyd games.OVERALL RATING: 3/10(If there's anything that I missed, feel free to notify me in any way. Keep in note that I write these reviews immediately after finishing the game.)			"

												I really can't recommend this... (TL;DR below)At first I found the game enjoyable, and I liked the things that set it apart from the glut of RPGMaker games on Steam (specifically, the ""Battle Ready"" mechanic).  Several hours in, though, the game has become a boring slog that I really can't see myself finishing.  After the initial enjoyment was long gone, I still wanted to complete the game (that's how I roll) and ALSO get the last 2 Achievments.  I literally don't think I'll be able to bring myself to load this one up, ever again...The other reviews here have really hit on just about every point I could hope to... but I do want to reiterate just a few points, and bring up a few complaints of my own.1) The writing of this game is just absolutely ABYSSMAL.  In the beginning of the game, it was fine if not inspired, but it becomes abundantly clear they just ran out of steam and had a ""let's get this f*ckin thing finished"" mindset.  It seems the devs wanted ""to make a RPG"" -- NOT that they had a story they wanted to tell.2) The characters are unrelatable at best, and obnoxious at worst.  I'd been playing this game pretty frequently (as my in-game time should demonstrate) up until the last week or so (when it became too much to bare) ... and I *literally* cannot think of but *TWO* of their names aside from Xen herself (Will and Markus -- so inspired!)...3) There are spelling and grammar errors CONSTANTLY.  I wouldn't go so far as to say that a few small errors here and there would ruin the game or anything (hell, even some of the Square classics had 'em) -- but when it's a constant thing it is a HUGE hurdle to immersion.  The script seems to have never been proofread in the least, and the game itself most likely never legitimately play-tested.  The nature of some of the errors leads me to believe the (text file format) script was run through spellcheck and called good... (""you'll FREE to death""?!)4) The title screen -- THE FIRST THING PEOPLE SEE WHEN THEY BOOT UP THE GAME -- is so bland and uninspired I can't wrap my head around it.  It's like... a (stolen?) cropped image of a pseudo-Medieval European cityscape, run through a filter, with ""Victim of Xen"" in plain ol' text in the middle.  This actually didn't occur to me until after I started to realize how totally sh*t the game is.  WHAT DOES THIS TITLE SCREEN HAVE TO DO WITH THE GAME?!  WHY COULD YOU NOT DRAW, *SOME* SORT OF SIMPLISTIC LOGO OR INCLUDE *SOMETHING* WITH *ANY* RELEVANCE TO THE GAME?!  Oh, I know why... because the devs DID NOT CARE about this game at all.  Again... ""get this f*ckin thing done"" mindset is my only answer.5) The world map is tiny, cluttered, and cliche... and does not loop around on itself.  Literally, you get to the edges of the world map and there are invisible walls.  There is no in-game lore explaining any of this, either.6) And, really, there is just NO IN-GAME LORE OR WORLD-BUILDING *AT ALL*.   If the devs don't care, how could expect the players to?I could go on and on, about how the art assets are stolen, most likely the music as well... and how there are MUCH better games on Steam in somewhat similar mold that are FREE... but all of that has been said, and I'd just never finish!So yeah... great job Smolders... you ""made a RPG""... which seems to have been your ONLY goal with this project.  Thankfully these devs have not released anything since... and God willing they WON'T.TL;DR: Go download ""Eternal Senia"" instead if you want a game that uses generic RPGMaker tiles and scavenged art assets.  What's the difference, you ask?  Well.. that game is FREE... and HAS A STORY TO TELL... and IT IS FUN.  FUN is something the developers of ""VOX"" seem to have *entirely* glossed over on their bullet-pointed ""Things To Include In The Game"" list.			"

												This is was made simply to sate the desire on the part of somebody to make a game around the fetish of gender bending and body transformation, with the contrivances of a bare bones, barely thought out plot tossed on to try and disguise the fetishistic nature of what it is.The plot does not exist, the combat is nothing interesting, lacking in anything to make it more than a mere chore, something that must be done to simply continue with the farce of a plot. When something actually story related pops up, it's quickly dealt with in such a manner that it contributes nothing at all while leaving you with more questions than anybody involved in writing wanted to answer. It all calumniates in an ending that is equal parts generic, cliché, dull and ultimately, answers nothing at all. It leaves you with an empty feeling inside.The only reason why anybody has several hours in this game is for the achievements, most of which are based entirely around grinding. Without those, this would barely be a three hour game, if that. There is nothing at all for anybody in this so called game; RPG fans will find the plot shallow, anybody who wants easy achievements will find themselves bored to tears and those with the certain fetishes listed above will likely find themselves not satisfied because it's very watered down to try and appeal to a larger audience.If you're still going to get this, do so when it's on sale, because it's not worth the 3 USD.

												Are you forgot the quest on your remind's book? That's bad, because there's no quest menu in the game.It's a very good specification in gameplay ^=^We've get a good story and spend this time with fun!			"

												Cara, não vim aqui escrever um review do jogo e sim dar minha opnião, amei esse jogo, de verdade mesmo, desde o começo até o fim, o jogo é curto, eu tenho que admitir, mas o jogo é muito, desde os inimigos, as armas, os dialogos, os personagens até o cenário, o sistema de batalha, etcTIve alguns bugs com o jogo e algumas quedas de fps desnecessaria, mas admito que me apaixonei de uma tal forma que se fizerem um Victim of Xen 2 eu irei comprar com toda a certeza ^^100/100			"

												This game is already a low priced game, and I got it on sale, so it was even better for me. It's made off of the RPG Maker engine, and I've gotta say, I'm really impressed with the characters in game, as well as the humor throughout. I've come to enjoy this game much more than I really thought I would, which is a huge plus for me.Lately, I've had a thouroughly difficult time finding interest in a lot of different games out there, so it's nice to find something that I can just sit down and enjoy, and have a laugh or three while doing so.

												The game itself may not be too bad for what it is, but the fact that this an RPG Maker game that uses only STOCK assets made it onto Steam to be commercialy sold is a great enough offense (I only got this in a giveaway bundle) for me to just let it run idly for the cards and let it rot in the junk tab. In that repect this makes Victim of Xen the ""Cosmic Race"" (A early PS1 game that is said to have been made with mostly template/stock files of the console's devkit) of RPGs but with functional gameplay.

												Fairly simple game, and I've enjoyed it so far. It reminds me of SEGA Shining Force in the way it's set up. The only complaint I have is that during battles you do not see your enemy's HP and that's rather unnerving.			"
