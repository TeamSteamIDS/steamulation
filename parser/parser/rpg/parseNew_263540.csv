												This game provides almost everything that I would want from an MMO. However, there are a few downsides. I'll start with the bad first.First off is the Vim System. It is kind of a negative thing for the game, but I can understand why it was put in. Vim is sort of like your crafting stamina, and it unlocks when one of your skills reaches 16. After you hit that point, everything you do when it comes to that specific skill will take up Vim points. Now, they do regenerate over time, but it's like every other game that has energy regeneration: few minutes at a time, and you only get one point back at a time. That wouldn't be so bad if you didn't need mass amounts for quests. The more you craft at a time, the more you use (e.g. one at a time for one Vim, or 50 for 150 Vim.) Gathering only takes one for each click, and sometimes you get three items instead of one, so that's not too bad. The biggest issue with this is that it greatly limits what you can do in the game each day. Sure, there are refills that you can buy (with in game tokens that you can earn, no real money required) and perks that cut down on how much is cut out, but if you don't have enough tokens or those perks yet, things can slow down pretty quickly. There are small ""free"" refills that you can get to drop, like 15 Vim cornucopians, but those aren't very common; there are also big refills, but that requires you to level the skill. If you're running low, and you're only around 10%, you're better off coming back later. The good side of the Vim system, though, is that it DOES slow you down. Without it, you would see level 1s taking up all of the high ranking gathering spots, and people who could actually craft with what's gathered there wouldn't be able to proceed because of the farmers.Second off is the way your skills work. (I'm going to be giving you my point of view, since that's all I really have to work with here.) The good thing about the skill system here is that you have 6 set usable combat skills. The bad thing about the skill system is that you have 6 set usable combat skills. Now, on my priest, that's not too bad; I get a personal heal, a shield I can give to anyone, and the rest are damage spells. However, if I want to be able to heal SOMEONE ELSE, I need to find a piece of gear with that specific skill on it. If I want to keep that skill, I have to keep moving it from gear piece to gear piece, and believe me, that can get expensive pretty quickly, especially if you want to keep A LOT of skills that benefit you. If you have more skills that the free slots cover, you have to either abandon all hope for them, or use special stones to be able to tack as many on as that gear piece or weapon has space for. (You can also earn these in game, but if you're like me, and acquire a lot of pieces with great perks, youre going to run out of them VERY QUICKLY. They aren't exactly common for daily bonuses.) However, this does force you to think about which ones benefit you the most, so no one person can hoarde all of the skills and be insanely overpowered.The third thing that I found to be a little irritating is crafting costs. Now, to craft things, you need to go to a station with all of the materials required (that you gather yourself) and craft whatever your skill allows. Now, a few friends of mine and I have sort of agreed that it's a ""station rent and craft time"" cost, but the higher up you get, the more expensive things get. That's a little annoying counting that I have to gather up all of these insane things to craft it in the first place. The sellback value isn't too great for them, either. The most recent thing I crafted cost me around 15 and a half silver, and it sold for a measly 24 copper. Pretty crappy, right? It feels pretty imbalanced. However, with how much hunting and questing most people do to kill time getting back Vim, I suppose most don't notice.The fourth thing is the party/friend system. This one isn't necessarily a bad thing; it's just more of an annoyance. When adding someone to your friend list, you have to be standing right there with them. There's no ""Add Buddy"" button on the friend menu. You have to track them down and do it yourself. And, while we're talking about the friend list, let me tell you what you can do with your plethora of friends. You can see their name (good, that's needed), their level (also good, I suppose), and if they're online or not(very good; I mean, you can't whisper them if they're not online, right?). Aaaand..that's about it. You can't do anything with them. Can't unbuddy them, can't invite them to a party, nothing really helpful for people who are doing their own thing and then decide to be in a party. You have to do all of that stuff in person. (Well, in character, I guess. You don't have to walk all the way to your buddy's house to do things in game.) Oh, and the party invites work the same as a friend invite. Have to be able to click on them.The last bad thing that I've noticed about this game is how you discover new areas. In most MMOs that provide a means of fast travel (which, by the way, isn't free in this game. It requires travel stones to go from one area to another.), you only have to enter the area to register that it's been discovered. The two exceptions that I've run into are WoW and this game. Like WoW, you have to activate a specific something to be able to travel there. In this case, there are travel pads that you have to run over. You get a free travel stone for discovering it for the first time, and bam. Area is now open for travel. However, that is also the drawback. If you're entering a new area that is just below, at, or just above your level, you had better be methodical about killing everything along the way. Most areas have the travel pad around the middle of the map if there isn't a town there. If you die before you run arcoss it? Better hope you have a resurrection stone. Don't have any left? You get to try again from the start. It's still labaled as ""undiscovered"". Better hope that things haven't started respawning yet.Even through all of the bad, there are a lot of fantastic things that I love about this game.First off, it's free. No pay-to-win here. The only thing that I might recommend paying for is extra storage if you like to hoarde everything. But, even that's not necessary. You get a total of three bags to start off with, a vault (with, I don't remember, 25 or 30 spaces?), and, if you decide to get the free house license, ANOTHER storage vault. So, unless you REALLY like to hoarde EVERYTHING you pick up, you don't need to buy anything with real money.The second thing I love about this game is that there is no limit to what skills you can learn because everyone can learn everything. Want to focus soley on mining and smithing? That's cool. Want to max out just your plant lore? Go ahead. Want to be a master in all things ore, wood, clothing, food, and potions? No one's stopping you! The sky is the limit, as long as you have patience for all of the Vim you're going to be blowing through.Other than that, it's really just your basic, run-of-the-mill MMORPG. There's things to fight, places to discover, quests to complete, and lots of fun to be had. If you're looking for a casual game to play alone or with your friends, this one is one that I recommend wholeheartedly. 9/10			"

												While this is not the worst MMO out there, it certainly isn't one of the best.Here's a Quick Look video of my tragic adventure in this game. All of what I descibed below is in there, though some parts edited for your sanity and bugs in the game. Even though it's long, I'll still call it a quick look since it's an MMO. Feel free to skip around if you want a general idea, or just read the short and dirty summary below.


YouTube™ Video: Villagers and Heroes: Quick Look 

			Views: 11,800		

			Watch Noble of Lost Pause play Villagers and Heroes: Fury of the Stone Lords. Be prepared, my friends. The outlook is not so good.		

I'll start off with saying that the first thing you do in this game is get plopped down in a tiny starter area and get asked to kill wolves. Pretty typical right? Well as I went to fight the most docile wolves apparently terrorizing the town, I got introduced to the combat system. You have to stay perfectly still and click buttons, and I STRESS perfectly still. If you move, you cancel your auto-attack. If you turn slightly, you also cancel your attack. Heck, even if you press the attack again, it cancels the attack and you have to wait for the ability to go off cooldown. If that's what the game is like right from the beginning, I can only dread what it's like late game.But combat really isn't the main focus of this. Crafting and socializing is. So I excused the dated and poor combat system and continued my journey. What I found out was that you can infinitely gather from nodes that require no effort to get to. It didn't even encourage exploration. Not that there was much to explore. You play in linear zones that push you along a path. But hey, maybe the crafting was where this game shined...Boy, was I wrong. It was as basic as the gathering. You click on the recipe, and let the game take care of the rest for you. There wasn't even some sort of minigame to make it more engaging. It was just a droll experience of clicking buttons and farting around.Alright, well perhaps the social part was the point of this. I wanted to try chatting to some peeps, but I rarely encountered another person. And when I did, they were doing the same boring stuff I was doing. But regardless, counting on the community to make your boring game more enjoyable isn't what developers should be hoping for. So it fell flat for me again. Even more when I discovered there wasn't a /dance command. C'mon now? No dancing?But I dredged on. And I found several bugs along the way. Sure, I understand most MMO's have them. The games are so big, it's kind of expected. But I don't think you should be encountering so many in the starting zone, probably the most tested place of them all. Why did my character leap into the water and flop like a fish when I asked him just to fish? Why are there strange black squares following me on the ground everywhere I go? Why is a fenced area full of hens called a sheep plot? Heck, I even had a game breaking bug that kicked me out of the game and corrupted my video footage. But even after all that, I suffered through this game some more to give a better review.Most of the quests. if not all, where simple fetch quests. All you had to do was go to a place sometimes a few feet away to complete them. It's like the quest givers themselves couldn't be arsed to play their own game. The animations are terrible too. Sure, some of the attacks look flashy, but rarely do they actually connect to what you're supposed to be attacking. Walking sideways is the most laughable thing in this game. It was so bad, I actually enjoyed doing it. I even fell off a cliff and my guy was as stiff as a board all the way down. It's just not polished at all.And when I finally reached the last boss of the tutorial, Grimbad the Deadly or something rediculous like that, I just walked right up to him and stared at him. He didn't even attack me. The big bad boss just aimelessly wandered around, looking for a way to escape his cruel fate. That just broke me. There is just no immersion in this game. I couldn't get a feel for it, and the point of MMO's is to lose you in their world, which this game failed miserably at.But after being so negative, I'll list a few positives. I like the jumping flips. You go so damn high when you get a boost from some boots. I like that the game's quest helper tells you exactly what to do, even if it does hold your hand too much by saying where you can get stuff. And, umm, some of the bugs were kind of funny? Eh, I guess that counts as something.So all in all, even if this game is free, I can't recommend it. There are plenty of better MMO's out there, some free as well. Don't waste your time here.			"

												The game should be renamed: Clickers and Heroesor Grinding HeroesAt first glance the game is fairly cute and suitable for children. This is true and a positive thing. But the core gameplay is a brutal GrindAndClickFest with agressive Pay to play concept: even the training missions are about craft 50 items... what means: you sit in the front of the monitor and click in every 3 seconds 50 times. Also, this game is about epic grinding. Really, there are no challenges in the game, the loot and the resources are easy to reach BUT: you have to spend long minutes and hours just to click and click and click on the same spot to have the necessary resources. All the gameplay is about just clicking and waiting, clicking and waiting, clicking and waiting.... while there are mechanics to reduce this tedioum, everything points to the shop. Honesntly, if there would be a reasonable priced monthly fee to eliminate this click fest concept I would gladly pay for it (because I like the world and the relatively simple gameplay, and again the relatively non violent MMO concept). But at it's current state, the game really tries to enforce me to pay with the nasty ""I will make your clicker finger suffer if you dont pay"" method. What I really don't like and I won't bend. Instead of that, I quit game.			"

												People keep saying that the controls feel like a facebook type game and the like.  Well, this game WAS actually on facebook a long time ago.  I played this game a few years back and when I log into facebook, I can still see this game on my list.  While it has improved from it's facebook days somewhat, it's still not up to par.  It is creative in it's own right (Bughunting as a profession!?) and it does offer player housing and growing stuff in your garden and caring for animals.  I do like having some form of simulation aspects in my games.  But it is really clunky, and it has a lot of 'seen that, did it in another mmo!' type of vibe.  It's also not graphically appealing and for the most part I kept the sound off.It's playable and you might get some entertainment out of it, but there is definitely better out there.			"

												This is a nice game, with funhy cartoon-like graphics and a sence of humor. As many others have already commented, it is a next-gen Runescape. So if you are in to Runescape, go ahead and try it.If you don't like Runescape or don't even know what it is, then DON'T try this!Unfortunately, in my opinion, the game is heavily Pay to Play!!From the 35 hours I have on record, the 30 or so were consumed on clicking on trees, mineral nodes and anvils in order to level up crafting skills..And I managed to get them to level 15...I can't imagine how much time it would take me to get to 50...Of course, you can speed up the process by using harvesters, but you have to pay real money to get them! ;)Travel pads (the way to teleport between areas) require travel stones. You get 1 free for every travel pad you discover (I got 7). If you are 3 areas away from the main city, you have to either travel on foot or use teleport..After 4-5 freebies, you HAVE to pay to get Travel Stones..It also has a farmville simulation! Plant. water, collect crops in order to level up your villager skills. At least crops deliver some good in-game cash...There are lots of other examples of situations that you have to pay in order to avoid the EXTREMELY OUTRAGEOUS LONG and TEDIOUS grinding you need to do.

												With the new update to Villagers and Heroes: Reborn, a lot of the annoyances of this title have been removed. The much-hated VIM system has been kicked out, and a lot of new features have been added. If you played this game before, you should definitely retry this game.If you never played this game before, then Villagers and Heroes is a fun MMORPG. Quests, Crafting, Levels, Housing, it's all in the game. There's a lot of maps to explore.Villagers and Heroes: Reborn is made by a small development team, but they delivered an epic update.			"

												This is a fun, interesting and low stress game to play.  I would recommend it for all ages.  There is a concerted effort to diminish overt sexual coustuming and because it's not a PvP type of game, there is a great deal of cooperation and players tend to be helpful rather than competitive.The developers are very responsive, even to individual needs of players.  They also continuously work on improving the game play with better graphics, and more involved story lines.			"

												I don't often write reviews.  However, I thought I should in this case.  If you are looking for something slick with high intensity, this may not be for you.  Combat is slow and a bit tedious. Speed of movement can be slow.  Questing can be repetitive. But what sold me is the community atmospher. I am too old for drama from my entertainment.  There is, so far, no one creating flame wars in chat.  People are just going about their business.  I do this to relax and have a bit of fun.  It is why I like this game.  Zero pressure, and so far no trolls.			"

			Cosmic reviews free to play indie MMO Villagers and Heroes the Fury of the Stone Lord. Enjoy this review? make sure to subscribe!		

Let's talk gameplay, those familiar with traditional MMO's like World of Warcraft will have no trouble in jumping straight into this one. Character creation is simple and straightforward, sadly there’s not much in the way of customization here, just a few sliders with generic options. There are four classes to choose from, Warrior, Wizard, Hunter and Priest. Each offer their unique ability skill trees and are good for their respective combat role.The combat system is somewhat traditional with a few curve balls along the way. You right click an enemy to enter combat and your character will auto attack. Beyond this are your skills and abilities, these are activated by either clicking the hotbar icon or using the corresponding number. You obtain your skills and abilities two ways, first you have a set amount of class abilities that you can unlock and upgrade through levelling. Secondly, the weapons and armour you use will also carry both active skills and passive abilities. This means that if you change your weapon you can end up with different abilities and this can change your play-style to some degree.Questing in the game is very text book MMO, go to quest giver, do quest, hand in and move on. That being said I like how some of the quests tie into the games crafting which I'll go into in a moment. There’s plenty of questing content to go through in villagers and heroes in fact there's over 1000 quests and the storyline of the game plus it's expansion the fury of the stone lord is a fun story to go through.In zones and dungeons on top of your run of the mill enemies and bosses, you also have bounty enemies. Bounty enemy locations show up on your minimap and offer great rewards, even better they are soloable. Meaning you don't have to miss out on the XP, gold and loot that bounties provide. Speaking of loot, there’s plenty to be had and its a well designed system. Loot from enemies will contain gold, animal parts for crafting, weapons, armour and more. Those who enjoyed Diablo 2 will recognise the name Steig Hedlund, Hedlund was the lead designer on the most widely loved Diablo game, he is also the designer of the item, loop drop and crafting system in Villagers and Heroes.In my opinion the crafting system is one of the biggest draws to the game. There are 10 crafting professions: Fishing, Mining, Bug Collecting, Plant Lore, Woodcrafting, Smithing, Cooking, Tailoring, Gardening, and Ranching. Gathering resources is simple and straight forward, simply find a node be it a mining node, fishing spot etc and flesh it out. Nodes also have levels, so as you level your proficiency you'll be able to mine higher level nodes for higher and rarer materials.There’s also Gnomenting with is short for gnomish augmenting, this is the crafting ability to combine crafted gear,elder gear from defeating lair bosses and rare randomly found exotic gear. The developers didn't want to have the most powerful gear exclusive to the end game bosses and wanted to make crafting more meaningful. It allows the player to combine different gear in the way of their choosing. Since about half the spells & abilities come from gear & weapons, this means that some very powerful and unique items can only be created and not looted. The best thing about crafting is not only the amount of things your able to create but how easy and accessible the whole system is. It's easy to use, easy to get into and easy to progress. While the game is not a true sandbox, it has a lot of sandbox features, crafting feels more of a joy than a painful grind. Also due to the fact that crafting is very meaningful, it means that crafting benefits you overall in the game rather than it just being a separate part. Another big draw of the game is the player housing and village system. Once a player purchases a property, they become part of that village. Villages are player created and there are two types, open where anyone can join or guild specific. Player housing itself is very customizable with not only the ability to customize the appearance of your house but the ability to both garden and ranch animals in your own land. It means especially those looking for an immersive experience you can live on your own little farm with crops and animals of your choice.Villages themselves are also not just plots of land, they are upgradable. Villages can be levelled up by members of the Village with better facilities such as a forge and more. Villages can also grow and expand in size by opening up new neighbourhoods providing housing for more players. The developers are planning to push the village feature further in the future by allowing villages to create their own dungeons and having Village vs Village warfare, where by villages plunder each others dungeons for loot, special relics and more.Now as I've mentioned the game is a free to play which means of course there is an in game store. However its certainly far from being pay to win. The contents of the cash shop are simply cosmetic items and items that provide boosts to things such as resource gathering. There’s nothing that could really be considered as pay to win. That being said the cash shop is a little pricey but there’s really nothing you need to progress or get enjoyment from the game, which is a good thing in my opinion.Villagers and Heroes is one of those rare games that sure, it's not perfect and its no big budget MMO but what it is, is a joy to play. Its very rare that I play an MMO and don't feel pressured to be doing anything specific, or to be rushing through content. Villagers and Heroes provides a pleasurable gameplay experience. The way the crafting, player housing and village system is designed, it really promotes a sense of community in the game. Playing with other people to complete village projects and more is fun and a enjoyable experience. It's also a game that may well appeal to the roleplaying community as theres housing, crafting oh and chat bubbles.If your an avid mmo'er who is looking for hardcore PVP or PVE, frankly you won't find it here. However if your looking for an MMO that’s a fun way to spend time playing with people that’s not too demanding on your time and energy then its right up your alley. The game is by no means perfect in any shape but the developers at mad otter have clearly tried to create a community focused game and have crafted the whole thing very well. I would also add that its a mmo that is very accessible to people who haven't played mmo's or are looking for a more relaxed casual experience with a good, helpful community. "

												My wife and I were looking for a free to play online multiplayer game to try out together. There were a few criteria for our search: 1) Both of our machines had to be able to run it (she has an older laptop with a low-end graphics card; 2) It had to be free (not interested in subscription-based MMORPGs); 3) It had to have a 'casual' feel to it so that we could focus enjoying the game rather than trying to figure it out. We sifted through the Steam searches, and came across this one. I've seen Villagers and Heroes decribed as the ""not too smart, but cute love-child of World of Warcraft and Runescape."" After sinking 26 hrs into it, I'd say that description is pretty accurate. It's not a very complex game, but it's a fun game. My wife enjoyed a lot more of the gathering/crafting -type quests, and I was much more interested in the dungeon crawling and boss matches, but we were both able to play through the game together and have a lot of great nights with it. The only CON that I need to add in here is the housing system. We were both really excited to purchase houses in one of the villages of the game, but they just act as inventory space (you can't enter them, customize them, or anything). Furthermore, you need to sign into the game every week to pay your 'rent' to keep the place... and I'm away for work quite often so when I came back after a project, both of our houses (and all of our stuff) was gone. I submitted an in-game ticket for support, but one month later I still haven't received a response. Damn.Oh well, it was still a lot of fun while it lasted. If I get a response back and our stuff is recovered, we may take it back up again.			"

												i have 456 hours, on the StandAloneClient , i've seen this evolve from a webgame to a game that goes on steam and been with this game since it was born... but steam players play 15 minutes and shout : P2W!!!!  . It's not like that .... the game has  great visuals and humor, lots of questlines and skills, nice crafting and overwall  enjoyable systems. about the P2W tho,  let's just say that people are not happy with the fact  how your base energy replenishes.the base energy is called Vim , it is used to craft and gather .  1 vim replenishes in 4 minutes , 1 vim can be used to craft 1 item OR gather something, however you can buy full vim potions that replenishes your vim to the top. Little did the 15 min players know... on daily logins you can pretty easiliy win those potions and you can craft them when you reach certain level cooking. I enjoyed this game  and i still enjoy it. I'd give it 9/10 i would give it a 10 if there was more voiceacting*UPDATE* Gathering no longer takes energy and there is more voice acting now  , they listened to the community and changed it ^^ Also the fact that the devs  are nice makes this game special.They will listen to any request the players want to see  added to the game.In these  hundreds of hours spent here, i can say for 100%, there is no better community, everyone will be welcoming and friendly to you, help you learn the basics and run some bounties (bosses ) with you to help you level up and put you on your path.The path of being either a villager, or a hero.

												I'll be frank: combat is just bland. It's not bad, not by any length, but there simply is no nuance. You click a mob, press some hotkeys and loot falls out of said mob. Luckily, this game isn't about combat. So far, I'm having a blast with the amount of options presented to me. I can mine ore and make it into ingots ('pigs' in-game) and trade them to my neighbour for some of his or her fine produce they harvested from their garden. I can become a tailor and create garments from the loot drops my more combat-oriented village-mates receive. Oh yes, there is a housing system; you join a village and contribute to the betterment of everyone while also gaining materials and xp. A good example would be Runescape's Clan Citadel system, except the materials you gather go to you and you decide whether it goes back into building the village.Overall, the game is a fun little timewaster played with friends. Graphics are so-so for an MMO, NPCs greet you in different voiced languages (yay Slovak) and there are plenty of kill-list quests. I recommend turning off click to move - you'll figure out why when you play.			"

												Villagers and Heroes us a Hidden gem in a sea of Free to play games. Dont be put off by the tutorial this game try's to introduce to you slowly its features and soon you will be chasing bounties or delving into its massive crafting system (a full 70 levels for each profession and gather) The world is truly Huge, 500 hours in and I have not seen all of it yet.One of the biggest things about this game thet makes it different from the sea of other Free to plays out there is that its crafting system is fully intergerated into the combat system, crafting isnt something just tacked on its a major part of the game system and this isnt truly noticable until much later into the game when you start to look at ability scores and stats and greater detail.I have also been quite surprised by the sheer amount of Adult players in this game, most people I meet are 20+One of the major letdowns has been the steam crashes, but the devlopers have been working very hard and getting as much informtaion from the community as they can while keeping us updated (which as you know is very rare in this day and age) I look foward to the very bright future of this game.

												This game begins with the designing your character - choose wisely, there is no going back on the customisation unless you are willing to pay real money for it.The talents and skills you choose to start off with gives you a head start in those areas, but they can be changed as you progress or by using a potion. The choice of house style is far more important as changing house style cost gold, which you'll earn by killing monsters and doing quests. Each style has its own variations and each variation has its own perk, so plan ahead what perk you want for your character. Choose the style in accordance to the perk you want, even if the variation with that particular perk is not available when you start off. You can always buy the variation you want as soon as you have placed your house. Changing one house styles to another cost a lot of gold (120 gold) though, so it's better to choose the right style to begin with and then just buy extra variations to that style, which is cheaper (30-90 gold).This game does not deserve the bad cred it's gotten. It is constantly being improved on. There is lots of people playing it (based upon playing the EU server) and the community is really friendly and helpful. You can play it on your own but it's a lot more rewarding and fun being a part of a guild.That you can use real money in the game is not blatantly obvious. It is a fully functioning game for free. Would you like to customise you're character a bit more though, you can visit the shop and buy extra stuff with real money.			"

My take on Villagers and HeroesPros:Lots of crafting to doYou can find all the materials you need in the worldLack of Vim or energy system (removed in past patch. I saw this was a major reason for negative reviews in the past)ConsGets boring as you go further inLack of motivation to continue with lack-luster storylineAuction House is empty, I would never be able to make money off of how the player economy is in its current stateEmpty feeling communityMany bugsFurther Examination and Review    I have to say, I had some hopes for this game. I've always loved mmos that carry a heavy focus on PVE rather than PVP. When I saw this had a dynamic crafting system, I was quite pleased. I've played Runescape and several other rpg mmos that mimicked the style of Runescape over the years, I figured I would  give this one a shot and see how it hold up. And it did not.    The first thing that caught my attention had to be the lack of ambition this game gave me. In games like Runescape, I was always working towards a specific, achievable goal. I saw all the cool things you could do with construction downt he line, so my goal was to level construction. I saw all of the sick skill capes people earned through their hard work, I figured I could maybe try for one as well! In Villagers and Heroes.... Not so much. I mean even RPGMO had some interesting skills that made you wanted to level and achieve even with the old-school graphics and lack of aniamtions. Villagers and Heroes led me on a wild goose chase throughout the internet to find out what I could do with say, smithing or mining? Is mining a good source of income on the player market? Do I get cool capes or titles or SOMETHING from achieving the highest level? Why should I sit here and grind all day if nothing will come of it?   The second thing that caught my attention was the stale and empty ""Auction House"". This is supposed to operate much like any other player market in any standard mmo. For example in the Grand Exchange in Runescape, the economy was always bustling. The demand of the market flowed naturally in a way I was able to take advantage of and profit from. It was fullfilling to find out new ways of making money. In Villagers and Heroes, however, there were several things on the market one could purchase, but rarely anything people were willin to buy. I found it fairly difficult to find demand fro any of the materials I had wanted to sell.   Lastly, the community seems pretty dead. There are only a few people on at a time it seems. The villages seems pretty empty, which is a shame because I though that player owned villages was a cool a neat Idea. I wanted to join one, but could find none that were active! I think a lot of this game's woes stems from this huge problem, but I can't say I blame people for wanting to stay away from the game. This game has a Vim or energy system in the past, that made it so that players could only do so many gathering actions a day (correct me if I am wrong). After something like that is implemented, I could imagine many people moving on to better organized mmos! I just feel that after the beginning fiasco of this game, it will be hard for it to recover.  I also wanted to mention the amount of bugs I experienced over the first hour of gameplay. I had a few visual bugs that I blamed on my own system. But then I started getting bugs that compeltely strained gamelay for me. For instance, I would go to talk to an NPC, only to have to wait a minute for the bubble to pop up. Sometimes quests would not be fullfilled even after I turned them in, and I would have to do them all over again. This happened specifically with the tailoring master during the first crafting quest. this really bogged down my gameplay.  Overall, I had a pretty ""meh"" experience. It left me wanting something more from it, it made me miss Runescape more than anything because of how unsatisfied I was. the community is slow to grow, if anything at all, and it severely impacts things like player economy, villages, guilds, and other aspects of the game. It doesn't seem like people are going to go back to this game for a while after some decisions made by the developers in the past that pushed a lot of people away. If it does recover and become and interesting game to play, I will most certainly change my review. However, in its current state, I cannot recommend it over other veteran games that have conquered the PVE style for decades like World of Warcraft or Runescape[//i]. "

												The people who complained about bad customer support and pay 2 win, have obviously not played the game very long or gotten into it.The staff, devs, and mods of VH are top notch. Have a question about something? Ask in world chat. If no one responds or doesn't know, make a post on the forums. Mad Otter is very relieant on the community so opinions and bug reports and the such are taken into consideration and worked on being fixed. The devs want and need it, to help improve things and appeal to the community. Customer Support is very accommodating and will usually 99% of the time be able to help you out; again, if you don't recieve a response within a day or so, notify a mod or post on the forums and they'll contact a dev to get on it. The game is def not pay 2 win. They've removed several things from the item shop (including buying gold) that made it seem that way. Ya, there are some items in there that can make the game easier, but it is still possible to play fine without them. If you watch the forums, there are often events that go on, and you can win crowns or item shop prizes from those. The game also doesn't have pvp, so its not like you're going up against other people. Additionally, this prevents a bunch of bratty kids from wanting to play, so the game is pretty peaceful and friendly. The community is a huge part of the game too. The game is family friendly, so you do not get people flamming others and yelling profanities at everyone just for the heck of it. It also means that the game is not sexualized like so many other games. Male and female gear are basically the same models, so you dont get the huge difference of the females basically being naked and the males completely covered up when wearing the same piece of gear.

												Nice game, (too nice maybe?) Fun enough pve, great gather and craft sys, amazing outstanding friendly af community. No pvp though. If you are looking for a fun family oriented game go for it, it is a great escape from the frenetic toxic hardcore pvp from most online games. If i had kid now this would be their first mmo for sure. The only reason Im no longer playing is because I miss the adrenaline from the high competitive hate-fueled toxic pvp mmos. Great game though			"

												I was interested in Villagers & Heroes because of the emphasis on crafting and collecting. Unfortunately, I was ready to uninstall it pretty fast.""Accomplishing"" something in this game, whether it's tailoring, bug collecting, or combat, has no mental involvement whatsoever. I didn't have to think or plan or even look around for new spots as I foraged. Villagers & Heroes is essentially a mindless clicker game in MMO format, and the uncanny graphics and stale game mechanics don't help either. I wouldn't recommend Villagers & Heroes to anyone who values their gaming time.			"

												This game is horrible... I am not sure why people are reviewing it so well, the controls are not good the spawn rates suck the game is just not thought out or implemented well.   Even on the first boss if there are five people waiting to get the quest and all five people attack and kill the boss together only one person gets the quest, that means the other four must wait and go through it again each spawn only one person getting the quest...  It is really stupid.			"

												I enjoy this game, beacuase I like crafting and farming. If you don't like that, you'll probably not enjoy it as much as I do.My only complaint is the skills are a bit delayed, and the graphics a bit outdated. But other than that, the idea is pretty cool :)I Actually choose this over Archage. Call me weird, but I didn't like the ""pay to have fun farming"" concept in that game :p			"

												A few things to note first, I am an extremely old school mmo player, I started with Ultima Online and played various graphical muds before then, I also played old text based muds like Achaea and before then I played bbs door games like Usurper and LORD.  I tend to play a lot of games and rarely stick to one specific game at a time so do not look at my 600 hours of gameplay lightly.That being said I am a very niche player as well, if you look at my steam history I've played everything from TERA to Wurm.  I've played things like Eve and I even backed War Z when it came out.  I own terrible abandonware titles like Towns and Starforge.  I haven't played everything out there but I've played a lot.Villagers and Heroes released on Steam just over two years ago, it was a semi-unique title with some really fun concepts that definitely piqued my interest, the gathering system was fairly in depth for the type of game it was and the crafting was pretty standard but well done.  The biggest flaw the game had was the energy system that was renamed 'Vim'.  About a year ago the developers listened to the playerbase and removed the system though, which really means a lot.  The idea that you have developers who can improve their game over time without making the older playerbase quit is a pretty huge feat.One of the biggest advantages Villagers and Heroes has is the developer is an industry veteran, he used to own the company Dynamix making games like Stellar 7 way back in the 80s.  One of my favourite flight sims, Red Baron, was made by him as well.  Villagers and Heroes is also not the original name either, this game used to be a browser game called A Mystical Land, so the idea that he's really kept this title alive by bringing it to new platforms like Steam means he's willing to keep up with the times and make sure this title never dies.Two years ago when this game released on Steam the new playerbase from Steam made a ton of suggestions and the developer actually listened and improved the game, he removed a lot of the original features that made players feel like it was pay to win because he knows that if you are happy with his title you'll spend money on it anyways, trying to milk players for money is not the way to go.On October 25th (in three days from now) this game will be released worldwide on Android devices (it's currently avaiable in some areas but not all) which really should prove this is a team that is keeping up with the times.  Sadly you cannot use your Steam account on Android (since an account created with Steam is bound to an agreement with Valve) but this game is now cross-platform to mobile devices and when it shows up on the Play store for NA you will see a huge influx of players. At the moment there are only a few games that are cross-platform between mobile and PC and I do beleive there are only two on Steam, AdventureQuest 3D and this game, so there isn't much competition in this market.  Albion Online is probably the best cross-platform game right now but it is primarily focused around PvP while Villagers and Heroes is focused solely on PvE.  AdventureQuest 3D is a new title, it doesn't have a lot of content, the crafting is clunky and it has absolutely no gathering mechanics as of yet.  Player owned housing and guild terratories exist in VnH, they do not exist in AQ3D yet.  The maps in AQ3D are also quite small and really doesn't feel as open-world as VnH feels.With all this being sad though, VnH isn't going to be like World of Warcraft, it's a far more casual style mmo and the mechanics are fairly simple, but it still has plenty of depth to keep a more hardcore gamer like myself interested.If you check out the title on steamcharts ( http://steamcharts.com/app/263540 ) you will notice that it had 2,898 peak players on steam launch and still retained 555 peak concurrent users after 1 month, that's about a 20% retention rate, keep in mind though that the majority of players play using the website client and won't be tracked on steamcharts.  After three months it still had 431 peak concurrent users, which is a really nice retention rate for a F2P title on steam.  After one year (April 2015) it had 163 peak concurrent users which isn't amazing but you'll notice this number actually increased when they revamped the game and removed a few negative features like Vim.I really can't stress enough though that the majority of players use the official website client so they aren't tracked by steamcharts sadly, so just look at these figures as a general guideline of the health of the game.  The fact that the playerbase on steam has slowly been increasing over the last few months should be a good indicator of the current health of the game leading up to the worldwide mobile release.If you are looking for a simple game that has guild territory, player own housing, farming, ranching, a good selection of gathering and crafting skills as well as a combat and progression system that is more focused on boss kills over grinding small mobs then you should really look at this title.  If you have children (or in my case a girlfriend) who you would like to play with but you do not have multiple computers then you should take a look at this title.  If you want to play this title on PC and then switch to your android tablet or phone while your out of the house then take a look at this title. (just remember your steam account is locked to PC only so you will need to download the official website client ( http://www.villagersandheroes.com/play-game/?signup=1#aSignUpForm ) to play your PC account on either PC or mobile)It's a very niche title and you will either love or hate it so you might as well give it a shot.

												I love playing this game.  I waited several months before reviewing to make sure I get the full experience.Firstly, the game is always changing.  I'm not even talking about different lvls and such.  The developers really listen to suggestions to make the game better and they do make fixes to go along with those requests.  As far as lvls go, there are plenty of bounties/maps/monsters to kill at each lvl.I do love how you can either play solo (with the occasional group for harder bosses) or join a guild, you don't have to do either.If anyone says it's pay to win, it's not.  It's easier if you pay for certian, but you can do it without spending a penny.			"

												For anyone that has any experience in playing video games or especially MMOs, I do not recommend this game.  Graphics:  The photos  look much better than this game actually looks in game.  For the most part it is large empty spaces without much in the way of adventure.  The coloring is very cartoonish with little to no texturing.Story/Quest Lines:  The story can be rather humorous, however the generic grinding system leaves one rather bored.  Combat can be really buggy.  Mobs sometimes don't aggro immediately.  When ignoring mobs and running away, they will eventually drop aggro but will suddenly come back.  Mobs will sometimes randomly respawn immediately after killing them.  While testing out the archer my auto attack would randomly just stop and I'd have to attack, again to get it working.  Very buggy.Crafting System:  The crafting and gathering is even more boring, as one can pick from the same tree until you have all of the materials that tree or resource supplies that is needed.  If you are of the younger generation of gamers and have little to no experience with MMORPGs, this would be great for beginners.  Possibly recommended for children (maybe 8 and under) - not recommended for pre-teen to adult.			"

Also didn't feel lonely as i ran into players everywhere. Not a bad game and the music in it is so relaxing.

Original Review:Man, had my characters not get reset from previous stages of the game (like back in the days when it was ""A Mystical Land"" and not Villagers and Heroes), I honestly would've never stopped playing. It was the only reason I left the game in the first place. I lost all of my items, my characters, as well as my friends that I used to group up with to farm bosses with (I powerleveled with them like CRAZY). After the first reset, I tried to get back into the game. I just couldn't. It was like getting sick from your favorite diner. I just couldn't go back to it. Until now.Today, on September 18th of 2016, after numerous years, I've finally decided to get back into the game and try it again. No, my characters were not brought back, BUT my enjoyment of the game was. There wasn't many people on at the time I was, but those that were on were relatively friendly, just like the people I played with back in 2011. Aside from the people, the graphics were improved by a LOT (not to the point where they're like Crysis 3 graphics, but to a more vibrant and colorful point than once before), the lore of the game has been extended and is a bit more intriguing, there's a ton more items, there's now player housing, mounts, and even more than what I had mentioned.Will I be getting back into this game? When I get more free time on my hands, absolutely.Do I recommend the game to others? YES! Bring friends with you! The more people you have with you, the more fun the game is! If you wanna play with me sometime, please don't hesitate to add me as a friend and message me!To wrap things up, I just want to say that I'm glad I revisited this game after so many years of avoiding it. Coming back to it now after so long just feels great. Hopefully soon I'll be back to where I was before my characters were all reset.Updated Review:After about 50 hours of gameplay JUST this week, I am truly glad that I decided to come back to the game a few years later. I've made a few friends including both regular people on the game and a few Mods that happened to be on the same time that I was. Everyone I've met so far in-game has been extremely welcoming and helpful, and overall have given me a reason to stay with the game. Besides the people in the game, the game itself is amazingly fun! Since they removed that dreaded Vim system, mining and smithing have become my favorite things to do in-game (other than going to the Equinox event zone and killing those Pharaohs; I got a pair of wings on my first kill!). Of course venturing out and questing is fun too, but I personally enjoy mining a bunch. I just find it to be so easy yet still pretty enjoyable. As a whole though, this game is very fun, and I completely recommend anyone to give the game a try. The negative reviews were from when the game had a Vim system (which limited how much you could gather ingredients after you reached lv15 in a given skill) and from people who literally spent about 10 minutes playing the game. I don't know about you, but I'd listen to someone who has logged 50+ hours on a game over someone who has less than an hour logged on a game.Anyhow, I'm gonna go ahead and hop back into the game and maybe kill some more Pharaohs or something. Hopefully I'll see you in-game eventually. :)			"

												A few days ago this game came out, with the name Villagers and Heroes. It's an RPG with some elements and technics which can't be found in many games. Well the controls aren't great, but it's not a problem. There are many great things to see. The graphics are beautifully animated, and it looks like a cartoon. The shaders aren't bad as well. But let's speak about the gameplay...There are 4 classes: Warrior, Mage, Hunter and Priest, and they have they'r own unique skills. You can craft things, from materials which you need to gather, and the crafted items are better than those you find sometimes.Theres even a portal to Villages, where you can buy a house. Theres a limited number of plots in a village, but it's awesome. You can design your house the way you want, and you can make a farm behind it. A house costs 20 Crowns, (Crowns can be bought with real money, 20 Crowns = 1,46 Euros i think) but it's worth it. In a village you can find every material.Now about the gathering and the crafting system...  There are lots of crafting and gathering activities, and each of them has it's own level. So if you mine ores, you get 100XP if you find some, and for some XP you get lvl-ed up, and you may get better ores.I think this game is pretty awesome, it has some bugs, but it's a new game, updates will come and it will be better. I would give a 7/10 for this, and not because the graphics, it's the game itself. (Graphics can't make a game awesome, only a bit better, it's the gameplay, and the mechanics what a game needs)Forgot to mention i played hundreds of MMOs which are more worse, so give it a try!			"

												I've played Villagers and Heroes for just over an hour so far. Based on first impressions, I think I can safely affirm that this is a fine free to play game. While the aesthetics of the art style remind be of a classic Disney animated film (and, in my humble opinion, this is NOT a negative), I find it very pleasing to the eye. The game performs admirably on my gaming laptop, and I have had no major issues.The gameplay, while mirrioring that of most MMORPGs, doesn't yet feel repetative (of course, my opinion on that may well change as I play more). I find it fun, engaging, and interesting. Talents are easy to use, but vary enough to keep me interested, in and out of combat.I don't intend for this to be a long review, so, in conclusion, I will say that if you are looking for a fun, engaging, and pleasing free to play RPG, then I believe that Villagers and Heroes could be for you. I highly recommend it to anyone new to the genre, or even a seasoned veteran. "

												This game looked so promising to me. a dedicated crafter in MMOs, BUT. I do not mind how silly it looks, what i do mind was that (when i played it) it bug ridden, boring generic MMO. It even looked that several of its features were broken, like inability to move combat, or cliping through well most of things, total inability to make party stay in the same instance (on each portal ""loading"" we were just dispersed among different instances). Based on my experience i cannot recommend trying tris even if its F2P, you are just wasting time downloading this, ehm abomination. As TB would said ""Avoid like plague"".			"

												I play this game because I like it, I have played this game for over 3 years and I still look forward to updates. The thing I loved right off is the simplicity, the easy going feeling you get while playing, the easy controls. I hate complicated controls, I detest the games that constantly tell you...""Go here now, do this now"". I never want to see the inside of another PVP game in my life! There is no pressure in this game to do anything, you can stand still and watch, chat, look at stuff or you can actively quest or bounty. You compete against yourself! You don't have to prove anything or fight anyone. I am hoping that people reading the negative reviews (and even video's) posted by people who never even went past the introductory or the tutorial sections but still posted negative reviews will at least try the game and decide for yourself. Please do not be swayed by what other gamers feel and blindly follow someone elses lead. This game is most definetly not a hardcore game. It's not a kill each other and your friends, race to be the top dog, the first and the best. It's meant to enjoy by yourself or by you and your friends both old and new. The community is really great! The players are a wonderful group of people from all over the world, both young and old. I also love that this game was built showing respect to all players and to women especially. It's not filled with bubble-headed bimbo's, scantily clad in what they called armor, but I call disappointing scraps. Some of the very reasons the ""hardcore gamers"" post they do not like about this game are some of the very reasons I do like it! So instead of letting someone else tell you how to feel about the game, how about trying it for yourself?			"

												Wow.. Just Wow.... When I first seen it in the store I was like.. Ha... Not even worth a minute of my time. But I've been looking for an MMO and I figured... WHY NOT its only like 800MB... Downloaded in minutes and was up and ready to play. Now I will say this, the game crashes to desktop a little more often the I would like, The graphics even on absolute max are not anywhere near the greatest, and yes, in my personal opinion it IS pay to win (Pay to advance rather). But just after giving this game a little over an hour of my time I suddenly found myself in love with the atmosphere, they did fairytale style MMO just freaking perfect. From some of the beast's to classes, to crafting. It's also a strong plus that all the NPC's say something in Germen... Lol... Funny little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s... But anyways, The game Had my heart and soon after that hour I was drudging on 9. I Wasted my entire DAY on this game... and I ENJOYED IT... All in all, for someone looking for something to just let out their inner child, get lost in a fairytale and enjoy a great little game that doesnt have people spamming up the chat with bots or gold farming services, then this is it. This is freaking it... I hope you enjoy the game as much as I do. And if you feel like joining me on a quest or would like to just jump in and forage some mushrooms with me then thats cool too... cause you can do that....  Then jump into the US2 Server, send a PM to ""Huntz"" I'll probably be on.			"

												While the game is cute to a point. It is boring. The game is grindy. It is Cash Shop Greedy and much of the game to make it fun is Cash Shop dependent. I play EOS, spend money in EOS. Because EOS does not sell stuff that the game depends on. This game is a click fest also. I came back to it and found it no better and my houses gone (You have to pay rent). I bought a dlc and it seems a one time use. Delete a character and it is gone. Too Cash Shop greedy and dependentClick fest.GrindyAnd for me simply one of the worst MMOs I have played (I have played other F2Ps). "

												First of all, the biggest positive of this game is the fact that it does not try to sell itself with nudity or gore. (As is the case in these times!) The setting and graphics are calming and charming. It is a relaxing game. Crafting and gathering are plain but interesting. Because there are many random drops and it urges you to try gathering ""one more time"" and ""one more time"". Combat is the weak side of this game. But the devs are saying that they will improve it and get rid of the ""stay still to attack"" feature. Social options are enough. There are many friendly people. Maybe PvP should be introduced properly as well. IT is a big MUST.Quests are typical MMO quests. Humor is nice. There is no voice-over, but that is not something strictly needed from a MMO after all. And F2P too.Currently it has many bugs and glitches and the servers lag. If i think these would persist, i would hate this game. But i hope they will fix those issues. Then it will be a perfect game.If you have children, or siblings, or friends, gather them and play this game together. Partying makes it much more fun and better. You can play with your children safely as there is nothing explicit. I would like to thanks to the developers for they opted to make something unique in the F2P mmo genre. I hope the game will be improved a lot, and become fantastic!			"

												just played a little bit. at first i was all like ""holy clap man it almost plays just as good as WOW!!"" but when i went deeper within the city it got so laggy, like 25fps. even though on most games like bf3-4 i get 40-120fps. specs: dell optiplex 760, intel core 2 quad q9300 2.5ghz, 6gb ram ddr2, zotac geforce gtx 750 ti 2gb gddr5, windows 7 home premium 64-bit, 500gb ssd seagate, antec 450 watt. i was only able to fit a gt 740 gddr5 edition and my current 750 ti version into this desktop, very odd fit. google it >:) but i liked the game and all but had some lag issues, the kind of issues that require a 4gb gddr5 to get smooth fps. my setup is able to handle most games like the forest maxed out with good fps and bf series medium settings. all 1680x1050. pretty damn good setup, but apperently not good enough for this lag trap lol update: i have found out why it lagged so much for me and i have freed up about 6fps roughly and is better around crouded areas like big towns. go to the folder path ""villagersandheroes/ AMysticalLandAppDataDev/ test.game/ client. theres is a folder in there called ""prefs.cs"". open with note pad and search ""threadcount"" it is set to 2, switch it to your core count :3 like mine 4 for four cores. little better for massive proccesing. hope that helps with lag for most peeps like how i was lol			"

												Hi there! I have to say that I recommend this game, especially for people that are looknig for a relaxed and low pressure game  supported by a great community.I have a history of enjoying sandbox games that have a high crafting content.  This game doesn't disappoint.  The crafting materials are detailed and diverse, though it does take dedication to progress high in the levels.  Each crafting class will helpe the others, so leveling them all is beneficial, though not necessary.The action aspect is the least exciting to me, though also reflects what I""m least interested in. I've only been playing since the ""reborn"" reset of sorts, and there have been some lag and other bugs that have needed working on.  As far as I can tell , the staff is hard at work ironing out all the bugs.  There are not a huge variety of adventure classes to choose from, but what there is is very customiziable, which I appreciate.Most of all, I have come to really appreciate the community.  The players, especially the longtime players, are committed to helping newer players get their bearings and learn the game.  Everyone can contribute to help community goals, especially building of newer villages, even if you are lower level.  I've asked a lot of ""newbie"" questions and always received very helpful advice.  I have played a lot of mmo games out there, and I find that it is always the community of players that distinguishes games.  This game has a great community base, and I look forward to spending more time playing it.If you are looking for a fast, bust through and win game, this might not be for you. But if you are looking for a nice place to settle down more casually, get to meet some new friends, and learn and have fun at your own pace, I would highly recommend giving this game a try.  Stick with it if you try it soon, give the dev's a chance to iron out the new bugs, I think this game is going somewhere great. Best of all, you do NOT have to spend money to succeed!!  What a nice change.			"

Look me up in game if you need a hand with anything! tubadave is the name!The game is free to play, has a well developed and fun crafting system and many well written and witty quests. The combat has great effects, the world is 3D and very immersive.Please note, there is no PvP, so if that is what you are seeking, then I think you best stay in TF2!			"

												Good craft, decent graphics, clever management and stories, large action freedom. People who made this game have thought a lot. And yes, it is non violent and non sexist, with classic music ambience :)Really, you will enjoy to play this game if you're not PVP adicted and if you seek a  smart and no-grinding craft game.And it is free, try it.Nota : at level 16 in crafting/gathering you will be granted of an energy (VIM) bar : the famous action bar of many facebook-like games.  If you're a full time gamer, you will quickly solve that problem : you will create another or two other character specialized in a few skills. While one is refilling his energy bar for woodcrafting or tailoring the other is exploring maps and emptying his energy bar gathering. There are other ways to gain VIM : gardening, events, management of your leveling, tokens in Gorge; etcIf you're lazzy or have few free time , you could simply spend all your vim in 2 clicks, focuse on village tasks or on mob chasing.My last explaination lead me to the conclusion : H&V is not a fast leveling pvp game and will attract merely mature players. Or younger ones without blood thirst. This fact explain why community is so peacefull, helpfull and ... well, nice. (at least in EU server, héhé)			"

												I haven't played that much, just a couple days really, but I honestly like what I have seen so far (for the most part).  I can't say anything about their store cause I bought something for like less then $2 and haven't really cared to look through it for any reason.  I see people calling this a ""Facebook"" game but it really isn't and I don't know where they get this comparison from.  I guess it's because it has farming, but that doesn't make ArcheAge a 'facebook' game.  Let's get the bad out of the way.  ---------------------------------------------------------Cons:*Animations are limited and kind of terrible.  It's hard to describe.  I can live with it, I just wish they were more tweaked.*Combat doesn't feel great, which I understand can be a deal breaker for some.  Hits don't feel connected.  *Controls feel clumsy and sluggish.  It can be a big turn off.  I would like it if you could move around with the mouse like in ESO.  I don't remember what that kind of control is called.  I just think it would be a lot better for this game then the default they have now.*Stacking in this game is messed up.  I have three stacks of fleece.  All the same quality/type.  One stacks to 64, another staks to 16 and the last stacks to 4.  I cannot put them together and I have issues like this with several other items.*You have to manually go to your house/valut/whatever storage over and over again to get materials.  I would be much happier if when you were crafting, it pulled from all storage areas instead of making the player run back and forth over and over again.  There's enough running in this game as-is.-----------------------------------------------------------Pros:*Very open world*Older graphics but I actually love the environment, lighting & brightness*Lots of combat geared quests*Lots of Crafting/Gathering geared quests that will help you understand crafting & gathering very easily right in the beginning.*Lots of unique voice acting*Anyone, from the very beginning; can learn about taking two pieces of equipment and putting them together to make a better piece of equipment.*Abilities are unique from passive to talent given activated abilties as well as abilities & feats that weapons & armor give the players as well*Quests give loot geared towards your class and your class ONLY.  You aren't given a staff as a Hunter and etc.*Friendly, helpful community*Housing that is easy to obtain & maintain -------------------------------------------------------------I can understand why so many people are turned off by this game, but I think it's given harsher reviews then it really deserves.  The changes to animation & controls would be something they need money for.  It may in fact be the reasoning of the pricey DLCs and whatnot.  Although I doubt it.  With better controls & a much more defined feeling in combat would make this game just about absolutely perfect for me.			"

The crafting system is an interesting one and easy to learn, the housing system is preety cool.The combat system can be better. Actions are happening too slow for a mmorpg.

												Okay, I dont know a lot about this game and at first my impressions of it were poor. But as I began to play and get into it a bit more I realised how much potential it really has. Yes the mechanics seem a bit naff at first but they are easy to get used to. I do have to say that I have encountered several issues but its the steam launch and every game has its faults at first. After joining a guild I encountered a great community and have throughly enjoyed playing and chatting with them (much better than other games) Overall this game has potential, it shouldnt be judged on the first 5 minutes of gameplay like many people have been doing.

												So far the game seems to be nice after playing for a few hours, i finished the tutorial missions and the game seems to open up more now. I first thought I had to pay real money to get the licence to own a house, but you will get it if you do simple quest.Fighting seems to be way to easy so far, but it's just low level and will probably get more difficult later on. The controls feel a bit clunky, but I can live with that, just something I have to get used to. The different skills and professions seem to be more entertaining so far than in similar mmo's like WOW. As for the size of the world I cannot say anything yet, but looking at the world map it seems big enough. It's not as open as WOW but all the zones are connected through portals. For a free to play game I would definitely reccommend this game so far. Stuff you have to pay for is mostly cosmetic and for your convencience, so no pay to win here. I would suggest everyone to at least finish the tutorial until you get to the city and to villages to see the potential of the game. Because it may look a bit dull at the very beginning.I do like the friendly community so far and the Dev's have already addressed some of the issues the game has and people complained about, like not being able to attack while moving and they are currently working on it. Good to hear.And I do like the art design and cartoony looks. I don't mind that the graphics are a bit outdated as I am playing on an old laptop, so this serves me well I can play this with decent fps.			"

												Some notes for context: I've played a few different MMORPGs - was on World of Warcraft for a while, also Dark Age of Camelot, Final Fantasy XI, City of Heroes, and Dungeons & Dragons Online.  This is about the second time I've come back to this game, so take the ""hours played"" figure up there with a grain or two of salt (mind you, the first time was about 2010 or thereabouts, so there's been a while between drinks, so to speak).  To Be Aware Of: if you read a lot of the older reviews, they'll complain about the crafting system, and how it was extremely limited.  This is now fixed - so if you're reading a review which talks about ""Vim"", you're effectively reading a review for a game which no longer exists.  One of the things which is most pleasant for me as a player of ""Villagers and Heroes"" is the lack of urgency about the game.  It isn't a game where you can't do much other than grind until you're in the upper echelons of the level rankings (as opposed to, for example, DAoC); it also isn't a game which is (in my opinion) thoroughly dependent on purchased content to make it worth playing (unlike D&D Online).  If you choose to play this game in its ""free to play"" mode, you can still get a very enjoyable experience without spending a cent.  While it doesn't have much variety in the early game (all classes get to start in the same place, doing the same quest, and there's only one species available - default humans) there's still a lot of options available.The biggest alteration between the first time I played this game and the most recent iteration is in the crafting system, which is now based more on time and effort than on limited resources of energy.  There are items (which spawn automatically when you're gathering) called ""Motes of Yorick"" which cut down the production time for large amounts of things (very useful when you're refining raw materials prior to actually crafting), but using these isn't compulsory (you can sit there and grind individually through, for example, turning all your lumps of copper ore into copper pigs one at a time).  This is a massive improvement over the old system (trust me, I've tried both).  There's also clockwork harvesters (occasional rewards from crafting quests, or from the daily ""lucky cards"" random draw; otherwise, purchaseable for cash through the shop) which can cut down the amount of time which is required for gathering raw materials.Combat is pretty basic and pretty generic for most MMOs out there.  I'm not a huge combat fan at the best of times, so I tend to be very much about getting through as quickly as possible, preferably with as little damage done as I can handle.  I'm based in Western Australia (timezone GMT +8, which means I'm at least 8 hours out of synch with just about everyone) so I can't really comment on the community.  What I've seen of it makes me think it's pretty friendly, and there's a fairly low incidence of trolling, harassment, and overall nastiness in the global chat.  Most people seem pretty helpful, and there's usually someone available to answer newbie questions without attempting to bite your head off.  Overall, I'd recommend the game for people who aren't after the sort of ""intense"" gaming experience which can come from some of the more popular MMOs.  If you're just after something nice and pleasant to help you fill up a few hours each night, or let you blow off steam killing off mobs, thumping rocks, chopping down trees, and so on, this is probably a good game to have a look at.  It's pretty playable solo - you don't need to have a guild or a bunch of friends playing in order to be able to do well at the game.			"

Some subscription based game should learn from their support team!Funny that it seems like a childish game but mostly I meet with people 20+It's free so why not give it a go?			"

The combat system isn't the best, but it is realy fun to complete quests and gather items like new weapons and armour. It is not like much games that you have a new item and it doesnt add that much. You feel difference with every item.My score: 7,5/10			"

												Why is there no option to cap the frame-rate of the game?There is no FPS limiter, and no vSync. I have also been unsuccessful with using third-party programs to force a frame-rate lock or vSync.Seriously. Why isn't there some way to cap the FPS? It's 2014! Why does the game even run beyond 200 FPS? No one has a monitor that runs beyond 200Hz.I have a pretty beefy computer that can play pretty much everything on max, and this game puts more stress on my system than any other game. Why? Because my damn graphics card is running it at 700~ FPS. They are redundant frames. The game does not need to run at 700 FPS when my monitor only refreshes 60 times per second. I am wasting 640-frames-worth of super duper magical computer power when I play this. Are the devs having a giggle?I don't feel safe playing this game, seeing every value on GPU-Z at 100%.The only way I would be able to lower the frame-rate, would be by underclocking my graphics card, but then I am either STILL rendering redundant frames, or I am getting sub-60 FPS.How hard is it to add vSync or an FPS cap option?I quite like my house; it's where I sleep at night. I'll play the game again when the devs don't try to set it on fire.0/10 for now			"

												This lighthearted game aims to be more social and relaxing and it comes at the cost of complex combat and gameplay.You can almost ALL combat or all of the housing/villager aspects of the game if you so choose. You are only forced into doing the first quest which is killing four weak goblin mobs so you can access the main world of the game. The vast amount of the talkative players can be found in the ""World Chat"" tab on your chat window and you can easily talk with anyone who's online for help (the game is naturally relaxing so the players are calm and friendly). This essentially summarizes the game, BUT if you want to be able to play the mobile version AND the PC version on the same account DO NOT play on steam. You are unable to use your steam account to play the mobile version for contract/legal reasons.What the game does: >Simple combat>Easily able to interact with friendly community>Relaxing villager skills and being able to be part of a village>Cartoon-like world with no rush or pressure>Able to train all villager skills as much as you want>Various events (like the Spooky Town event going on now that allows players of ANY combat level to participate in a boss battle where any number of people can help and receive rewards)>Mobile version for NON-STEAM accountsWhat the game doesn't do:>PvP>Gameplay beyond cast a few spells or do repetitive clicking to grow/collect materials and make potions or gear>Allow fast travel between zones without paying for an optional subscription (that only boosts leveling speed, inventory slots, you know)This game serves well for people not looking for an intense experience and who just want to sit back and grind out a few crafting/agricultural skills (without worrying about which methods are most efficient like in other click-grind games) or just talking and interacting with a welcoming community.

First impressions are good and first impressions last!Controls are like WoW nice and easy, cool graphics have not had any lag.Already lots of players so load times are abit slow but meh its launch day.Looks like a keeper!Enjoy.**Update**Much further in the game now and still enjoying it. I was lucky enough to be one of the first members in Runeknights which has become one of the top guilds. Basically a guild lets you make a village and in that village you can place your own house, garden and farm, simple. Your town also has group projects where you start to slowly build your town into a blazzing city, and everyone contributes!!I have noticed that this game has not attracted unwanted A$$holes which is good,the community is friendly and someone will always help out if you need a hand.Overall a good game. A few updates and im sure it will run like a well oiled machine!! Happy Easter. Happy 4/20.=)			"

												I have been playing Villagers and Heroes for over a year now, and I have really enjoyed it.  The recent REBORN update has improved the graphics and added more content into the game.  The aspect of being ""reborn"" is also something that I have not experienced with other games that I have played.  You also have the choice to quest and fight, or craft and gather, or both.The big plus of V&H is the community.  The players are amazing helpful people, and then that compounds if you become a part of guild.  People are willing to help you whether they know you or not.  The developers also listen, take feedback, and make changes based on input from the community of players.The best way to enjoy this game is to try it out for yourself.  However, give it more than the 3 hours that some reviewers have played.Just as an aside, I mainly play on the stand-alone client than through my steam account.			"

												I'm just gonna rate the stuff that truly matters, such as server stability, gameplay, and graphics.Server Stability 7.5/10: Server Stability is not a large issue but it is A issue. Mattering on what your internet is. Usually I'm working on doing either main quests or side quests and then it takes me back to where i was a second ago and turns me into a different direction. I dont know why that would happen but Im saying that its probably because of server performance.Gameplay 8/10: When it comes to Gameplay it really matters on where you are and what your doing in the game. Monsters are hard to take down when your 2 levels below it's level and not equiped with any potions. I dont like the main boss that you have to take down at the beggining (Donalda Declancy) with 1800 health and a fast health regen rate as a level 10 boss. I was level 9 when i battled her and it was hard as heck, but another player who was level 11 came in and helped me defeat her. It is really hard to level up but with quests that give you almost 3000 experience its actually smarter to do quests rather than xp farm.Graphincs 7/10: Graphics arent bad, but not great. The graphics just arent as good as some of the other rpgs that ive played.Over all my score for the game itself would be an 8/10. I am recommending this game because it is a good game but could use just a little bit of work.Edit: The server stability is actually ok for the most part, it was just my old internet.			"

												Gave this game a good hour of my time before I gave up. Why?Was it the sub-par graphics? No. I can live with graphics being basic, but they are styled to something I'd expect in an MMO about five or six years ago.Was it the vast emptiness? Also no. While I was on there were NO other players on at all. So these vast villages and towns felt... dead. But even then, I prefer single player games, so I can live with that.Was it the bugs and massive lag-spikes? Yes. Falling through the terrain became all too commonplace. Several times I would spend five minutes running a metre due to a lag spike forcing me to re-run it. Also, why so much delay between acknowledging I've hit attack/move/speak/craft/open menu (it makes a sound and graphic when you do) and actually performing that function.So why the immediate hatred for this game with just a few bugs? The truth is that there are far better free-to-play MMOs out there that nailed down the basics before they decided to get all fancy (Neverwinter, Rift, DC Universe just to name three). Yes, the player controlled villages was a cool idea, whilst every game needs a hook, you should always make a game PLAYABLE first.Players will forgive an average game that has a good (if somewhat buggy) hook if the basics are playable. Why? They'll stay long enough to give the developers a chance to streamline the hooks.Players will not forgive a subpar game that has a good hook if the basics are buggy? Why? They'll abandon it before the developers actually improve the game engine.			"

												So, after playing the game for a brief time, I wanted to leave a review to help other people deciding. I actually kind of liked the game and I think it has lots of potential.Yet the main reason I would not recommend this game is because it is a massive grindfest with no enjoyable+ added into it. The gathering system seems to be somewhat okay compared to the crafting system. The crafting system is unbelieveable. Espescially after making lots of digging and finding out the grinding amount I have to do to level up my craftings, the game was over for me. Seriously you dont want to click that much, just no. Other than the absurd crafting system, the game is very unfinished with unconsistent art here and there. You see really annoying and buggy stuff generally.As for some pros, I would recommend this game for some chilling with friends. The storylines were really fun and the humor is pretty goodly constructed. NPC voices are also okay.Generally the game is a 4/10 for me.			"

												Villagers and Heroes feels like a mix of Runescape, Zelda, and World of warcraft, this game really carries the nostalgic factor to a new level. Despite this game being free, i am proud to say that it is not a pay to win game. It has minor micro-transactions which will not give a major advantage over someone who does not purchase them. I would reccomend this game for anyone who likes to explore and is a fan of mmorpgs. I put countless hours into this game and i still enjoy playing it just as much as i did when i started. There is plenty of things to do in this game such as fishing, minning,crafting cooking, etc  all the way to raiding a boss with a group of your friends to gather some epic loot. This has to be my favorite game i have played in a long time!			"

												Your judgements will most likely be based on the first 5 minutes of the tutorial zone, however, if you want an MMO to play that doesn't require you're unending dedication this is definitely a game for people who only have a few hours to spare for gametime. Warning: you can only garden and ranch in a village, and as of writing this review the only way you can have a sure spot in a village is if you join a guild with one. If you're into PVP and combat this most likely wont be the game for you as the combat falls rather short for a typical mmo, however being a combat person myself I still found enjoyment in some quests and mat farming. This game is definitely worth it for people who usually lean towards crafting in mmos.			"

												Villagers and Heroes is a diamond in the rough among free-to-play Massively Multiplayer Roleplaying Games. It offers a charming landscape and a world that promotes a healthy, friendly community. The barrier to entry to this game is next to none, if you've played an MMORPG in the past you kind of know what to expect, yet somehow Villagers and Heroes is different. Maybe it's the town system that makes it different. You can join a town of 34 others and create your own house in its own, non-instanced plot (however the towns are instanced) relatively early on in the game (I've only played about 4 hours at the time of this review). You can garden and raise your own animals behind your house, which seems like a simple enough concept to implement into an MMO however systems like this in other games seem to be weighed down by unnecessary complexity. Not so in Villagers and Heroes.Or maybe it's that it's so easy to get into. From the beginning you are guided to learn of all the various skills and crafts available in the game and that's pretty much all there is to learn. Improve upon the skills you'd like to, leave alone the ones you don't. It's your choice where you improve, with the exception of some quests that require you to level up various skills.It's probably the unique combination of these features plus more that makes Villagers and Heroes seem like such a promising title. The game creates an experience that's a well-rounded mix of all the MMO-goodness that one comes to expect from an MMORPG and then adds some neat features on top of it.The only things that I can find to complain about this game is how unoptimized it is and how parts of the game seem unfinished. You'll find yourself looking like you're drifting half of the time as there are no side-stepping animations in the game yet. Additionally the game does not run as well as it should, it feels. There doesn't seem to be a whole lot of graphical complexity going on sometimes and yet my framerate gets hit hard. (I am running on a GTX 660TI so it could be worse for cards less powerful than that) These are things I imagine will get corrected over time, as indepdent developers have the tendency to release meaningful patches for their games over time. It is impressive what Mad Otter Games has been able to achieve with Villagers and Heroes as it stands even, it takes a lot to independently release a video game, let alone an MMORPG.Small flaws aside, Villagers and Heroes is a great MMORPG that benefits greatly from its simplicity. Join with a friend and build houses in the same village, it'll be fun. If not, well, then it didn't cost you anything.			"

You need to Gather a Certain Number of that Product OutSide of your Town somewhere Where Monster are, and Collect that ammount to bring back to your town and it will Quadruple the Ammount, but you still need to collect it after you have Gave the Right ammount!

It's just a simple, laid back crafting/fighting game that can be enjoyed by all. If you take the game for what it's meant to be and don't try and compare it to other big name MMO's, then you'll be pleased.			"

												This game is a lot of fun, it does not exactly look that great from the store page but boy is it fun from crafting, to the goofy characters, to being able to own a house, fish and tons more. One thing I have to say is it is a lot more fun if you play with atleast 1 friend but all in all, great game.			"

												The gameplay itself is good overall. However the game crashes too easily and sometimes it lags the mouse out a whole lot. Otherwise, i love how the game is fast paced and is quite easy to play at the start unlike most other mmorpgs where you can get killed right at spawn by an overpowered boss.			"

												This game is honestly fantastic. The community is really friendly and helpful and just generally good to chat with. You can do whatever you want in this game, the crafting system is fun, you can do quests, or you can run a farm and a garden in a village. If you're looking for a serious hardcore mmo then this perhaps isn't for you as it's more of a chilled out casual game. Whilst the quests can be quite repetive and grindy, the first story quest is great fun so that's well worth a read, and some of the dialog is so funny. The graphics are cartoony, so if that's not your thing I also wouldn't bother with this game as like I said it isn't the most serious on the market. The focus is also more on coop and party play with friends or guild members, as there isn't really any pvp. Generally, if you're looking for a casual chilled out and enjoyable mmo or a place to make friends and do your own thing (there's something for everyone) then I'd definitely try out this game. The cash shop isnt pay to win and they've just brought out mounts which is exciting. However, if casual, chill, cartoony games aren't your thing I recommend you try something else :)			"

												The addictive system of gathering and crafting in Villagers & Heroes was the main draw for me.  Building a character with a wide variety of skills that produce stuff is always fun.  The game does not disappoint; I had a blast harvesting a huge variety of items and it was easy to start making quality gear from what I found.My problem with the game is with the questing.  Remember back when the first WoW expansion, The Burning Crusade, came out and the quests in the new zones were streamlined and really fun (at the time)?  Remember how awesome Ghostlands was, because the zone rewarded you for completing the quest line and you didn't have to traverse the world to do it?Well, the questing in Villagers & Heroes is very much like the questing was in WoW, before BC came out.  In short, a pain in the rear.  Its a serious slog to level up via questing here; the interface is not friendly enough to group your quests by zone, and there's some other glitches (missing quest markers) that twerk your day.  You're going to want to purchase some virtual wings (teleport stones) because your feet will be tired from the running.  Despite all of that, getting to level 14 was actually a pleasure.  I may see how far I can get just harvesting and whatnot, but more questing from here on feels like a bad-paying job.			"

												I feel like the negative reviews are not accurate. I played this game the first day it came out, and I'm not going to lie, it was very glitchy. The game is an MMORPG by an indie company, and it's only the first week, of course it's going to be glitchy. They are currently on top of everything, so hopefully the game is all fixed up and clean this up coming week.On with the review... If you've played and liked Runescape, you'll love this game. It is a skill and stat based game. You do little things to level up every skill possible. Picking apples is a skill, cooking is a skill, fishing, crafting, smithing, all that stuff. You start off on a tutorial island just like Runescape where you can learn all the skills and start a main quest. The controls feel a bit weird but they are very easy to get used to. Don't fall for all the negative reviews. Play the game for yourself and see if you like it.			"

												The best thing this game has going for it, besides amazingly pretty graphics, is the community.  It's amazing how well people get to know each other while killing monsters or gathering mushrooms.  There is a lot to do and there is no rush to do any of it.  People can play on their own or in groups, can play a little or spend days playing: there are many choices to fit all kinds of players.  It's worth a try!  (I will mention that my personal experience is that STEAM and V&H do not form a good team- so far- seeing as Steam is holding my password for the game hostage.  So if you decide to get the game through STEAm- make sure to write everything down, otherwise, no one will help you. )  "

												Pay to win! Good thing it was free to play, otherwise I'd feel robbed. DLCs for this game seem way overpriced. Glad I didn't get that far or spend any money on this junk.You've got 4 classes, warrior, wizard, priest, ranger. Ranged classes are it. Combat was just dull.  I played the ranger, pick a target, double click on it, run around while it auto-shoots.Game gets repetative and boring fast. You spend most of your time gathering resources to make a little bit of cash. Every 5 second you can click to gather 1-2 resources, but usually you get just 1. Depending on the level of the resource you get anywhere from 25-100 exps per resource. Yeah, try getting to level 12 where you need 30k exps in that particular resource. Everytime you pop a level, your exps drop to zero again. Takes for friggen ever to get anywhere. One quest requires you get to level 10 in everything. You have 10 skills plus your charater level. At 5 hours of mostly resource gathering, my average level was around 8. Makes for a really exciting game.I upgraded my tools, didn't make any difference, still gathered at the same amount, the same items. I really don't find it fun where I have to click for an hour on the same resouce constantly, then move on to the next resource and so forth. Go craft you stuff, sell want you can and go back again for more resources.Other annoying thing I found was it's only 1 player per resouce. And I don't even see the point of have 5 resources of varying levels, where the only one that does anything for you is the highest level one.Game penalizes you for not playing! Costs 1000cp per week to have a house. I don't see myself ever getting one.5 hours of game play and I never ever want to play this junky game again. And yeah, it's a bit buggy as well, sometimes you click and nothing happens. Or you select a target and all of a sudden you're shooting at some other target and so forth.Atleast it's free, and when you get bored, just delete it, having lost nothing but time.Just looked at the store page, WHAT trading cards? Where? 5 hours I got nothing.			"

												This game is essentially a rip off of other MMOs. There is really nothing memorable about it, basic graphics, boring battles, simple animations, and unbalanced classes but; if you are looking for a game to laugh about with friends and spend hours just laughing and having fun with your friends than I highly recommend this game. If you want a real MMO that requires strategy and skill this is not the game for you but; if you want a game that is laid back and overall enjoyable then give this game a shot.  "

												So my first play through the game was ok. The quests where the same as any other MMO but thats expected. While trying to kill mobbs other players would always get the first hit and then i would have to wait a couple of mins so i could complete the quest, that was annoying. After about 30 mins i got out of the starter zone and picked up a quest to join a village and get a house. I was expecting something like wildstar where i can place things in the house and move stuff around but couldnt even walk in, it was just a bank, put stuff in and take stuff out. The houseing was dull. Then wanted to look around the villege and was also hoping that it was like SWG and that you could place stuff anywhere but its preplaced structures and you can only upgrade them with other guildies. After a couple of hours of playing it seemed like a ok MMO but I give it a 6/10. For a free to play game its not that bad. Hope everybody doesnt freak out over my view of the game but hey review is a review.  Happy questing everybody.			"

												Very much a World of Warcraft meets Guild Wars built by German developers, this PvE only game will satisfy plenty of folk's need to play in a fantasy world of crafting and smiting without needing to spend any money.  The game is still in development, and Mad Otter is continuing to further refine and improve the experience that they have already sunk lots of time and effort into this piece of gamecraft wonderfulness.  Like its inspirations, it isn't for everyone.  If you like the two games I've already mentioned, you'll love this game too.  Give it a chance!

Sadly (in MY opinion), they have gotten rid of VIM....So, now gatherers/crafters can do their thing - for as long as they like....There is STILL a strategy to it....but, devs have come through again with a compromise that should make all happy.If you tried the game out in the past and hit the 'vim wall' and quit - give it another go....:D			"

												Villagers and Heroes is a classic MMORPG that has been compared to the likes of Runescape and WoW. While I feel that a direct comparison to these games is less than accurate, I would go so far as to say that players from these other titles will find it an easy transition in terms of game play and mechanics. If you have not played these other titles, you will find that the base mechanics of game play are not that difficult to pick up on, thanks in large part to the games opening quest which serves double duty as a well crafted tutorial. While the game offers many of the traditional aspects found in other games of this genre, it has an acceptable learning curve. The main thing that differentiates this game from those previously mentioned is that it is more casual than hardcore, which results in a friendlier community than the average game of this nature.Like many other games in the fantasy genre, V&H has a medieval setting in which characters engage in three related aspects of game play. Combat and exploration, gathering, and crafting. There is an additional element of game play with the inclusion of villages. Characters can join join a stand alone or guild village where they maintain a house which grants additional storage, raise crops in their own gardens, and maintain a small ranch which yields components useful for crafting.Despite being squarely in the middle of a somewhat crowded genre, V&H offers a few aspects that make it somewhat unique. The most unique aspect in my mind is an add on to crafting referred to as the Gnog station. Through gnoging, a character can take existing gear and modify its looks and aspects. They can add and remove the various feats and abilities inherent to gear to create custom gear tailored to the individual needs of the character. Another feature that was added just this past year is the ability for a character to be ""Reborn"" which allows them to reset their combat stats and advance their character with bonuses, without the loss of non-combat achievements. My most favorite aspect of the game however does not have so much to do with the game itself as it does the games community. The owners and staff at Mad Otter Games have a reputation for being receptive to their customers, which results in player driven development. In actual game play, a player will find the game itself to be well moderated, which results in a play environment remarkably free of Trolls and Drama-llamas. Of all the on-line games I have played, Villagers and Heroes has perhaps the most friendly and welcoming community that I have ever encountered.Read more: http://mm-mysticalts.proboards.com/thread/270/villagers-heroes-revised-01-2016#ixzz3wfpDGkPC ~LL*Notes: (1) I played this game for over a year before making a Steam account for it. My client account is my primary account. My hours on record as a Steam player are less than a tenth (at best) of the actual hours I have put into this game. Just saying............ :P(2) Several updates and improvements to this game since the mid point of 2015 have prompted me to revise my original review. Any review you read for this game made prior to June of 2015 need to take into account the ongoing devolpment it has recieved since that time.			"

												Alright I gotta admit the game has/had potential to become something worth trying.The game was fun I also gotta admit, the graphics are actually good and entertaining to look at, the storyline doesn't seem that bad at all, it has a point, tells you a thing happening and what's going on and where are you in the story.But yet again, when you want to make an MMO with this amount of great stuff and you miss the most important piece in a video game development called ""controls"", then I would say this game fall in this section, the game camera controls is not close to a free cam where your mouse can move in any direction you want.It's not only the problem with the controls, but actually the game itself from the inside, the only dialogue you hear is complete gibberish of thin air, I'm not kidding, they are basically the Raving Rabbids dialogue but girlish/manly sounds, don't believe me? look it up, Micro-transactions is ugly here, they give you at the beggining 5 teleporting stones to your house, when you run out you can buy more or buy ""unlimited feature"", so basically you have to waste hours of hours to get your♥♥♥♥♥♥to your house and go back to the point where you actually stopped!If you want an MMO that has potential to become something successful/already a big success, go try World of Warcraft  (Free) or Elder Scrolls Online (payable 40$ - 60$) The Elders Scrolls have a free weekend right now by the way from November 16 to 21 November "

												One of most crappy games that I've played this year. Let me tell you why. First of all, optimalization - I've Intel i7 4770k 4,5 GHz (water cooled), 32 GB RAM Patriot Red 2600 MHz, MSI GTX 770 4GB, Windows 8.1 64-bit and this game is running at 40 FPS at high (not ultra) settings. At ultra it's nearly unplayable in cities. Also I've lost 3 characters because they are ""lost in space"" between loading screens. They are stuck since days. Second thing - I don't know what devs where doing, but new character is using 5-lvl gear at the start. If you will change something in your eq you can't use these items untill lvl 5. Logic? What the f...? Third thing - combat, it's nearly turn-based. Every mob or player is dealing max 1 attack per second, combat is bugged, very often the game isn't responding for actions or attacks. Loot drop is pathetic - who will first attack the boss gets 100% of loot, Forth thing - nearly everything you can buy using in-game Premium Shop. Everything. Simply everything.I can't find even ONE POSITIVE thing in this game...			"

												This game has A LOT of potential. From the graphics giving you that almost old-school feels to the housing & gathering system. I have only played for a couple hours thus, but I am thoroughly enjoying it. As reviews below said, the combat is not fluid at all, but the DEVs are aware of this and are currently working on making it smoother. The gatherng is a huge load of fun, though. It's quick, easy and exciting due to random drops and the ability to discover new items and objects. You will, however, find yourself right-clicking a little more than you'd hope, IMO. After a little more work has been done on this game I think it will be a huge success and it is definitely worth trying out. :)			"

												Villagers and Heroes isn't exactly your typical MMO...It has taken the crafting and gathering thing to a whole new level of not enough inventory space as well as focused the entire game around crafting and gathering with a hint of PvE. The PvE side exists (I'm still low level) but it's like the crafting and gathering is the main point of the game and the monsters are like a side quest which is pretty weird to say.The list:Graphics - Cartoony graphics-ish. They're alright but don't expect RIFT quality.Gameplay - You mean gathering and crafting? Pretty dang repetitive.Combat System - It absolutely sucks. Probably why they avoided PvP? Is there even PvP in this game? No there isn't.Community - Very friendly and very helpful.Chat System - It really sucks. Should be replaced immediately...Achievements - Yes of course... and they give you gold as a reward for earning them (interesting).Voiceover quality - Meh - Some NPC's are great and some others are terrible or too loud/too quiet/bad voice acting.Grinding levels? - It appears it's going to be quite the grind to get everything from leveling/crafting/gathering to maximum.Auction house - Very meh. Lag? - No, not really.Kid friendly? - Absolutely. Have young ones and need to have them do something for awhile? Let them play this.Overall it's an alright game but wasn't what I was expecting.			"

												This game has A LOT of potential. From the graphics giving you that almost old-school feels to the housing & gathering system. I have only played for a couple hours thus, but I am thoroughly enjoying it. As reviews below said, the combat is not fluid at all, but the DEVs are aware of this and are currently working on making it smoother. The gatherng is a huge load of fun, though. It's quick, easy and exciting due to random drops and the ability to discover new items and objects. You will, however, find yourself right-clicking a little more than you'd hope, IMO. After a little more work has been done on this game I think it will be a huge success and it is definitely worth trying out. :)			"

												When I played it the game seemed like a more cartoony version of WoW, except the cost model will kill your wallet.It has so many crafting recipies, and like 20 levels of each ingredient type, and there's many types... This means if you enjoy crafting you'll have a ton of options... Right? The promise of that is what got me into the game. Here's where your wallet suffers.You get 3 inventory bags, 1 vault slot, and 1 house slot for storage (once you rent the house). After that you have to pay hard $ to get crowns which let you buy extra storage space. You can barely fit all the levels of 2 ingredient types into 1 storage bag. So to be able to enjoy the tons of crafting, you have to spend money to unlock storage.This isn't a ""Pay to accellerate your levelling up"" model. It's a ""pay or suffer insane difficulty as you have to sell items to make room for what you need at the moment because we don't give you a way to get enough space"" model.Save yourself $ and hassle, try some other game. Plus there are still minor bugs in some quest lines and the big one where my key setting changes were never saved and required me to rebind after each exit/launch.			"

												Villagers and Heroes is an amazing game, if you like RPG style; this is a game for you. It is based on fighting to level up and complete quests, these quests can be for different, there are quests for leveling up your hero, (Eg) your player. there are four main player types, Worrier, Wizard, Hunter and Preist.The Worrier is for heavy close combat fighting. Wizard is for distance, long ranged attacked but not great in close combat same with the Hunter(archer). Finally the priest, it is mainy used for healing but can fight as well. In the game you can go solo or join a party, once you join a party you dont have to stay in it, you can leave it when ever you want. If you are in the same area as some party members you get 50% of the exp they get from attacking a monster.As you have read already there are areas, in Villagers and Heroes there is loads you can explore you start on a island called Ethlos this is where you willl be given a main quest, you do not have to do the quests but it is recommended if you want to level up fast, also the main quest is only to help you level up when you first start and teach you the rules and the ways around the game. Once you have completed it your done with the main and can do side ones.You can also join a guild or a village these can help a lot as if you need something Eg (Ore) for smithing you guild or village has a vault where players can put equipment they dont need in it for others to have, the differents between a guild and a village is that you can join a village of the bat were a guild the leader has to accept you in the only way this is done is if the leader invites you. Once you are in one of these you can make a house as you go on in the game you will unlock new looks; their are many looks out there also you can farm and breed this is a good way to make money, Money is in copper, silver and gold. 100 copper = 1 silver and 100 silver = 1 gold. monsters drop around 8-15 copper so the best way is to farm or quest. You can also get money from doing achivements.If you realy want to get good stuff level up fast or get money fast you can do in game purcheses but i dont recommend this, but its your money.Im going to stop talking now as i will give away to much and this may stop people playing as they know most things about it.If you need help on the game or want tips or if you have any questions just add me and message me, i will try to answer back as soon as i canHope you start playing its a great game, you nevere know we might be able to fight together.

												Updated review:Alright so I've had my ups and downs with this game, as with most MMOs I play. If you don't feel like reading the whole thing the short version is: This game isn't perfect, but I'd still recommend it as a free player.The good:-Nice story that is, although predictable at times, very in depth.-Skill customization. Can reset skills at any point in the game, giving freedom to try different builds without remaking characters.-Can be played free. Nothing in the cash shop could really break the game for free players. There are things in the item mall that make it easier to level and give very minimal (5%) buffs to stats. You could still dominate a premium player if you worked hard enough to get your character built. The membership gives you bonus exp and takes away the debuff you get from dying.-Bosses are fun and challenging, which promotes group play, but doesn't require it. Being someone that solos every possible thing I can on MMOs I love having the freedom to at least try to solo bosses. I can defeat most things alone, but still get my butt whooped by others. -There is an auction house, which is my favorite type of trade system. -The village system is pretty nice. There's a vault in the city to donate items into and other people in your village can take the items as they need (or want). -The crafting system is very in depth. There are a lot of different things to do, and everything works together. Also, you can do everything on one character.There's more than what I'm posting that you can make within the crafting systems but this is a general overview:Cooking (potions and food) Smithing (swords, maces, and heavier armor)Woodcrafting (bows and staves)Tailoring (light armor)Bug Lore (collecting bugs)Fishing (collecting fish)Plant Lore (collecting fruit, wood, and mushrooms)Mining (collecting ore)Gardening (growing plants in your village)Ranching (raising animals and collecting materials like fleece and eggs from them)The bad:-Everything is bound to you after using it, which makes an in game economy pretty much pointless.-The servers are a bit dead. It's hard to find other people playing that aren't either complete noobs or elitist trash. Then again, that's true for most MMORPGs.-Although the skills are customizable, the characters are pretty lacking in that. You can choose from a few hairs and faces, but all of them are pretty terrible looking.The meh (not problems for me, but might bother others):-The graphics are simple. I find this to be a good thing because it doesn't give me a headache after playing it for a long time like a lot of games these days do. It's not about being flashy and looking ""pretty."" It's not about having half naked girls running around like a lot of games. It's more about the story and gameplay than the flashy graphics. However, I know a lot of people prefer a game to be super pretty when playing it. If you're into that, you'll probably want to keep looking.-Skills are not just built from skill points. The armor/weapons you use determine your skill levels. This can be good because you can get high-ish level skills earlier than you would be able to normally. This can be bad if your items have skills that are good but stats that suck. Gnaugmentation (or whatever it's called) helps solve that problem, though. You can fuse items together and decide which appearance, stats, and skills you want to keep from either item. It's cheap (in game currency) and helps provide in depth customization.-Not much character balance. Mages seem to be very nuke-ish. They get a skill called ""spirit orb"" that can pretty much one hit ko anything their level except bosses, which it deals damage to more than 90% damage to early on. I'm playing a mage, so I don't mind, but I would like it if the other classes had a nuke skill or if mages were a bit more balanced. They have like 0 defense so I guess that makes it a bit better, but still.. one shotting things gets dull after a while. They're glass cannons, I suppose.This is what I've learned from the game within less than 15 levels (I think the cap is around 70, not sure). As you can see, the game has a lot to it.My personal issues with the game:The company seems to be one of those companies that does not care about the players, at all. It takes days, sometimes weeks to respond to tickets. Also, there was an item on sale in the cash shop. I purchased the item, and later got banned for it. They said that it was glitched and me purchasing the item was exploiting the glitch. It was very, very obvious that the item was put on sale and they just didn't think it through. I'm over it, and I still play the game, but they lost me as a paying customer with that one. You don't need to pay to play this game, so I intend to keep playing and not giving them another dollar of my money. They don't deserve it. "

												Pretty enjoyable little game. It isn't a triple-A MMORPG, but it also isn't pretending to be. It's a fun little time-waster. Something you shouldn't take too seriously. For the most part, RMT seems to be mostly based around convenience rather than necessecity, so I'd say paying is largely optional unless you absolutely must complete everything as fast as humanly possible.I'm just speculating here, but I'd wager the majority of the people who have rated this game negatively were expecting something completely different. This game isn't bad by any stretch of the imagination.			"

												V&H is a very fun, engaging game in which you can focus on crafting and farming if you are not particularly into slaying monsters. Great for a day when you need to power down and not think too hard. The world is immersive, and allows for communal game play. I am particularly fond of the village building aspect, really fun if you find a village with a friendly, goal-oriented population. Looking forward to this game's evolution, building on its current success.			"

												There are much better options for games like this. It's lacking depth imo, and it's too repetitive. It's basically like any other mmo but just a bit worse. Still, worth to give it a try. I really enjoy grinder games, however this one just takes it to a whole new level - which I like. I find myself yawning most of the time and getting frustrated with the odd spawning rates though. I have yet to try another class beside hunter, hopefully warrior is a lot more fun.			"

It promises stuff and doesnt deliver or if something happens to your sever and you have missing stuff like me you bought w crowns which can only be purchased with real money you are SOL. They tell you to submit a ticket and months later they still won't do crap about it so u just get ripped off over and over. I'm so sick of it this is the second time it's happened.

												Is it fun? Sure, it is an RPG with crafting elements. I would relate it to Runescape but the only real similarity is leveling various skills. As far as crafting gos you may as well spend some money on the game, as soon as you hit level 16 in any crafting skill you are limited to how many items you can gather and how may items you can make. The ""Villages"" and I say that with quotes because you are going to want to join a Village with active members or you and maybe one other person are going to be doing anything, are a time sink and nothing more. You get extra crafting and  xp if you finally get enough people to help make a single building and extra gathering xp by bringing in outside materials and putting them in these bins that not only give you more of the item but give you only that certain type of item and more xp while doing so. The RPG element is meh on so many levels, to actually do anything you need Elder Gear that you practically HAVE to get a party together to take down the bosses that drop the mats however only a single person gets the item and unless you know everyone in your party and mutually agreed to farm for everyone you are not likely to get it. On the other hand gear plays a BIG part of how well you are going to do, they obviously add your attack and defense stat bonuses but they also add points to skills in various ways. In short play this with friends you know and know that are going to stick around and make a village with them, otherwise you will not get much done in the long run and you will  ultimately buy some premium items. Not exactly F2P but you can kind of manage.			"

There are some multi phase quests which continue over several zones and probably levels which add to the flavor and enjoyment. Mostly its a very friendly PVE game with a alot of crafting.  The developers are constantly updating the game with different event zones which pro rate the characters by level so that all can group on more or less an even ground.

												If there was a maybe button, thats what I'd reccomend.Pros : Its very Runescape-esque.  Which I entirly love.  I love to farm and craft, etc.  I could spend all day just farming and crafting and the next day go beat the living snot out of that Bounty Mob that killed me the other day.  In that respect, Its great.  Cons : Only problem is, the graphics are a 3/10 at best.  I have been spoiled by many games that are high demand video hogs.  So, this is more of a personal preferance.  Out of the few hours Ive played, The game window has closed 5 times with no warning at all.  Getting stuck in a wall was a pain.  Also the in game village building.... Is always full.  Almost impossible to start your own or settle in one already made.  There is in game purchases which make it slightly P2W, but its almost needed at times.  If your a crafter, the bag space you have is very limited.  IIRC its 2 16 slot bags.  Others you need to buy through in game purchases.Overall a 4/10.  The Runescape end of it keeps me playing mainly because I've been hankering for a nice MMO RPG to play thats not mainstream.  IT IS F2P at any rate.  Worth a try. "

												Gave it thirty hours and here is what I've deduced.Five best qualities :- Quest lines are pretty well written, nice splash of humour here and there.- Customisation in the sense of being able to mix and match gear skills via ""gnogmenting"".- People are mostly friendly and quite helpful, but it is F2P so expect ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.- Bounties, achievments and rare mobs called ""Zingaras"" to complete/hunt. - Music. Even the song that sounds like a 5 year old playing a recorder is quite hypnotising.Five worst qualities :- Combat. Many a times i've been on the brink of death because it wouldn't target or attack.- Crafting is so mind numbingly dull I was close to painting a wall just to watch it dry.- The stupid energy in place when doing any gathering or crafting over lvl 16. - Customisation. Variety is the spice of life. This has no real variety.- COMBAT !! When it works, its as smooth as one would expect. But some times....Whilst there are many aspects that can be tweeked and improved on, currently it is a nice dose of light hearted, quirky monster stabbing fun. Fair enough the graphics are what many would consider as ""outdated"" but people play WoW no problem and that has always looked half♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Extremely relaxing fun filled f2p/mts mmo. Thoroughly enjoying it! Came home from work as a bundle of stress, my usual mmo's were more ""work"", so I browsed for something  a little more casual or relaxed and found this gem.  Anyone who played Wizardy 101 will recognize the graphics, soft cartoony, colorful, yet easy on the eyes. Also, a family friendly game for someone looking to play with their kids. Currently I have stepped out of the 'Heroes' part of the game and am fiddling with housing and crafting. Truly, I can't recommend this game enough for someone looking for a relaxing and fun mmo. Most beautiful part; the microtransactions store does NOT impare the gameplay for those who can't afford to use it. No roadblocks! I would also like to note, I read reviews from players prior to trying it out. Some had me a bit concerned, however it looks like the issues addressed in this reviews have been resolved. Combat is far more user friendly, no longer locked in place... can run and cast etc. Definitely will not be a ""niche"" game, very much a mainstream relaxing mmo with a ton of achievements and goals to aim for. Lastly yes there is raiding in high end (I have yet to experience it) and from the death notices I have seen there does appear to be some pvp elements (arenas perhaps?). I am still fairly new to the game, hooked. Let's see if it keeps my love for it!			"

												A really bad game. Maybe would be ok as a browser game but as a standalone - no way.Its called VILLAGERS and Heroes, it announces housing as one of its main features. Almost shocked me to find out that the houses cant be entered. Real Housing was around in mmos about 10 years ago, where you were able to upgrade, customize, add furniture, add crafting tools, invite friends - in games that didnt even mention housing as a feature. None of that is available here, houses are nothing more than storage.The collecting/gathering professions, a huge part of the game, begs you to use macro cheating. Best way to level is to turn on ""auto collect"", define a key to send left mouse button every 2-3 sec and go afk for a day or two.The graphics were ok maybe 10-15 years ago, i dont get how such thing can be released in 2014.The ui is ok at best, you have all or least most basic informations. Of course you cant change anything about them, Resize/Move? - Lol. Its ok as the game just isnt very complex and a detailed ui isnt needed.The Style is comic like, but rather childish, naiv, simple and less cute.It also has combat, well a main part of it is combat. You can kill stuff. Thats it. Works. But thats it, no great tactics, group play or whatever, not very dynamic or challenging.Hell, the game is so bad, absolutly not worth writing a single more			"

												THis is a great little game to pass away the time.  It has a lot of grind to it.  But the game dev's have made it very easy to gather stuff.  Just takes time, so if you have a lot of free time on your hand this is def a game for you when it comes to the trade skill aspect of the game it is great.  So many different items to create and give to your friends.  The comunity on the servers are amazing.  Being a player of EQ for 13+ years.  I came across this game and really enjoy it.  Def worth checking out.  The xp can be a little grindy at times. As well as progression but all and all its a solid game.			"

												Graphics (indie) 8 of 10Entertainment value 6 of 10Pay to Win: Yes (money speeds up leveling and gets more skills to play with)Pay to Play: No (no money needed to play the game)Stability 9 of 10 (only had a few minor issues nothing game breaking)Controls 10 of 10 (very easy to understand)This is everything I've been looking for in a game except the f2p pay shop crap.  You get to have a town.. you and many others build houses in this town. you get a farm that you planet, water and grow.  get a ranch for raising sheep/chickens and other things.  in your town you build all the crafting machines (and upgrade them), build the collecting stuff too... like mines/trees/fishing holes... and the material is stocked by using a few items from the real game (apple tree level 1 takes 20 red apples to fill it and then it contains 200 for you to harvest in your town (the apples you get from town can't be used to refill this)PROS: Can build your own town with all your friends (in a guild or not up to you!) Can craft weapons and armor Can play how you like.. wanna just do crafting and nothing else after the tutorial do it.. your friends can bring you 20       of any material (ore for example) load it into the towns ore supply and boom you can now mine 200 of that ore        type. Though it does have a real money shop, it does seem to not be required to playCONS: In game real money shop (no matter what this is never a plus in my book, even though this isn't required so it's in the      pro column also) Sockets, You get a handfull free that's it.. then it's pay or do without.. what are sockets? they are the attrib of your weapon that gives you your attack skills.. without them you have to pick do you want slow shot or poison shot or one of 5 other abilities you can only have 4 without them. Game is entertaining for bit but then becomes extremely time killing.. ex: at level 21 you need 120,000 xp to level a craft.  you only get 100 per tree (without any xp boosts, I'm getting 106 in town) so just to get to 22 in gathering you'd have to click a tree/bush/mushroom 1, 200 times. (good luck) PAY TO WIN - you can buy things with real money and speed up your leveling .. one guy hasn't bought much been playing 1200 hours and he's only level 54(out of 75) other people have paid for stuff and made it to 75 much faster.EDIT: 36 hours in .. completely bored .. there isn't a point no direction can't figure out what's the point.. crafting is good for a while but honestly there is no point cause the gear you find in the wild is better than anything you can craft.I keep this as a recommend because if  you like crafting and gathering games this one is pretty good for about 30 hours of entertainment .. which is more than I can say for most games I've paid $50+ for			"

Let me explain.In this game, you run around in tighty-whiteys and slay wolves, the equivalent of running around in a dark suit slaying Flesh Raiders in SW:TOR. The game looks ugly, even at best graphics. This was never really an issue for me personally, but it gives the game a better feel if the graphics are pleasing to the eye. If you're going to get any MMO, get Star Wars: The Old Republic. However, this game has a few ""funny"", and even smartass moments. Hey, it's not Guise of the Wolf.6/10			"

												I was interested in Villagers & Heroes because of the emphasis on crafting and collecting. Unfortunately, I was ready to uninstall it pretty fast.""Accomplishing"" something in this game, whether it's tailoring, bug collecting, or combat, has no mental involvement whatsoever. I didn't have to think or plan or even look around for new spots as I foraged. Villagers & Heroes is essentially a mindless clicker game in MMO format, and the uncanny graphics and stale game mechanics don't help either. I wouldn't recommend Villagers & Heroes to anyone who values their gaming time.			"

												Awesome game, I haven't played a lot yet but the great visual style, wonderful music and relaxing gameplay is just what the MMO-market lacks nowadays. V&H may seem too simple for some people in the beginning, but I'd rather say that in this case it is a plus. I'm sure it will get only more interesting with the progress.			"

												It's a fun little game, the art style reminds me of Disney a bit, and while they do shove adverts and desperate money grabs down your throat, it's still possible to play without parting with any of your real life money.Great for when you're bored.Just watch out for those Bogtrogs.			"

												Gameplay:Very standard RPG questing gameplay. Lots of different levelable skills. (Bug Lore, Cooking, Fishing, etc)Graphics:I would give them a 7/10. (On very low graphics settings, lol the graphics settings go to very high (for better computers)) They are very in the middle of cartoony to real, but more on the cartoony side.Is this good for all ages:Yes it is! Go ahead and hop on with your kids! (If you are a adult)Combat:The combat is mediocre. It consists of a basic attack and a bunch of special attacks relying on ""Spirit Points"" (The combat system relies on clicking). There is only one basic attack, and it varies from what it is from class-to-class. (Archer shoots a arrow, Wizard casts a little ball thingy, warrior swings his sword, etc) While on the other hand there is a WHOLE TON of special attacks, and there is a big selection of weapons for all the classes.Is it Pay 2 Win:No. There is some elements you can pay for (Instant Ressurect (Revives you where you died at full health), Mass Crafting (Crafting a ton of stuff all at once), Extra inventory space (but there is a few places where you can store your extra stuff in the game without paying real money (a vault, a purchaseable house), etc)Rating:7.9/10			"

												I love this game so far im a level 4 and im really enjoying it. the combat isnt the greatest point but thats not what the game is really about. the crafting system is amazing and the variety of items is just insane! personally i like to play archers and thieves in RPG games and so far the hunter class fits me perfectly! The art style is simple but still beutiful and colourful you can tell that the creators have put alot of work into this indie game as it allows you to perform different actions such as, farming, fishing, and harvesting wood and ores. The list just goes on and on.                                                           The rating I would give Villagers And Heroes would be a                                                                                  9.5/10As I said the combat isnt the main feature of the game but if they could improve it slightly, maybe by adding some dramatic battle music or something like that this game would be perfect and get a straight 10/10 from me!

												So this is my experience, it's a bit harsh but this game is just frustrating from the controls down to the usage of system resources.     Controls are terrible, couldn't stand to play the game much longer than an hour. The graphics aren't even that amazing and the use of system resources is horrible. I play every game out there on max settings and I was seeing massive framerate drops doing something as simple as turning my character, which brings me back to the terrible controls. Movement is slow, rotation sucks and the whole layout of the movement in this game is backwards. The character modeling is terrible and I had to restart the game oh...about 10 times because it crashed every time I tried to finish my character creation, once I got through the terrible character creation screen (Which is about 85% of my time spent on this game) I was met with the disgusting control mechanism, I spent an additional 10% of my time playing around with graphics settings hoping to baby jesus that somehow they control the ugliness of the modeling, once again was met with disappointment when the models got even more jagged and I could now see (in detail) how terrible their collision checking was for their AI. As I turned my character I was met with the terrible disappointment that for these sub-par graphics somehow I am going under 60 frames per second when I can run way more gorgeous MMO's on ultra quality without any issues. This game is a huge disappointment and I feel bad for anyone who wastes money on the in-game content, their global chat is next to dead which goes to show how many people don't want to play this game, because it's bad. I don't even care how many downvotes this gets me, because wow, just wow this game is so bad, please just stop developing this game because the team who handles your coding must still be in highschool. Uninstalling immediately and never looking back to this dark moment in my past. I am going to write this one off as a skeleton in my closet and I am genuinely a little disturbed that a game like this made its way onto the steam market.YOUR GAME IS BAD AND YOU SHOULD FEEL BAD.*Edit as of 11/26/15This game is still bad but I want to add that my specs are as follows:Windows 10 64bitIntel Core i7 5820k (6 physical cores 12 logical)16GB DDR4 SDRAM (2133MHz)NVIDIA GeForce 970 (3.5GB Dedicated VRAM)The reason for adding this is so you can all understand I have a machine that is capable of running just about any new release to date on maximum settings, 4K Resolution, etc. without a problem.Anyway don't play this game, because it's STILL bad, clearly the developers have not listened to anyone or have completely abandoned support for this game. Personally I can't blame them, I would abandon my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stepchild too.			"

												Review Score: -4.5/10- As of Nov. 17, 2014. 'Lacks Visuals, Traveling a'Bore, Indecently Expensive'Comical Liner: 'I once had this game, it was very fun until it uninstalled itself, then I forgot the game existed..'Quick Summary; Before you slip past the scoreboard, I'd like to say.. If this game was specifically for a kid, I'd give it a 5.5 or possibly a 6. The game seems a bit... Underdeveloped. Sure it has it's ""Greats"" And ""Heights"" Such as many other games, but this game doesn't have anything to draw itself onto ""Uniqueness"" - And have something new to the table of MMOs. However, even despite this it can be pretty decent for someone with a lot of time... Otherwise, prepare to spend a lot of time traveling, and playing very carefully as potions derived/created/or bought ingame, are pretty faulty; Except the Paid by real money kind. Enjoy.Pros:- Game seems appropriate for a 'First time RPG'- The look and theme persisted- It had a WoW-like feel, a bit more cartoony.- Game is child friendly it seems as well, but that's about where it ends.- Crafting seems pretty fun. It's great that you can train any skillset.- Combining multi-items into better or more stylish items is neat.Cons:- Traveling across this game is tedious; Time-consuming and tedious.- Did I mention traveling in the game feels like a grind in itself?- If you died, while traveling, get ready to pay real money to revive..- Or pay money to travel to wherever you attempt to go.- Mana and health dies out pretty quickly, so stock Lots of garbage potions.- Reliable, usable, and good potions are only purchasable via Real Money.- Generic Quests. i.e. Collect 10 XYZ, Bring XYZ to XYZ, story driven? No.- Controls feel like it's still in Alpha, Keyboard and Mouse sometimes conflict.- Everything feels instanced, get ready to wait at every turn.- Music.. Is.... That's all I can say without violating terms of agreement.- Same generic sounds played for everything; NPC, Damage, Damage Taken, etc.- I don't recall anyway to ""Speed up travels"" meaning... Real money to Travel.- I was told by a friend you can have a house and XYZ, but it's just a ""Stash""Ending Conclusion; Don't play it unless you really... Really.. Want too, or it's already there for your niece, nephew, son, daughter.. And just wanted to play it. Otherwise, steer away, your money is worthwhile in other Indies that aren't trying to squeeze your wallet.			"

												So far, I quite enjoy the game. I like how there is no pressure, friendly chat, and other players are quite helpful. To enjoy the game, you really need to love crafting and gathering, two things I have always enjoyed in other MMO's I have played. If PvP is your thing, there is no component of it, that I have seen yet. The game tends to inspire co-operative play. The mechanics are sound, not to glitchy. All in all I give the game two thumbs up.			"

												I really enjoy this game. Its different from my normal space games but still has a co-operative feeling to it. If you were a fan of WOW, Free Realms or Runescape, and enjoy the guilds and guild feeling of inter-game family, Then this is a game you should try. It doesnt have pvp but has challenging areas and crafting skills that do require patience and leveling to help get the best gear and bonuses. Lots of quests and challenges. Great community of people to just have fun with.			"

Well, the most annoying thing is just the graphic, i just don't like it so it ruins everything. Paly for a while, then i decided to stop playing.  I don't like this one.

												I played this game for 10 minutes and they had to be the worst 10 minutes of my life.Pros of getting this game:1) It's free (sort of)Cons of getting this game:1) Terrible Frame Rate2) The coontrols were so unlike any other game. I couldn't get used to them3) The quests you are given are so mundane (kill 3 x and report back)4) The ""hostile creatures"" don't attack until you do5) There are 6 pages of inventory. Just give us 1. It's too confusing.6) Massively Multiplayer? There was 1 other person in the game when I played.2/10 would not bang. Just play WoW or any other MMORPG			"

												This game is a great MMO to play with your friends, and is still fun when you are alone. It is harder when you play alone, but I would still recommend it. I don't like the way the automatic combat system works, but most of the time you are using abilities, so I hardly ever notice. The game also has much gameplay with great crafting, wich can be tedious at times, but still is helpful. There are many places to go, and many, many quests to do, which increase with difficulty the higher level you are. This game also has TONS of gameplay, as long as you work on the quests for xp, which is nice so you don't have to grind. I have at least 35 hours of gameplay or something and I am only level 12 and not even CLOSE to finishing the game or quests, let alone explore all of the areas. There are also many bosses to track down and defeat, which also adds some purpose to the game. Everything eventually leads up to fighting a stone atmy with one of Mallok's apprentices or something, but I am nowhere near the end. I highly recommend this game, especially to play with friends.

												Okay, I am a big mmo guy. So i saw this game and started playing for a few hours, i saw it had some issues but I thought it had potential. I needed a game to play until wildstar came out at the end of May, so i gave this game a real shot. I REALLY tried to like this game. I even put a fair amount of money into it. This game is definately pay to win. If you dont spend at least 50 bucks upgrading your bags, vault storage, and infiniate travel runes you will not enjoy this game at any stage. Which is fine, I was willing to put up some money to see how its end game was. Bad idea. This game is limited to just running around a few zones at end game. The zone is basically the dungeon in which you have a few bosses to kill. Thats it. Thats the end game. No pvp at all. No real instanced dungeons. Forget about raiding. The zones are also very small when compared with other mmo's. Do yourself a favor and do not try this game out for yourself to see if its any good, I already tried that. Its not.My suggestion, if you want an mmo. Is to pre order wildstar. Ive put over 100 hours into it and its AMAZING. Great PVP, hard end game PVE raids/dungeons. Warplots (think guild wars 2 keeps but instead of defending your keep with arrow carts you defend it with missle guided lazer systems and raid bosses). Good luck guys.			"

												Villagers and Heroes has fantastic concepts and ideas. I love the idea of city building with friends in an MMO setting. I was so excited to play this game. I mucked throught the first 45 minutes of wandering tutorials and rough quest dialogue with the light at the end of the tunnel of being able to make my own town with my friend. After beating the tutorial boss we were given the quest to begin the main quest line. NO MENTION OF HOW TO CREATE A TOWN. If that is the main focus of the game, instead of giving repetitive quests and gather missions (Which every MMO does) focus on the thing that makes Villagers and Heroes unique, city building sandbox MMORPG. That is what makes this game a fantastic idea; however, the developers fail to capitalize on the fantastic ideas, instead bogging the player down in childish graphics and incoherent quest line. I would be elated to return when the focus is MMORPG sandbox city gameplay as opposed to standard MMO gameplay.			"

												Villagers and Heroes is a free to play MMORPG that is simple and easy.  It worked, looked ok, sounded ok, played ok.  Graphics are older and simple.  Crafting is big in this game.  This game is more of a grind and clicker fest than other game, social and younger oriented.  Try it, maybe you might like it.  For more info:

That's about it.The game is pretty much PvE... Pretty boring.I thought it was going to be an Albion duplicate.			"

												Well, at the moment i have 10 hours on this game, and from first impression i really like the game, when you first start playing the game you feel very ""Youthful"" and for older players like myself its rather relaxing. The best part about the game was it was totally free! There is however a item shop in which you can purchase crowns, the items in the shop are somewhat fairly priced. The questing system is very simple, you basically do as you would in most MMORPG's and collect things for people, and beat up villans, grind, craft ect.. Learning the game is so easy.. like seriously.. so easy, even a 3 year old child could learn this game in less then 20 mins, which i find is rather nice as it lets you dive into the game right away and not waste 4 hours trying to figure out how to craft something. I've played various free to play games, and this is one of the top free to plays if you are looking for something that is simple and enoying. If your looking for something that complicated, detailed this is probably not the game for you.Now, the good things in this game is that is has guilds, housing, currency system, mail, trading, enchanting, cooking, fishing and the list goes on. The controls are not all that bad, but i would like to see control options for people that like action/combat controls and opposed to turn based controls, i understand this game is semi what turnbased in the way that it works in combat, but i think it should move over to a move of a hack and slash style, as it would feel much more action package.Now for the bad about this game;-Support is VERY slow to respond, there is currently an issue with their crown system and purchasing, emailed support still no response, been 24 hours, and its not really a big game- Launcher at the time of this review crashes every 30 mins, i have a feeling there is some type of memory leak thats causing this, there is a walkaround which you can find on their discussion forums, it worked for me and i know longer crash.- Some of the doors you have to click 5-6 times before they open- When you click on NPC's to automactically combat them you sometimes get stuck on items in your surroundings like trees and rocks, instead of your character going around the obsticle, your character just gets stuck.- Auction is DEAD.. no really enough players online to support a good auction house-UI could really use some work with things like showing your current rank, question direction indicator, better mapping system-Inventory system is a little lame, could use some work to make it look better, make even make it larger as it seems rather small for a dedicated playerWith all that being said, im still rather new into the game, and with updates this review may change, as may my opinion on the game, as it stands right now i would give this game the current ratingsEasability- 10/10Fun- 8/10Community- 5/10Gameplay- 8/10UI- 6/10Item mall prices- 8/10Support- 5/10Stability- 8/10Graphics- 7.5/10Overall - 7.5/10I would highly recommend downloading the game and playing it, its free to play and requires nothing but your time.

												ohhh my, what to say about this game. Well lets start off with the clear fact that its a attempted WoW clone  -1. There are 4 of the dullest classes I have seen sence Rune Scape. The enviorment is so plain and flat it's really a joke from when you first enter the game. Zero ability to kite at a archer starting off. Full of cash shop items to make you stronger then anone with out a credit card. Very poor battle feel all together. Plain and simple this game is worse then Tiic-Tak-toe. I would recomend forgetting you ever seen this game and move on. They should be ashamed that they released such a poor game. Not worth the HD space at all, my 8 year old checked at it when she seen it, lol.			"

												The game even though lacks a bit of graphics has a great potential to maintain at top. Despite having low traffic channels it seems to me that people are bored to explore the game... everyone complaining about the Vim being inadequate..i say start your day with 20-25 bounties and the vim is enough (you get 40-50 more). A very good feature in the game is the village where simply...money talks bul!sh!t walks. Everyone would want his settlement to be one of the best in game but this comes to a very large price. Endless hours of farming to build the projects but you get rewarded as daily quests appear. Plus you have kitchen, smith, tailor in a convinient radius without searching every city.I personally enjoy this game very much. I would compare this to Aion but a lot more Gbs and graphics. Huge craft radius, lots of areas to explore but server balance is.... :S .I agree with you people saying that V&H is Free-to-Play/Pay-to-Win. It is funny though and enjoyable :)F@cking YES from me			"

												tldr: This game has the potential to be very enjoyable, but if you want to get the best expience out of it, be prepared for a bit of a cash sinkThe village system shows a lot of promise (if you can find yourself an active village) And it is nice to have your own house (even if it's just a nice looking item store) farm and animal pen. The community are also increadibly nice and it's one of the only MMOs I've played where I never encountered anyone trying to agro anyone.There is a uniquely high focus on item gathering and crafting which can be a selling point for some people, but like battle exp it becomes difficult to progress after level 10 without a lot of time put into grinding.The music can be very repetetive but is not terrible and there is a nice hand painted texture aesthetic to the world, which is also pretty huge and full of story quests, daily quests and weekly quests to keep you occupied. However the world being so large is also what breaks the game for me. While it is possible to teleport from place to place the items used to teleport you are premium items that are difficult and rare to find in game without buying them as extras, I get that as a free to play game they have to make their money somewhere, but for something so vital to the gameplay it seems like a bad direction. I would really like to reccomend this game because I did have a lot of fun initially with it, but with the combination of game vital premium items and a steep grinding curve after the first few levels I can't in good faith fully endorse it. Though it is free to play, so if you want to give it a chance it certainly wont cost you anything to see for yourself whether you can get more out of it than I did.			"

												TLDR: Over priced items and a game that doesn't operate properly.  Once you finish the newb Island and start tring to do quest in other areas the game falls apart, Unable to get quest (due to NPC not responding when targeted/mouse clicked), this also happens when you try to click a door.  The main disappoint for me is the over priced cash shop.  They make sure you'll need plently of bag and bank space and they charge you for it (20-60 dollars for bank and bag space is way to pricey) for a game that is at best worth 19 dollars.  I played two Characters to lvl 14ish and had fun till lvl 8ish when the flaws started to show.Would not recommend.			"

												Played 10 levels--will probably not continue.Not really f2p if you want to enjoy yourself.  The game relies heavily on crafting and combines multiple crafting disciplines involving many different items and then they severly limit your inventory.So if you're going to pay to enjoy a game, is this the game you want to play?  It's okay and I'd even pay a little for a fully functional version with about 4x as much inventory/storage space, but as is there are better options for the price.			"

I spoke with someone the other day and they stated ""my son is going to major in video games development, that's where the money is"".

												i used to play this when i was younger (when i was 10-11 years old) and now i see it on steam. it has been SO LONG this game is the pure thing :D because you have four classes warrior, archer, mage and priest then you got the pvm stuff which i never understood much. Now to the skilling part this has so many skills (i didn't know what each one did so i just cooked fished mined and gathered without knowing what to do) i've been a unarmoured (only with some panties) running around messing with everyone and enjoying the game. this game was my living for some years then when i lost contact to it i was pretty sad. but now i see it on steam... (even though i played on the browser) don't get fooled by my hours i was seeing if the game was the same thing and it still is. might just drop in to have some fun. :Di would rate a 9/10			"

												Seems fairly interesting, but it's a bit on the immature side, and a lot of the stuff (like crafting) is extremely monotonous where you just stand there click wait click wait click wait. But it is a F2P (if you don't want badges) MMO RPG so it does have some nice and in depth elements.			"

												This has to be one of the very best games I have ever played, I not only like it for the crafting concept but also the fighting is fun too, you can play this game at your own pace and not have to worry about  PvP battles as there are none. You dont have to spend oodles of money to get ahead either but spending a little now and then to help the developers is ok, so go ahead and grab your crafting tools and join us in Villagers and Heroes, the new Reborn update is very cool :).

												WOW! A really terrible game! It tries to feel like runescape. (If you've ever played it). Slow Framerate. Even at low settings. Atrociously Bad Combat. *Click* Thats all. Theres no need to use your skills. Buggy Gameplay and it gets even more confusing to manage after you spawn in. Your Presented with 20 different things. Horribly Voiced Characters. Lathargic movement. (Btw way terrible Moving system.) This game is dissapointing at the least. There are alot of word that can be used to describe how bad this game is. As a matter of fact. It had me laughing at how PATHETIC EVERYTHING IS!!!Nothing is special about this game. Its a waste of time. And computer Space. If you wanted better gameplay. Play Wizard101! Yeah thats right! I went there! Incredibly stupid Artificial Intelligence.The Quests are the worst part! To track it You press ""J"" to open up your quest journal. and hit track quest. And After you're presented with a HUGE Icon of the Quest's Icon PASTED onn the map. Not only that but the Quests are Ridiculously easy!Hunters are overpowered.And everything else is just... AAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGG!!!! TERRIBLE!!!! My short amount of time may have not given the game a chance. I'll take that.The screenshots look nothing like the actual game. Models Arent Smoooooth Like expected. They're Blocky and pixelated.Just... No more! 1/10. Misleading, Terrible And Stupid.			"

												I recommend this game because it is similar to pirate101, wizard101, and School of Dragons. If you like any of those games you would love this! the music goes with the game, plenty of quests to do, and really hard bosses! Well not that hard, but still they can be pretty hard if you don't level up properly. I like how you get to mine, fish, farm, ect. to make certain stuff. I likethe graphics on this game. Very good community. However, only one person gets the quest if ur beating up a boss with a friend or some random person. It takes probs a minuet or so for the boss to respawn. The two servers i played on were pretty full just be aware of that. You can also pick from 4 different types of classes, knight, archer, priest, or wizard/mage.  Each class has a beginners, non-beginners, and advanced clothing looks.			"

												Sick and tired of waiting for the devs to fix the memory leak issue that I and other have been experiencing since at least APRIL. Once you hit about 1.7 million k, it closes to desktop. And WON'T fix it!I have told them time and time again what the proplem is and how to make it happen (which by the way, playing the game causes the issue). About month later (I can't quote from the forums as the community hub apparently doesn't exist? How ironic...) we get something along the line of ""we will fix it next week"". About 2 weeks later ""we can't replicate it"". THERE HAS BEEN NOTHING SINCE. Thanks devs for wasting my time.I had fun when I wasn't crashing every 15-30 mins but I will NEVER touch this game again, or buy/play ANYTHING from these developers. It'll be a complete waste of everybodys time.			"

												My Review Point of [Villagers and Heroes] is 4/10. Average games with less things to exploits.Pros :1. Free is always good.2. Gathering, Crafting, Mixing & Etc were appealing.3. Low graphics requirement make game amiable to all PC, which had potential of attracting new players.4. Gameplay rated as childplay, game that won't make you stress.Cons :1. Earlier level were still interesting, but explore much, you gonna feel it's a wasting your precious time to play this game.2. Low graphics requirement make my eyes ""hurt"" and my honey i7 felt betrayed by me, by playing low graphic games. ;)3. Because the gameplay quite easy, for a short time you will feel so bored, and thinking Dragon Age 3 will coming soon so you need to re-play DA 1 & DA 2 to get the savegames continuity for next DA 3. Just say so ...			"

												Great if you want a casusal only log on every few days type of game. At the higher levels 16+ you have to rely on an ingame ""stamina"" system called Vim which makes what would be a ridiculously crafter friendly game into a wait until you have more stamina game. The battle mechanics seem to be about as basic as humanly possible so if you never wanted a hard battle system this is for you. Lag is what really tends to be a problem. Every 10-15 minutes like clockwork the interactions you have with things will just hang. click a door 4 times and it wont work until the game catches up and summarily opens and closes the door 4 times in front of you. now before people say it could be on my end I also have a high end gaming rig. I was looking for a crafter friendly kind of menial takes no thought game and this was it. The problems however make it not worth the effort.			"

												I DL'ed this as a test run for my world into pc gaming and quickly abandoned it. The game itself is NOT bad, however, that said it is about as flavorful as tofu. Some people dig tofu... many find it tasteless with a slightly rubbery, crumbly texture. That is this game. The fighting is good (if easy even for the newest of players I.e. myself), the objectives are fairly clear cut (retrieve this, craft this but gather all the items for it first, and oh btw please save us all... if you have the time.) I spent a decent amount of time fishing... yes in game fishing, and crafting what few new items I could for my character at that skill level. As a ftp you're not losing anything by giving it a go and I think it would be a great game for a younger audience or very new gamers. Overall I guess it's just like I said; not bad just not really interesting.			"

												My Review Point of [Villagers and Heroes] is 4/10. Average games with less things to exploits.Pros :1. Free is always good.2. Gathering, Crafting, Mixing & Etc were appealing.3. Low graphics requirement make game amiable to all PC, which had potential of attracting new players.4. Gameplay rated as childplay, game that won't make you stress.Cons :1. Earlier level were still interesting, but explore much, you gonna feel it's a wasting your precious time to play this game.2. Low graphics requirement make my eyes ""hurt"" and my honey i7 felt betrayed by me, by playing low graphic games. ;)3. Because the gameplay quite easy, for a short time you will feel so bored, and thinking Dragon Age 3 will coming soon so you need to re-play DA 1 & DA 2 to get the savegames continuity for next DA 3. Just say so ...			"

If you're the kind of person that runs around in places you shouldn't be (combat-level-wise) just to raise your crafting/gathering skills, maybe this game is for you too. So far, I've found where a few of the pay-only features would be nice, but they aren't necessary whatsoever. And it's not really in your face either, like some games are.			"

It's pretty boring to play, and the game just lacks life in general.I'm also used to playing Guid Wars 2, where there's no competition for resources (resources are limited, but each player has access to whatever is on their screen, and no-one can prevent that), so it was a bit of a shock to be back in an archaic system where players have to compete for resources....

												This game is  bad. It will never be up to par with any other MMO without going through major cleanups. Now, my play time with this game is low due to me having played this mostly on my laptop with another steam account, but here are the hard facts:The controls feel like you are running on wet ice with flat shoes. The graphics are heavily artstyled, but severely ugly (especially on the player characters). The AI is laughable. The first thing I saw was an enemy walking directly into a tree to no end. This game tries very hard not to be a WoW clone, and succeeds ever so slightly, but in the bad way. It is an unplayable mess, and if the developers want to ever make money (I assume that is their only reason for working within the gaming artform), they probably should make a more compelling game. There are many features that seem impressive, but at the very core of the game there are huge flaws. Fix it say I, I want another admirable MMO on the market. For now though, I'd advise any consumer to stick to WoW, as the new expansion is pretty wicked.From me it gets a 3/10 for possible potential.			"

												i really gave this game a chance because the company name was mad otter. at first glance it looks like a remake of runescape. but they have fallen so short. i started out making my charicter. the limits of only 7 heads 7 faces (Textures) and 7 hairs was very limiting. i got into the world ad taken on a quest. finding out you cant just click and move i have to actually use the wasd keys. i got stuck on a well and took a bit to find out how to attack the first beast. it was mordifying. Reminded me of like beta runescape but worse. anyway in and end this company has let down all of the otter communitys of this world and should be exiled.0/10 Would rate again.PS. That well was like sticky paper you touch it and you have to reverce away from it before moving around.			"

												Were you a big fan of runescape back in the day and looking for a similar exsoeraince? Try out Villages and Heroes. It is a f2p fantasy based mmorpg for mobile devices and PC. It has a focus on crafting, guilds, story and combat. You level up as you use your skills. It is run by a dedicated group of devolpers and has really nice fan base . It is well populated in the later areas of the game, not so much in the well designed starting island. If this game sound interesting to you try it out, you will not be disapointed. It can easily be played casually or hardcore. Play it once in a while for an hour or more or play it several times a month. However you play, I can personal guarantee you it will be time well spent.			"

												I didn't even bother to play, when right out the gate I saw a displeasing bug. I entered 'Timeforfunstuff' in as my characters name. This name is 15 characters long. I got in return an error telling me that my characters name must be less than 20 letters long. I then went to options to submit the bug and numerous times I tried this but i kept getting a failed to send bug error so I didn't even bother to play seeing that I can't enter a name that is obviously under 20 letters long, nor could I submit a bug. I figure if theres that many problems with the sign up, there has to be loads that will bug the OCD part of me.			"

												This game did not impress me. The graphics were reminiscent of Wizard 101 but less cutesy. The controls were slow and clunky, combat was point and click with clunky animations and the skills were lackluster and generic. The crafting gave me hope, but it was shot down when this more interactive process caused the game to crash multiple times. On a whole, at present time there are more MMOs out there that are free and do everything better. This game excels at nothing thus far and isn't worth sticking around for. 3/10			"

												I wrote a big ol'review of the game on my blog but I thought I'd put the summary here on steam. If you want to read the full version you can find it here:  The Apathetic Gamer - Villagers and Heroes	[theapatheticgamer.com] The Basics	PositivesEnjoyable art and writingLarge crafting and gathering systemUseful player houses and villagesNegativesObject collision issues.To many base materials that can’t be sold.Clunky auction house.Poor inventory controlsWhen it comes down to it Villagers and Heroes is a  niche game that speaks to people who like to craft. Considering the game was made by a small indie studio the game is rather good. While it is playable and enjoyable there is still a lot of refining that I believe needs to be done. If the premise of Villagers and Heroes interests you then you owe it to yourself to give the game a try.			"

												I played this game a couple of months ago before I wrote this review. What I remember from my experience of playing this game is this. While I enjoyed the content that this game had to offer, or at least the content until the first city where I collect wool to tailor myself a piece of clothing, what I didn't enjoy was the combat system. My combat playstyle is usually hit-and-run and AOE spells. In this game, while I couls successfully execute AOE spells, I wasn't able to 'hit-and-run' since if I moved after I ordered a basic attack but before my character actually executes it, my character never executes it. I'd recommend this game for what it has to offer, but the combat system could benefit from some polishing up.			"

But however, this costs real money. The idea seems funny for those who got money to use.- The Bad> Music in game is repeating itself all the time. This wouldn't interfere if it wasn't ""bombastic"" fantasy mud.> The missions are sometimes messy. Where do you find this chicken? Where you need to deliver that feather?> Combat is sometimes stiff, example you cant move while you are attacking.> You only get two bags on start, if you want more space you need pay real money.> Game sometimes crashes without reason.GAMEPLAY - 90%GRAPHICS - 70%MUSIC - 50%-In short, this game is very childish. Bright colors used everywhere and graphics are cartoonish.Fighting in this  game is not challenging and is only clicking buttons. Missions follows the same pattern as in the other MMO Games: (Kill chicken, take feather, give it to that person etc.)Anything in the game doesn't seem hard or different.Is that a bad thing? Not necessarily.In my opinion this reminds me RuneScape -game, that you can play without further tense and madly screaming.This is game for those who wants something very simple, or those who aren't ready to pay World of Warcraft's monthly fees.-Total score: 7.9 "

												Disappointment and Disjointed.These words best describe a game that had some grand ideas, yet simply failed to deliver. The key draw of this game, of course, is that it combined WoW-ish gameplay, with UO-ish housing and crafting. Unfortunately, it simply doesn't deliver on either.The graphics, to start with, are low quality as they can get. The coding for the game is obviously not optimized, as even on normal settings, I found myself with only 38 - 40 FPS, on a rig  that can run crysis 2 on max settings, and still get 50 FPS, and skyrim, well, we won't even talk about how great the framerate on that is, even with max settings and numerous graphical improvement mods. Graphics, however, are forgivable, if the gameplay is good. Ultima Online stood on this for years, because of the depth of the crafting system, and the housing system.Stability was also an issue, at first. For the first two hours, my game kept constantly, and randomly, crashing to desktop without any notice or erorr messages, every two or three minutes, while I was trying to craft things. My guess? I probably clicked a button too fast, and the game's code took offense at it.One thing that this game -does- do well, is that a good chunk of materials can also be gathered by killing monsters, tying the crafting sections in with the combat sections and, if they had imposed some type of skill cap limit, would have made fighters every bit as valuable to a village, as the villagers themselves. Of course, the draw of the game is that you can decide to either be a villager, or adventurer. In truth, you're simply an adventurer that sometimes dapples in villager-lite actions.I was extremely excited when I finally got the chance to build my own home and enter a village, even so much that I just went to a random, newly-created town, and built it there. I was intrigued at first, that you had to actually stockpile a specific amount of resources at each node, to activate it. This quickly turned to disappointment, when I found out that, while you only need to gather 30 - 50 of the resource to stock the node, this stock depleted. Indeed, stocking the node with 30 of an item, seemed to give it 182 charges to gather from, before you'd have to restock the bin again. Which is actually pretty great.Except that you cannot restock the bin with resources gathered in that village, and you can only gather from your own village. This basically means that there is no purpose to loading a resource node up with any resources, unless you plan on tripling the resource and then immediately camping it to boost your own investment (Otherwise someone else can just steal it from you), or unless you want to use it to power-level the gathering skills of new players in relative safety.Instead, you're just simply better off going to a random zone, and gathering at one of the nodes that never disappears. The game also claims that you can only gather so much in a day, due to an energy bar limit, but I did not encounter this at all in four hours of gathering, though it would also be another dermit, if I had.Housing has to be great, however, right?Wrong. Unlike UO, you cannot enter your house. Instead, the house gives you bonuses to specific parts of your adventurering.. but there's a catch. It costs a lot of gold for even the first bonus. Twenty-thousand gold, to be exact. The other bonuses are even more signifcantly difficult to get, requiring rare items, for very small bonuses. Then there is your little farm plot and animal pen. My sheep went to sleep within five minutes, and I couldn't even interact with him for three hours afterwards, so I can't say too much on that process, other than the fact that I couldn't add any more sheep, because my sheep passed out and I couldn't tend to him to increase my skill.Then there's the farming. In most games, you plant some seeds, you harvest them, you get back at least 2 seeds and some crops. In this game, you plant some seeds, you harvest them, you get one crop per seed planted, which, if you get enough skill, you can re-plant once. With level 4 farming, I couldn't even re-plant the level 1 wheat crop I harvested. In the end, it's another situation of something that seemed like a great idea, but was destroyed by bad design choices.So what's the verdict, then? Do you play it, or do you not?Well, if you're a fan of runescape-ish games, have a lot of free time, and are a farmville fan, this game would probably suit you just fine. The cash shop, at least, isn't completely in your face, and while I could see storage issues (Which are solved by the cash shop, at not too horrible prices, at least) cropping up at later levels of the game, after gathering and hording everything for four hours, I had no problem with it.If you're looking for something that lets you decorate a home, really give you ownership of your village, and generally reward you for investing in the village, you'll be sorely disappointed, and I suggest you simply pass this one on.The developers, for what it's worth, seem to be fairly active on the steam forums, and seem to genuinely want to make a great game. Perhaps, in the future, they will take feedback and process it. With the right alterations, and the proper polish, this game could easily become a diamond, at this stage, however, it is a decidely rough cut.			"

												This is probably one of the only games i have played where the most boring tasks are actually fun, i spent about 3 hours picking apples and fishing just to raise up my levels in Plant Lore and Fishing but not because i had to but because i wanted to discover everything that there was to discover. This is going to be a game that i play daily and i would definitely recommend it to other. 9/10			"

												While I find graphics acceptable, animations are not, they are terrible to look at.  In addition NPC's greeting you in random language for no reason and combat makes no sound AT ALL. This game is a unfinished mess for which someone wants to get money. (That is why it is free to play.)			"

												Avoid!!! terrible graphics, half the objects in the game are not solid, the combat is extremely bland and the controlls feel clunky. The game feels like it was made by zynga (or some equally terrible game manufacturer)It feels unfinished and the microtransactions are for things like ""craft 10x faster"", ""do 10% extra damage"" etc. The game, in places is badly optimized and causes frame drops for no reason, the combat is simple, needing only 1 or 2 buttons to be mashed and although i was in a british server the NPC's spoke russian and german varying between the two mid sentence.To add to that the game crashes regularly and is just the generic mmo experience..it copies many things from WoW, diablo, runescape etc.			"

												For those of you who may be fans of Villagers and Heroes, I offer my apology in advance. I'm not trolling. So please hear me out. According to the System Requirements listed below, it reads:Originally posted by author:RECOMMENDED: OS: Windows® 8, 7, Vista, or XP Processor: Intel® Core 2 Duo 2.2GHz, AMD Athlon™ 64 X2 2.6GHz or better Memory: 4 GB RAM Graphics: Graphics card with 512 MB of memory or more DirectX: Version 9.0 Network: Broadband Internet connection Hard Drive: 3 GB available spaceNow, I am using an HP Pavillion dv7 running Windows 7, with 8GB of RAM, an Intel Core i7 Processor, and an ATI Radeon 6770M dedicated video card. In spite of this, Villagers and Heroes struggles to perform on even the lowest graphics settings. Why is this a problem when I am exceeding the system recommendations?Taking into consideration that I can run other MMOs like Dungeons & Dragons Online, Star Wars: The Old Republic and World of Warcraft at 1600 x 900 with the graphics settings at medium with no problem, there should not be performance issues. But for me, Villagers and Heroes is somehow unplayable.- even though the game is supposedly running at 20fps, it looks like 1 frame for every 2 seconds- Mouse responsiveness is painfully slow- game freezes at character creation- no soundUnless you have money to burn, or a monster gaming rig with an nVidia Titan, save yourself the trouble. Don't download it.			"

												Feels like a baby runescape. Still half decent, not pay to win which is absolutely beautiful.But the ♥♥♥♥ing combat HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥ The combat doesn't seem like an important part of the game initially, but you get thrusted into it just to keep any interesting things in the game. Why the combat is♥♥♥♥♥♥br>1. It is click and wait to fire. Terrible lag makes this cringeworthy2. Combat levels up like any other skill, but extremely slower than the others. This means the experience ratio compared to say fishing, is way off. Level 1 spot for fishing could get you to about level 10 easy in a bit, getting level 10 in combat takes about 6x that length off level 1 enemies.3. The abilities run off of high costs so you can't spam if you're a wizard, so you have to wait to go into another fight.Advice for combat:1. Instead of point>click>wait, have the mouse as an aim and you can fire off of that, in range of course.2. Better servers3. Change the exp ratios But this game is good, the combat brings it down to a no.			"

Posted: November 21, 2015
												This is gonna be a long, in-depth review. While I give it the thumbs up, I do so with a grain of salt, and a very big grain of salt.But for those of you with TL;DR Syndrom, here is a short summary:  The game has graphics that look bad today, but has a good, nostalgia feel, while also giving a nice digital world look. Its a basic and standard MMO, but lacking in some content specifically, content found in other MMOs.So, to begin with, Im into MMOs. Personally, I am interested in a social MMO, with different aspects to play. Namely, housing, PvE-content, socializing among the community, dungeon runs, RP especially like a knight (like, wearing knights armour, sword, shield, horse) and some PvPing. Yes, I'm aware VnH does not have PvP, but more on that later.So, really, once you see the game world, and the store page, you'd think this game is just what I'm looking for, right? First off, the game is pretty entertaining in gameplay. The quests, while the standard, go gather x amount of this, talk to someone, find this, find that, can be rather interesting and entertaining enough. Crafting, while I'm not a big fan of it, plays a major role in you getting the best gear, weapons, etc. Furthermore, the community is so friendly that they'd simply all agree to craft you whatever item(s) you need/wanted. So it is possible to rank up your crafts at a relaxing pace.Classes: Its the usual class system that we've seen in all the other MMOs before:Heavy armoured, melee damage inflicting warriors, the OPed archers, the annoying healing Priests, and of course the-middle-of-all-the-classes, the wizard, who is a rather interesting class.The game is also not p2w at all. There are ways to get market items for free in drops and your daily Lucky Cards. The gear that takes real money, is simply for looks. It shows it comes with no new moves, attacks, or ratings to suggest buying one would give yourself an advantage in battle.Storage is a problem, but it is so much better than other MMOs, especially SWTOR and Eldevin. There are literally, 28 vaults you can rent, 3 more bags, and storage conatiners you can share with your other characters. Ultimately, without getting to the end of the game, I can tell you who the final boss will be. No darklord, no emperor, no stone lord, no evil wizard, witches, dark knights, or anything. Storage will be the final boss. The game should be called Storage Wars, as given enough time, it'll cause you tons of problems. So storage is a big time problem, but the storage you start out with, as well as the free vault, will give you a great start. The rest is for once you travel deep into the game. Something I would like to see added to the game:Mini games. Somethin to do to pass a few minutes, earn a few coins, and maybe play against another player, like checkers, chess, duel etc. The games could be simple like, memory, side-scrolling and other such little things, VnH themed! It'd certainly help the game. I'd even be satisfied with that to count as PvP. Now, for the negatives. I'll list them, then explain. As you'll clearly see, this game is lacking majorly in some content that has become the standard in MMOs:1.No mounts.2. No PvP.Yep thats right. No mounts. Now, it wouldn't be such a big deal to me. I could make do without a horse to ride around on. Majorly dissapointed, yes. But not detrimental to the game. Now, why people couldn't raise aniamals to ride around on, like horses for example, it would fit in PERFECTLY with the game setting. Ultimately, the game is split into two halves: 50% deals with farming, gathering, and just being a neighbor.The other 50% deals with setting off on adventure to kill Ai monsters. So, raising a colt to a full grown horse wouldn't just make sense, it would only add to the game's depth, adding to the theme of the community working together to build a world, making it more interesting all around! Even Eldevin, who's mechanics, and graphics are much older than this game, has a VARIETY of mounts as well as also being set in a medieval world.Next, the PvP. Players love dueling it out on the internet. PvP arenas/ zones/ servers can be found just about anywhere on an online-themed game. So why not here? To keep the the community happy, they say. Well ok, I can try to deal with that. I understand that part. Sadly, it has kept me away from really jumping into the game, wanting to spending money, etc. on it. No pressure Mad Otter. Personally, I think that the lack of PvP is really what has also kept this game from becoming something bigger and being able to compete in the MMO market against the giants of the internet.Finally we have reached the Big One. Housing. Ok, at character creation (best creation I ever went through on a game!)So at creation, they ask for your house design. They list a few different styles for the outside of your house look. And, once you reach the capital city, right inside, is a guy named Donald. Who is, apparently, in love with the fact that players can own a house. He gives you a quest to go to any village and talk to his sister. The reward: one title to own a house! For free! You must simply choose the when and where! Exciting, isn't it?So, after settling down on a spot, I buy my house. First thing you'll see is, that there are DOZENS of outside decoration looks, but they cost real money. No matter though, its just whats on the inside, right?Long story short, there is no housing. All that hubbub about how wonderful they are? Apparently being able to have an extra vault, with access to all your storage areas, is something wonderful everyone should have!Scam of the game, I call it.There is talk they'll add interior housing to the game, but no immediate plans of when and it dont sound like the devs are even working on it as of 11/21/15.Final con: The moderators. Long story short, they're pretty much the refferee of the chat. Sounds good, right? Well, apparently, they feel(or have been told) that when there is one or more players who're fighting in chat for whatever, they can threaten and ban, those players from using the chat for a set period of time. Naturally, for veteran players, this would be a serious penalty. For new players, it'd simply drive 'em away from the game. Just my two cents on that matter. To wrap it up: I'm still not sure how long term I'm gonna be on this MMO. With the lack of any sort of PvP, mounts, and housing, my interest fades quickly.Beyond that, the game is still nice, nostaglic, DEFINITELY NOT p2w. Some of these p2w reviews feel like a free game means no cash shop and when they see one, its ""p2w"" in their minds. Lol. I will at least keep playing off and on, seeing if the game improves. But for how long, I cannot say. If another MMO appears to have just what I want, then most likely, its bye bye Villagers and Heroes.			"

I only recomend this game for the nostalgia trip it will give gamers of the 90s, theres so many old type of bugs that use to plauge early mmos and havent been seen since.			"

												There are no excuses for games these days that either cost over $40 or are made poorly.While this game atleast doesn't come with an expensive price tag, everything else about it just feels like it was never beta tested.Combat is messy, move, look or anything and cancel your auto attack.sprite issues.. to be honest read the reviews, there are hundreds already that make it clear as towhy one should NOT play this game.Not worth wasting your time.

												This game has a neat crafting system. It's so incredibly easy to excel. However, when you buy a house in a village you must CONSTANTLY pay rent or else the house will disappear without warning or any way to recover said house. This includes any farming you had done or ranching. I lost everything I was working on in a 2 week span. Most other games give you notice and you pay rent for months. NOT weeks like this game. I mioght recommend this game for a young kid because of the bright colors and easy game play etc, but for the regular gamer I would say no.			"

												This game needs help, it started as a facebook game and it is not much better then that. The graphics are cartoonish but that is an art choice, yet it requires a powerful computer to run smoothly on high ""detail"". Now this game is not for combat, it is about the crafting as it is fairly well fleshed out and wasy to understand. Yet the developers found out about this and placed a stopper on crafting, assuming to stop botting but all it has done is harm the actual player. This is due to the ease of creating other accounts who have no restriction on creating potions to remove this blockade put down by the devs.Next the lag in this game is atrocious there is alot of skipping, getting stuck in objects and being hit by enemies that are no where near you (this is also tied into the ""combat"" of the game). I did some research and this lag has something to do with the old code from this games facebook days, but this brings up the games combat system, or lack there off. It appears as a turn based combat system at first however it is real time, its just missing all forms of depth and complexity. All you do is spam combat arts and spells with the occasional auto attack and things die, but each attack has an animation and once the animation is begun it is a guaranteed hit unless a dodge is performed. Except no enemy dodges attacks only players.This leads to my playthrough being a hammer fest of the number keys and then spamming the z key when it got too much, but that is also down to RNG it appears as i died many times during a roll. Next up is stats of the character, health and spirit restore way to slow. 40 points a minute out of combat is atrocious, this leads to players waiting for a half hour at higher levels waiting doing nothing, there are potions however yet I can only find them in the pay money to the dev section. Death is meaningless, except for the part where you do less damage and take more for 10 minutes meaning you have to wait (or pay the dev). Now leveling, i was going to beat the game until I spent about 10 hours grinding exp in an area my level only to find my total exp went up 5%. I had to check my numbers but it is about that, the requirements go up exponentially without the gained exp going up a decent amount. So now i have to wait to partake in laggy boring combat that is worth nothing... so glad i can craft oh wait my bot accounts haven't finished. I gave up and went back to EvE online as it is more excitingSo we have a crafting game that makes you pay to keep crafting or exploit a bottable set of commands, horrid lag, bare bones combat, long waiting between battles and death unless your a healer with a level up system designed by morons. This game needs to be pulled down, decompiled and remade by competent game developers who have some idea how to make interesting combat, better netcode, proper leveling system and better anti bot measures then just breaking the part of the game that is worth a damn.2/10 Not worth the time really, only play if you have so much time on your hands after watching paint dry for an hour			"

												If u can't pay the money for getting the elder scrolls: skyrim then you can get this. It's similar to skyrim, apart from the fact that every aspect about it is a complete downgrade from skyrim! I don't recommend this game, but if you do like this game, then I would definitely recommend that you upgrade to the better game in all aspects: skyrim!			"

												This game literally gave my computer cancer, the only redeeming factor was ease of uninstallation thanks to steam's convenient interface, I started playing and was immediately accosted by graphics that wouldn't have passed muster on the n64,  some of the worst character designs I've ever seen in a game, and music so mindlessly average they would have been better served to have simply left it out. In spite of all of this I decided to roll a character and play for a while, that was an aweful, aweful mistake. I would like the time I spent playing this back, everything from questing to skills, to combat, to professions was so disgustingly below average I thought I was playing something coded by the makers of Runescape, If 5 monkey coded for 5 years on 5 computers you would have villagers and heroes. Once, the pope downloaded villagers and heroes, played it, and declared satan the clear winner at reality. If you're thinking of downloading this, a glass of bleach may be preferable for an evening's entertainment. Now if you'll excuse me I'm off to set this hard drive on fire to erase the shame of having ever downloaded this.			"

												The game is pretty entertaining. I loved it enough to spend about 20$ on it. There are some things I'd like to see improved. The quest log is a good example of that... I don't read quests and having to scroll through that quest log and figure out which quest it was that I am doing is just a pain, takes time away from gameplay. The graphics kill me inside, I have mine turned to extreme and it still feels like I'm running around in EverQuest vanilla. LOL. And my last complaint is the way the attack systems works... it's slow and a little weird feeling. But with those three problems aside, I still enjoyed playing the game. Which usually as soon as I see crap graphics I turn a game off. But this game has potential.			"

												First of all its a hack and slash game and im not reallya fan but it was okay,But the graphics kinda let the game down and the walking mechanism plus the map doesnt show where the next quest is, if i was you id spend £30 to get guild wars (which i have played for about an hour then stopped because i dont like hack and slash) or play war thunder dont even bother with this game.

												It´s basically russian clone of WOW and Runescape. Like in most of mmo games there is grinding involved. Characters talk russian or german even when you choose english .The community is 95% russian so if you aren´t russian you won´t find someone to chat with in this game. But i guess if you don t have things to play this can be your choise so i give this game 4/10.			"

												The game is pretty entertaining. I loved it enough to spend about 20$ on it. There are some things I'd like to see improved. The quest log is a good example of that... I don't read quests and having to scroll through that quest log and figure out which quest it was that I am doing is just a pain, takes time away from gameplay. The graphics kill me inside, I have mine turned to extreme and it still feels like I'm running around in EverQuest vanilla. LOL. And my last complaint is the way the attack systems works... it's slow and a little weird feeling. But with those three problems aside, I still enjoyed playing the game. Which usually as soon as I see crap graphics I turn a game off. But this game has potential.			"

												A FUN ALPHA BUILD!! (many bad programing errors and feutures that are not polished yet)I played this game today with my wife for some fun, to enjoy a nice MMORPG. At first look it is great tones of stuff to do, open world style mmo (you dont have to do anything more than the tutorial to do things) and it was quite fun for the first hour.I encounted many issues, mainly with programing. The game works but there is many ""Hacks"" in the program, that can and will be exploited if not fixed. (Hack as in a way to program something in, not the right way leaving it open to be exploited, not expecting it to be exploited). It also casues load issues and in some cases can cause system to crash.The tutorial needs to be worked on and as it sits it is great, it just does not explain ""Everything"" as in expecting your players to read your tutorial that is longer than 2 sentences is not going to work. They wont, they want to play and you are only wasteing time putting it there.For the remainder of my time I spent it seeing how much you can troll newbs, and there is alot of trollability. Step one grab a auto clicker. Step 2 find a place where a newb is trying to gather stuff. step three point curser at resource. step four activate auto clicker. Then poor newb cant collect there should be a priority system giving priority to the last person that used node (1 - 3 seconds) this can and will stop this main form of trolling that is already going around in your game.so to Wrap this upFUN 8/10SYSTEMS 5/10 (NEEDS WORK NOT POLISHED)STABILITY 2/10 (MANY HOLES NEEDS PATCHING)This game is playable, but not a place you can build a community right now (As that is what the everyday MMORPG gamer wants).

												This is a usual MMO RPG, though this one appears to be a bit low-badget. I don't mind the graphics and I can deal with the unoriginal quests, but I couldn't deal with constant lag and the weird character movement. I didn't compare it with major games like World Of Warcraft but I have tried a lot F2P MMO RPG and I can honestly say there are better than this out there.It has plenty of professions to lvl up and the skills are obtained by items, the items you craft and combine. This is a good twist on the lvl up to obtain the new skill model. The talent tree lacks a bit though, not much to do there. The combat is the basic shortcut but....less. The skill ""manifestation"" is lacking to a point that auto-attack might be more desirable to the eye.This might happened to me only (maybe my screen settings) but at night (in game) it was too dark. Raising the brightness (in game) distorted the colors of the brighted places and raising the brightness of my monitor was blinding me when the day came. Maybe they wanted to give the real night impression like some other games to prevent to hunt at night easily but waiting for the sun to come up was adding to the lack of interest.I didn't play much so I cannot say about end game or even how it progresses, but it is a game that couldn't make me wanna hit the launch button again.  I do not hate it, it was not bad, but I didn't like it either. I believe the word ""average"" is what best describes it.			"

												Gathering, crafting, ranching and gardening is what continually keeps me logging into this game and wanting to play. There are village projects to upgrade crafting stations to give bonuses to your crafting! They have this Gnogging system where you can truly create very unique items. It mixes theme park and sandbox elements very well. Your not pidgeon holed into just doing one or two things. There is so much to do in this game. The crafting has real meaning and the graphics are great if you love the style... and it's free!  "

												MMO players who always have to ask ""Where is this?"" ""How do I do that?"" or ""Can someone tell me a bacon story?"" should start here. Don't bother starting out anywhere else. This is as basic as it gets for you. If you are an EXPERIENCED player, skip it. End of story. A child could...wait...I actually saw some people ""claiming"" they were ""adults"" having troubles figuring this one out. Just..don't bother.			"

												This is a very dull game. Once you hit level 16 in any crafting skill there will be a brick wall that blocks your progression. This is valled ""Vim."" It's like stamina or energy. You can only craft or gather a certain amount of times before you've run out and must wait or buy potions from the cash shop to refill it. I would not recommend this game, mainly because crafting is all it really has going for itself and even that feels like a grind.As for the combat it's super basic. Not even worth mentioning.			"

												Another review by Gaius Julius CaesarI have found that this game is a enjoyable game with lots of people who seem to play it and enjoy it. This is different for me however, I find the lag to be allmost murderous, I, at times, thought I would die before the game did what I asked, if I said for the character to move to a different spot it would take many seconds before it even started to move. Loading is okay but the moving around the map is pathetic.I still do tyr to put up with this game but i do not go on it much, as it requires a lot of patience to use. Patience is not a thing you will find in me when it comes with games like this. So if you have a high patience level then I would say you might want to get this game, but if you don't then do not get this game, you might hate yourself if you do. Yours SincerlyGaius Julius Caesar			"

												First let me state this game crashes CONSTANTLY! I am talking about every 5-30 minutes. Shorter if you are crafting. Secondly, this game is all about item mall. You want more bag space? Pay $. Want to harvest more? Pay $. Want anything that might be slightly useful? Pay $. This game is just after your wallet. You'd really be better off paying $5-20 for another game on steam because at least with that game you get it all for that price. This one would be really expensive if you wanted to do a lot of the higher level stuff.			"

												This game would randomly shut down like hitting alt-f4. No error messages or anything. When it didnt do that it wouldn't let me online. It would state could not connect to steam account or servers are down. Outside that I played other games that have better graphics than this one, all of which i can run at the highest graphics settings. This game requires so much I had to turn my computer down to medium graphics. It is a very demanding game as far as resources from your computer. Gameplay is good. Reminds me of Runescape.			"

												Playing Villagers and Heroes was a terrible experience. Im not going to talk about the ugly graphics or the bugs and glitches that sometime can be very annoying, or the server lag, that even in a half empty EU server can be an issue. Im going to talk about the bad game design:  There is no looting system, yeah right, NO LOOTING SYSTEM, party loot is ALWAYS FREE FOR ALL, imagine how that can work well in a mmorpg. Quests are the worst designed quests I ever seen, and I did play a lot of games. Tedious as hell, and often barely give you hints about what to do. Crafting looks deep at first, but it is quite boring and a very huge money sink, and the ton of different crafting mats will fill up your storage very fast, forcing you to buy space with real money, or throw stuff away. Spirit regeneration, mana-like power bar that is used by all classes (4) to use skills, is a big pain in the butt, you are probably meant to craft huge stacks of potions, because there is no food or /sit option to bring that regen up. You just stand around watching it ticking up veeery slowly all 3-4 mobs. Someone said it gets better when you level up but no idea how much better it would be. I really wanted to try it for the crafting that looked interesting, but as I seen that leveling it up burns tons of money, making you probably have to grind money for that, I stopped trying.			"

If you like to pay for your inventory (you get 2 bags, the other 4 you have to either rent or you can buy perm, both which cost real money) this is also your game. If you like MMOs that have poor art, takes massive amounts of video card power to run graphics on medium+ and still looks like crap, pi$$ poor combat (anywhere from 2-4 seconds before you actually use a spell that are instant cast mind you), you get where I am going. As you can see I really have nothing good to say about this other than I've already uninstalled.Tl;dr-Poorly optimized.Poor combat.Lack of base options for character design.Lack of character classes.Pay-2-expand inventory.

												So after getting over that the game itself feels cheap (basically characters have no feeling of weight about them, same animations for moving straight or diagonally etc,) I was then HORRIFIED to find that the unique aspect that had attracted me to this game in the first place (being part of a village) was inaccessable to me, as all the villages were full to capacity (except the guild villages).Of course i could have grown my character, got myself invited to a guild etc. in time, but why would i want to waste my time playing what would have just been a sub standard MMORPG up until then?Not for me, im afraid.

												I have played a lot of games, and I mean a lot. Mostly MMO's in fact. I have never seen one so undiverse,  with no depth, and riddled with bugs as this one.	To start off, you are placed in some Hollow place, where you have to kill wolves for a lady (which might I add may be difficult), this is the start of a almost 1 1/2 hour tutorial where you do unuseful things, such as gather wood, just so you can walk over five feet and make a bow that you proceed to take to some guy and he gives you a better one, thus making the bow you spend ten minutes on useless. You can learn to cook, or brew alcoholic beverages, by shaking a tree and a few button clicks. The tutorial is long, basic, uninteresting a crueling and teaches you absolutely nothing useful about the actual game.	Let's talk a little more about the crafting. While the crafting is much like Guild Wars 2's ""Click, UI pops up, click on what you want, some time passes, item pops out"" it is actually very immersive in the fact that your crafting is nearly unlimited. It goes to a very high point and you can basically craft any weapon, armor or anything else you want if you have the materials		Characters. This just makes me angry beyond all recognition. It should make you angry . A priest, hunter, warrior and mage. REALLY. You couldn't have at least tried to come up with one ORIGINAL class. It's really not that hard. Just make a hunter with a special twist, but NOOOOOOO, no originality in this game. There is nothing original about any of the classes, they do the same thing that they do in every game. To add to the unoriginal characters, they have their own ""Talents"" where you put your points when you level up. There is only around 12 places to actually put your talent points. Then you just keep putting them into the same ones, ""upgrading"" the talent.	While the talents are not abundent, the skills are. Woodcutting, Plant lore, and fishing are just a couple. They all have unique perks and as you level up you get ""Achievements"" which gies you some in game money to spend. This is useful not only from a money standpoint, but also from a resource standpoint, you don't just grind mobs for money. Sadly, the fish are just recolors of another fish for the most part.	Combat. Combat is a copy paste of WoW, just like the rest of this game. You click, and your character auto-attacks, you can use your 1-0 keys to aid with your various skills that unlock over time. Combat is nothing special, and pretty bland. Once you kill an enemy, your loot flys fifty feet into the air and spews all over the place. Annoying. And if you help someone kill another monster, and you aren't in the same party, then you might not get the loot. To top it all off, all the quests are ""Go kill X amount of _____ animal. Come back to me when you did it."" it's just a ""grind"" to the death.	Let's talk about graphics & UI. The graphics aren't that great, after all this is 2014. THis game honestly looks like the old Spyro games. I went to add my friend to the friends list (if they had one, I didn't know if they did). I searched the menu until I found the friends list, only to find that there is no search. You have to go and FIND your friend in order to add them. When you find them they have to hold still so you can ""inspect"" them and then move to the top of the screen to add them. It's a bother.	Quests. I have gone briefly over quests in the tutorial section of this segment, BUT let me elaborate. The main questline is hardly thrown together. Side quests are repetitive, and even some of them DON'T EVEN WORK. You can't comeplete some of the quests. Not once have I ever seen an MMO where you can't complete a quest. Sometimes you can't even talk to the person who gave you the quest in the first place.	Glitches. They are like your BFF in this game. There are too many. Everywhere you look you may get stuck in a building or fall through the map or something else that should not happen. As previously mentioned you might not be able to speak to the person you need to either.	Map. The map is not open, it's just a bunch of miniscule, pre-defined maps, with pre-defined spawns. In order to go to another part of the world you go to some teleporter that isn't explained at all and is kind of just there. It's not open or free at all. You feel confined to a small space in every map.	Cliche. There is a central city with all the merchants and teleporters to a whole bunch of different parts of the map. That is so cliche of MMO's I can't describe how angry that makes me. With the teleporters there is also lag as it genereates, so that is useless. Now let's take a nice little look at my personal ratings of this game.Graphics- 2.5, welcome to the 1990's where there were no graphics but boxes. Oh, and fake looking huts. Story- 3, Thrown together by a three year old, I see no connections whatsoever to each character you go to other than where they live Gameplay- 1, This game is so broken it is no fun to play Mechanics- 3, It is playable, but it looks as if it should not be released, almost like it is early ALPHA. The controls are clunky and finicky. Replay Value- 0, don't even bother to play it.Soundtrack- 9, THE ONE THING THAT IS GOOD!! They have a nice soundtrack, suits the towns.Overall: 3, This game isn't worth the time. It was so terrible I couldn't bear to play it the full 5 hours I promise to do before a review. STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME!			"

It's one of those RPG's that have a story wich basically ends about ten seconds after game start, then you have to find people in the game that are impossible to find (even with the minimap) and then kind of fade away to other crappy quests that are just as rubbish.Also, it take ages to load.

												I dont have a lot of hours in this game but those hours I do have, I got all of them in one week of play the first week it came out. I managed a trade guild back before even being in guilds was ""cool"" I dont know if it is now. But it was a lot of fun I played a lot because I cared about the guildies under my reign. I made sure everyone was properly geared and was enjoying themselves. But this could happen in any mmo and honestly this is not a good mmo in my opinion. I would suggest others, but I also would suggest trying this one, It is free, its not terrible and if you are just looking for a few hours of fun why not?I dont really know where this review is going, I guess the real message is that Black Company was a great guild back in the day. The most important part of that is ""back in the day"" which is where the good parts of this game remain.So I think this is really my final goodbye to this game. Goodbye4/10			"

												I tried this game in response to a giveaway of one of the content packs and was pleasantly surprised. I find the graphical style rather charming, cartoonish yet reflecting higher resolution GPUs. I concur with many about the crafting system having plenty of depth, though you should probably get some more inventory slots in order to get the most out of it. I have only played the Swift Warrior class so far, which didn't get very high level wise because I was out leveling my crafting and gathering skills. And man, did I enjoy fishing. My only complaint in the four hours of gameplay is that crafting/gathering items from skill use are automatically picked up but players have to manually pick up items gathered from killing monsters, and these items can fall in areas no seen by players. I looked in the settings but didn't see an option to automatically pick up loot. This option would cut down on the time spent twirling about and searching for that treasure. #featurerequest			"

												I gave it an honest shot. Unfortunately, this game felt dated and uninteresting. It lacked immersion to keep me occupied. It was a struggle to actually log in and play as I wasn't interested in anything the game really had to offer. That being said, it didn't seem to have any problems; server or bugs. Quests lacked flavor, story line is not memorable, and characters are post dated. Best thing about this game, it is free to play.			"

Posted: April 21, 2014
												A free slow paced MMO based on simple gameplay and horrible combat.The movement in this game is very sloppy, making you almost laugh at the sliding of players around you. The combat system is also slow and not very fluent, if you move at all, hit a skill by accident or practically do anything while auto attacking, you will completely stop what your doing and the abilities you tried to use will go on cooldown. I can't see how that is viable at any point in the game.Okay then, I get it. The game is called VILLAGERS and heroes, maybe the crafting and exploration part of the game was what it was all about.. but that was not the case. Finding the materials is very easy and when you go to craft items, the game basically does everything for you. You can walk several feet in a village, gather the items needed to cook/fish/shear/whatever and then go back to the area, pick what you want to make and then sit back and watch your guy do every for you. How is that fun? I was hoping a minigame or something interesting to do while cooking or say you had to hammer weapons or armour at a blacksmith? wouldn't that be more fun than watching your pixels stir a pot of apples?So at this point in the game, the combat is sluggish and outdated, the movement is awkward, the quests and zones are way to linear and the crafting/socialization of the game is completely simple and dead. I really don't understand what the appeal is.A and D turning should of been improved, and when you look at players moving, they tend to slide due to sluggish movement design. I've asked several people in game and they feel the same way.And why are the quest givers speaking in atleast 3 different languages when I am set to english?I understand its in beta, but I fail to understand why i'm being spoken to in english, russian and german.This game is still in its early beta, so these things could be fixed and upgraded before it is fully released, but its really hard to endure even an hour of this when you have experienced quality games like World of Warcraft and other MMO's. (Thats not to say its complete garbage, as the forementioned games are subscription based and have time behind their backs to master the this subject of gaming.)The small player base, having only several players in any given area, makes the chat dead and empty, accept for the occasional moderator snooping around, dropping filter hammers on your head.On that note, I said ""crap"" in chat, and I was told to not use curse words or I should leave the game. Clearly, this game is highly censored, which is a huge turn off for me. I do however, like the art design very much, a nice casual blend of sharp detail and a nice mesh of colours makes it looks very pretty.Character design is very primitive and the players look very ugly. But thats not important.What is important, is the store. It has a large selection of cosmetic items, gag items and unfortunetly has Pay 2 Win, making this dead to me the minute I logged on. (combat potions. bro, those are pay to win)All in all, its just another cheap MMO. Give it a go if your looking for a free game to play or just casually sit around with friends, but don't expect anything special.I also find it odd how recommended reviews are always highly rated up, even when there is no content. It's almost like people can't stand having this substandard game rated down. Anyway, they tried, they failed horribly and now this is another sad pimple on the face of MMO history. Enjoy :PPersonal Rating: 1.5/5			"

												 Granted, I didn't play this game for more than 10 minutes. I really wanted to enjoy it because the trailers look pretty amazing, but then you realise that the controls are extremely jerky and unrefined. The aestethics of it can be a tad bit weird at times, but that doesn't matter. However, it's the sheer unprofessional look of all of the GUI. It looks as if it belonged to a flash game. Also, for me the NPCs talked in russian for some reason, although the text was in english. But even if you can get past these unpolished aspects, the gameplay and the way it controls just killed it for me.			"

												There are a lot of great ideas here, but sadly they are implemented horribly.  Combat is floaty and unresponsive.  Quests are standard run of the mill kill x rats, gather x berries, etc.  Crafting is a boring grind.  The staggering amount of things you have to pay for is insane.  Worst example I saw in the short time I played was in order to queue up crafting jobs (ex: smelt all your copper ore) you have to buy a consumable item.  That lets you craft 10 items at a time, once.  Free to play has such massive potential for great consumer experiences (see Path of Exile), but if developers keep putting in blatant money grabs like this that only hinder gameplay, it will continue to have the terrible reputation that it does.

												   Wow... where do I start with this? This game... if you can call it one... is... ridiculous. For starters this game lags HEAVILY on my computer, especially because I run TF2 ALOT and it runs beautifully. After tweaking a few graphic problems, another problem came up for me. The amount of characters and customization was just BAD. They were all standard and could've been more creative besides the whole DPS, support, ranged, and healer standard.    I chose the Archer and began in a town overrun by wolves. Now the idea was standard for a beginning point, but the combat, OH THE COMBAT.     The combat in this game is the worst part besides something else we'll get to later. The combat is slow, especially with the Archer. It took me forever to use one attack. Compared to something like DC Universe Online or other MMO's of this rank, the moves from what I saw with the beginning Archer aren't very diverse.    Now I tried some other ones on the downloaded version on the original website and they all were very standard as well. The Fighter or Warrior was slow but not like the Archer, the Mage is a faster and more powerful Archer, and the Cleric is actually the OK class. It's not the worst, but it's better than most of these characters.   Now we got the MAIN aspect that this game has been titling, the crafting, jobs, and house ownership. I hated this with a passion. I enjoy doing crafting and sometimes jobs and I'm a nut with customization, but this didn't appeal to me. The main reason being it was ALL done FOR YOU. I mean common, all it required was for you to go fech some supplies and let the game do it for you. Couldn't we have a minigame, maybe somekind of lore or SOMETHING behind this piece to keep it interesting. After the dissapointment of crafting, I tried jobs, and the same problems occured. So I tried the house ownership, and even THAT was bland.    After all the dissapointment of this bland crafting and customization system, I tried the social. Nobody was talking, except for ONE person who commented on how bad the game was. So I gave up on this mess.   I only found a few redeeming qualities in this game, and it was just how holding these NPCs were to the player. Like, they gave you ALL the information you could possibly need.   Overall, don't waste the space for this ""game"". Don't buy the DLC, don't do anything. This game failed to immerse me into its world because it failed in about the first few seconds of GAMEPLAY. If you want a real immersive MMO, go get World of Warcraft or especially DC Universe Online, a game I can say granted alongside TF2 is the best F2P games out there. I beg of you, do not get this game. It will be a waste of the 30 minutes you spend in it. TL;DR: The game is a waste of time. The combat and whole ""social"" experience is horrible and there is little to no customization in the game. The games' immersion is just terrible and fails to grab the attention of most players. The only reedeeming quality was that the game held your hand like a little child. Don't download it, go play TF2 or DC Universe Online or any other better F2P game.			"

												This is a realy awkward feeling MMO. The controles feel jumpy and the quests are not easy to understand compared with most mmo's today.This game doesn't even come close to other free games we can play today and it's a shame that there are still people putting time and efford in games like this.The first quest for example took me 15min. because if 6 people attack one mob, the person doing the last hit gets the quest kill. How do you expect people to spend 15min. for only the first quest just to kill 3 wolfs.The combat feels weird and slow, there's no good/easy way to compare items or skills.I might be used to other good f2p mmo's / games but because those are out there this game is not going to live long.I recomand to skip this game and search for other f2p mmo's.

												I though about giving this game a try, and it's been painful. The first time I tried, it was yesterday. I connected to the only EU server that there was, and after making my character,I couldn't even connect, because it was full. I tried then the next day (today), and got the same luck. Then, a few hours later I tried once again, and finally I got into the game, to see how it was.Dissapointment is pretty much the best word. The graphics look really outdated, like if I was playing a game from the 2000's. You can't also move the characters that well, the controls are kinda bad. Then, add the fact that the servers lag way too much, and that the game is generic, WAY TOO GENERIC. It's like any MMO out there! Or at least what I've saw on the time I've spend on the missions and quest that they give you: Hit trees to get apples, hit trees to get wood, hit rocks to get minerals, hit generic monsters because there are too many.And that's another thing: The monster spawn-rate is horrible. It takes 2 minutes to 4 monsters to spawn, when over 10 people are waiting and trying to kill 4-8 for a quest. It took me 10 minutes to kill 5 skeletons that only took me 5 seconds to annihilate. The rest of the time was spend jumping arround, waiting until they're back, and trying to get the first hit ,so other players don't steal the monsters from me. And I ended up being the prick that steals the monsters because I had enough already.This is even worse than a generic MMO. A game that's been for a while already, that they decide to put on Steam so more people play it, and in the end, ends up making the game even more unplayable. I hope I don't have to see it ever again.			"

												Looking at all the negative reviews i had to see it for myself. I gave this game the benifit of the doubt as i'm an rpg lover and i do not believe graphics should be how a game is judged. Do not bother seriously this game handles worse than runescape. The mouse acceleration is woefully terrible. auto attack is responcive about 1 every 5 clicks. Character models and customisation is lack luster. Only the most forgiving and ignorant players who were able to play total crap should even waste the download space. Simply put this game suffers from not coming out 10 years ago where it may have had more luck in a world where you can get charged for games of much higher quality. 2.5D browser games for free have better content and systems than this game and your money is better aimed elsewhere. These bad reviews are written for a reason we do this to tell you guys not to bother when we see a poor product and inform you of what is good in situations you are undecided. If you read this and want to see for yourself how bad it is I am a person who read negative comments and went to see for myself and now i'm writing this review 20 minutes into your future. Save yourself the time and effort and do not pay these guys any money. they need to learn you get paid for good products in this world not shovel crap.			"

												Poor animations, poor models, poor combat, poor controls, poor performance. On a 980 Ti the framerate was around 50 with pretty heavy drops in the tutorial area.The crafting looked like it might have been reasonable, but unfortunately I couldn't bring myself to play that long.			"

												Gra słaba. 50 minut przegranych z czego 40 to pach. Jest bardzo słaba graficznie (postacie ślizgają się bardziej niż w pierwszych grach 3d). Gra nadaję się tylko dla dzieci by zabiło im to trochę czasu. Tyle w teamacie. Game weak. 50 minutes losers of which 40 minutes are updated. It is very poor graphically (figures slide more than in the first game 3d). The game is suitable only for children to kill them some time. So much in the topic.			"

												Let's see; IO played this game for about 34 minutes and right off the bat, I could tell it was unfinished.  The animatiosn seemed stilted and sucky.  But I persevered.  The quests are VERY generic and boring (go here, kill this many things, get this many things, return).  But then I got stuck.  You're supposed to shear sheep to get items to craft a belt.  But shearing the sheep DOES NOTHING!  Like Wonka says, YOU GET NOTHING!  At that point, its either just kill things or quit and being that there's no reason to keep playing if you can't advance farther, I quit.  And then there are the ENORMOUS amout of micro-transactions that are available.  This game just OOZES Facebook game, sadly.  And then you have the issue that the npcs switch between English, German, and Russian greetings!  What, they can't stick to ONE language greeting!?  I would say this game needs more polish, but I don't any amount of polish will save THIS one!  But on the bright side, it's a TINY download and you don't have to make an account.			"

In fact, it has mining, harvesting, smelting, and looking at bug hills to get bugs. (Oh mahgawds!?

												I have a pretty good rig. The initial fly-by is extremely choppy, on 800x640 (or is that 480?). I tried to change my resolution, but it just forced my monitor into a lower resolution and bumped the game's up - or in other words, I only saw the top-left corner of the screen. Character creation seemed neat, and maybe even like what's missing from a lot of MMOs these days, but the optimization is just too poor for me to stomach. I'd give it a fair shot if the game would let me.			"

												People are finding my initial review unhelpful. So i'll re-write it.If you still dislike my review its because you're being a fanboy/fangirl.-----The game had a lot of trouble just getting started. The launcher had to verify files. It took a very long time to load. And when I finally got it, I was greeted with stuttering gameplay. Not lag. The game itself doesn't run smooth. The tutorial really should be optional. Because after they teach you one task, its obvious that generally the same mechanic applies for the rest of the crafting. Combat. Its very clunky. Its very slow. You click a button and almost a full second or 2 later.. Your character reacts. Animations are very stale. The design of the game seems very crowded. The UI is also clunkly. The NPC dialogue window especially.But again.. My biggest problem was the stuttering lag. My computer is no slouch either. I run every game on I own on High with atleast 30 FPS. Usually 40-50. So its not my computer.The entire experience I had with this game was just not fun. It was boring. From the moment I logged in. Until I quit. You could not pay me to play this game.On that note. The game is free. But that doesn't mean you're not wasting your time...			"

												it is an ok game. the game itself isnt so bad, the admins on the other hand are horrible. they are complete power trippers and even if you say the ""A"" word in chat you get a 10 minute silence with no warning so you cant talk anywhere. when you ask why they give you another one for a half an hour. totally ruins the game. if you arent part of their click already you might as well not play and expect to chat if you drop the odd curse			"

												(ONLY 5 HOURS IN)The game feels and plays like a hybrid of WoW and other standard piano sim RPGs, Wurm Online, and (don't worry) zynga/loserville.There isn't a true moneygrubbing energy system as far as I can tell.  The game's equivellant (Vim) appears after 16 levels in.  They supposedly did this to make it easier to level, but it feels like the practice of brickwalling to extort money out of players. Fortunatly, it is fast regenning AND there are a ton of items, like foods, that let you regen it faster.Crafting is a two step process, as usual.  Gathering and creating.  You click on a node, which drops an item randomly chosen based on your level and the level of the node, and you pick it up.  There are many types of nodes, at least one for each gathering profession which can be levelled up.  For instance, if you collect 20 copper ore, then take it to an anvil and work it into 20 copper ingots, you can then work those into warrior weapons, armour, or a few special items.  Crafting is a large part of the game, as evident by the fact that you learn how to gather materials 2 minutes after learning how to fight.There are a lot of silly quests, such as freeing a man from his imprisonment in an archery target.  The man tells you you must brave the horrors of Mount Deadly, kill the deadly Hurtsubad, and collect 7 gems from around the world to combine into a staff that has just enough magic to free him from his curse.  When you point out that the archery target seems to resemble a man in a costume a lot, he'll say ""I had you going though!!""  This is only a few minutes of this quest, so don't worry too much about spoilers.Every MMO has it's useless and pointless minigame, and this one is no exception.  While other mmos make their pointless minigame crafting, this one actually made crafting worthwhile and fun.  Unfortunatly, to fill the void with something useless, they added a gambling game.  Not poker, or any other card game that would be fun.  No, you play Rock Paper Siccors.  Waste of time and gold coins, dont bother.  Tell you what I'd like to see for a pointless minigame.  Tiddly winks.  Yeah, really!  Don't you want to do the John Lennon Memorial Shot without actually being there?  No?  Oh okay.  Yeah, just joking around, don't add tiddlywinks.  There is apparently instanced villages, as well, which let you own your own house, and lets you stock/create resources through a node system where you collect 20 of something naturally, then put it into a stocking bin and it creates 200 of that item in a harvesting node.  THis can be used to create public copper mines or something similar for your players.After 5 hours of gameplay, I can say I recommend it. This review subject to change.			"

												This game is fun, the monsters are cute, and it is well thought out in many ways.  However, there are a few things that make me reluctant to recommend this game to my friends.  The lag makes this game frustrating/unplayable at times.  There is one other small change they could make to keep young players and new players.  In this game you have to craft your hp potions and sp elixers, meaning you have to spend hours gathering materials and crafting pots if you want to be able to play efficiently.  I find it very boring to craft potions and I want to jump right into the fighting action.  The developers could solve this by simply selling hp and sp by npcs so children (whom would never spend hours crafting just so they could play) would stay past the first few lvls.  The game is very fun and I would like to recommend it to my friends that all capped out at our last game, but the lag and tedious crafting of hp/sp pots makes me reluctant.  If they fix these 2 problems the game deserves a huge, loyal following.			"

												So, I've played 115 minutes up to now, reached level 7. Crashed to desktop 11 times and now stuck on a loading screen when trying to enter a new zone, which by the way the new patch they released was suppose to fix.  Those who haven't tried it out yet, it's worth a shot but if you're crashing to desktop every 5 to 10 minutes I'd wait a few weeks for more patches to be deployed.  I've played countless MMOs since 93 and Villagers and Heroes is a real CTD mess.  If they can fix the stuck loading screen and reduce the CTD by at least 50% , this game is definitely worth a try.

												This game is a simple, fun MMO for people who like cute graphics and fun characters. It plays a little differently than other MMOs, which I think is great because it can get boring when you just feel like you're playing the same game over and over. Don't like the cute graphics fool you though! Like most (if not all) games, it gets pretty challenging as you level up.			"

												A very bad game. It needs you to set your graphics so low to even run the game with normal FPS that its not worth it but it suggest that you would change your graphics to lowwer quality and if you want it does it auto matically but is still a bad game.			"

												I built an entire house, complete with a garden. I didn't log in for a couple of days and apparently my ""rent"" was due. I came back to find everything deleted, so I rage quit. Other than that, fun game. Lots to do.Update: Okay. I came back to this game about a year later. Things seem to be updated. I decided I was just going to go through the main story quest and see how far I can get. Turns out, they've added a lot of pay-to-win ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t into this game since I last played. Combat is ridiculous now. Just a bunch of button mashing that apparently does nothing. You get killed brutally by even low-level creatures. And then once you run out of those ""Ressurection Tokens"", they want you to buy more. I'll tell you what, guys. You make the game actually fun first, and then I'll consider spending money in your shop.			"

												As a long time MMO player, I was looking for a game that was low key with a good friendly community. I found this game and gave it a try. I really was beginning to enjoy it after a couple days. However, I then tried to log into the US2 server and found that it would not transfer data. I tried to resolve the issue to no avail. After 8 hours of attempting to get at least an answer as to why... I gave up. No customer service for any issues you may have. It is very unfortunate, I was looking forward to trying this one.			"

												This game is just...ugly. Poor character models, inanely bad landscapes, and laughable enemies make this game visually unappealing. The style begs to be compared to something like Fable, but it doesn't have the same charm.Gameplay-wise, you click an enemy, watch your character bash the enemy into bits, collect loot, rinse and repeat until you get bored as all hell and contemplate on life. Yes, it's dull, at least to me. That and the fact this is supposed to be an MMO, there aren't any other players...kinda see why now.Music is all stock and really forgettable, though I will say that the narrator has an epic voice, that's really the few redeemable qualities of the game.Overall a run-of-the-mill MMORPG with lackluster performance and incredibly uninspired gameplay.

												I read a lot of comments before deciding to give Villagers and Heroes a try. And I can say, I'm glad I did. Though I've only played about an hour or so I found I really like it. Being an avid MMORPG gamer I was impressed at the games straight forward playing. It took me a bit to get used to things but the more I played the more I settled.  I am glad to have found a game that I didn't feel pressured to have hurry to do this or that. In fact, I really enjoyed just being able to meander around the beginning town at my own pace exploring and getting familiar with things. I can say people who are looking for a laid back, play at your own pace and have an awesome time and happy time playing this game is for you. If you are looking for a heavy PVP or pressured PVE this game is not for you.			"

You didn't spend any money to get this game. You didn't lose anything, except however much time you put into it. The controls aren't, great, but I've definitely seen worse. The same goes for about everything in this game. Overall, it's average. But it's FREE. I know some people like it, and some people don't. Personally, I enjoyed it, but only because I could play with my friends. I disliked the lack of a thief class, but I didn't care that much about it. I guess I might as well end with, try it out, it's FREE!			"

At first the controls seem a bit strange, but after about 10 min, you soon adapt. The game play is generally quite smooth and the fighting style is like ""W.O.W"". Have only played the game for a short period, but actually do enjoy it. Would reccomend this to others, and shall be continue playing it in the not too distant future. For an MMORPG 3.5/4 out of 5.

												(ONLY 5 HOURS IN)The game feels and plays like a hybrid of WoW and other standard piano sim RPGs, Wurm Online, and (don't worry) zynga/loserville.There isn't a true moneygrubbing energy system as far as I can tell.  The game's equivellant (Vim) appears after 16 levels in.  They supposedly did this to make it easier to level, but it feels like the practice of brickwalling to extort money out of players. Fortunatly, it is fast regenning AND there are a ton of items, like foods, that let you regen it faster.Crafting is a two step process, as usual.  Gathering and creating.  You click on a node, which drops an item randomly chosen based on your level and the level of the node, and you pick it up.  There are many types of nodes, at least one for each gathering profession which can be levelled up.  For instance, if you collect 20 copper ore, then take it to an anvil and work it into 20 copper ingots, you can then work those into warrior weapons, armour, or a few special items.  Crafting is a large part of the game, as evident by the fact that you learn how to gather materials 2 minutes after learning how to fight.There are a lot of silly quests, such as freeing a man from his imprisonment in an archery target.  The man tells you you must brave the horrors of Mount Deadly, kill the deadly Hurtsubad, and collect 7 gems from around the world to combine into a staff that has just enough magic to free him from his curse.  When you point out that the archery target seems to resemble a man in a costume a lot, he'll say ""I had you going though!!""  This is only a few minutes of this quest, so don't worry too much about spoilers.Every MMO has it's useless and pointless minigame, and this one is no exception.  While other mmos make their pointless minigame crafting, this one actually made crafting worthwhile and fun.  Unfortunatly, to fill the void with something useless, they added a gambling game.  Not poker, or any other card game that would be fun.  No, you play Rock Paper Siccors.  Waste of time and gold coins, dont bother.  Tell you what I'd like to see for a pointless minigame.  Tiddly winks.  Yeah, really!  Don't you want to do the John Lennon Memorial Shot without actually being there?  No?  Oh okay.  Yeah, just joking around, don't add tiddlywinks.  There is apparently instanced villages, as well, which let you own your own house, and lets you stock/create resources through a node system where you collect 20 of something naturally, then put it into a stocking bin and it creates 200 of that item in a harvesting node.  THis can be used to create public copper mines or something similar for your players.After 5 hours of gameplay, I can say I recommend it. This review subject to change.			"

If I get round to the farming etc stuff I'll update, but for free it's better than others Free MMO I've tried. In fact, it's better than ESO as it actually works properly!			"

												This game is pretty fun in my opinion but seeing how people dont really like it alot saying how it sucks and all that jazz but hey this is a good game sure there maybe be a couple hiccups here and there and the voice acting for the NPC's isnt that good but hey every MMO is sometimes has it's ups and downs and combat isnt really what your expecting but hey sometimes you gotta go with the good and the bad and this is a free to play game and the DEVS are patching the game making it better. with every patch			"

												Haven't played for too long and for that, I'll keep it short.When I started the game I went through pretty generic customization meaning I could only change the face, hair, and a few other things to only the characters head. Things that I could change only had a few options to change (in other words, customization is pretty bland and you WILL see other players who look exactly like you).Oh well, the customization to your characters head shouldn't make or break the game, right?Next, I loaded into the starters area where I went through a pretty dull intro to the game mechanics. This time it was a pack of wolves or felcats or something of that nature annoying the villagers (never seen that before). On a side note, this game DOES run smoothly on the worst of computers (I know first hand). So if you cant play other graphically-intensive games out there, then this is for you.Oh well, it's the tutorial. Of course it's going to be boring just like in (most) other mmo's.Now, I know it's not sounding too hot as of now, but after the tutorial I encountered the communtity of the game. I was very pleased with my discovery. Once I began moving out of the starting area, I was met by some experienced players. They helped me complete quests, find hidden areas, and explained game mechanics which were way overwhelming to a starter at first (as in EIGHT different classes of crafting each with thier own experience levels, yikes!). Once those eight crafting classes were explained, what could've been a down had now turned into a complete positive! Eight different ways to play created many different play-styles along with new things to do.Now, I know I probably missed tons of things, so heres a quick list of Pros and Cons (not in order of importance).Pros:                                                                            Cons:-Runs well on the worst of computers                         -Bland customization-Friendly and helpful community                                 -Boring tutorial-Lots of variation to play styles                                    -Crafting can be overwhelming at first-Eight different forms of crafting                                -Combat is dull (click to attack along with 1,2,3,4,5,6,etc. for spells)-Simple and easy to play                                             -Storyline is a little underwhelming-Appealing to new players-Free-NOT PAY TO WINThanks, for reading! Keep in mind I'm still pretty new to the game so I might be updating the review as I progress. Also, I think this is my first review so sorry if the format was wierd. I definately recommend this game, plus it's free. If for whatever reason you dislike the game, you won't be wasting your money and it's as easy as pressing uninstall to move on.			"

												This game is just...ugly. Poor character models, inanely bad landscapes, and laughable enemies make this game visually unappealing. The style begs to be compared to something like Fable, but it doesn't have the same charm.Gameplay-wise, you click an enemy, watch your character bash the enemy into bits, collect loot, rinse and repeat until you get bored as all hell and contemplate on life. Yes, it's dull, at least to me. That and the fact this is supposed to be an MMO, there aren't any other players...kinda see why now.Music is all stock and really forgettable, though I will say that the narrator has an epic voice, that's really the few redeemable qualities of the game.Overall a run-of-the-mill MMORPG with lackluster performance and incredibly uninspired gameplay.

I like the exploring, the (not too technical - level 10 remember!) battles with creatures, the crafting, the interactions with NPC and the quests. I have yet to experience the village/house part of the game, so cannot comment on this yet. Only bad experience, and this is not a criticism of the game itself, is the apparent childishness of some in-game chat users, but this is probably true of any online game.

Not those stress and complicated type of crafting system and i think there is little PVP here too..Also if developer is looking at this, the lag is like♥♥♥♥♥♥ ping can go as high as 1k+.I using tunneling non of the location works with nice ping rate.I tried smooth ping, better ping, ping zapper.. all the same 500+ ping to 1k+:D			"

												The most unfortunate thing about this game is that it lags a lot, and there are several bugs in the game that cause you to not be able to interact with npc's, or crafting stations.  If you can deal with having to close out the game and relogging all the time then I guess go for it.  The most positive thing about the game is the community, this is a rare community in the MMO world that are actually not jerks.  The graphics are meh, but playable.  I was not that impressed, esp not enough to give any real $ to it, but you decide.			"

												I played for a couple hours to give it a try. Pros:-Fun character creation and storyline-Easy character advancement (not a big talent tree to follow like some games)-Lot's of crafting.-No pvp (this is a con for some people)Cons:-Graphics like everyone says. They are on the lines of WoW, but worse.-Buggy (lots of times a lagged out or had to get in the right spot to click something)Now I only played this game until I got all my crafting to level 10 and my warrior to level 8. So  I didn't give it a big massive chance. My first impression was I was pretty happy with the game. It had everything I like. But I started running into the buggyness and even though I don't need AAA graphics, I would at least like modern.The world is kind of barren also in the start. I don't know if it gets better, but the start area seems to have alot of just farms that have no real use. The gathering seems to be done in specific areas which is boring also. open world gathering is more interesting. I could have really stuck with this game, but it's lacking as a full MMO. It is perfect for a casual person or child though.			"

												This game is so amazing, first off the vim system is gone. They improved the graphics... which could still have some improvment. But anyway, the whole new character creation is amazing. But there is one small downside, it is the fighting system. So you double click on a enemy you attack it then it attacks you and then you attack it again and so on. Thats it. It gets kinda boring. But thats the only downside. The crafting system is amazing too. But I really do hope the developers change the fighting system. But the rest of the game is so well done.Thanks.			"

												This game is fun, the monsters are cute, and it is well thought out in many ways.  However, there are a few things that make me reluctant to recommend this game to my friends.  The lag makes this game frustrating/unplayable at times.  There is one other small change they could make to keep young players and new players.  In this game you have to craft your hp potions and sp elixers, meaning you have to spend hours gathering materials and crafting pots if you want to be able to play efficiently.  I find it very boring to craft potions and I want to jump right into the fighting action.  The developers could solve this by simply selling hp and sp by npcs so children (whom would never spend hours crafting just so they could play) would stay past the first few lvls.  The game is very fun and I would like to recommend it to my friends that all capped out at our last game, but the lag and tedious crafting of hp/sp pots makes me reluctant.  If they fix these 2 problems the game deserves a huge, loyal following.			"

												After they took out the Vim system, the developers attempted to revamp this game. I found that it was plagued with bugs and glitches; so much so that it wasn't playable. i could barely get past the loading screen, and when i did the fps was terrible and the game would continuously crash. I was very dissappointed. I am happy to say, now though, that after YEARS of tinkering and tweaking, they seem to have gotten it right. The game is stable, and a very fun time waster to boot. There's fighting, crafting, farming, events and even a modest gaming community that is very enthusiastic about its' baby. It's taken a long time, but i think this is finally a game to be proud to play.			"
