												Ah, KOTOR II. Where to start? First, download The Sith Lords: Restored Content Mod. I state this because the standard game is highly unpolished, is missing a lot of extra dialogue and has many bugs that will frustrate anybody, whether they are new to Star Wars or loved the first KOTOR.This game shows mechanics that would later be implemented into Mass Effect. A definite meter to determine morality, the breaking down of gear into components (or ""omni-gel"" for you Spectres), combat that can be paused while issuing commands to you and your squad along with a focus on dialogue options between NPCs and your companions. Your choices in these dialogues could allow you to avoid a combat situation, help progress a quest, or give more information on your companions or your surroundings.Those familiar with some Star Wars lore (such as the movies or KOTOR I) are probably aware of the black-and-white morality shown. For example, KOTOR I gives you a situation where a woman is attempting to sell a hunters trophy belonging to her late husband. You can either buy the trophy from her (the light option), or convince the woman using the Force to give you the item (the dark option). KOTOR II blurs morality into tones of grey, where the Jedi are not seen entirely as the paragon of all that is good and where the ultimate ""light"" option is not always perceived as the most prudent one.Part of this blurring of the lines is due to Kreia, one of the companions accompanying you, the Jedi Exile. A mysterious woman whose becomes more cryptic with every word, her musings and personality have convinced me she is one of the most fleshed-out and well written characters in video game history. The strange thing is, not many of the other characters seem as interesting as Kreia in comparison. Actually, I'm somewhat wrong; HK-47 is a great companion as well. His mannerisms about murder, his copies and his past are worth listening to if you want to chuckle. Atton is somewhat interesting wisecracking pilot and the remaining characters aren't worth writing home about. They're not bad characters, just not great ones.I'm going to stop this review now before I type spoilers and just tell you to play it. If you enjoyed Mass Effect, if you played KOTOR 1, if you enjoy learning about the lore of Star Wars, or if you need an RPG fix sorted out, KOTOR II is a great option. Just make sure to get the Restored Content Mod. It's really necessary to have a good experience.			"

												""Perhaps you were expecting some surprise, for me to reveal a secret that had eluded you, something that would change your perspective of events, shatter you to your core. There is no great revelation, no great secret. There is only you.""That is the culmination of Obsidian's Knights of the Old Republic II, a game which flips the entire Star Wars universe on its head via deep character interactions and a unique spin on established aspects of the franchise.Make no mistake - the original release of KOTOR II was a flawed, incomplete mess. Not only was it missing a large chunk of its ending (notably, what happened to the player's squadmates when they landed on the final planet), but it was buggy and prone to all sorts of glitches. Yet, despite all that, the game still remains a classic of the RPG genre for how often it defies standard conventions and plays with the series' established tropes.You play the Exile, a former commander who committed a terrible sin to stop the Mandalorian Wars, and was exiled from the Jedi Order because of it. The game begins with the Exile waking up onboard the Peragus mining facility, alongside T3-M4 (a returning character from the first game) and an enigmatic woman named Kreia, who knows more than she lets on. Together with sprung prisoner (and ace pilot) Atton Rand, the quartet escapes the facility and discover that the Jedi have been driven to near-extinction. With the help of a cast of supporting squadmates, including a former Sith protegee named Visas, the fun-loving (well, as fun as a homicidal robot can be) assassin droid HK-47, a bounty hunter, the leader of the Mandalores and more, the Exile sets out to stop the Sith and rebuild the Jedi Order.The biggest difference between this and KOTOR I is how linear this game is. Not that it diminishes the plot at all, but there's a definite rhythm to the way you approach areas and plot situations. Whereas the original game's only real goal was to activate the four pillars to find out the location of the Star Forge before assaulting it, II has you either aiding or working against a planet's internal war, taking part in a trial to exonerate a wrongfully-accused civilian, taking apart a crime syndicate and more. The plot is a lot tighter and focused than its predecessor.The cast of characters is where the game really shines, though. Aside from Kreia (an enigmatic woman who stresses being neutral in all decisions), every character has some backstory that requires trust and increasing the ""Force Bond"" with them to access. I truly liked that you could upgrade various aspects of your teammates' abilities by either talking to them a lot or helping them with certain decisions.It's pretty much a given that if you're going to play KOTOR II, you need the Restored Content Mod. Not only does it restore the bulk of the ending which was scrapped by Obsidian in their rush to finish the game for a Christmas deadline, but it also fixes a lot of the bugs and underlying coding issues found throughout the game. I used it the first time I played the game, and I can't imagine going without it. In the same vein, the M4-78 Enhancement Project fills in an unfinished questline and gives some great upgrades to your droid party members, along with some awesome consequences later in the game - I was so pumped to see the droid army helping me during a later encounter.It's not all perfect, though. While the crafting system is very good (and has shades of Mass Effect, which came out three years later), it's far too easy to be stuck with a large amount of components and weapons that are unusable, and there's never any real need to upgrade your gear beyond a handful of weapons.Likewise, the ending (even with the Restored Content Mod) is a huge slog. There's a mid-mission quest with a robotic remote, which you are forced into, which is impossible to complete if you didn't clear out all the enemies from the map just prior to starting it. Likewise, the final fortress is a huge slog and is only passable through spamming Force powers or avoiding the majority of enemies.That said, KOTOR II is well worth your time and money. The way it turns many of the elements of the Star Wars universe on its head and keeps up the energy and characterization through its runtime is still near-unmatched in this day and age, and I heartily recommend that every RPG fan check this game out at least once.

												KOTOR II is one of those classic RPGs I can replay over and over. This sequel was released in 2004 and is still a great game and remains extremely playable today. Even though Bioware developed the first KOTOR, they ended up handing the job over to Obsidian who, as always, did a fantastic job with their work.The use of KOTOR II's Light Side/Dark Side system is a lot like the modern day systems of good/evil characters. When you as the  character does or says evil things then you grow more in tune with the dark side of the force. The contrast to this is of course, doing good deeds and saying not-so-evil stuff. This leads to the Light side of the force. In either case you will grow more powerful and influence those you travel with. This will also effect your force powers amongst many other things...The StoryThe single defining feature of KOTOR or KOTOR II is the story. Anyone who loves Star Wars must love a good mythos from the Star Wars world, especially one this early in the timeline of the Star Wars Universe. This sequel begins when a stranger, oblivious to his past, wakes up in a Mining Station medical bay, only to notice no one is around. No one...except a mysterious elderly woman. Journey to several planets and cause havok or create order. Kill the weak or defend them. All the while, you search for the power to make you a Master of the Force.Pros:- Great main storyline with various other mini-quests, all which act in canon with the Star Wars universe.- Open world that you would expect from an RPG- Choose what you say to someone carefully; You could end up in a fight or effect the story.- Choose light or dark side; Your actions will decide what you become.- Tons of lore from the Star Wars universe you can't find anywhere else!!Cons:- Graphics are from the first Xbox generation, but it still holds today.- Some of the voice overs for alien species are simply repeated recordings on loop.- Occasionally, a glitch or two might happen- RARELY, but sometimes there are game breaking bugs. There are only two that I know of, and one of them ruined my first game. This requires the double save slow technique. Verdict? - 8.5/10 This is my favorite Star Wars game hands down. Many people also recognize this particular game to be LucasArts' crowing achievement. Obsidian does a great job with the sequel to Bioware's KOTOR and does Star Wars in general great justice.			"

												Well, I liked this game so much I spend years working on a mod to fix issues with it that happened due to LucasArts rushing Obsidian. And again several to work on adding a cut planet (M4-78) with a lot of self-made content to make it a fully fleshed out planet matching the ones ingame. That should tell you enough. If not just know this is a ""must play"" RPG you can't miss...EDIT:Since it was unclear for some people which mod I talk about, TSLRCM. You can now get it from the Workshop!			"

												A great idea for a main character, memorable teammates and a plot shrouded in mystery makes The Sith Lords one of my favourite games of all time. Some people may find the first section of the game quite linear, but the game only really begins once you leave Telos. Also, the wait for a lightsaber makes getting it all the better.Be sure to install the latest version of the Restored Content Mod, which adds in dialogue, scenes and missions that were cut from the official release. The mod also removes many of the games glitches.			"

												This is Star Wars free from George Lucas. He created the saga, and Obsidian show how to continue it, creating more stuff thats even better. I have played this game over 500 hours, I bought it on Steam just to have an easy way to install it. 4 cd to install it is a little annoying today.I can write long novels why I love this game, why I play it more than I play Kotor 1. But I will try to make this short.The Sith Lords has:- great characters with deep personalities- dark stories and setting- a deep lore thanks to Kotor 1 and Tales of the Jedi-comic- fantastic dialog with complex possibilities- an improved crafting-system (6 parts-lightsaber anyone?)- Influence-system with your compainons- make your own jedi or sith-team. Even good guys can be turned to the dark side.- Be a jedi, or turn to the dark side and be a Sith Lord. It really change alotPlaying through the game once? You have missed much, I promise you, I still learned new stuff on my fourth playthrough.Is the game perfect? No, its not. Its a slow start, it really is, and it was a rushed game, so bugs, it had alot of bugs on release, but nearly all is fixed today, and some things was left out, and not really a good ending, . But the way there, is so gooood. So much improved from Kotor 1, and so much content. Its a 30+ hour game.From me, a die hard Star Wars fan, and not too experienced with rpg, its a 10/10 points.			"

												If you like Star Wars, you love the lore behind the Force, and you love the Jedi, then you'll probably hate this game. Why? Because the idea behind KOTOR 2 is to take all of the black and white in Star Wars, then break it down so you see past the blinded Jedi council and ambitious Sith. It's not your standard Star Wars movie. The game turns Lucas' pure good/pure evil fantasy into moral playground that makes you question the very existence of the Force and the people who use it. That being said, though, this is an absolutely fantastic game for any cRPG/WRPG fan. It sticks by the standard D&D rules, just like the first game, but adds more feats, force powers, and items. However, after a certain point, the game gets extremely easy, especially if you have half an idea of what you're doing.Unlike the first game, it doesn't have a major twist (the biggest twist is a backstory for one of your companions), but instead slowly provides hints to the major plot. The game's setting is pretty dark, too. The universe is in disarray, and really feels like it. Settlements are run down, there's ruins on places that were bright in the previous game, and the Jedi order is nearly extinct. However, along the journey you run into several party members with interesting personalities and troublesome backstories. If you were expect any form of romance, it's not here. There's subtle hints, but no official romance options (which I really enjoy). That said, I suggest playing as a male simply due to the fact you get Handmaiden, who is a far more interesting character than the Disciple. Overall the story and setting make a very immersive game that will keep your attention, as long as you can force your way through the first two planets. The combat starts off fairly difficult, but becomes a breeze once you get going, then turns into EZ mode. Your companions are great, some of the best if all of video game history, in my opnion, and their voice actors deliver top notch lines that you will remember for years to come. Is it better than KOTOR 1? In my opinion? Yes. In your opinion? I don't know, play the game, dummy. (just kidding, i don't mean any offense at all, but you should form your own opnions instead of jumping a bandwagon)apathyisdeath/10P.S. Look into the Restored Content Mod to not only fix a lot of old bugs, but get access to a TON of content that was cut from the original game. Also, if you use a widescreen monitor, look online for a widescreen fix. It's pretty easy to do. "

												Star Wars: KOTOR IIThis game is truly epic, considering the fact that it was released 9 years ago. I tell you what, this game could probably be the best RPG game out there, in my opinion it's the best. It is much better than the first game. The voice acting is really  great and the wonderful thing in this very unique game is that it evoked players to feel strong emotions the same way the characters were portraying in the game. Light side or dark side it doesn't matter which side you choose because if you play this game you will feel peace and passion thoroughly. However, the downside is that when this game was released back then, it wasn't complete due to LucasArts pressuring the Developers for an early Christmas release date, many parts of the game was cut out. But thanks to hard-core Star Wars fans out there they made the KOTOR II TSLRCM which allows you to play the game with the cut-out parts. Now, do yourself a favor, go to the store and buy the game.May The Force Be With You!			"

												Quick story recap: a long time ago, in 2003, prior to KOTOR release, LuasArts already wanted a sequel, but Bioware was unavailable at the moment and offered Obsidian instead. Then two things happened: 1. LA were greedy and patientless enough to demand the game be done by Christmas 2004; and 2. Obsidian were optimistic/desperate enough to agree to these terms without even seeing the first game. The end result was a glitchy half-cut but potentially great game.I used to hate it and left after ~5-8 hours into the first playthrough. It seemed boring and I got stuck on the very first planet… but then it got a new life on Steam, with high-res support, achievements, and the Cut Content mod already on Workshops. And I loved it. KOTOR 2 is worthy of the first game, adding a little more ambiguity to the classic light/dark dichotomy, and offering more action and independence to playable characters than the first game. The Exile story is probably not so personally dramatic as the one of the first game, but it's just different and delivers no less.			"

												Let me tell you the story.Once upon a time, there was a Boy. That Boy had a dream. He dreamed about the galaxy far-far away. There were no limits for his imagination. So he created the world where rebels fight with Evil Empire. He decided to add some weeaboo stuff too, so there were Space Samurais called Jedi, and Evil Space Samurai called Sith. So they were fighting epic battles, ya-da, ya-da. And people liked it, and praised the Boy.But then this universe got popular, and the boy sold out. He didn't care about his creation anymore, because he lost his dream, and his imagination ran out. So he sold out everything and began to pander to child audience, selling merchandise for♥♥♥♥♥♥tons of money. He also blessed various of talentless hacks (like Bioware) on creating tasteless and pandering copycats to get some cash.You probably know that Boy by the name George Lucas.But there was Another Boy. He was a writer. But not just writer, he was a videogame writer. And pretty successful one. He liked videogames. He liked to write for them. He went through tough♥♥♥♥♥♥ however. But in the end he gathered the greatest team of RPG developers of his time.But there was a thing that Another Boy hated. It was the universe George Lucas created and then butchered. Another Boy hated how childish this universe was. And the overpowered Jedi demigods, i mean WTF? Who the ♥♥♥♥ wouldn't kill himself instead of fighting them. Because Jedis and Siths secretly manipulated regular folk, oppressed them and did whatever they want with them. Another Boy didn't liked it. It was♥♥♥♥♥♥So what Another Boy did? He created The Game. The Game without childish stuff, but set in this very universe. He deconstructed the whole thing, and then made it smart and quite philosophical too. His name was Chris Avellone, and his brothers were Obsidian Entertainment.And together they made the best Star Wars game ever existed.Knights of the Old Republic 2.			"

Star Wars | Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords is an Adventure RPG based on the D20 System. As the Republic lies in shambles five years after the Dark Wars, a former Jedi who lost his connection to the force is pursued by a trio of dark jedi masters who roam the galaxy, seeking its destruction.Pros: Darker story than the first Star Wars | Knights of the Old Republic game with a lot of shades of grey. Alligning yourself with the light side of the force may cause death, while other times the dark side of the force may save innocent lives, and seeing the consequences of your actions makes much more of a moral struggle to determine what really is the right thing to do. You get to spend time and train some of your companions into jedi, and yourself get to upgrade your jedi class with a new selection of 3 jedi master classes. Crafting has also been enhanced, adding among other things the ability to disassemble existing items into parts and chemicals. There also are many winks to locations or characters from the previous game, without actually needing to have played it to understand everything.Cons: As with the previous game, the graphics didn’t age too well (although the full-resolution update helped), and unfamiliarity with tabletop RPGs and the D20 system might confuse many who try to understand and optimize their character’s equipment. The game has multiple bugs due to problems in the development, making the story somewhat hard to follow: A cut scene might pop in but the playthrough that lead to that scene was missing, or maybe you were in your ship flying to a destination and the game suddenly jump to your cockpit with your ship having landed on a unknown planet you’re unsure how you got there.Verdict: ★★★★☆ - Next of your list!This is a darker game using the same mechanics as the previous one. The bugs aren’t game breaking, and can be easily fixed with a Mod in the Steam Workshop. If you didn’t like the prequel, you won’t like this one either. But otherwise, I definitively recommend it!—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

												It's better than KotOR from Bioware (with the restored content modification)!There, I said it! And why exactly would I say something?BioWare make great games, but their stories and lores are divided into good and bad. It's simple, faithful and hence; unrealistic. A deluded fairy-tale, trying to simplify fiction, so people who delude themselves in real life know what they up for, so they're not overchallenged by nuances. Obsidian, on the other hand, did with The Sith Lords what they did with Fallout New Vegas; they put everything on a higher meta-level. They included realism in form of blurring the line of what is good and what is not, making it uneasy to decide between sides. Kreia is one of those prime examples, just by including her as an important character. I don't want to spoil anything, but you'll know what I mean when you play it. Those things are what makes this game far superior to the Bioware equivalent. Obsidian are the best RPG makers, then, and especially now.			"

												After the huge innovation of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, KOTOR2 had high expectations. It introduced advanced upgrading; a more fleshed out and expanded story; more force abilities and early game choices/customisations; and allies that you could get to know, gain influence with, and overal interact with, with much more depth.From the get go, you're flung into a mystery as you find your character recovering from being held within an abandoned mining facility. I won't spoil the story for you, but I will say that it it never gives in - also raising new questions, and spawning many branches which act not only as side missions, but also to add more detail to the main story.In KOTOR2, you start the game as a jedi, as opposed to becoming one later in the game. There are more force options, and more feats that make each of the 3 classes really distinct. This, combined with the game's element of choice, and a light/darkside meter, you will find it is a unique experience for each player.So, for those who enjoyed the original KOTOR, this game will serve as both an extension to the story, and the means to get back into this amazing experience.For new players, however, this game will still be blast to play. It features an easy to understand character creator, and a solid tutorial in the beginning. I would recommend playing the original KOTOR first though, to really understand both the gameplay; and more importantly, the story.Kotor 2 is a fantastic game, and one played through many times. Each experience is unique, and the characters and story are really engaging.*Also, on a side note. I recommend a mod called 'The Restored Content Mod', which will increase the amount of content in the game, as well as adding some 'lost' content that wasn't in the original game. It also fixes a bunch of bugs that really plague this game, due to it being released premature.			"

												This is the true Masterpiece Star Wars game.Yes, Bioware's first game is fantastic and fun, but if you look at it closely it's basically a retelling of the original trilogy and is a bit one-dimensional in terms of characterization and plot writing. You fight against the big bad empire and find a way to stop their super-weapon(factory) and discover a massive plot twist truth, and it's pretty much polar opposite paths of pure good and pure evil, with almost nothing in between. Plus, the dialogue can be really cornyFor the sequel, however, the gods of writing known as Obsidian were given the power to bring their epic writing ability into Star Wars and thus came one of the best RPGs known to man, and one of the best stories Star Wars has to offer, where the story really comes to life through character interaction and brilliant lines that chill you. A lot of what you learn comes through dialogue in this game, so be prepared to listen and respondNow, you may be saying: ""But it has bugs and is incomplete!"" That's because LucasArts got greedy and gave them a year to do this game instead of the three years that Bioware had for the first, it's amazing they managed to create this much material. I highly recommend getting the Restored Content Mod here which does its best to re-create what Obsidian had tried to do with this game --> http://deadlystream.com/forum/files/file/578-tsl-restored-content-mod/So why am I saying this game is so good? Well, here are my reasons:1. It has one of the deepest and most moving plots of any story, and changes your perceptions of the Star Wars universe. The Jedi are not painted as the god-like saviors and the Sith are not necessarily entirely evil. In fact, the game almost presents the point of view of an outsider (well, an exile of the Jedi) and you can experience the consequences of the constant conflict between the light and the dark. The entire plot is trying to find a way to stop the sith, but you have no help, and you just got back into the galaxy and just re-discovered your force connection. As you progress, you discover just what has happened to the galaxy, how bad the situation is, why you were exiled in the first place, and get to make some very tough calls. Unlike the first game, there are no real bomb-shell plot twists that come out of left field, rather a setting of interesting minor twists that make sense, but feel no less impactful (the jedi council scene on dantooine, for instance)2. It has some of the best written characters ever witnessed. Case and Point, Kreia, who's practically your twisted female Yoda who lies to you so you do her bidding, but mixes her lies with truths as she shapes your view of the world. She also has some very interesting viewpoints on the Jedi Civil War, and provides context to why the war happened in the first place and why Revan (the main character of the first game) did what he/she did. Other characters also have their own flaws and positive traits, each being actual living individuals, whereas in the first game it was clear that most party members were just a character embodying one viewpoint only (light, dark, comedy). And those brought back from the first game are given even more of a shining light and a deeper backstory so that they become real people. (HK-47, for example, is even more epic)3. Your choices matter - No, really, they do. Granted, the endings don't play out that differently, but you see the consequences of your actions throughout the game (especially with TSLRCM), and particularly with those you travel with. The way you act changes your followers, and the way they respond to you likewise does so. Again, particularly with the restored content mod, you can witness how your choices play out, and experience the difference in how others react to you (People also note that if you're evil your face looks awful, which nobody notices in KOTOR 1)4. It feels grounded to reality - It's not just cowboys and spaceships, you actually witness good political drama too in this game. Here, you deal with real people and their problems, not just a grandma needing to get across the street. You also have to struggle with what is good and what is evil, and often times the lines are blurred, particularly when it comes to choosing sides. On Nar Shaddaa, you might feel inclined to help the hapless refugees, but it might cause more harm than good because there is no system to replace the caste they are in. Oh, and by the way, common citizens blame the Jedi for the war, both the sith and the Jedi. In fact, they think they are both Jedi, since they don't actually know what's going on.These are the ones I have off the top of my head, but look around and you'll find more reasons. This isn't some epic good vs evil game like the first or Mass Effect, so don't go expecting it. Instead, look for a deep narrative that tells a complex story that has a journey that matters more than the destination. There are definite flaws, since the game was rushed out the door by a poor production committee, but if you overlook those flaws, then you'll notice just how brilliant this game is. Truly, I wish that Star Wars resembled what Obisidan came up with more, but unfortunately we won't see that in Disney canon. However, if you want a taste of Star Wars for big boys, come check this out.			"

Better than canon storiesSeriously, I'm surprised that Disney quickly went and declared almost all older Star Wars games ""non-canon"", because these games contain better stories than most, in not all, Star Wars movies. KOTOR saga, that goes through both the BioWare game, and this one, made by Obsidian already could make even the Original trilogy sweat for excellence and the depth of the characters in the stories told.But enough about that. KOTOR 2 got recently updated after being released 10 years ago, which is very unexpected. Game got updated with achievements, bug fixes, Steam Workshop and up to 4k resolution support which is VERY welcome. There's also a very certain divide between the KOTOR RPG fans. There are the ones that love both games, ones that love the first, but trash the 2nd (this one) and then there are the ones that claim KOTOR2, to be the superior one. From my perspective, KOTOR2 is the superior one. Why? Here's why:- More detailed characters- More replay value, because there are different ways to approach even Light/Dark paths.- Kreia- Ability to influence your companions and turn them to Jedi/Sith warriors.- More feats/powers and ""Prestige"" classes. i.e. Sith Lord, Jedi Master etc.- Playing with the Restored TSL Content mod, you get all the mising stuff, that wasn't in the original KOTOR2 release and basically get the whole experience, which was the main gripe with the game all these years. - Lightsaber and Force stances (varying kinds of bonuses, depending on situation and enemy type). - HK-47 explaining what love is. - Aged better than KOTOR1- More companion AI behavior options, especially for Force wielding companions.Now, I'm not saying that KOTOR1 is any way worse, it does however deliver a more cohesive and easier to follow story, whereas you play as a random Jedi ""exile"" here, and the real meat of the story gets delivered basically at the end of the game. So it's a lot harder to have a vested interest in the plot (for some). Gameplay itself is fairly straight-forward, as RPG's go, because it has more in common with Dungeons and Dragons then any other video game RPG. In combat you and your enemy take turns (in real time) and make ""rolls"" based on your stats and skills to whoever will get the best outcome, miss, do damage or ""save"" against a status effect, like Fear/Stasis etc. You control your character with WASD keys and click on enemies, select an action and your character follows the order of actions from the list. You can always pause the game at any moment, if you'd prefer to also set actions for your companions in certain order, but on ""Normal"" difficulty that's not really necessary. Just make sure to keep your other guys  leveled up and with decent gear, if you happen to get knocked out and your allies have to pick up the slack or clench a victory in an engagement. I'd say that this game is no-brainer if you love both RPG's and Star Wars. Might not be your cup of tea, if you love Star Wars, but are not a huge RPG fan, because this game is more RPG, then let's say something like Fallout 4 claiming to be an ""RPG"". This game is more in tune, with older types of RPG, where your stats, level, skills, gear and tactics matter in a fight, but it's just complicated enough, not to become a dry mathematical calculation.There's hoping that sometime in the future, we'll get the final conclusion to Revan's story with a third installment, or even an entirely new reboot of KOTOR RPG games, which should be a no-brainer, because now is the perfect time to ""milk"" the Star Wars hype, after The Force Awakens made over 2bln$ worldwide.There was never a more perfect time for a new Star Wars RPG, than now.

												If you're uptight about graphics go away. It's old but it's amazing.I owned SWKOTOR 1 before I even knew steam existed. I loved it. When I saw SWKOTOR 2 years ago on steam I bought it so quick I didnt care at all the price.I honestly believe it was very well worth it. Now that it has steam workshop enabled I'd imagine it'll shine a bit more. But I'd gladly replay multiple time. I've heard it was riddled with bugs by some people but when I played it wasn't that bad at all. Honestly no matter what anyone says good or bad get the game anyway it's well worth it. There is a mod to change many things and make it how the developers wanted it to be however which I find amazing. I love RPG's and this one is by far one of my favorites. Even without any mods I rather enjoy it greatly. Although  I heard the restored content mod is extremely worth it and makes this game 100x better. I personally havent tried it yet due to issues on my part but I'll work them out after I beat the game for the 12th time. Number 11 so far c: I love everything about the game. Finish reading this review clearly means you have not purchased it yet and started playing. Go, now. Unless you did in which case... Think about force stuff! I rate 20 / 10 I would bang so many things out of this game. I would recommend this game infinitely. My wife will also kill me for wanting to bang this game harder than her. But I'm sure she will think the same after tasting this game.TL;DR Just buy it now. It's beyond great.			"

												Along with its predecessor- this is a RPG that shouldn't be ignored!More abilties and feats, an advanced gameplay, improved customziation and a story filled with questions and mystery, which leads on to a deeper depth of the star wars psyche.A worthy successor of BioWare's legendary Star Wars game, but has been tossed in the shadows because of the problems it experienced during development.This is a game that deserves more recognition than it actually got.

												KotOR 2, despite being chronically unfinished, is probably the best Star Wars RPG out there and here's why:The story and especially the writing are absolutely phenomenal. The guys at Obsidian have managed to create a game that feels like Star Wars without any of the clichés associated with it. Where the first installment had a whiny Han Solo, a force using Leia and Chewie as carbon copies of their originals, this game puts multiple twists on most stereotypical Star Wars characters, fleshing them out so much more. Hell, even though all a certain Astromech droid ""says"" is random beeps, you know exactly what he wants to tell you, without anyone going ""What's that, Lassie? There's  boy trapped in the well?"". It's just that amazing.On top of it all the game features the best wirtten female character in any video game ever, but it's hard to praise the writing without spoiling the story, so I might as well stop now. Just so much: The game covers a multitude of philosophical questions, especially when reading between the lines, so you should be prepared to think while playing.The graphics are dated, RTwP combat with DnD rules isn't everyone's thing but the same thing can be said for Planescape:Torment and it still is widely regarded as a (the?) classic RPG.Things of note if you have played the predecessor:While the graphics, animations and UI have remained pretty much on the same level when compared to KotOR 1, the characters' build diversity has been greatly increased, making things like a gun wielding Jedi viable options.The combat itself hasn't changed much, except for a few extra skills and powers or new enemies, of course.Loot is now randomly distributed and modding items as well as crafting them have been greatly expanded.The story itself covers quite a few events that happened before KoTOR 1, although the game itself is set later. Due to this, I'd recommend playing the predecessor first (especially since its big twist would otherwise be spoilered). Otherwise, you might get lost, concerning the order in which things happened.As so many others have already stated, the game's main issue is the fact that it's unfinished and unpolished but this can largely be fixed by downloading and installing the TSLRCM, a brilliant modification which restores a lot of cut content to the game, such as the great droid factory. Also, while the game now has widescreen support, I'd still recommend the Widescreen Fix mod to un-stretch the UI.			"

												Knights of the Old Republic II is one of my faveorite games. I've never had a computer without it installed since the day I originally bought it in 2006. The story is extremly unique to Star Wars, and feels almost more fantasy than sci-fi. The writing is top notch, and shines brightest in the character of Kreia. However the game as available for purchase, is incomplete, with a complete planet, entire questlines, and flesh-out ending, absent from the proceedings. In order to fully enjoy the game I highly recommend downloading TSLRCM and M4-78EP, available at deadlystream.com. These two mods(+ a few additional addons) complete what Obsidian was unable too, transforming TSL from a broken game into a masterpiece.Do buy this game, and do get TSLRCM/M4-78EP.			"

												Absolute first and foremost: the first thing you have to do when you want to play this game is go download the mod called The Sith Lords: Restored Content Mod (TSLRCM in short) WITHOUT the M4-78 extension. Trust me.The review: this game is no doubt one of the greatest achievements in the history of intellectual products and will go down in history of videogames defiantly standing as the testament that games are a perfectly viable medium for writers to deliver complex and compelling stories.While not free of flaws, the story, writing, pacing, character development are masterfully weaved together to form one of the best, if not THE absolute best RPG the gaming world has to offer.

												This game was literally the reason I downloaded Steam. I had been looking to replay this game from my childhood for years, and when my friend showed me it was on Steam, I didn't hesistate to download and buy it. The nostalgia factor was and continues to be unreal. The above gametime does not account for the hundreds of hours poured into KOTOR 2. Also, considering the mods that are now available for this game, there are potentially hundreds of more hours to be spend in this fantastic game.10/10 Revan is love, Revan is life.			"

												This series of games are my favorite and I have to say I am probably going to add about 500 hours of gameplay to this game. Also if you see the TSLCRM-The Sith Lords Content Restoration Mod, get it because it adds more story to this game and makes it a lot better.  It is bad that as soon as I saw that Steam had this game, I ran to the closest place that sold Steam Cards and grab a $20 and bought this game as soon as I could. That is how much respect I have for this game it may be around 10 years old, I would rather buy this game then some of the new games coming out.			"

""I am become death,  the destroyer of worlds.""An intensely philosophical and brooding rumination on war and morality, The Sith Lords is a masterfully written sequel to the original BioWare classic.As brightly as the narrative and writing may shine however, (a worthy successor to the quality of the first), the game often falters in other aspects. KotOR II borders on what could be considered broken; featuring an overall design that lacks polish, quality and ultimately feels unfinished and sorely lacking of QA testing. Granted, this was due to time constraints and pressure from LucasArts, but it is only thanks to the efforts of the community in recent years, (namely the team behind the Restored Content Mod that I'll be trying out next), and the rare update that this can be played and enjoyed as much as it is. Dialogue is frequently skipped over at unreadable speeds, there are significant issues with clipping, camera movement, loading and most animations, and achievement unlocks are all over the place - I got the ""Dancing Queen"" achievement randomly on Peragus Station. The Sith Lords also doesn't feel like much of a departure from the first. Combat is almost identical but yet no longer satisfying or a challenge to play; the developers appear to have compensated for the now♥♥♥♥♥♥weak enemies by simply adding more of them, with the rare boss fight often amounting to a self-healing tank, bullet sponge or absolute pushover. As a result, you'll die very little and this leaves you feeling as if you're playing on rails; as if combat hardly matters. But for a series that is so reliant and with so much potential depth in its combat and stat management, this was disappointing.As already alluded to though, the quality shown through the writing and branching dialogue saves The Sith Lords from what could have been a disaster. For those who have played the original, the game picks up a short time after the events of the first Knights of the Old Republic and builds upon a lot of the lore surrounding it. A feature for importing your save file isn't available, but there are plenty of options through dialogue to link the choices made in the first. Though admittedly seen as more of a part of the overarching narrative than unique themselves, the companions and major NPCs are, for the most part, fascinating. HK-47 is back, (by popular demand, no doubt), and Kreia personifies the complexities that TSL deals with and, along with Visas, delivers the excellent writing in an equally stellar performance. Remember Malachor V.Very few modern titles use the capabilities that gaming - as a medium - presents anymore, but like the first, Obsidian manipulates both the character and the player with a narrative and means of perspective which is fascinating to watch and all the more immersive to experience. Questions of responsibility and complicity are frequently raised, often leaving it open for you to ponder your choices and the nature of the Force itself. The interwoven plots and rich storytelling of KotOR and the like could not be possible in film or television; and it is this that makes video games such an art form.Play The Sith Lords for the story. Though still worth a purchase, just be aware of what you’re getting into. It is a flawed gem, but a great one at that, and its achievements exceed the faults that could've held it back. A worthy follow up to the original, pick this up along with the Restored Content Mod and make it into the best it can be. A war-torn, Nihilistic thumbs-up.			"

TLDR VERDICTKOTOR 2 is a very worthy successor to the high bar set by the original game. They kept the general gameplay and presentation true the original and put their own unique spin on the story. Many people argue it is actually a superior game to the original. Overall, a rough, buggy and now dated, but still very entertaining game well worth the asking price if you’re a fan of the original or fan of Star Wars in general.FULL REVIEW BELOW“Take the greatest Jedi Knight, strip away the Force, and what remains? They rely on it, depend on it, more than they know. Watch as one tries to hold a blaster, as they try to hold a lightsaber, and you will see nothing more than a woman – or a man. A child.” - KreiaFive years after the events of KOTOR, the galaxy is recovering from the events from the Jedi Civil War. Both the Jedi and Sith have now fallen silent. You have been exiled from the Jedi Order as punishment for following Revan into war against the Mandolorians. You have also been completely cut off from the Force, but was this a part of your punishment, or the result of something much worse?This review is written from a huge Star Wars fan and a fan of story driven RPGs in general.GAMEPLAY AND DESIGNIn terms of general gameplay and structure, KOTOR 2 is designed very similarly to the first game. It features the same turn-based D20 based combat system and character building as the first game and other old-school RPGs. This can be a quite daunting system to learn for those unfamiliar with these types of games, but fortunately the lower difficulty settings are forgiving enough for those without the patience or time to learn it. Combat is important, but arguably not as much as the stat and skill point distribution. Making sure you have characters with the appropriate skills determines being able to deal with obstacles in the world, conversation checks and crafting. The game does feature an automatic leveling up system which will do the leveling for you, which is fine in the late game after you have all the skills you need, but it may be worth doing some research in the early game for leveling up. The companions are all reasonably balanced and they level up with you, meaning that you can take anyone anywhere (at least from a gameplay perspective).The game isn’t entirely open world by any means. It’s similar to KOTOR and Dragon Age: Origins, in the sense that you travel between several fairly small focused areas rather than one continuous land mass. The areas are either mostly linear action packed levels or slower paced story driven quest hub areas. Crafting is important system to pay attention to as you can craft item modifications to create weapons more powerful than the ones you find. This is a fairly simple system that involves breaking down items you don’t need for materials, but it’s just a case of knowing what the stats actually mean. Of course, on lower difficulties you can get away with not paying much attention to gear and stats and still just about get by spamming the same attacks. You won’t find it very challenging, but more than adequate for just seeing the story (which in my opinion, is the main draw of the game).STORY AND NARRATIVEIt’s never easy to develop a follow up on such a beloved game from a different developer, but Obsidian certainly delivered on delivering a sequel that is true to the original and yet unique in its own way. KOTORs story felt very much like a grand space adventure and it captured everything that the classic Star Wars story should be. KOTOR 2 differs from this slightly. It tells a more subtle story with a focus on different themes. In stark contrast to KOTORs overt villains, KOTOR 2s threat is a lot more sinister. The battles with the Sith are fought in the shadows and the themes are a lot darker. An example of the darker tone is a reoccurring idea in the game that to the galaxy’s Average Joe, Jedi and Sith are indistinguishable. They just people with too much power fighting over religion and getting everyone else caught in the middle. This is a really unique and interesting idea and caught me completely off guard. Another good theme was the idea of the absence of the Force and the advantages it has aside from the obvious disadvantages.The conversation system is identical to KOTOR, with the standard light and dark alignment options and the opportunities to use skills (if you have the stats) in certain special situations. In my opinion, morality is much more interesting in KOTOR 2 than in the first one. Picking light or dark and sticking to it not only changes the ending, but the entire game. It shifts your characters goals for the whole game and also effects the gameplay. Dark and light side powers become easier/harder (but not impossible) to do if you are the opposite morality and it can result in some rather large deviations on the story line during some quests. It also affects your companions and over time you can even begin to influence their morality (e.g. enlightenment vs corruption). Overall, I’d say the game changes enough to warrant multiple playthroughs with different morality choices. On the topic of companions, you can expect yet another colourful crew of heroes, villains, droids and miscreants. They are very varied from the original games selection, but just as interesting and unique. Gameplay wise, they still have classes that need to have their stats properly assigned and equipped with the right gear. However, pretty much any configuration of companions is viable to take anywhere, which is good for the story. It makes it feel like you travel with ALL of your companions rather than just bringing your favourites and leaving everyone else on the ship. Your actions also influence your companions, resulting in them liking or disliking you more depending on how you act. Having them like you opens up more story and has gameplay benefits I can’t elaborate on without light spoilers. A quick note on voice acting: personally I found a particular companions voice actor laughably bad (look out for the one-armed Iridonian), but he’s really the only one that stands out. The rest of the game is mostly either passable or excellent.GAMEPLAY AND PERFORMANCEAs is customary with Obsidian games, they are often not given enough time for playtesting and optimisation leaving them somewhat lacking in the performance department. I expect you won’t encounter many problems these days however, as unsurprisingly an 11 year old game runs at 60fps 100% of time and doesn’t look half bad for its age. I did get a crash or two here and there and more than a fair share of bugs, but fortunately nothing game breaking or huge. I didn’t run into any compatibility problems either (running Windows 8.1). Funnily enough, the game actually got a patch recently that fixed a lot of problems, added controller support, support for higher resolutions and some other fixes. The biggest change was the addition was the addition of Steam Workshop for the game, which allows the seamless installation of some mods that restores a whole bunch of content that was cut from the game. Look up The Sith Lords Restored Content mod if you get the game, but it should be the highest rated anyway.			"

												Ignore my playtime.I first bought this game about 7 years ago when the 4 CD box could still be found and was pretty common, and since then I have finished this game 8 times, totaling an average of about 30 hours per gameplay.So yes, this is my 9th time playing this game and I am at more or les 250 hours, and even now after having played The Witcher, Mass Effect series, Fable, Dungeon Siege, TES IV Oblivion, TES V Skyrim, this game is by far the best game I've played in my 25 years of existence.Yes, hands down just like that.This is the best game I have ever played in my life and nothing will ever match the feelings this game has given me, and I think we will never witness a masterpiece such as this one.

												Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic 2 is a game that I highly recommend playing with its restored content mod: http://www.moddb.com/mods/the-sith-lords-restored-content-mod-tslrcmWhen KoTOR 2 was first released it was rushed by the publisher and then criticized into the ground over missing content. However the developers over at Obsidian were kind enough to release the source material that was cut from the game to the modding community. Over the years the dedicated KoTOR fans were able to fully restore the game to its complete glory. DO NOT PLAY KoTOR 2 without this free and essential mod. With that said, the game is amazing. It really is just as good, if not better then the original Knights of the Old Republic. Any self respecting Star Wars fan needs to play this game.Final Verdict: (5 out of 5)			"

												With the Sith Lords Restored Content Mod in hand, this game becomes more complete than the original ever was. The original game was released far to early, even after Obsidian was promised an extra half year they were forced by LucasArts to ship the game before eveything was properly put into the game. However, most of this content was still left in the code. Brilliantly all the dialogue, cutscenes, levels and interactions that never made it further than code were debugged and added into the game with TSLRCM adding hours upon hours of new content.The dialogue choices will make your mouth water. The difference between Bioware and Obsidian dialogue philosophies is this: Bioware believes in the three choices, good, neutral and bad. Obsidian believes in letting you choose many shades of gray, some obvious evil choices but no obvious good; you decide who your character becomes. The depth within your choices really lets you make your character who you want her or him to be.The characters are incredible. Lines of dialouge are restored giving them so much depth. Your least favorite character within the game might have dozens of new lines restored making him or her your favorite. The crappy romance options have been restored, fleshed out. Obsidian really shows their strong character writing within this game, each character is intresting, and they all have secrets to tell you... so long as you dedicate yourself to talking with them and earning their favor. As you make choices they will approve of you more or less, so be careful for everything has concequences.The combat is the same as it always is. The addition to lightsaber styles and tweaks makes the game more enjoyable than the first, but that is to be expected.But be warned: this game is kind of hard to get running on Windows Vista/7/8. Really the only flaw of the game is that its one of the few that doesnt run on modern versions of windows all that well. If you can get this game running I guarnete if you download the mod you'll enjoy this more than the first however.			"

												You know, this game catches a lot of flack in comparison to the first KOTOR, which is widely heralded as a masterpiece of gaming. Flack which is well deserved, yet easily rectified. The main quarrel most gamers hold to this particular game is that IT WASN'T RELEASED IN THE FULL AND COMPLETE FORM AND THAT THE STORY DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. While there is some merit to this claim, you truly need to gaze deeper to fully understand this game. The game was fully intended to be just as perfect as its predecessor. However, Obsidian, the company in charge of the project was forced to play their hand before they were ready to release. The result was a patchwork project that can make a coherent game, and one that stands alone as one of my all time favorites. Was the game released in a complete form? Hell no. Can this be fixed? Now we're talking.You see, others feel the same way as I do about this game. It *is* an excellent game and all it needs is a bit of dedication and elbow grease to get it to shine. A determined group of modders recovered files that were scraped from the final release of the game and constructed a mod that fitted these files into the game. Lost items, recorded dialogue, and even an entire planet were restored and reborn through the crucible of modding. This mod is compatible with the Steam version of this game and I highly recommend you install it (http://deadlystream.com/forum/files/file/398-tslrcm-183/), as well as the sister mod which restores the droid planet M4-78 (http://deadlystream.com/forum/files/file/399-m4-78ep-patched/). Outside of these two mods, there are multiple others I recommend you try as they improve the overall game experience. The mods are now available through the Steam workshop, but I'll just leave these links here anyway.But about the game itself, unmodded, and purchased from Steam without the addition of a single modification. This game is spectacular. Don't let my measly hours of play depicted by Steam deceive you, I played this game extensively on the original X-Box when the game first came out and I still have the disk to this day (although, admittedly, it is a bit worse for the wear at this point). Despite the cries and whines of the gaming community, this game is entirely playable without the restoration of lost elements. It simply takes a bit of digging into the story. On the XBOX version and as a child, I was able to understand the entirety of the story of the game quite easily. You might have to play through multiple times and see each conversation from a different angle, but you can do it. It's not the jagged mess many make it out to be. Inferences and an active imagination may be required to fill the gaps, however. Get ready to think and make connections between different characters and events. Just use your noggin and you'll be fine. Here's where I believe the true root of the problem is: people approach this game thinking that it will be a fun little game they can just jaunt through casually and there will be an exciting adventure story to accompany it. Spoilers: it's not. This game is exponentially darker than the original KOTOR, heck, three of the planets you explore are inhabited only by corpses by the time you arrive. This game was intended to have you question your morals, in fact, there are some parts where no matter which choice you make, dark or light, you are doing something terrible. It was intended to bring to light that in a conflict, there is no middle ground to take, but rather, by doing nothing you hurt one side and allow the other to  gain a leg up and by doing something, no matter the action, the end result is the same. You are full of all the powers of the Force, and yet, you are powerless. And when you can finally change the outcomes of events, the freedom is glorious and all the more worthwhile. Well, that was the intent, anyway. Portions on missing, so patches of this beautiful quilt of morality are missing. But the game is still superb and well worth every hour I've logged. Go ahead, buy it, play with an open mind, mod it, and explore. And may the Force be with you.(This was a review that I wrote a while ago that I deleted and reposted so that more people could view it with ease.)			"

												- I don't know who you are. But, you picked the wrong room to break into.- Yeah? Well, you picked the wrong room to die in.10/10 would break-in again.Apart from that, the recent support that Aspyr gave to this game, revitalized it to a point that it's truly amazing. Even more that it was before. Also, now Steam Workshop is available and the TSLRCM is as simple as just clicking in ""Subscribe"". For a true and beautiful experience with this game, it's highly recommended to download it.This is the game (Counting the first one too, of course) that every true Star Wars fan needs to play.			"

												I recently replayed KotOR 2 after roughly a decade's absence and thoroughly enjoyed my time with it. The game's message resonated with me in a way that it couldn't have back in my early teens, and I gained a new appreciation for the writing because of it. For a die hard Star Wars fan, such as myself, Kreia is a breath of fresh air in a universe that too often falls into the standard ""Good vs Evil"" dichotomy. Kreia provides a glimpse at the space in between the Dark and the Light and serves to inject the concept of existentialism into an otherwise faith-driven universe. If you're considering picking up KotOR 2, or going back to it after many years, the writing and characterisation is absoulutely the reason to do so.However, if that doesn't interest you, this may not be the game for you. Whilst KotOR 2's combat isn't by any means ""Bad,"" it isn't a particularly engaging system and can become quite tedious in places. This will become most obvious if you choose to play a buff-heavy style, with abilities having to be recast far too often in order to be maintained. The game also suffers from a number of difficulty spikes that come in the form of the occasional OP opponent. The most egregious problem that KotOR 2 suffers from combat-wise is, in my opinion, the sections that force you to play your companion characters. There are a significant amount of these sections and they will almost always make you feel incredibly underpowered, especially if you've just trained a companion in the ways of the force and they are lacking in Force Points/Abilities because of it.If you're still interested in trying the game, I HIGHLY recommend installing a mod called ""The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod"", or ""TSLRCM"" for short. This mod, as its name suggests, restores most of the content that was cut from the original release of the game, the most noticable re-addition being the HK Droid Factory, that contrains a wealth of funny cut dialogue, it was a joy to play through. TSLRCM also helps to alleviate the rushed feeling of the original game's ending, though large parts of this particular part of the game steel feel unfinished.All-in-all, KotOR 2 is an absolute classic, despite its faults, and I highly recommend it to fans of old-school Obsidian/Black Isle RPGs and, of course, to Star Wars fans. If you're a huge fan of both, like me, this game is a must play.			"

												Here's another incredibly long recommendation from me :DThis game isn't just one of my favorite games of all time - It's also one of the best RPGs I've played and also the first western RPG I've laid eyes on. Lastly, I find it to be much, much, much, muuuch better than the original Knights of the Old Republic from BioWare. It takes the gameplay mechanics of its predecessor and improves upon them to a greater extent. There's no ridiculous level cap from the first game anymore either. Much more open freedom to build your character with the introduction of the Advanced Classes. Lastly, the writing, story and characters are well-rounded and not drenched up in clichés like the first game. Knights of the Old Republic 2 throws the whole Light vs Dark concept into a bin and then dump it on the dark side of the moon. In retrospect - The game basically views the Jedi & Sith from a broader perspective and then concludes ""Hey, maybe they aren't so different after all"". They both wear morning gowns for a living and carry wide coloured willie exstented swords as a means of defense or offense. Essentially, there is no good or evil in this game, just various shades of grey. This philosophy is something one would find in the game's characters, especially the enigmatic woman, Kreia. Most of the characters are incredibly complex, even the Han Solo-esque ones have a dark secret hiding in the closet. There's no suave, secret, paragon of the universe response that will unlock their hidden feelings and open up to you. There's an interesting approval system, which I do consider a bit flawed but in terms of role-playing, it works. Once you've finally gotten to the heart of their character you'll unlock new abilities for the said characters. The best part: Even when you've gotten that far it still feels like you don't quite know everything there is to know about these characters. I think it is best if I sum up the plot now -- The game takes place a few years after the events of the first game. In classic Star Wars tradition, the Republic is on the verge of collapse alongside the Jedi... AGAIN. There are some tropes that Star Wars can never truly escape from I suppose. You play as an exiled Jedi... Knight? Master? Janitor? Whatever, the game is kinda vague about your previous ranking within the order - You've just returned to the known galaxy and thus missed out on the party of the first game -- I suppose this makes sense given that Star Wars doesn't seem to be restricted to one galaxy, but how the Exile have managed to NOT hear about the whole escapade in the first game is beyond me.. Guess she spent her time in a cave or a remote planet or something, ala Ben Kenobi. For some reason you find yourself onboard the ship of the Ebon Hawke, which people who've played the first game will recognize, and it has been badly damaged, explains a questionably-soothingly-female-voiced-sentient-AI as the tutorial begins. You have the option of skipping this tutorial but it's probably best not to do it since it'll give you a better idea of what is going on and foreshadow danger to come. Not too long after your Exiled Jedi wakes up from her/his comatose sleep onboard an eerie space mining facility called Peragus. The whole place is mysteriously abandoned, and one of the only survivors seems to be an old woman named, Kreia. Like I mentioned she's an enigma and she seems to know a lot about you and the Force, so the next course of action is to figure out what has happened and get off the station. That pretty much sums up the beginning. One of the other things I find that Kotor 2 does exceptionally well is that it allows the player to get easily integrated with the character of the Exile, despite her having an established background -- The well structured dialogue assignment paves way for role-playing a character who doesn't have a clue, as well as someone who's already familiar with the events of the first game. In addition to that - There's also the subtle choice of gender for the previous protagonist and selected occurences of the first game, without the use of an import system, in conversation with one of the characters. A smart way to build to connect both stories together as there'll be plenty of references.  So, I've talked a bit about what to expect from the characters, the story and gameplay -- Now I'd like to sum up some of the central themes. The game doesn't present itself as the ""Save the world from the ancient evil"" type of story. Instead, it sets itself up more as a personal story, about your protagonist and your followers. Every time you exit and enter your ship you'll usually find the party bantering with each other, alluding to a dark secret they are hiding or what have you. This is also brought to light in some of the story cutscenes, where Kreia will downright intimidate your crew by exposing their darkest secrets and have it consume them... Why? Because of The Exile. The Exile is unlike any Jedi or Sith and not because she drew the shortest stick, but because she did something in her past that none other could have done. Something that litterally draws the followers and Kreia alike, to the Exile, but one would have to play the game to understand. Most of the story is a lesson to the protagonist, and the player -- About the ideas of morality, and how being a nice & benevolent saint might not always be the right thing to do; Least of all being cruel and despicable. Relying heavily on the Force is brought up as a sign of weakness, and that true strength comes from not needing it. All of this is dictated through the enemies you fight, the choices you make, the characters you meet and certainly through the character of Kreia. It'sKOTOR 2 is a story of self-realization, different shades of morality, confronting the past and learning from past mistakes to face the future. Knights of the Old Republic 2 gets a strong recommendation from me, simply for being unlike any other Star Wars game and with the Restoration Mod -- A much better game than BioWare's original Knights of the Old Republic! :)			"

												Let me tell you a story.I installed the restored content mod, booted up the game, made a Consular and went into the options to crank up the difficulty to the max before I started. I consider myself pretty good at games built off Bioware systems, and I played KOTOR I on the hardest difficulty without issue.Fine, all was dandy. Played the game going full sith. Corrupted all my companions, which was a very memorable experience. Downloaded it on my laptop and kept playing from there. The first 35 hours of the game was absolutely amazing, and I was rejoicing in my EEVIL.However, around the 30 hour point I noticed how easy the game seemed to be getting. Being the stereotypical arrogant gamer, I thought that was down to my epic skills and great build. I got lazy, thought the game was so easy, I only bothered to level up 3 characters, and the others were left in the dirt.How wrong I was.See, the first 35 hours or so are epic, but the ending of the game is unfinished. There are a lot of endless rooms with the same trash mobs. The restored content mod is a mixed blessing, because it brings back a lot of extra levels which feel very empty, as the devs only half-finished them and didn't put them in the game. By the 50 hour point, I was getting fed up. Just wanted it to be over.Then came the HK factory. Oh boy. The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ HK factory is one of the half-finished levels put in by the restored content mod. It's in the ending sequence, so you can't back out once you've got there without losing hours of progress. Would usually be fine, but it turns out the HK factory is a solo mission. A solo mission for one of the characters I'd never bought gear for or levelled up. So I was stuck there. With a character with default starting armor, no weapons and no accessories. He has level 3 stuff, against endless level 23 trash mobs of EXACTLY the same enemy. Let me get this straight, there are at least 100 enemy droids in the HK factory. Every single one of them was capable of oneshotting my character. He did like 10 damage to their health pools of 200+ HP with every shot. Whatever, I thought, I'll turn down the dificulty.To my horror, when I opened up the options menu, I realised that when I transferred the game over to my laptop the difficulty settings had not transferred. I'd been playing the entire game on easy. This was as easy as it got. Oneshots and 10 damage per shot. It seemed impossible.At this point, usually I would just laugh at myself and watch a let's play of the game's end. But for some reason I was determined to finish this game. It played me! I would get my revenge at any cost!So I scraped together all the health potions I had and RAN through the HK factory level. If I got hit more than once, I'd have to start over again. It was absolute agony. I died so many times, as many rooms had 5+ enemies which could jump me at once. So I had to learn, gradually, the exact patterns I could run so that I could avoid taking the damage. It was the most pathetic I've felt playing a game. It took quite a few hours, and I was so close to giving up. But in the end, I did it. I suffered, but I did it. Upped and ran past every single enemy in that large level. And after doing that, I felt more satisfaction that I can ever remember feeling from playing a game - even after defeating Dark Souls bosses or something like that. I was rewarded by the game's real ending sequence (which is awesome).I felt a warm glow of pride from being able to successfully run away from trash mobs on easy difficulty. 10/10 game is an emotional rollercoaster, would recommend the suffering to anyone.

												I think that Star Wars Knights of the old Republic II is an awesome experience and a must if you enjoyed the first game or Bioware games in general. Obsidian released it a little sloppy and missing lots of content, but the majority of cut content can be restored and bugs fixed with 'The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod' (TSLRCM); an aftermarket add-on developed to bring this game up to speed.*Highly recommended, but only with TSLRCM.

												TL;DR: The ambitious and messy sequel to Knights of the Old Republic. Darker than the first game, some very good writing, expect to encounter uneven pacing and bugs. Lots of bugs.Long Version: Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic 2 is role-playing game where you take on the role of one of the few Jedi left alive after an event that takes place after the end of the first game. Your main character has a choice between three starting classes, Guardian (strong combat class), Consular (strong force-user) and Sentinel (balance between combat and use of the force, emphasis on skills). You have an option to take up a secondary class later on in the game. Throughout the game, you acquire companions, you can have up to two assisting you, while the rest remain at base. Manage your character and follower's levelling up and inventory. Combat is real-time with pause, which means you can pause in the middle of a fight to issue orders. If you unfamiliar with the first game, Dragon Age: Origins would be the closest game to compare this to. Also includes a very basic crafting system, and two optional minigames (a cardgame and a racing game). Familiarity with the plot of the previous game is not required, but in my opinion, highly reccomended as the lore dump might be overwhelming. The game does a very good job at establishing for the first few hours that your ex-Jedi is being hunted by an unknown enemy, vulnerable without your lightsaber and cut off from the rest of the Order. Your connection to the Force weakend, and you are slowing re-establishing connection to it. The starting area is an apparently abandoned mining facility called Peragus. You will pick up the basics of the game in this area. Players already who have already beaten the first game, or replaying KOTOR 2, will find the starting area slow and annoying. It does not need to take more than 30-45 minutes to complete, but it does feel much longer and drawn out. Fortunatly there is a mod that allows you to skip this part.The game picks up the pace when you visit the next area, where you finally get to make interesting plot choices. I would say your choices are more meaningful than in KOTOR. You are railroaded for a bit longer, after which you are presented with a choice of four hubs on four seperate planets to complete in any order you choose. The pacing and content of the four planets vary an lot. Two of the planets (Onderon and Nar Shaddaa) feel much more fully fleshed out and with a great deal of content, with the other two feeling there was content cut from the game (Dantoonie and Korriban). The same could be said for your companions, some being more fleshed out than others. The mood of the game is dark, very dark for a Star Wars game. The Jedi Order destroyed, Republic recovering from a series of devestating conflicts, shades of grey in decisions you are forced to make, and your companions include some very unsavory characters (including a former torturer for the Sith, bounty hunter, and an insane mass murdering Wookie). The Sith are given an lot more dimension in this game, they have their say in this game, and aren't neccessarily cartoon villians as portrayed in other SW games. Playing as a Jedi going down the Dark Side need not have force you to play an unsympathetic psychopath totally lacking in subtlety. Plot may be harder to follow than in the previous game, you may feel slightly at loss around the 75% mark, but I personally felt it was very rewarding to pay attention to it.The version of this game on Steam includes Workshop modding support, some graphical enchancements, support for higher resolutions, controllers and wide-screen. As of now, these enchancements haven't made their way to the first Knights of the Old Republic game. The game is still very much buggy however: enemies shooting through walls, characters getting stuck in areas, and dialogue sometimes automatically skipped. Smart players will keep multiple saves, incase a bug prevents the completion of certain missions. Game engine still runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥ even on modern hardware, I have a GTX 680 and game sometimes drops to the low 20 FPS.Note there is a mod in the Steam Workshop called ""The Sith Lords Restored Content"", which does what it says on the tin, restores much of the missing content. It adds two larger areas missing from the base game, plus a few lines and missions. It is worth trying out, just the once however. You will quickly notice what parts of the game ended up on the cutting room floor, and realise why they were cut. M4-78, a droid planet, involves an lot of back-tracking and couriering messages between NPCs. Buggy, does not add anything to the story, unnecessarily large areas, and introduces some questionable fan voice acting to fill in the lines that were never recorded for the game. The other, a manufacturing plant for assassin droids, is tighter and contains lots of funny dark humour. But like M4-78, it did not add anything to the plot, and it gets tedious very quickly with the many health-sponge enemies.My completed save took me around 45 hours to complete all the sidemissions, the restored content, and Light Side ending. The ending, by the way, also felt rushed and much less satisfying than the previous game. If you are used to RPGs like Dragon Age or Bauldurs Gate, this game may be on the too easy side for you. Turn up the difficulty and don't pick Jedi Guardian as your character class.In conclusion: The game feels very much like the ""Empire Strikes Back"" to KOTOR's ""A New Hope"". Darker, more intriguing, and complicated. Unfortunatly the vision the developers had for this game was never fully realised, absolutely brilliant in some places, felt like a missed opportunity in others. Very much a diamond in the rough.The Good: plot, characters, interesting choices to be made, a fleshed out and realised universe. The recent enchancements added to the game.The Bad: the ending, uneven pacing. Perhaps too easy for most RPG fans. The Ugly: bugs and poor performance.  Thank you for reading, please let me know in the comments if there's anything I should do to improve my reviews in the future!			"

												If ever there was a game that deserved to be judged fairly by history, this is probably it.Everyone interested in this game at all knows the story. KoToR 1 is undisputably one of the greatest games of a generation. The follow up had immense hype, development was going well, and then the publishers pushed it out the door unreasonably early.The result, and reaction, was predictible. A game that for all it did right could never quite measure up. I often referred to it as ""the best public beta ever"". That's something I stand by playing it now. Some people enjoyed it as a flawed masterpiece. Others derided the obvious lack of debugging. We all agreed the final chapter was obviously rushed and simply wasn't done. It was a shame, and it fell squarely on the publsher.Luckily, the game's community was kind. As was this re-release, with some mild enhancements, and Steam Workshop integration. That means there is literally no reason to have this on Steam and not be using the (fabled) Restored Content Mod, that undoes so many wrongs. One single press of a green subscribe button in the workshop undoes a foolish, greedy mistake. A truly great piece of work loaded with bugfixes, and finally seeing the game as it should have been from the beginning in 2005.And what a game it finally is. So many bugs gone, so many plot holes filled with the dialogue that was recorded but never programmed to trigger in the final release, a so much more complete experience. It's a massive, almost overwhelming game. Unlike most Star Wars, it isn't overly sugary sweet, the line between good and evil is rarely clear at points. It's got real depth. And it's an epic adventure for the ages.I love the KoToR games. I always did. Nobody in their right mind disliked the first game. And it really warms my heart to see that, even if it took me 10 years to see the final result, the second game turned out alright after all.			"

												This is one of those oldies but goodies. It does have a few problems like glitches, weird twiching, and skipping cutscenes. However, I feel the gameplay pays for the glitchiness. Plus the glitches are sometimes hilarious. This game is also extremely long. Compared to some of today's games, this is like a 5 game trilogy all in one package of fun. They don't make games like these anymore. This game is great and lasts ages. This game is really good for something that came out in 2005. This game has great text-tree conversations too. While you can't even compare this to Telltales' dialogs, it is certainly much cheaper and provides much more time to enjoy the game. You can finish Telltale's episodes within 30 minutes. After that you wait another month for the next episode. I would say money wise, this is one of the best things you can buy on Steam. These days an hour of gameplay costs $60. This game is relatively cheap and has replay ability. This is definetly a good game for new RPG players. Lots of RPGs are intense and difficult to understand. KOTR II is a great buy for anyone on Steam.			"

												""HK-47, what is love?""“Definition: 'Love' is making a shot to the knees of a target 120 kilometres away using an Aratech sniper rifle with a tri-light scope.

												A lot of people give this game a lot of crap, especially seeing that is is the sequal to the masterpiece that came before. There are some glaring issues with the normal version of the game, but that does not make it a bad game. At the end, it ties in quite nicely to KOTOR but there are some things missing from the game. The game seems unfinished at times. That can all be fixed by using the Restored Content Mod (found here http://www.moddb.com/mods/the-sith-lords-restored-content-mod-tslrcm ). This mod adds a tremendous amount to the game. Basically there was a bunch of unreleased stuff that wasn't finished in the game. The makers of this mod made the game more of what it was supposed to be. It really made this game what it is for me. It's a good game without the mod. It's a great game with it			"

												Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II is one of the most underrated RPGs of all time while also being one of the greatest RPGs ever made. Hands down. This game has been plagued with an undeserved negative reputation all across the internet for reasons I can only assume must be both malicious and blatantly fraudulent.Heres my take on KOTOR2 and it's bad rep.1. MAJOR BUGS and GLITCHESI have never EVER suffered a single game killing bug playing KOTOR2 unlike what is said from everyone else which leads me to believe it's all either collective disinformation or people need to stop playing on Win95 PCs, I have beat it 12 times with no mods and twice with many mods on multiple different PCs with both Windows and Linux (WinXP, Win7, Win10, Ubuntu 12.04, Peppermint 4, Lubuntu 16.04) using the DVD version, the Steam version and even the original Xbox version on both the original Xbox and Xbox 360. No game crashes, no freezes, no game killing bugs of any kind, not once, ever. Either I am very lucky, people do not know what they are doing or the internet is full of♥♥♥♥♥♥ I have had resolution issues in the past but that was because AMD drivers suck and because the game was simply not made in the era of HD but it has since been updated to accommodate this very issue amongst other minor things.2. THE ENDING WAS TERRIBLEThe ending was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cliffhanger, KOTOR 3 was already in the works to directly follow the game and got canceled. In other words, the story was not finished, it was to be continued on so in that the ending was actually really good in terms of what it was trying to accomplish which was, once again, a cliffhanger ending in preparation for a sequel that no one at the time knew would never happen. This is also perfectly in line with the Star Wars franchise, In ""A New Hope"" it had a cheesy dumb ending (like in KOTOR1) and in ""Empire Strikes Back"" it had a cliffhanger, a fairly dark cliffhanger (like in KOTOR2) in preparation for ""Return of the Jedi"" so imagine if Star Wars Episode 6 never happened and you were just left with the first two films and a cliffhanger ending of the second... Thats what it's like and people would call you dumb if you said ""Empire Strikes Back sucks because the ending was just so gosh darn terrible!"" If those people knew the facts behind the ending and why it never got explained, they'd call you and idiot and they'd be right.3. KOTOR1 WAS BETTERIn what way? Story? Gameplay? Quality? To my mind it depends on what you want. Kotor1 was very basic, very to the point but yes was well written, well acted and overall well made. No question. BUT what did it lack? - Depth in both story and character development. - It, like all of Star Wars, had a very black and white view of good and evil both visually and in the ways it told the story. - The gameplay had less game mechanics than Kotor2.- The game had far less dialogue options than Kotor2. - It had far less options in terms of how one completes a mission, granted not too much less... to be fair. - Kotor1 in no real way branched off from the rest of the Star Wars universe in any way that would separate it from the rest of the franchise.. In other words, unlike Kotor2, it never questions the philosophical foundations of Star Wars and thus neatly fits within the Star Wars motif, some people may actually see that as a good thing... Whatever floats your Death Star.- Kotor1 has a giant evil military machine floating in space. Kinda getting tired of giant Sith machines.- Kotor1 contains too many damn Star Map dreams.- In Kotor1 your choices do not directly affect your teammates except when you choose the dark side and only near the end of the game.- Kotor2 actually tells you when♥♥♥♥♥♥is ♥♥♥♥ing empty.- Kotor2 allows you to build/upgrade far more items.- Kotor1's story was NOT written by Chris Avellone.I'm sure I could go on but these are just a few things that Kotor1 doesn't have that Kotor2 did that made it far more interesting, immersive and fun.MY RATING...9/10MY SPECS...Intel i5 446016GB of RAMGTX 980TiWindows 7/Lubuntu 16.04			"

												TLDR VERDICTKOTOR 2 is a very worthy successor to the high bar set by the original game. They kept the general gameplay and presentation true the original and put their own unique spin on the story. Many people argue it is actually a superior game to the original. Overall, a rough, buggy and now dated, but still very entertaining game well worth the asking price if you’re a fan of the original or fan of Star Wars in general.MUST HAVE MOD IS 


(English) The Sith Lords Restored Content Modification (TSLRCM) 
A Workshop Item for STAR WARS™ Knights of the Old Republic™ II: The Sith Lords™
By: Hassat Hunter

			This mod's intention is to restore much of the content cut from The Sith Lords, that was lost to the main game due to a rush to release the game.		


MOD REVIEW BENEATH FULL GAME REVIEWFULL REVIEW BELOW*MOST OF MY HOURS ARE OFFLINE DUE TO INTERNET RESTRICTIONS WHERE I LIVE*“Take the greatest Jedi Knight, strip away the Force, and what remains? They rely on it, depend on it, more than they know. Watch as one tries to hold a blaster, as they try to hold a lightsaber, and you will see nothing more than a woman – or a man. A child.” - KreiaFive years after the events of KOTOR, the galaxy is recovering from the events from the Jedi Civil War. Both the Jedi and Sith have now fallen silent. You have been exiled from the Jedi Order as punishment for following Revan into war against the Mandolorians. You have also been completely cut off from the Force, but was this a part of your punishment, or the result of something much worse?This review is written from a huge Star Wars fan and a fan of story driven RPGs in general.GAMEPLAY AND DESIGNIn terms of general gameplay and structure, KOTOR 2 is designed very similarly to the first game. It features the same turn-based D20 based combat system and character building as the first game and other old-school RPGs. This can be a quite daunting system to learn for those unfamiliar with these types of games, but fortunately the lower difficulty settings are forgiving enough for those without the patience or time to learn it. Combat is important, but arguably not as much as the stat and skill point distribution. Making sure you have characters with the appropriate skills determines being able to deal with obstacles in the world, conversation checks and crafting. The game does feature an automatic leveling up system which will do the leveling for you, which is fine in the late game after you have all the skills you need, but it may be worth doing some research in the early game for leveling up. The companions are all reasonably balanced and they level up with you, meaning that you can take anyone anywhere (at least from a gameplay perspective).The game isn’t entirely open world by any means. It’s similar to KOTOR and Dragon Age: Origins, in the sense that you travel between several fairly small focused areas rather than one continuous land mass. The areas are either mostly linear action packed levels or slower paced story driven quest hub areas. Crafting is important system to pay attention to as you can craft item modifications to create weapons more powerful than the ones you find. This is a fairly simple system that involves breaking down items you don’t need for materials, but it’s just a case of knowing what the stats actually mean. Of course, on lower difficulties you can get away with not paying much attention to gear and stats and still just about get by spamming the same attacks. You won’t find it very challenging, but more than adequate for just seeing the story (which in my opinion, is the main draw of the game).STORY AND NARRATIVEIt’s never easy to develop a follow up on such a beloved game from a different developer, but Obsidian certainly delivered on delivering a sequel that is true to the original and yet unique in its own way. KOTORs story felt very much like a grand space adventure and it captured everything that the classic Star Wars story should be. KOTOR 2 differs from this slightly. It tells a more subtle story with a focus on different themes. In stark contrast to KOTORs overt villains, KOTOR 2s threat is a lot more sinister. The battles with the Sith are fought in the shadows and the themes are a lot darker. An example of the darker tone is a reoccurring idea in the game that to the galaxy’s Average Joe, Jedi and Sith are indistinguishable. They just people with too much power fighting over religion and getting everyone else caught in the middle. This is a really unique and interesting idea and caught me completely off guard. Another good theme was the idea of the absence of the Force and the advantages it has aside from the obvious disadvantages.The conversation system is identical to KOTOR, with the standard light and dark alignment options and the opportunities to use skills (if you have the stats) in certain special situations. In my opinion, morality is much more interesting in KOTOR 2 than in the first one. Picking light or dark and sticking to it not only changes the ending, but the entire game. It shifts your characters goals for the whole game and also effects the gameplay. Dark and light side powers become easier/harder (but not impossible) to do if you are the opposite morality and it can result in some rather large deviations on the story line during some quests. It also affects your companions and over time you can even begin to influence their morality (e.g. enlightenment vs corruption). Overall, I’d say the game changes enough to warrant multiple playthroughs with different morality choices. On the topic of companions, you can expect yet another colourful crew of heroes, villains, droids and miscreants. They are very varied from the original games selection, but just as interesting and unique. Gameplay wise, they still have classes that need to have their stats properly assigned and equipped with the right gear. However, pretty much any configuration of companions is viable to take anywhere, which is good for the story. It makes it feel like you travel with ALL of your companions rather than just bringing your favourites and leaving everyone else on the ship. Your actions also influence your companions, resulting in them liking or disliking you more depending on how you act. Having them like you opens up more story and has gameplay benefits I can’t elaborate on without light spoilers. A quick note on voice acting: personally I found a particular companions voice actor laughably bad (look out for the one-armed Iridonian), but he’s really the only one that stands out. The rest of the game is mostly either passable or excellent.GAMEPLAY AND PERFORMANCEAs is customary with Obsidian games, they are often not given enough time for playtesting and optimisation leaving them somewhat lacking in the performance department. I expect you won’t encounter many problems these days however, as unsurprisingly an 11 year old game runs at 60fps 100% of time and doesn’t look half bad for its age. I did get a crash or two here and there and more than a fair share of bugs, but fortunately nothing game breaking or huge. I didn’t run into any compatibility problems either (running Windows 7). Funnily enough, the game actually got a patch recently that fixed a lot of problems, added controller support, support for higher resolutions and some other fixes. The biggest change was the addition was the addition of Steam Workshop for the game, which allows the seamless installation of some mods that restores a whole bunch of content that was cut from the game. Look up The Sith Lords Restored Content mod if you get the game, but it should be the highest rated anyway.TSLRCM REVIEWTSLRCM fixes many bugs, quests and all round genral nuisances that affect the game. It adds (restores) lost cutscenes that give better reasons and fixes endings to give a more full conclusion.It completes the game. I personally would reccomend palying the without the mod (or any mods infact) to fully taste the (lacking) game but then when re-playing it would change your experiance greatly.			"

												I don't write reviews on Steam often. This game is one of my exceptions. KOTOR II may also be my favorite Star Wars story. The movies are great, so is KOTOR I, and I highly recommend them as well, however KOTOR II is very much the Dostoevsky to their Stephen King, forgive the dorky literary analog. One is entertaining, whereas the other makes you think. KOTOR II is, on the surface, a rather standard RPG. You're railroaded from point A to B through various locales, picking up side quests, and trying to beat the Big Bad. Standard♥♥♥♥♥♥honestly. Where the game excels is in how this is presented. Rather than the standard adventure approach we are so used to, KOTOR II instead takes the chance to tell a dark, ambiguous, and complex tale exploring betrayal, anger, hope, apathy, revenge, the nature of good and evil, the nature of the Force, the complexity of human emotions, relationships, loss, and most importantly, finding out who you are. This is not in the sense we explore in KOTOR I, for those of you who've played it. This is not the tale of an amnesiac, it is the tale of a broken man/woman who has been repeatedly betrayed by everyone, and everything they've trusted. It's the tale of someone trying to find meaning for themselves in a world that has repeatedly stolen meaning from them. Even as you make the choices for your Jedi, man or woman, good or evil, Consular or Sentinel, it all ingeniously boils down to who this character is. You can help define them, but unlike the MC of KOTOR I, the history truly means something more than an interesting twist, or a way to move along plot. It starkly defines all that you do, from beginning to end in ways that require you to question every action you make. This might be one of few games out there, where being the good guy can still make you feel like♥♥♥♥♥♥by the end of the game. As the game so splendidly relates, all that you do has an effect, both seen and unseen, and how neither extreme, light or dark, can be wholly considered right or wrong. Even after all of that I'm nowhere near describing the amazing characters, quest-lines, quotes, philosophical dialogue, and beautiful moody/dark feeling of looming doom, and ambiguity that is summoned by the central plot of this game. Just go out and buy the damn game! It's awesome, and if you're tired of the same old copy and paste characters, and horrendous or uninspired dialogue that saturates most RPG's, look no further. The game is a masterpiece! As a quick side note, get the TSLRCM mod, the base game is good, but sadly Obsidian, as is often the case with them, had a tight deadline, and couldn't make the game as bug free, nor as filled with content as they intended. The mod adds a lot of cut content, including a new planet (It isn't huge, or filled with tons more quests, so don't get too excited.), fixes several game breaking, or quest breaking bugs, and generally just irons out a lot of issues the initial release had.

This game. Buy it.If you have already bought it, pull it out of your pile of shame and play it already.+Story and dialogue are amazing. +It is still being updated years after release. They added achievements among other things.+Differences in light-side and dark-side playthroughs kept it fun for both.-A couple achievements didn't want to pop, but reloading and redoing it seemed to work. I save often.-Wished I could kill more exchange guards on telos. They quit posting them outside after you kill the fourth one.-Jeez. The lost Czerka twilek is annoying as hell on telos. If you are going light-side you of course want to help out, but the idiot can't seem to walk around random crates on your way to the entrance. Really made my dark jedi come out.9/10. Would force choke my companions again.			"

												This series of Star Wars video games is my personal favorite, Knights of the old republic is by far the best Star Wars game available for single player, I only wish their newest game for Knights of The Old Republic included a single player mode like this one.I loved playing these when I was younger and still do.Their uniqueness of character paths has really made this game one of the best. Like their newest release, you can make your character have their own path, their own abilities, and followers. I strongly recommend this game to people who would enjoy a fun action-packed single player game with various ways and paths to complete it. "

												Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis ""the wise""? I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.			"

												Let's get this out of the way: KOTOR2 is not KOTOR1. I loved KOTOR1.  It was the first real PC RPG that I was going to bite into as a kid, despite having toyed with Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale when they were the 'hot things' to hit the market.  From the first to the fourth disc, I was playing out some of the best scenarios I was convinced could ever have existed in a video game; it certainly helped that it was all being played out in the Star Wars universe, which, to any bright-eyed kid who loved the original trilogy, was something to behold. And then came KOTOR2.  As a bit of a set-up: I never had the chance to play KOTOR2 when it was originally released, but I was there to watch the bile and distaste that most gamers had for it.  Reviews from users on a variety of other gaming sites came in, deriding the story and claiming that it was a vastly inferior title compared to the stellar original.  It was incomplete, people had said: the story was unfinished, and for the most part, the game felt empty and had a plot unfitting for the Star Wars universe. Then comes 2014, where I finally had the time to do a bit more reading on the game, including the (now famous) content restoration mod.  I bought the game on sale, installed the mod, fired it up - - and was hooked for the next 30 something hours that I had it installed and played.  I loved the game so much, that it promptly was installed on my laptop, just so I could get a few hours in on the go during downtime.  It was fantastic. KOTOR2, for those unfamiliar and reading this review in hoping to tip the scales, is a Star Wars game, yes.  It takes place in the Star Wars universe.  It involves jedi, lightsabres, starships, the Sith, light versus darkness - except, not really, particularly the last bit.  You see, head writer Chris Avellone never really liked the Star Wars universe - or, parts of it's mythos, anyway.  The Light and Dark sides seemed too binary, too hilariously Machiavellan at turns to really allow him to write the stories he has become so well known for among PC RPG fans (Planescape: Torment being the elephant - or perhaps well-endowed titan - in the room).  He wanted to shake things up, narratively speaking, and it shows: the game is not so simply about the light versus the dark (as, arguably, the original trilogy of films and the first KOTOR are steadfast about), but instead, how such concepts do not work when we apply the idea of secondary belief to the universe at large.  (For some more insight into Avellone's thoughts on the universe, I suggest looking up Super Bunnyhop's interview with the man himself on YouTube).  The game features you as the Jedi Exile - a wounded warrior who had returned from the Mandalorian Wars to the Jedi Council, only to be banished (for reasons unknown) and to have their powers stripped from them.  As you awaken on a mining facility, with a case of amnesia and tremendously weakened from the ordeal, you come to realize that something is wrong with the force, and the Sith, no less, are behind it.  You set out on an adventure with a series of unlikely companions to determine just what happened to you, and what this new face of Sith appear to be up to.  The companions, a highlight of any BioWare style RPG, but particularly for Obsidian (the designers at the helm, here), feature some fantastic heroes.  Some cliches remain, to ensure you're playing in a game set within the universe you signed up for, of course: there's still the charming rogue who represents the Han Solo of the title, the sassy bounty hunter, the wise and mysterious Jedi Master.  But it's not the same.  Something feels 'off', in the most magnificent way possible as you spend time speaking with these characters.  They're thematically similar, yes, but the way they express and espouse their discomfort with the status quo of the Force and the Universe makes you realize how real humans living in the far corners of the galaxy might actually feel about how things work when you're facing space wizards and death-bent cultists.  It doesn't stop at the companions.  KOTOR1 had the bad habit of setting up encounters across its planets in a very blase pattern.  Find planet - fight through corridors - find friendly race - handle problems.  Oh, it's very high adventure and there are several key notes within the campaign.  But that's how it feels and how it ultimately handles for much of it.  KOTOR2 shines in this regard - at least, it does for a limited time, but we'll talk about that later.  One of the largest planets in the game has you splitting up your party, facing enemies alone as your companions in what seems like impossible odds, encountering foes in what you thought were the safest regions of the map, and having traps and battles sprung on you when you honestly least expected it.  There were several times where I found myself popping tinctures and med pacs just to stay alive, staving off death and improving party members in thoughtful ways to defend against some truly interesting scenarios.  But then we have the common problem - and the one that you will probably continue to see across all of the reviews that are written here - is that the game is unfinished.  There are far too many elements of it that are clearly missing, stripped down, or otherwise incomplete that make it lesser than the game it starts off (and is, in the perfect world, ideally meant to be).  Those creative scenarios?  They really only happen on one planet (Nar-Shaddah - and, take note, new players: head there first, if you can.)  Companions suddenly 'disappear' from the final encounter with no explanation as to why they are not with you.  Some character history lines seem to just drop dead.  As the game runs out of steam, the following planets ultimately feel a bit one-note and flat (and veer too close to KOTOR1's rather vanilla campaign).  The ending seems to have written itself in a corner and provides too little closure for what the game seems to be setting you up for.  What begins and ends with a bang, closes with a whimper.  Does that mean that KOTOR2 is a game not worth your time or money?  Of course not.  If you've ever enjoyed Avellone's writing, then it still comes through strong in this title, butchered and shortened as it is.  The characters are interesting and foster genuine curiosity about the world the Old Republic represents.  There are still some genius set encounters, particularly in the early and late game, that challenge what it means to have quests and how to experience a story in a western RPG.  The only problem is, when all is said and done, when you've put in your 30-something hours and you see the final cutscene, you leave with that bitter and sour taste as your final realization is this: What an RPG this truly could have been.

THIS IS A GAME THAT ANY STAR WARS--OR RPG FAN SHOULD PLAY (TL;DR at bottom.) I wasn't sure I'd like it, to be honest. I got it over a year ago because I was almost done with my first playthrough of the first KOTOR game. But as I continued to delve deeper and deeper into the plot, I realized that this game may just be better than the original--I know, sue me; it's just so good. So what made this buggy, old, rushed game so good? Graphics: 13/20; (per 2004, 18/20 on high settings): The engine from the first game was still relatively nice looking at this point, but I can definately tell the difference between the two games. By today's standards, the graphics kinda suck, although they aren't too distracting, becuase it isn't the focus of the game. Gameplay: 19/20: Okay, now when I started this game, I detested the gameplay; it was one of the reasons that I didn't complete it for over a year after buying it. It's hard to get used to, but once you do, it's quite endearing. Second playthrough, still loving the gameplay. Again, though, not the focus of this game. Sound: 20/20: Like literally some of the best voice acting I've ever heard; even after 35 hours, I was not tired of the voices. Music was good, too (Star Wars, you know), but my recommendation is that you turn it down, becuase it's kind of overpowering if you don't personally set it. Story: 20/20 (Considering giving it 21/20): Now... now, young padawans... let me tell you that this is the Creme de la Creme of all games I've ever played, save maybe TLoU or TWDS1. This story--side quests and main quests--is amazing. It makes the entire star wars saga look like it was designed by a child. This dark, sinister story... I could go on and on, but instead I'll give you the gist of it. The theme of the first game was redemption and being true to one's self. This game is about betrayal and loss. I can't go on without revealing too much; I just can't say enough to do it justice, either. I've never been so obsessed with a game. I couldn't stop playing. Sadly, Finals were the next week, so I had to stop playing. Seriously: get this game just for this. Lasting appeal(Characters and world): 20/20: The characters are what make the story; the world is what makes the characters--domino effect. If it weren't for these characters, their dedicated roles of voice acting, and the expanded universe of Star wars being explored, this game wouldn't be as good; it would still be good, but not as good. Since this is a star wars game, most players don't need too much explaining to understand (""Jedi, sith, What are those?"") if they've played the first game, so the story is the main focus. Cons: Bugs... lots of bugs; more bugs in this game than in a Vegan Naturalist's hair. But it's worth it; the bugs can be endearing, most of the time they're just plain annoying. If you can get over bugs, this game is worth it; just get to know your computer and remember that most of the time, just an alt+tab will fix it; if not, try reloading your last save; if the game freezes, you'll need the ctrl+alt+del. Only significant complaints. (P.S. I used the Restored Content Mod, so probably most of my issues came from mods, but if not, try these things.) TL;DR Graphics: 13/20 (2004: 18/20); Gameplay: 19/20; Sound: 20/20; Story: 20/20; Lasting Appeal (Characters and world setting): 20/20. Lots of bugs, but amazing game underneath all the issues. OVERALL: 97/100 Spectacular. Seriously... Great game. Get it. RPG or star Wars fan, don't miss this. Get the first one, as well, even though I don't think it's as good.			"

												The best RPG I have played in my life. I recommend having TSLRCM (It's in the steam workshop) installed from the start, it adds back lots of great content that was cut from the game during development. I personally find this one far superior to the first game, the difficulty is more balanced (doesn't mean that you can't cheese your way through though), the dark turn this game took is definitely more interesting, characters are a lot better written in my opinion. The ending isn't as bad as people make it out to be either. This is less of a review than a recommendation to buy this game right freaking now.			"

												The original KOTOR 2 was & still is a buggy experience. However it all changes with the TSLRCM mod which fixes a lot of issues & restores much of the cut content from the original. While KOTOR 1 started as a nobody who'd eventually become a jedi/sith... KOTOR 2 actually lets you start & play as a force user from the beginning.  However the end question is is it worth it?? The answer is YES.Buy the game... download the TSLRCM mod from the workshop & enjoy a great rpg that's totally worth your time & money. "

												A timeless game that makes you feel like you are a jedi or sith! I played the original Knights of the old republic back in 2003 and absolutely loved it...then I played the sequel and also loved it, though I didn't  dedicate myself as much as I had to the first one! Now I have rectified that mistake. KOTOR 2 is a wonderful game even for todays standards of 2014. I have spent 34 hours completing it and savoured every second. I believe these games transport you to a sweeter Star Wars universe than the one you see in all those movies. 5*.			"

KotOR II: The Sith Lords is best played with TSLRCM (The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod). If you don't have it for this game, get it. Most mods you will ever download for this game depend on that mod to function correctly.Trust me, without TSLRCM the story isn't gonna make much sense, if at all.Alright, let me start off by saying KOTOR II: The Sith Lords is an absolutely incredible *addicting* game - even better with TSLRCM. As much as I enjoyed the first KotOR (and I really enjoyed that game) I enjoyed this game even more.Anyways here is my breakdown of the game:PROS+ Includes 57 Steam Achievements+ Each time you play through the game you may discover/learn something you didn't in the previous playthrough+ Excellent/Addictive Story+ In many ways a contiuation of the first, yet not in so many others (Depending on what you say to Atton, Carth and Bastila make an appearance somewhere in the story; more than once iirc)CONS- Limited Romance Options (Mira is pretty much a no-go, Handmaiden blindly falls in love with you, and Visas confesses her love for you at the end of the game - which is about it. No kissing.)- Too many technical and non-technical issues & bugs to count. Even with all the TSLRCM fixes there's still quite a lot.- Without TSLRCM, the story will NOT make much sense- Your first playthrough most likely will be your worst, like mine (but not your last thankfully)- This marks the end of the KOTOR Games (It's highly unlikely KOTOR III will happen folks)- The workshop makes installing non-workshop KOTOR II Mods a huge pain in the♥♥♥♥♥(I'm playing a semi-working but broken game right now thanks to the lousy Workshop)My Rating: 10/10 (Highly Recommended) "

												Very seriously the best Star Wars game and one of the best PC RPGs of all time.You don't have to have played the first Knights of the Old Republic to follow what's going on here, but if you did, you'll notice that when Obsidian took the license from Bioware they put out a game that just viciously dunks all over its predecessor. It's damn near disrespectful how much better KOTOR 2 is.KOTOR 2 freely gives away things that would qualify as major plot twists in the first game because its most important reveals are so much grander. It repeats archetypes from the first game and sometimes even grabs characters themselves from the first and says ""hold my beer; THIS is how to write them correctly."" I'm on my fourth play through (I'd played it twice before Steam existed) and I'm *still* discovering new things because there's just that much depth. Where the first KOTOR told your typical humdrum legendary hero Bioware story with ""moral choice"" amounting to being a boy scout or orphan-murderer, KOTOR 2 goes deeper. Is light always right? Can dark-sided actions be morally necessary? Are there unintended repercussions to simple acts of charity and kindness? Is anything worth believing in or fighting for?You don't *have* to delve into these questions. You can play it straight forward and ignore so much of the dialogue and character development if you really want. You can speed from start to finish obliterating enemies with Force Lightning and ignore every hint of story. But KOTOR 2 will gladly reward you for the time and attention you put into it. And it's so very worth it.			"

												Let me start by saying Kotor 2 is a wonderful game, especially so with the amazing restored content mod.Pros: -Atton, my favourite follower, not only for hilarious 1 liners, but for a highly in-depth and backstory.-A plot that isn't entirely revolved around Light vs Dark, that is intricately woven into the game, forcing you to pay to attention to the decisions you make.-A game where actions ACTUALLY HAVE CONSEQUENCES. -1 playthrough is NOT enough. I love how you can playthrough the game multiple times, but barely scratch the surface of the story.-HK-47. Nuf said.-Multiple styles to play the game. Playing as a Gun-Weilding, Bounty Hunter, Dark Side Sith Lord. Angelic Jedi Guardian. THE GAME DOESNT LIMIT YOU.Cons:-Quite Buggy at times.			"

												THE FUN IS STRONG WITH THIS ONE!I loved KOTOR, but I sadly heard that KOTOR 2  ""IT'S A TRAP!"". Supposedly it isn't as good as the first one and bugged as hell. So I said to myself that ""I'VE GOT A BAD FEELING ABOUT THIS"" and let my physical copy collect dust without much research about it. In some steam sale, I felt obligated to buy it again though.. and noticed that legends like Chris Avellone and Feargus Urquhart were responsible for it. Then my main gaming PC needed repair and long story short, I am so happy that it did. This game was on top of my old games bucket list and to my great surprise, literally next day that I started to play a great update went live. I felt lucky, but ""IN MY EXPERIENCE THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS LUCK"".. ;) So along with an excellent Restoration mod, KOTOR 2 was a unique, melancholic experience. It took me some time to fully warm up to it (unlike original KOTOR), but in some areas it is even better then it's predecessor. And to think that It could have been even better if not rushed in development.. Big thank you to all that still care about the game and enabled me to enjoy this gem. Now I can finally lost myself in TOR. Oh and find some petition for making Kotor 3 happen. MAY THE FUN BE WITH YOU.			"

Feel the Force playing the main character and seek the path of complete your knowledge about what happened to you and the Jedi OrderIntroductionFor a Star Wars fan playing this game again, is a luxury. Old memories came back and how I defeated enemies for the first time. I remember the first time when I played it and the emotion of being part of the Geroge Lucas universe. Feeling the Force with these characters, no matter the side you choose, light or dark. Every member of your group,  every planet has a unique story and a continuity carefully created. The chance of gaining influence with your partners and unlock certain things you will discover during the game is being played is fantastic. One of the best ideas of Obsidian and Bioware could see in other games like Mass Effect for example.Here you play the Exile, a former Jedi knight who followed Revan during the Mandalorian wars finishing at the disaster of Malachor V. There's a lot of story about Malachor V and almost a taboo among survivors. Only 5 years passed during that terrible war where the Republic suffered a great peril. You wake up in a station called ""Peragus"" and something is not there. Your powers. And the quest for recovering your connection with the Force starts there. What you do will have great repercussions in the galaxy.There are a lot of history background at the missions, and there is a big plot in the whole game and the main character is the center of this plot, and maybe others, who knows? GameplayYou can play a male or female character and depend on what you'll have different partners and romantic options. Also, the dark or light side will affect some of the decisions you'll take. You even can change the perspective in the middle of the game, I tried and worked. If I'm not mistaken, I played this game like 8 times. Yes, I'm a big fan. You don't do Star Wars? No problem at all. No matter the knowledge of the Old or new Republic, the Force and those issues, this is one of the best roleplaying games. And you'll have to try it if you like RPGs.The player has to think very carefully the decisions, you don't even know when you can gain dark or light side points. That will allow you to gain certain powers or not. Also gaining influence with the onboard characters could jeopardize these points or even influence with opposing members of the group.Comparing with the award winner, Knights of the Old Republic I think this second part is even more polished than the first but the previous one seems to have more choices in travel options.The skills and powers are well established. What I don't understand why a light side could use dark side powers. Of course, Force Storm is the best attack power, and there are some light side powers who will protect you from attacks.They never fixed some glitches and bugs, there are one in a cave of Korriban where you can get a lot of experience, also, there's a bug. You find Kreia and after the scene if you don't have a telepathic communication with her you'll be trapped there.I have to mention something about music and graphics. comparing actual games graphics are not the coolest, but this is an AAA game, and had the best graphics in their time.The soundtrack is one of the best I ever listened in my life. It's just precise and perfect for every moment. I'll make a special mention about the music in Malachor V, fantastic. Try to play that part in the dark and listen carefully. Amazing and a little bit creepy. Pros+ Star Wars, I mean it.+ In my opinion, the best RPG made of the franchise+ The richness story of every companion+ The story of the main character is a great one, full of question and not always a proper answer+ A great soundtrack Cons- They never fixed many glitches and bugs. I remember years ago costs me to start the game again. So, save!- There's a no return point if you had some extra quests to finish. Don't go to Dantooine Enclave after the mercenaries attack.- You'll have to replay the game and pay attention to complete all achievementsFinal ThoughtsAs I said before I loved this game. Not only because is a Star wars game, is one of the best Roleplaying Games I ever played. It's quite immersive game, in a Republic at the point of disaster, you in the skin of someone who want answers. There are a lot to explore and you¡'ll have to play several times to know everything of your party members.Play it. Maybe it's an old game but today we don't have this great plot and storytelling in a game.Rating: 9/10May the Force be with you "

												Developer Obsidian Entertainment was born of former PC RPG giant Black Isle Studios’ closure, and with the name Chris Avellone affixed as lead designer/writer there was an expectation that we’d be seeing something transcending the low standard of video games—even if they were stuck using flippin’ Star Wars (of all things: Really?) as a starting point.What Obsidian’s crew ended up doing was to look at Star Wars, at all Lucas and BioWare and every EU author had accomplished to manipulate the monomythic structure in the creation of something palatable and brilliantly addictive, and just…wrench a knife somewhere in them there guts and twist, twist until everything that gives the Star Wars appeal is torn apart. Piece by piece, the Sith Lords subtly begins feeding you each and every tired expectation, and, as they come, what you feel is this growing sense of relief, this subconscious drive to be satiated on your own literary comfort food—but: There’s always that moment—and you come to expect that too, come to rely on it as the antithesis to your prior highs—there’s always that moment the game asks Why? Of this path so often repeated, what accomplishments do you imagine?A beggar family, torn apart both financially and physically by war, asks for your help--a paltry sacrifice on your part to ensure their safety; maybe, just maybe, nearby stands a man asking for the same outcome, but in place of your own personal sacrifice he offers great monetary gain. It’s either-or, here, and the tendency of players will be towards “good” over “evil,"" so the sacrifice is made, the family hobbles off pitifully to presumed safety and bright futures. You yourself positively reflect on the morality bonuses given for another day saved--and the game stops you dead in your tracks, voicing—almost exclusively through your mentor Kreia—its frustrations with the ignorance inherent in your actions.No matter your in-game answer for Why?, the result is always the same; your choice, perceived as the moral high ground, was nothing but a wasteful performance of ignorant folly. Drawing parallels of your actions to vampirism, your acts of kindness, of Jedi charity, do nothing but steal what power the helpless may hold for your own use (i.e., the experience points gained by your choice, an idea reflected in Star Wars lore itself without any game-y statistics). No matter how buried motives are under the guise of self-sacrifice, helping the needy only serves to weaken them, altering their perceptions on universal modality and, in some cases, making them targets to others more desperate and lethally-driven towards the same goal.By following the ‘goodness’ of the Jedi code—a lie fabricated for self-preservation and personal profit—it's suggested you just led an entire family to their death.This deconstructive direction outside the realm of predictable comfort is what makes the Sith Lords such a massive improvement over BioWare’s excellent predecessor, and, really, the story is just too dang good for Star Wars; its goals far too high and self-aware, but also something the Star Wars brand has desperately needed for a long time.Yet, while the writing of the Sith Lords is far stronger than its prequel, I rate both titles the same, and may, personally, even view the first as a better game. Achievements aside, the Sith Lords is riddled with bugs, moments of atrocious pacing issues and literally a quarter of the game unfinished. Many of these issues have been repaired by dedicated fans over the years since release, but that’s still not enough: The long intro segment and Nar Shadaa still feature pacing issues that stem from more than a rushed development cycle, but simply clumsy planning and writing.Kreia’s continued domination over the players’ own emotional turmoils are what champion this game ahead of so many others, her words forever scarring views of Star Wars as fluffy entertainment. Amidst the wealth of coding error that would come to define Obsidian’s games, it’s that writing--that twisting of archetypal norms and the assumption of a moral compass built from her presence that make this journey so darn good. In the rush to finish this game under a holiday development schedule, she’s written out as Darth Traya, but despite the new name’s implications, despite the donning of black robes, she's never convincing as a villain. (It’s hard to buy her shadow mask when she’s always right, even if she is pushy and demanding. Her role as a mentor is far more believable.)It’s long before she makes her name in betrayal that she raises the avatar and herself from the dead. Five years have passed since Revan redeemed herself and saved the galaxy (the pawn of a Star Wars cliche repeated almost by the decade), and the next galaxy-wide threat is already in full effect. It’s unfortunate that not many seem to know it. This behind-the-scenes orchestration of tragedy is defined by absence in TSL: The concentration of power so great, so abnormal even by Star Wars standards that it threatens itself strictly by persisting, every moment needed to devour the essence of this life that connects every living being. Sith Lords Sion and Nihilus, Kreia’s guiding hand, the avatar herself—exiled by choice from the Jedi Order for her own acceptance of rational, necessary darkness—are all representative of the ultimate consequence of the power sought by good and evil in Star Wars lore, each in their own way black holes eating away at what seems, on the surface, like a coherent system guided by a familiar mythos born long before ’77.The rest of the supporting cast lends a helping hand in reinvent the Star Wars universe, too, with the best among them following the same route the game’s overall quest system takes. The first to join your cause is--of course--a clone of Han Solo even down to the predilection for familiar catch phrases, but as the story progresses his character is turned inside out, his snarky personality made merely a coping mechanism for his horrific past. Another is a twist on the now-stereotyped wookie: A psychopath tortured by his own culture, he adheres under a broken sense of honor to life debts--you know, that cultural norm handed down from his homeworld that would bind him to anyone who saves (or spares) his life--that also drives his psychopathy. He’ll fight alongside those owed such a debt, but not without the constant reminder that his only wish before dying is to gleefully dismember them.It’s this team of equally-lost souls the avatar and Kreia influence and guide on their mission to remove the devouring endgame. Since the conclusion of BioWare’s epic, Revan’s vanished and the Jedi Council lie in ruins. Barely a handful of members still live, and that persisting, devouring force quietly ravaging the galaxy has them in hiding. It’s the Exile’s job to pull these hiding Jedi out of their inherent selfishness either by hunting them down or banding them together to Save the World.Fantastic characterization and dialogue aside, story progression doesn’t bring the same joy or discovery BioWare gave players, due possibly to overcomplication or ridiculous ambition beyond TSL's budget. The series has since become an MMO, and the characters’ fates removed from the postmodern, deconstructive tone of TSL back into comfortable, anticlimactic Star Wars fare.Unfortunate.			"

												A Star Wars game like no other. I mean apart from the dark feeling that I felt throughout, its sheer scale and philosophical tracts made a deep impact on me when it first came out.

I can't recommend this game enough that, while with a few glitches and missing content (easily fixed with 'The Sith Lords Restoration Project Mod') it is certainly worthy of being played nearly ten years later with graphics being the only burden of it's age.9.5/10			"

												Just played this game through again post-update with the TSLRCM, doing almost every quest and experienced no crashes, and no lost saves. The game is just as good and fun 10 years later and now runs on 1080p with a 360 controller flawlessly! I plan to go back through on the darkside again to pick up the missed related achievements. If you remember KOTOR from the past or just like Star Wars or RPGs in general, pick this up!			"

												When I bought KotOR, playing it was just epic. After KotOR II was released, I decided to get it as soon as I could. I can say, it was, just like KotOR, one of the best investments I could have done. The game itself offers that much of a story, you can replay it and replay it and replay it. But due to my own stupidity, I lost the CD somehow and due to that, buying it again in store never happened. It changed when I saw it on Steam's Sale for 3,99EUR. Bought it and replayed it again. The best what could happen was the release of achievements. A couple of days ago, it caught me again, because I wanted to get all the achievements for one of my childhood games (plzz Steam do it for more old games :DDD). Now, several days later, I got them all and decided to write this review.I hope, that I might encourage people to buy/play it just like other aged games. Besides, both KotOR and KotOR II are must haves for StarWars fans :D.Regards,Wick			"

												Star Wars Knights of the old Republic II, to me, seemed like an awful game compared to the first one, but after going back and playing it again now in 2016, I now see how wrong I was. Kotor 1 still remains superior to the second, but it was pretty close. If you haven't played the first kotor, please play it before purchasing this game, everything will make so much more sense.If you decide to buy this game, I highly suggest downloading this mod 


(English) The Sith Lords Restored Content Modification (TSLRCM) 
A Workshop Item for STAR WARS™ Knights of the Old Republic™ II: The Sith Lords™
By: Hassat Hunter

			This mod's intention is to restore much of the content cut from The Sith Lords, that was lost to the main game due to a rush to release the game.		


This is a restoration mod to add things to the game that originally were supposed to be there, but were cut due to a deadline for the games release. You can download this mod off the steam workshop, so don't worry all of you people who don't like downloading off sketchy mod websites.			"

													Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II is an absolutely great game. But as many games do, it does have problems. And even though these problems are small and inconsistent, they are still a flaw in the game. And while it might not be as good as its predecessor, it still is an amazing game.Pro's: Compelling main storyline, great characters, beautiful worlds, and the modding community.Con’s: Bugs, and the starting planet.Storyline: 	The storyline of SWKOTOR 2 is a little complicated, but once you get to the nitty gritty, you can see it for its entirety. And while I would love to tell you how intriguing it is, I’m afraid that I will unwillingly tell you what the story is about. But once you start to play the game, and when you do get to the grit of the story, you will be more than interested in it.Characters:	The characters, my god the characters. Never in my life had I felt so much hate, love, and understanding for characters. Not even with most of modern games today. Every character you meet, either side characters or companions, all feel fleshed out. And while there are a stray or two that feel like they are cardboard cutouts, it’s not enough to detract from the world of this game. And your companions are probably the most interesting people you are going to see in this game.	They all have their own agendas. One of them just wants to get out of the situation, one just wants to be in the situation, and they’re all just so damn interesting. Not a single one of your companions are the same. If you were to rob someone blind, one of your companions will tell you that it was worth it because we need the caps. While the other one will scold you and tell you off. The game finds a way for it to work, and it works beautifully.Worlds:	The worlds in this game are absolutely stunning, and not a single world feels the same. If you go to Nar Shaddaa, you’ll feel crowded, claustrophobic, and lost. While on a forest world, you’ll feel like you're in the depths of a jungle. The world’s are portrayed outstandingly, and are an absolute charm to be in.Modding:	The modding community in this game is ferociously great. There are so many mods for the game that I can’t even count. And no, not just the Steam workshop. There are mods that fix the game, make it look better, and make every single part of the game feel much more fleshed out.Bugs:	And even though the game is great and has been patched multiple times, there are still so many damn glitches. One of these glitches, for instance, is a glitch that happens when you play the game for over 3-6 hours. And what basically happens is that is automatically skips dialogue for you. And while this is probably a must for speedrunners, the people who are more than interested in the game's narrative will find this a little more than annoying. But thankfully all you would need to do is simply restart the game to fix it.	But that still doesn’t mean that there aren’t some other bugs. I came to experience one of these bugs via teleportation. One minute I was walking down the hall and the next I was talking to one of my companions, and then the game crashed. And I lost everything that I have done up to that point. It was annoying but it only happened once while playing the game, so it wasn’t that big of a deal.First World:	The starting planet is boring as all hell. The first time while I was playing the game felt like I was about to fall asleep while playing it. I don’t think I can explain it anymore than I have. It’s boring, plain and simple. Verdict:	The game is amazing and it coulnd't be any more so. And it does have a few bumps here and there, but other then that, I couldn't recomend this game any more than I am.			"

												With the restored content mod, this is probably my favorite Star Wars game. Graphics, gameplay, sound etc. are all pretty out-dated, but the characters are excellent, story is engaging, and the RPG - mechanics solid. Kotor I and II both capture, IMO, the feel of the old movies, with great relatable characters and humor and so on, but still manage to do their own thing with the story. Plus, there's the dark side playthrough, which isn't completely independent, but still manages to feel different, like Mass Effect. Saying more would spoil much, I'll just say the player kills a lot more people as DS. The player also gets a different party member for light and dark, as well as another one for male and female main. There's a fair bit of replayability, especially if you love Star Wars. Also, there's a DA: Origins type influence system for party members, with serious rewards if played right. It's pretty epic, I played it through maybe a dozen time when it came out, so my laudatory review might be tinged with nostalgia. Still, seeing an old favorite on steam, with a patch released some ten years after the original game came out, with workshop support of all things - as well as the fact, that the game is stable technically, and plays fine on Win 10, make it an excellent look into what a classic game of the sixth generation was like. Something of a testing ground for Dragon Age and Mass Effect, which stormed the industry, while Kotor turned into an MMO. Kind of sad, really. No voice-acting for the player character, dated graphics, and wonky controls aside, it's a great buy. Also, the bit in the beginning on the mining station goes on for some three hours, but after that, the story starts to open up. Warmly recommended for story, characters and writing.			"

												Forget what people have said, with the Restored Content Mod, this is not a broken game.Even ignoring that excellent mod(which you shouldn't), this game manages to having the best writing in all of the Star Wars fiction. The characters, their motives and personalities, along with an excellent plot make this the most enjoyable part of the Star Wars universe.All the other games, comics, shows, movies, etc. all assume that The Force is unquestionably the way to live your life. KOTOR2 dares to challenge this idea, and ask if The Force should even continue to exist at all. The characters all represent the lengths to how far we are willing to go to get what we want, good or bad. They also show how people cope with tragic events.If you even remotely like Star Wars, you should play this game.			"

												Moody and philosophical, brilliantly written and filled with multi-layered characters, immersive and emotionally involving, Knights of the Old Republic 2 is a fantastic game and one of the best stories in the Star Wars universe. It has its share of flaws - the gameplay is rather dull, level design repetitive, graphics outdated even at the time of release. It was also originally released in an incomplete form, but this has since been fixed by a group of dedicated fan who created the The Sith Lords Restored Content Modification. Despite all the flaws, the game succeeds in what matters - sending the player on a memorable journey and leaving such an impact that all these years after its release I still can't get enough of it. Hopefully, one day it will get a sequel it deserves.			"

												Have you ever wanted to play Planescape Torment in Star Wars universe? This is it. Enjoy.Best storyBest characters Best philosophical crisis I ever hadLet me put it this way: gravitational pull of this game is so strong, that I fear that I will never be able to break it. Like the best works of art, this game gives you with one hand, and takes away with the outher: it creates a beautiful philosophical dilemma, a paradox if you will, but the price is steep. The price? A small thing: just a part of your soul and your mind to inhabit forever. It damages you, but in a good way: it forces you to reevaluate your your views, to broaden your horizons, to let in larger world. It shows you... the Force.I am certain in one thing: this 60 hours of metaphysical experience I will carry with me for the rest of my existence.What can change the nature of a jedi?			"

												KOTOR 2 uses the d20 system in the Star Wars universe. If you're a d&d nerd and a Star Wars nerd, that should be all you need to hear. If you need any more convincing, then the dialogue was done by Obsidian; if you don't find the phrase ""Welcome to Mar Shaddaa, watch your step or you'll fall for hours"" to be hilarious, then you're looking at the wrong game. The characters range from charming to annoying, and the dialogue is pretty entertaining,  especially when HK is involved. The game does have its share of bugs since it was rushed for a holiday release oh so long ago, but the Restored Content Mod brings back a fair share of stuff and fixes some scripting bugs. Other than the engine being kinda old and clunky, I have no complaints about this game, and only the highest praise. For those interested in gameplay time: oneone playthrough will take about 35-50 hours (probably closer to 35), and it'll take you two or three plays to get the full experience (light side and dark side, plus gray if you want to).

												After having this sit in my inventory for months and being bugged to play it by my friends, I finally gave it a shot. I am not a fan of this type of combat system, where i'm just clicking hotkeys but I still found myself immensely enjoying the game, as well as (eventually) the combat once I figured it out halfway through the game. I played the game really lazily at first, just automatically levelling all my characters up. I actually played for ten hours as a light side Jedi before I got angry at Kreia and started over as the dark side. The first thing i noticed in playing it, is how similar the first Mass Effect is to it. I love Mass Effect so I appreciated playing its ancestor and there are a lot of similarities to appreciate. I loved the whole inventory system and how much loot you could find. The locations felt similar to mass effect and even the sound of passing space craft on the citadal station over telos sounds like they used the same sound in mass effect. Like I said, I played this game very lazily...i eventually figured out the levelling system and how everything worked after I decided to pay attention half way through. I spent most of the game trying to figure out ways to make Kreia angry, so I was rude to her every chance I could get. I had also started over after running into the jedi on Telos who irritated me so much with their haughty ways I decided to go full dark side. No regrets, even after selling a kid into slavery and convincing a guy to committ suicide within a few minutes of each other. There are obvious flaws to the game which everyone recognizes and I soon came to discover...its buggy, it seems unfinished, the ending (at least for the darkside) felt lacking. It is still a great game, however, primarily because of the story. I don't really need to go into much detail here...its an old game, everyone knows how great this story is. And by the end, I was laughing at myself for basically role-playing my dark jedi IRL by having all my actions decided by my irritation with Kreia and the Jedi. In short, if you haven't played this game yet, from one first-timer to another, seriously, play this game. Now I just have to play the first one.			"

												Took me about 57 hours to complete the light side run... My enjoyment is the story line, however, how many times can you run the story line before it's time to move on?Win 7 doesn't seem to like the game too well. As known, it does like to ""freeze"" the character in place after battles, and on occation also jumps conversations and cut scenes... Minor fixes was to include all processors in the system manager, and set it's priority to high, Then make it compatable with Win 98/XP.For the dark side run, will be attempting to drop some dlls for DirectX 9.0c with it, as that seems to smooth out other older games as well. The reason for this, is the game was indeed not meant to run on DX 11, so a few modifications will be needed, and I believe this to be one of them...Again, a free roaming version of the game, that doesn't really end would be an awsome addition to the collection, for the modern systems. I have a game I keep going back to, cause I can mod it, and even if you finnish the game, you can go back to all the places you had been for more if you so desire.			"

A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....Whenever people discuss KotOR II, the word “deconstruction” is used a lot, referring to Chris Avellone's interpretation and criticism of SW as a whole, The Force, how the Jedi are perceived by civilians, Dark Side/Light Side, the infamous “Are you an angel?” easter egg, etc. but the deconstruction doesn't stop there.KotOR II is a critique of the entire RPG genre, in the way it deals with common occurrences and cliches seen in most RPG's. How can you stop your very important main quest, even momentarily, to fetch some irrelevant piece of junk to a random nobody? Why do your party members follow your lead and attack whoever you attack? Why is it okay to loot corpses? Do you have to be good to everyone in a “good” run, and conversely, do you have to butcher little rabbits in an “evil” run? (Not that Light Side/Dark Side is the equivalent of good/evil in other games, just follow me here.) The game was already great at release, just rushed, and now with Aspyr's update and TSLRCM it's even better. Just keep in mind that despite all the official and unofficial fixes it's not perfect and you may still run into technical problems.			"

												Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2 is a tough nut to crack in terms of a good review.The game was released too early and so there are still broken missions, to this day. It was also meant to be a build up for a third installment, which never came due to EA's Star Wars: The Old Republic which (and by trying to spoil as little as possible) leaves you with an incredibly bitter after taste when the credits roll after Knights of the Old Republic 2.And yet, I replay it at least once a year and have done so since its release. Even though this sequal to the classic is a lot lazier in terms of character substance and campaign.So, what is it that takes us back to this unfinished sequal of, what I think is, one of the best RPG's ever made?Star Wars: Knights of the Republic 2 goes dark. There is no better way of saying it. While its predecessor let you choose the Dark Side for the sake of sadistic fun, Kotor 2 shows you what the force really is, and how little it means in the end to be a Jedi or a Sith.I recall a particular moment, very simular to many from the first game, where a beggar comes up to you and ask for money. Choosing the Light Side option as I normally do, my Jedi gave the beggar a few credits and sent him on his merry way. I was given a few Light Side points for my kindness.Then, a wild Treya appears.Treya is an enigma, and the very first character you meet in the game. She will keep a close eye on you, be you Light side or Dark and right there, she shows you a vision of the man, and how he walks off to get himself a meal. She tells you that every action has its consiquence, followed by your vision of the man being robbed, and murdered. You gave him the money. You made him a target.And this is the excellence of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2. It goes further than option one and option two. This game will test you, not only as a player, but as a person. It has its bugs, to the points that it actually needs a MOD to even be playable on some machines, but if you get it running, and if you have the time to put into it, I strongly recomend this game.To me, this is not only one of the very best RPG's, but one of the very finest storylines ever written.May the force be with you.

												A true classic x2+ Pretty much the same combat system the previous game used.+ A good story.+ Decisions that effect the outcome of the game. Lots of replayablity.+ Things can get dark!+ Good characters, good voice acting.+ Some characters make a return.+ Dual sword wielding Wookies are OP.+ Not a very hard game, I think anyone could enjoy it.+ Decent graphics compared to the previous game.+ Stable, no real play-ability issues.+ Improved interface vs previous game.All these are pretty minor annoyances:- Can be troublesome to change your battle options.- Combat can be a little wonky when you want to coordinate multiple characters during fights.TLDR;Did you like the previous game? Well this one is actually better in every way. Strap on your favorite kicks because you have a universe to save or destroy.			"

												By and far the best Star Wars RPG I've ever played. Amazing, immersive story and hundreds of different ways to play the game. You'll definitely keep coming back for more. And as soon as you start getting bored, throw some mods in there.			"

												Loved this game. The sheer amount of content in this game has made me play it several times through, and I've enjoyed it every time. WARNING: IF YOU BUY THIS GAME, YOU MAY NEVER SEE THE LIGHT OF DAYI rate 10/10, because this game was such a good experience for me that many other single player RPG's make me cringe.			"

												This game... This game = SO MUCH WIN. The review might be slightly drawn out and rambly but do try to read it through. Else, putting the TL: DR version here, Buy this game, right now. On any platform you prefer, STEAM, GoG, physical.Follow up to a critically acclaimed RPG by BIOWARE from over a decade back, the original release was severely cut down from the original vision that OBSIDIAN had in mind. Nevertheless the game was strong in its own right and deservedly so. It picked up and iterated on almost every point that BIOWARE had explored in the original, the most obvious being, 1) DIALOGUE: The game improves on this point the most, sure BIOWARE had put in decent dialogue and writing in the original KoTOR but OBSIDIAN's work is a class apart. There are more dialogue options informed by a range of variables apart from the Speech skill of your character. Your standing and influence with factions / characters can get them to divulge information without having to have a superior Speech / Persuade / Force Persuade roll. 2) CHARACTERS: Having been treated to a basic Light Side, Dark Side struggle in the original KoTOR (with a single exception), the player is treated to a more nuanced fare of characters in the follow up game. Sure there are still the tropes but the depth of character play has certainly been explored better in KoTOR II. Your influence over party characters can not only open more character interaction options but confers certain benefits on them when they align with your world view.3) COMBAT: Something as simple as adding another set of weapon slots to make it easier to switch between melee and ranged support roles.  A great game, released a decade ago and still a damn fine game especially with the Restoration MOD guys adding a lot of cut content back inside the title, you can find the content here, 


(English) The Sith Lords Restored Content Modification (TSLRCM) 
A Workshop Item for STAR WARS™ Knights of the Old Republic™ II: The Sith Lords™
By: Hassat Hunter

			This mod's intention is to restore much of the content cut from The Sith Lords, that was lost to the main game due to a rush to release the game.		


. Would highly recommend every RPG player to check out the title if just to see where the standards of role-playing were once and how far they have fallen, also, the dedication of a community to raise a flawed star to its fullest potential.			"

												Because this game obviously needs more praise, I'll throw my two cents on it. Honestly, after having played many modern games these days, KOTOR2 was a great game to come back to. A lot of contemporary RPG games, even those by Bioware, have various issues these days, so I'm going throw out a bunch of points as to what made this game amazing, and even more so now that everyone can easily install and use the Restored Content mod. Because I tend to be wordy, I'll have a TLDR list below.The DnD System: The DnD system implemented in the KOTOR games really does it a great service. Unlike real DND, you don't have to wait 10-15 minutes to hopefully hit something, it all happens quickly. You can even view the detailed rolls for previous combats in great detail, whether they be about enemy or friend. (So you happen to know if it's even possible for you to land a debuff on an enemy.) The movement controls could certainly be tightened up to feel more responsive, as there's a short delay when telling a character to attack, but the slower real time system is far more enjoyable for me than the super fast paced action RPGs that seem more common today. Because it runs at a slower pace, it's far easier to take in the battles, even when a lot is happening at once. There's far less flash and particle effects during the battles than most Action RPGs these days, but I think the game is better for it.Customization Daydream: So much in this game can be tinkered to your liking. You want your wise Jedi Mentor to suddenly just be a sharpshooter? You can level her like that. Probably won't be as powerful, but can certainly be done. There's a wealth of items to make your character fit your style, weapons and armor that can be customized, plenty of feats and force powers. They also added the Seven Lightsaber forms (and Force forms) so you can further adapt to a situation or confine yourself to a certain style. Sad thing is the only real lack of customization is in the character appearance itself, but it also wasn't an industry standard back then.Gray(t) Story: Excusing the awful pun, the story is excellent. It might be difficult to grasp the first time around, depending on your experience with the Expanded Universe or other Star Wars games, but there's a lot going on. Where many Star Wars games tend to play things pretty black and white, especially when it comes to Light Side and Dark Side, this game examines the major elements of Star Wars lore differently. Characters don't always scold you for an action they disagree with if you can back it up with solid reasoning. The choices in this game are wonderful and can lead you to some pretty interesting alternate solutions to getting through a part of the story. This is also one of the non-linear RPGs that I feel doesn't suffer from pacing issues. Games like Dragon Age 3 for example, let me go where I want as well, but I can sometimes just hit a point where what I'm doing doesn't feel as important, so I lose focus and interest. KOTOR2 however does good at keeping major objectives there at all times, large and small ones.Pros-Fantastic Customization of characters and gear.-Wonderful writing featuring compelling characters and tight pacing.-Active-Time-Battle-like gameplay that is enhanced by the wonderful animations. Uses a DnD dice system for most things in the game.-High Replayability since many different builds and conversation choices can lead to some vastly different experiences.-Not your traditional save the galaxy story.Cons-Clunky movement of character and camera. Will take some time to adjust if you're used to modern games.-The music isn't very memetic. The dynamic music the games tries to utilize doesn't flow very well in places.-Can be very difficult in places if you aren't properly prepared.-You'll begin to really loathe the first level if you replay the game a lot and don't mod it out.-Not your traditional save the galaxy story. (Not for you if you're looking to be the undisputed good guy who does no wrong.)So that's KOTOR 2 to me. I would recommend this game certainly and highly recommend it with the Restored Content Mod. It might not be as fast and flashy, your character may not be voice acted, and it might be a little confusing at times. But if you're a fan of Star Wars, Bioware games, or are just looking for a story that isn't so traditional, KOTOR 2 will keep bringing you back to that galaxy far far away.			"

												I didn't play this or KOTOR 1 on release. Instead I played this for the first time in 2016-2017 on a recommendation from a friend. I used the restored content mod as well. I just finished this game and loved every moment of it. It instantly jumps along-side some of my other favorites as the best games I have ever experienced.I remember playing Baldur's Gate 2 and being invested in my party members, and caring about who stood with me. It was the first time in nearly 20 years that I felt the same feeling. I genuinely felt bad when I disappointed Kreia, and made future decisions based on what I thought she would approve of. There's so much mystery and unknown intertwined into the story. If you're a Star Wars fan, or just an RPG fan, play this game. It is a unique experience unlike any other. This is not a traditional ""hero saves the world"" RPG. It is a game of exploration, discovery, morality, and philosophy. Must play experience.			"

												Just like the first one, this is a classic and a must play. The Sith Lords is much darker and ambiguous than the first, and it makes you think a lot more about your actions and motives and the consequences of said actions. It is harder to tell what is right and wrong--your choices aren't cut and dry, light or dark--and with many choices, you will have party members chipping in on what you should have done. Also, your choices really matter as they can even affect what your party members think about you. It is just as immersive and interesting as the first, and the characters are even better and more complex, each with their own interesting backstory, personality, and views, and you don't always know what they will do next. There are also some cool appearances from characters from the previous game and references to it. Granted, it's an old game so the graphics are quite outdated and I don't love the combat system, but I personally think that the other components of the game far outweigh these negatives. Also, Nexus Mods has some pretty cool mods for it. Overall, this is a masterpiece and easily one of the greatest games to grace the world with its presence.			"

												I love this game. I wasn't that interested in RPG's before playing the first game, but that game cured that. This one got me interested in making mods and after just playing that kept me entertained for a very long time.Pro's- Star Wars, lightsabers etc.- Great story telling & story-related choices- High replay value because of character choices & mods- Great updates by Aspyr for this Steam version to make things run better with today's computers- For modders: lots of modding tools, modding tutorials, mod sites etc. were made over the yearsCon's- Rushed content, especially at the end of the game- What you can do with Steam mods is limited, it could really use some kind of mod manager to combine mods			"

												Here it is, my all time favorite video game. I rented this in a Blockbuster when I was a kid, along with the first KoTOR. It blew my young mind. Action, choice & consequence, philosophy, memorable characters. It was crazy for a youngin who's only played Halo with his older brothers. And it was freakin' Star Wars to boot. I fell in love with everything, from Swoop Racing to lightsaber dueling, Pazaak, and good ol' HK-47. Not to mention the MASSIVE crush I had on the Handmaiden, oh boy.I've easily played over 2,000 hours, I can't count the amount of playthroughs I've done. This game will hook you in, make you think before you choose, and crush your spirits and raise your hopes as you travel the path of the light or dark side of the Force.I easily recommend this game to everyone, whether you're a massive Star Wars fan such as myself, or simply seeking a fun RPG with great combat, real fun mini games, and fantastic worlds and characters. It's on sale! So hurry, buy this. Buy KoTOR I. Buy the Jedi Knight series. Buy Battlefront II. Just buy every damn Star Wars game you can afford.			"

												tWell first thing first i wil set this review up as i did with the first kotor game and they will be a little similar. before we start , compared to kotor 1 i played or tried to play wholly as the light side. If i did get some dark point a re-loaded an earlier savefile of the game , witch i wont do on my second go. Pro- Great gameplay. With some minor improvement like easy change of melee and ranged even tough i mainly used melee on my MC , also the add off different forces/styles. - Great soundtrack music- Darker in setting or tone the kotor 1. Witch also makes for a darker plot. ( But i probably prefer the original due to a little better pacing ,but is entirely objective/subjective or whatever the say- Overall better and more interesting characters imo and villain . - Again a great rpg with a lot of choices you can make , however the ending you get seems to be dependant on your choice in the end fo the game.-You can play it at you own pace, it starts out linear, but eventually you get 4 planets you can choose to explore and take on in what order you want ,also able to go back an forth.- Just hard enough , even tough the bosses is pretty hard.- Replay value.Cons: However there is some cons here compared to the original, i had problem with the mouse freezing right after cutescens so be sure to save regularly. But it seems too vary very much on people and there probably some fixes for it out there. Also looting from container and especially on npc sometimes i had to loot from a specific angel.- one of the places you visits feel to drag on a little and so does the last location your at.Also i recommend you to use the restoration content mod Great game a little bit worse then the original due to it cons how ever if it was for cons it would be very tight. It would basically be plot vs characters an tone/setting of the game ,a darker star wars or not as dark.			"

-Quick Review-Knights of the Old Republic II (KOTOR2) – The Sith Lords, was developed by Obsidian Entertainment and released early 2005. KOTOR2 is a Star Wars RPG played from a third-person view, and a sequel to the original KOTOR game which was developed by Bioware and released in 2003.There was an update on July 21, 2015 which dramatically improved the quality of the game, adding in steam achievements, steam cloud saves, native wide screen support, controller support, and best of all the Steam Workshop.

-Detailed breakdown review-Story: The events taking place in KOTOR2 take place five years after KOTOR1, the Sith are winning the war with the Republic. You play as “The Exile”, a former Jedi Knight who has lost his/her ability to use the Force.Throughout the story you are given chances to earn “light side” or “dark side” points based on the ethical decisions you make, you also grow closer to your various companions based on choices you are sometimes presented with.All of this gives the game an extremely replayable atmosphere; because you can go back and choose different dialogue, experience a completely different story, and most importantly deal with the consequences for your choices.

Gameplay: Combat wise, the game is identical to the first KOTOR, you have the same types of weapons: lightsaber, Melee, Blaster weapons, Ion weapons, Mines, Grenades, etc.You can (and should) pause the game before and during combat to plan out your strategy of engagement, will your companions lay down range fire while you rush to the front lines lightsaber blazing? Or is this a boss and you need to throw all your grenades? First use force lightning, flurry, auto attack, force drain, then power attack? There are countless strategies for combat within the game.

There are Mini games; Pazaak (Card game) and Swoop bike racing (Racing game). Learning the tricks of these mini games are very rewarding in the game, but a guide would be the appropriate place to learn about these mini games.Achievements: Once upon a time there were no achievements for KOTOR2... ...until the magical day of July 21, 2015! This is one the games I always wanted achievements to be available on, most achievements will be earned with playing through the game twice; Once choosing the Dark Side path, once choosing the Light Side path.There are also several achievements for skill based side objectives, however it's safe to say that all of these achievements are very well achievable. You do need to be willing to go through the story several times to earn them all.Price: KOTOR2 is priced at $9.99, my first play through was 47 hours. The quality of this game is excellent. Personally, I am guilty of being biased for star wars RPG's and playing the heck out of them, but even for a normal person you can easily squeeze out 20+ hours. (RPG's as a genre are designed to be lengthy and time consuming!)Conclusion: To quickly recap, Story: Excellent, the story changes based on decisions you make throughout the game. Gameplay: identical combat rolling system to KOTOR1. Achievements: straight forward, you will need to beat the game twice and maybe three times (depends on if you missed any skill/trait based achievements). Price: Extremely fair, if you want an even better price just wait for a steam sale.I adore the Star Wars universe, and this is my favorite RPG series within that franchise. With the advent of J.J. Abrams, Star Wars Episode 7: The Force Awakens (Because putting “Disney” before “star wars” is still too weird for me), the franchise will regain momentum.Thanks for reading my review!

												There's something special about this game.In spite of the dialogue skipping, the AI glitches, the funky influence system, and the odd glitched quest, this is the most fun I've ever had with a game.It's got a great plot, sure, and it expands on the Star Wars universe and its predecessor in some really interesting ways, but at the end of it all that's not really what stuck with me. What hit me were the characters, and how I grew to care for them. I learned ""pazaak"" from Atton, sparred with the Handmaiden, shared the pain of a past war with a past ally, sat at the feet of of Kreia and absorbed her teachings, and in turn taught Visas the ways of the Force as Kreia had with me. All of these characters had interesting and involved backstories, but what I liked the most about them was that they were just as defined by their moments with you as they were by the exposition that you could eventually get out of them. Another intriguing thing about the characters is that they all seem to have their own inner darkness, and the way you influence them is either by fostering that darkness or helping to redeem them of it. You can free one companion from their inner rage, or teach them to draw strength from it. Draw a naive student to the light side or shackle them to the darkness. And they're all HIDING something. Why is it that your wise teacher can't seem to read the thoughts of the scoundrel you picked up on a mining station? Why was your wise teacher seeking you out in the first place, and why does she seem to know so much about the Sith? What's hidden away in the memory banks of that backtalking T3 unit? What exactly /happened/ on Malachor V?Sure, the game's got its issues. The combat might get too easy for those who figure out its tricks too early in the game. Some of the time it seems like the game was cut into pieces before its release - which it kind of was, unfortunately. Graphics might seem outdated. I mean, yeah, I'll admit, they ARE outdated, though they aren't unbearable. Basically what I'm saying is that, once you peel back all the issues on the surface, you've got something truly special. I don't know how to explain it - it's like this /feeling/ you get, when you're playing the game into the wee hours of the morning, and you have to get up early tomorrow but your thoughts are drowned out by the dim glow of your computer screen and the soft chuckle you let out at ""Just because I saved her doesn't mean I want to charge up her loading ramp!""I don't actually know how to end this review. Peace.""Between assassin droids, a Sith Lord who looks like he sleeps with vibroblades, and being target practice for a Republic ship, I was better off in my cell!"" - barack obama 10/10			"

Deep, Compelling, Immersive, Philosophical, Controversial, Unfinished: Past Its Flaws, The Sith Lords is a Great GameDate of Review: January 16, 2016Note: This game was played with The Sith Lords Restored Content Modification available from the Steam workshop and no other modifications.Developing The Sith Lords, the 2004 sequel to Bioware's excellent Knights of the Old Republic, was undoubtedly an ambitious task for Obsidian Entertainment. Not only was it their first full undertaking, but also the sequel to an extremely memorable and enjoyable game in one of the most famous settings ever created. Sadly, the final product was a rushed production with a notorious amount of cut content, having had only 13 months of development before going gold thanks to LucasArts' infamous decision to hurry the game to market for the 2004 holiday season.I had never played The Sith Lords up until recently. I played Knights multiple times in the past, loving its story and gameplay, but never its sequel. And now having played it, I feel that there are tragic signs that the game never realizes its full potential, even with the restored cut content, but I also feel that it surpasses its predecessor in several ways. MechanicsThe Sith Lords employs the Odyssey engine and d20 system from first game, effectively translating Dungeons & Dragons concepts to the setting of blasters and lightsabers. Combat is real time with pause and although there are a few oddities and annoyances, I always felt that the combat worked mostly well. The game's item crafting and upgrade system is decent, and thankfully so, as almost all the items you will find are randomly generated, including merchant stocks, and you will need to upgrade your gear to remain competitive.Special note needs to be given to the influence system. Depending on your actions, you can gain influence with your companions and thereby earn their respect, change their alignments, learn more about them, and even train some of them in the Force. The system has significant flaws, as it tends to encourage gamey tactics in order to maximize your influence points. It is also undermined by the fact that you cannot have more than two companions with you at a time, making it nearly impossible to influence everyone in any singular playthrough and restricting access to some parts of the story. However, watching your companions follow you to the Light Side or to the Dark Side is very cool.What is a Jedi without his lightsaber? Without his powers? Without the Force? The background story of the The Sith Lords is far more ominous than its predecessor. Darth Revan has left the known galaxy for mysterious reasons. Civil war has crippled the Republic. And the Jedi, relentlessly hunted by a new wave of Sith assassins, are nearing extinction. Yet, your character, despite being a Jedi, has been divorced from these events right up until the game's beginning.You are an exile from the Jedi Order, who condemned your actions in the Mandalorian Wars and ordered you to give up your lightsaber. Furthermore, you somehow lost your connection to the Force. However, it begins to return.Thus you embark on not just a physical journey, but a spiritual and philosophical journey. Delightfully, you are given the opportunity to opine on the nature of the Force and are encouraged to decide for yourself whose teachings are right, whose are wrong, and if the Force has a destiny for everyone or if your fate is one of our own choosing. In many ways, this game is a successor to Planescape: Torment and it all but explicitly asks ""What can change the nature of a man?""It is not your typical Star Wars story. And here, that is fantastic.The game has excellent dialogue and many times gives you a plethora of dialogue options. Overall strong voice acting and writing permeates this title and nearly every character has depth far surpassing their counterparts from the first game. Admittedly, the writing does have its share of inconsistencies and the story has its issues, including a series of somewhat unsatisfying retcons regarding Darth Revan's motivations and the ""True Sith,"" which cheapens the value of The Sith Lords as a continuation of Knights.  But when the story and writing are at their best, it is wonderful and makes up for nearly every weakness this game has.Do you consider yourself a Jedi? A Sith? Or something else entirely?I was very charmed by the fact that you can play a character that adheres strongly to the Light Side, the Dark Side, or one that rejects both the Jedi and Sith orthodoxies and still arguably be justified in your choice. It is so much more interesting to have genuine motivations for your actions rather than a superficial veneer of rationalizations and this game succeeds at providing such motivations. The character I played prior to this review generally showed charity, courtesy, and hospitality to those around me, but I also decided to exterminate the remaining Jedi masters and constantly criticize the Jedi Order for its many hypocrisies. It was deliciously heretical.Although I love that this game readily permits, and sometimes encourages, toeing the line between Light and Dark, I was a bit disappointed at how it can lock you out of some content. While I could forsake the alignment specific prestige classes, I was far more annoyed that there was a level on Korriban that required a strong alignment commitment, thus prohibiting my only mildly Dark Side-aligned character's entry, and that the ending of the game is merely dependent on how devoted you are to the Light Side or Dark Side rather than on any given choice. I'll also note that I was stopped short of completely and utterly denouncing the usual conception of the Force as having specific Light and Dark natures rather than emphasizing the value of an individual's choices and actions, perhaps because there was still an expectation you would ultimately pick a side. Nevertheless, I enjoyed this run and the game is very replayable. Beset by Unfinished Content, Blemished by a Weak Ending and BugsAlthough almost any game will have its weakness, this game's are pretty prominent. One of the most noticeable was some wildly varying level design quality alongside a relative lack of content in some areas. For instance, Onderon had many sidequests, many locations, and an interesting plotline with many remarkable characters. But Nar Shaddaa and especially Malachor V have some lifeless and rather poorly designed environments. And Korriban was almost pathetically short. The ending of the game's story can also be disappointing, as it refocuses on the aforementioned retcons and takes away choice from you regarding what your character does next. While it was supposed provide a sequel hook, it feels cheap. In a way, it feels like some parts of this game were never fully finished.I also encountered some bugs, including graphical glitches on some of the player character models and some pathfinding oddities. There was also a bug where dialogue would start constantly skipping if I didn't close and reopen the program around every two hours. Massive praise must be given to the people behind the Restored Content Modification for crushing so many other bugs, but the presence of the ones I found still speaks of an abridged quality control effort due to the rush to get to market back in 2004.Summa SummarumFor all its problems and unrealized potential, I really liked this game. I liked it for its story, its characters, its willingness to confront some of the normally sacred concepts of the Star Wars setting, and most of all, its fantastic writing. So long as one enjoys RPGs, is cognizant of this game's flaws, and can appreciate its complexity and subtleties, I strongly recommend this game.			"

However, there are a few bugs, like a door supposed to teleport you to a different section on a planet putting you out-of-bounds in the same area, so that unfortunately drops the score a little.Type of game: Turn-based action game (think Dungeons & Dragons)SCORE: 9Replay value: HighController-to-movement latency(lag): lowEase of use: Medium			"

												This is one of my favorite games. I love how it deconstructs everything about Star Wars including the Jedi, The Sith and even the Force itself. It suggests that all of these ideas, not so much the Sith as it's already been well established that the Sith are a problematic idealogy, lead to conflict and disarray. The tone of the game is magnificent as it's haunting and dreary, which is a complete contrast to the Star Wars stories (movies and even the first KOTOR) that we've come to know and love. In the end I'd reccommend this game to anyone who loves Star Wars and is looking for a fresh and unique take on it, or anyone who loves good characters and storytelling.			"

												This is where Star Wars gets really interesting. Sure, the first Knights of the Old Republic was a blast, but this is where everything starts to mean something. What do YOU think about the galaxy? What do YOU think about the Jedi, Sith and the force? Do you care what your companions think of your opinions? Companion influence really added another gameplay element. The mix of light and dark points with influence points makes it harder to pick dialogue options without thinking, and sometimes the moral principles of your character have to be sacrificed to gain influence with another. It's far more engaging than the last game and definitely worth playing after installing the restored content mod. Easily one of the best stories in Star Wars for me.			"

												A hugely rewarding, deeply engrossing experience almost ten years on from release. This is my second time all the way through (first time on the xbox) back in 2004/2005. The best thing about KOTOR 2 is the writing, and the characters. It is deeper, and definitely darker (but perhaps with more profound moments of light and redemption due to contrast), than the first KOTOR. As expected the game looks a little out of date, but the sound, voice acting, and as mentioned, excellent story carry things along very nicely. The presentation is really quite cinematic, with nice pacing, good use of dramatic pause, and a poignancy that is rare in computer games.It is an excellent RPG to play driven by your own moral compass etc, intentionally selecting and ignoring the threads to form your character, and party relationships. This is a MASSIVE part of the game, and in many ways is far more interesting than the grinding and combat etc (which is fine, and quite entertaining). Some of the outcomes of choices are a little tired/naff/obvious. For example there are so many problems ultimately solved with violence etc, but hey it's star wars and a computer game... what can I really expect! On the whole the dialogue and outcomes are very enjoyable, especially as you come to understand the personas and motivations of the party members, and learn to pick the threads that yield the best reactions.I highly recommend installing the missing content patch, which is now very clean and tidy, and adds considerably to the experience and sense of completeness. That said it would be nice to see a clearer round up of what you acheived from your choices/acheivements in the wider universe (minor niggle).An indellible experience, and I would love some more.

												Do I recommend the Sith Lords? Of course I recommend the Sith Lords! Why wouldn't I? It's one of the best Star Wars games ever made. It has fantastic characters, great dialogue, and an excellent story. Also it................it broke my heart.STAR WARS(R): Knights of the Old Republic(tm) II has bugs coming out of every exhaust port. I've had important conversations ruined by glitches, a blank screen during climatic battles, the Exile getting stuck for several seconds at a time unless I enable vsync(??). Worst of all, after 29+ hours, when I was at the doorstep of the finale, all of my saves stopped working. All I wanted to do was take a break to eat lunch. LUNCH! What's wrong with lunch? Does lunch lead to the dark side?! Hunger leads to crashing, crashing leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to...oh my gosh. It's true!I'm not saying it could happen to you, but it happened to me. I spent nearly 30 hours on this game, and I couldn't even finish it. What a piece of garbage.---KILL ALL THE STORM BEASTS----------------SPOILERS AHEAD------------------Now that we've gotten the nasty business out of the way, let's discuss the actual game.PLOT: You are the Exile, a fallen Jedi seeking answers. Along the way you are mentored by the mysterious Kreia. Eventually you recruit the motliest of crews, attempt to restore the jedi order; while killing hundreds of alien creatures, space bandits, and Sith assassins.Let's look at the basic structure of the game. KOTOR2 is an RPG, which tends to involve exploration, stats, equipment, and an emphasis on story. The most important aspect is that you're playing an active role. As the Exile, you make numerous decisions, which can affect the storyline in various ways. Going further, the decisions you make influence your party-members. Do something they agree with, your influence over them grows, and eventually they'll answer your questions about their past. This is a relatively low-key game. At times it almost feels like detective work, and not the usual lightsabers & blasters extravaganza (though there is plenty of that). Also, as with the previous entry, the decisions you make determine whether you think like a Jedi, or a Sith. What I like about this system is that it keeps you thinking. There's no silly ""let homeless people eat"" or ""kill homeless people"" decisions in this game. A jedi might carry a lightsaber, but not every situation requires one. Being selfless and using diplomacy can save lives. Even a few lies won't hurt your relationship to the light side. But don't let that stop you from threatening someone to give you a few extra credits, or force-persuading them to jump off a bridge. Giving in to the dark-side tends to be more rewarding, easier, and more entertaining. Getting light-side points requires sacrifice, which isn't something we're used to. I mean c'mon, RPGs tend to involve heroes raiding houses and stealing every last dime. How often are players going to say ""No thank you. I don't need your reward money. I'm a good guy.""? Playing an actual truly honorable person is difficult, and it involves saying things that will make players (and Kreia) really annoyed. Kreia is one of the best-written characters in a videogame. First off, she presents a third dimension to the common tale of good vs evil (or light vs dark in the case of Star Wars). She implores the Exile (and the player) to look beyond the basics of the jedi code, and seek a greater purpose. I suppose her ideals are biased, but that adds depth to her character. As you attempt to influence your party members, she indulges in her own machinations. Secondly, her nature helps keep the rest of the cast on edge. While your party members can trust you, they tend to ignore or even outright hate each other. Kreia's role as a mentor is far from what we'd expect, as she shows little respect for her allies, and will control them to achieve her ends. Also, her betrayal is exceptionally well-written. She turns on you, but it's not ""Haha! I'm a bad guy now!"" This is something that has been hinted at numerous times, and Kreia even all but spells it out to the Exile at one point.The rest of the cast, as I mentioned earlier, is fantastic. At first glance, everyone looks like a bunch of cliches. Atton Rand is the wise-cracking rogue, Bao-dur is the mechanic, HK-47 loves killing, and Han Harr is a wookie. However, everyone has lot of depth to them. This isn't to the point where it becomes overbearing. In the end, this is still the Exile's quest, but the extra care and attention given to the party-members makes them more than just ""along for the ride"". Their interjections fit their personalities, and give you something to think about when you're running from one adventure to the next. KOTOR2 gives you a lot of ideas to dwell on. This is important because the battle-system doesn't require much (if any) thought. You can put together your own party and outfit them however you want, but your strategy will rarely deviate from ""use this force power to put everyone out of commision"". The most difficult parts of the game tend to involve certain boss battles. The twi'lek twins can be a headache, unless you had the foresight to mine the cantina in Nar Shadarr before a certain event. You might also have trouble fighting Darth Sion in a rogue vs sith battle. Before long you realize that Sion is as dumb as he is ugly, and will gladly stand around while you plant a dozen mines for him to be lured into. An optimal player might've just made Atton a Jedi so they could awesome their way through these fights, but I messed up there. While this game focuses on its story and writing, there is a part of me that's disappointed in the lack of any real end-game or post-game content. We can ""thank"" Lucasarts for shipping KOTOR2 in such a poor state, and thank TSLRCM-group for restoring a lot of the cut content, but there's still a lack of...well...return on investments. I look at it like this, when I use a particular party-member, buy equipment for them, and raise their stats, I'm investing in them. I expect that eventually this investment will pay off. Usually the pay-off is in the form of help beating the game, defeating some super boss (like the weapons in Final Fantasy 7, the dragons in Baldur's Gate II, etc) or exploring some grand optional dungeon. When a party-member is killed off (via the story) all I'm thinking is ""Why did I invest in this loser?"" Unfortunately, there's no pay-off for investing in anyone in KOTOR2. I outfit them, invest my time by building a relationship with them, and I'm awarded nothing for my efforts. You can look at it as part of the storyline, or not important to the game, but I think it's an oversight. There were probably going to be 8 legendary Krayt Dragons for players to fight. Alas.As far as necessary complaints go, I figure the level-design deserves to be knocked around. It's mostly bland and feature-less. Also it's spaced out to the point where there's a lot of running around. I skipped a few quests just because I was sick of huffing it from one end of the planet to the other. To add to this, there's a very clear sliding scale in terms of planetary content. Telos, Nar Shadarr, and Dantooine have the most, while Dxun, Onderon, and Korriban have the least. This can be attributed to -- you guessed it -- rushed development. There are other issues as well but let's just blame it all on Lucasarts. Obsidian deserves a lot of credit. Even though this piece of junk failed on me at the worst possible time (my investments!), it's still one of the better CRPGs out there. The cut content is definitely worth checking out as well. However, you may want to be prepared for the worst. Even if you can manage to launch KOTOR2, you're never really out of the woods. It just might break your heart like it did mine.			"

												I just realized I never made a Steam review of this f#cking game. God damn it. As usual I will start with the bad stuff, and I will try to keep spoilers out of the way.The first and biggest problem this game has going on it is the fact that it was never actually finished. And let me tell you, I LOVED THE FIRST ONE, and I bought the second one when it came out, years ago. I was confused as HELL with the ending, because it didn't make ANY SENSE AT ALL. However nowadays there's an actual fix for this situation: Last year the devs patched the game on Steam to add Achievements and Mod support, to thank the guys (some of the devs included) who took their sweet f#cking time to, after so many years, finish the game on a mod. You HAVE to play it with those mods, I'm serious. They add quite a ton of stuff, even if some of those new things still seem to be fairly unfinished.The second thing are the bugs. After so many years there still are bugs running rampant through the game.  Granted it's nowhere as close as with other games, however I've managed to do stupid stuff at times and I don't even know how. A few examples are somehow teleporting to the top of a pillar and getting stuck there, forcing me to load a previous save, or having a character somehow bug out and ignore a current quest, not allowing me to finish it. Sometimes this can be fixed by loading previous saves, but not all of them.My last issue with the game is the characters. Don't get me wrong, I like that they brought the playable characters from 9 to 12 or so, but not all of them seem actually interesting. G0-T0 deserves a f#cking special mention as I never actually gave 2 f#cking ♥♥♥♥♥ about him, while Kreia always looked and felt like a smartass who knew way too much.That being said though, is the game good? Oh boy, you bet you♥♥♥♥♥ To begin with, the story itself (if you have the mods to play the actual entire story, of course) is seriously good, long and deep. It takes somewhere across 25 hours to complete, and that's only counting a Lighr or Dark playthrough, so there's another 25 hours waiting for you later on. The characters, ignoring the two I said before, are REALLY INTERESTING, and you can learn their back-story and stuff about them as you play on, sharing adventures with them. The game also has a sort of system which tracks who are you being nice to and who are you being an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to, which works perfectly, and characters trully react to your actions throughout the entire game.The rather deep (and even a bit confusing at times) combat system from the original is back here at full force, with even more weapons, more armors, random items, and customization. There's also buttons to switch between two weapons, allowing ranged characters to quickly switch to melee weapons when needed. You can literally play most of the game your way, although using blasters against Jedis and Sith is f#cking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ most of the time.The whole feel of the game changes deeply from the previous game, and it's good. While in the previous Kotor everything felt happy and colorful with the current truce, now everything is f#cked beyond repair. It helps inmerse the player into the current situation, and makes you explore and learn about what changed from one game to the other.Oh, and this game has one of the best video-game characters to ever exist as a rather unlockable: HK-47. I'm not f#cking arround with you, he's totally worth the fetch-quest to unlock him.Overall, this title still stands arround other great RPG games, specially after the fans and old devs finished it together. Do I recommend it? Yes. But if you haven't played the first one, then you totally should, as the story follows in here. And obviously, you should play this one with the mods that fix it. Personally, the base price of the game is already fair enough, but you can wait for a sale if that makes you feel better. For 5€, it's a f#cking steal. You filthy meat-bag.Edit: Whoops, forgot to put the link to the Restored Content Mod. Remember though, there's an extra mod on the workshop that adds an unfinished planet to the game, I suggest getting that one too.

												I rarely play a long game from start to finish more than twice, for me to do so it'd require fun gameplay and a story I felt invested in and wanted to relive. I've played Half-Life 2 (and its episodes) three times over because of how in love I fell with the story. While figuring out how to get this game to work with TSLRCM, I started playing Knights of the Old Republic again, as the opposite sex and alignment but found myself somewhat bored after Dantooine. So far, I have played Knights of the Old Republic II - The Sith Lords two full times in rapid succession and I'm roughly a third of the way through my third playthrough. To say I love this game is an understatement.The gameplay is a step up from KOTOR 1 and though I find it very enjoyable, battles can be rather bland and a bit too easy at times. The real reason to play this game is the story. However, that itself is very divisive. The Sith Lords' story is a meticulous exploration of the very basis of the Star Wars mythos: the Force. It portrays the Jedi as flawed, the Sith as broken but ultimately human (or whatever species they are) and the very concept of morality as far more complex than any of the current Star Wars canon does (admittedly I'm rather unfamiliar with the old Expanded Universe outside of these two games). This can turn off Star Wars fans just looking for a Star Wars game like KOTOR 1 that captures what makes Star Wars great. On the other hand, the mouthpiece for all these criticisms and alternative points of view is a character called Kreia who, without delving into spoilers, is... rather questionable to say the least. Though you can't convince her to change her mind, you can declare yourself in disagreement and you can defy her as you wish, or agree with her as you wish. As a Star Wars fan, I found this deconstruction of the Force to be highly enjoyable and cast the movies in a different light for me.The other characters in the game are hardly one dimensional, the weakest ones are two dimensional at worst. It's difficult to talk about what makes these characters great without delving into spoilers so I won't, but I will especially praise Atton as an example of everything a good anti-hero should be. There are a couple that return from KOTOR 1 and their presence is very welcome. Some, such as HK-47, are enjoyable as ever and developed further while others, like T3-M4, are an improvement over their KOTOR 1 incarnations.The mechanics are integrated much better with differet aspects of the game this time around. Your attributes and skills play a role in conversations and the creation of items at workbenches, the latter being itself a huge improvement over its handling in KOTOR 1. Playing as different classes and alignments creates very different experiences outside of combat. As a male Jedi Guardian/Jedi Master I played very differently than as a female Jedi Consular/Sith Weapon Master and as a female Jedi Sentinel/Jedi Watchman, for example. Where in KOTOR 1 you can play Dark Side or Light Side but really only make meaningful decisions towards the end, you're put in a spot where you have to take decisions from the start. As a Light Side player, early in Telos do I refuse this monetary reward to earn Light Side points but risk having to sell my wares to not gain Dark Side points a bit down the line? As a Dark Side player, do I challenge the Jedi Masters early on and engage in difficult fights or save all but one of them for later when I'm more powerful but make the survivors gang up on me?In conclusion, I tend to compare Episodes IV and V to KOTOR 1 and KOTOR 2. Episode IV and KOTOR 1 are the more basic Star Wars adventure. The dichotomy between good and evil is clear and doesn't really try anything new but is more easily digestible and is incredibly fun regardless. Episode V and KOTOR 2 are the more creative one but takes risks that might not be to everyone's liking. While this really isn't a good analogy as both Episode IV and V are rather easily digestible whereas KOTOR 2 is a lot harder to swallow, especially if you just come in for a sequel to KOTOR 1 in body and soul, I think it works as a comparison because one is the safer one while the other is the more daring one. Both are great on their own merits, though I personally consider the latter to be better. With this game you should come in with an open mind. If you do, I highly recommend giving it a whirl and seeing if you can get something out of it. Just please install TSLRCM and possibly M4-78EP from the Workshop, the game is incomplete without at least the former.			"

Star Wars: KotOR II - The Sith Lords is one of my favourite games of all time - in that way, it very much lives up to my love for its predecessor. The two tie for the #1 spot on my all-time favourite single-player game, and are cumulatively my favourite story ever, as far as I can say off the top of my head. (NOTE: TL;DR at bottom.)  KotOR II is a third-person RPG game, with largely turn-based combat. Whilst I certainly have a few problems with it, I truly believe that this game (as well as KotOR) is a game that any die-hard Star Wars or RPG enthusiast need to experience. I'll break this review up into a few short segments based around the story in particular (as the most important part of this game is by far the story), and will be reviewing this from a largely biased position, as I've been a fan of this franchise for over a decade. I'm new to the whole reviewing thing too, so forgive any mistakes on my part. For those of you who are just looking for a TL;DR, here are the pros and cons:PROS -Carefully crafted story, one that manages to touch the heart of most die-hard SW fans in a very powerful way. It’s absolutely great in just about every aspect, and it does something no other game does – it paints in grey strokes about the nature of the Force, not just ‘good’ and ‘bad’. -Aesthetic and visuals hold up in the majority of places, considering its age. Just don’t look at the back of the Ebon Hawk, whatever you do. It’s certainly no stunner, however – if you’re cool with a lot of somewhat muddy textures you’ll be fine.  -Fans of the first game won’t have their love for the first game cast into the dirt like a dead corpse. KotOR II respects the first game and doesn’t undermine it. On an unrelated note, the same isn’t the case with the MMO. -There’re some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hilarious and exceptional characters. HK-47 kicks♥♥♥♥♥ -Combat is pretty damn neat, and becomes more satisfying as you progress through the game. Not everyone will love it, though. CONS-Throughout a lot of the game, you may find yourself doing busywork that takes far too long based almost always on where you have to go. A certain mission sends you back and forth through an entire city twice, which is infuriatingly needless. Additionally, any who were a fan of the “RETURN TO EBON HAWK” feature will have to do without this time around. -There are times when your goal is not clear. The mission overview page could rely a little less on my memory, as it often lists only what I’ve done and what *will* happen, but not what I need to do. -Not all will be a fan of the UI, or the aesthetic – though personally, I like them both. There are places where textures go beyond horrific, but thankfully the majority of the game is free from that. -Thanks to Disney, the game technically isn’t canon. The most we’ve gotten in terms of that is a reference to a planet in the original game, as far as I know. I don’t know why playing non-canon stuff would be an issue, but I imagine someone out there will have a problem with it in one way or another. “Ugh, I’ve tainted myself with “extended universe” filth!”- Music can bug out and become repetitive. - Audio can fluctuate at times, forcing you to rip off your headset and smash your ‘lower volume’ key with a clenched fist. -Voice acting noticeably varies in quality. At times certain characters will suddenly sound as though they’re a different person (because it *is* a different person behind the voice). It ruins my immersion, I tell you!-Some characters could use a little love. For example, Nihilus - the guy in the skull-y looking mask - has very little established story, though what story there about him is certainly engaging. ---STORY - (Don't worry, I'm not going to spoil anything.)This is the jewel of the game - again, much like its predecessor. KotOR II has a story that tugs at my heart, in no small part due to KotOR. If you want to delve into a world that’s chock full of lore surrounding the Force as well as the Star Wars universe at large, then KotOR II is the world for you. Now, as a recommendation before I go any further, the story of KotOR II is hugely complemented by the first game. Whilst it isn’t necessarily crucial to play KotOR first and KotOR II is perfectly capable of standing on its own legs, there are quite a few references to characters and the plot that won’t quite make sense, which would be a travesty in my eyes. KotOR itself, though, certainly has a story that stands better by itself than KotOR II could, as KotOR II makes references that without the existence of KotOR would make far less sense and have barely any impact. If you’re someone that takes a great interest in the Force, paying attention to key details in both games will go a long way. *Sorry for spamming “KotOR” there. The intertwined stories of the two games intimidate me, as a wishfully aspiring author. Now, whilst this opinion is subjective, I genuinely believe that the story (including the first game) lives up to the movie saga itself – an opinion I’m sure I’m to receive a lot of flak for. However, there is absolutely no doubt that the lore of KotOR II is immense, and if coupled with lore from KotOR, they far surpass the lore in the saga – I suspect that nearly all who’ve taken their time with this game(s) will agree with me. There is little I can say about the story without spoiling it, so I can really only recommend that you experience it for yourself. The ‘protagonist’ of the full story is to this day my favourite character in anything. Yes, I even like them more than the likes of Vader, Master Chief and Solid Snake. (to be fair I’ve only played a bit of Metal Gear.) Perhaps that’s because I was a lot younger when I first played KotOR, but I stand by my love for the protagonist. PLOT: The plot of KotOR II keeps the pace going and cuts off loose ends from KotOR, resulting in a very tidy story, with a small few exceptions – important questions that the more curious players may have asked themselves in the first game have been answered in a very satisfying way. It doesn’t need to stand on KotOR’s plot - the story of the Exile is just as enthralling as that of the former game. CHARACTERS AND THEIR DEVELOPMENT: There are noticeable improvements on character development in this game. The characters that surround you on your journey are very in-depth, and less predictable than the previous game’s characters were. A few welcome faces from KotOR also join the mix, something that strummed my nostalgia-guitar to a mellow tune – if you were a fan of say, T3-M4 and HK-47, you’ll be pleased to know they’re back. The only issue I can say I have with this is that you may not get a chance to interact fully with all the characters in one playthrough, especially if it’s your first time. Then again, that’s what replays are for, right? PACINGThis comes down to the player, for the most part. The sooner you get into high gear, the sooner you can blitz through the story if you want that. Given that it’s a game full of stuff to loot, chances are the pacing will be right for you – whether you want to get it over and done with – running past loot – or if you want to take your time and soak in the world. CONCLUSIONBuy it. It’s seriously an incredible experience that no one should go without. Better yet, buy the original and play that first, then this. I’m always going to have memories of this game and the original, and will fondly take them to my grave. If I were to assign it a rating (which I disagree with but some insist on having them in reviews) I’d give it a perfect ten, which is something I don’t think I’m going to do much in my life.			"

												Legendary RPG from Obsidian, but it's still got some missing content. First of all, complete planets, and many things from the ending was cut out due to deadline. So basically, the game wasn't finished, but that's where ""Restored content mod"" comes is, and fixes most of the stuff. It's not perfect, but a very good RPG, so if you're a fan of these types of games, or a hardcore Star Wars face, don't miss it!			"

												Great game, perfect sequel to the first one. Great improvements across the board, literally the only two things I prefer about the first game, is firstly, the length, this game is far shorter, and the ending kinda gets boring so you start rushing through the final level. And secondely the nostalgia, though far more fun to play with, and have on a team, the characters from this game just arent as memorable as Bastilla and Carth. Still an awesome game, would reccomend to anyone who's looking for a good Star wars game. "

Totally recommended, but I would also recommend the first game as well since that game is still REALLY good, this one is just much better (with TSLRCM, of course)!			"

												I came for the nostalgia,Yet  I stayed becuase this is a genuinely damn good game.Setting aisde this is a Star Wars game, this game is great, the graphics have aged decently, still can feel immserive at times. Combat is fun as long as you don't mind the pause aspect, and the story while slow to the start, is deep and interesting at times. Now throwing the fact that this IS a Star Wars game back into the mix, if you are thinking of replaying for the nostalgia, you won't be disappointed, it really held up well, and for those who haven't touched it before, BUY IT, and PLAY IT. SWTOR1&2 were great Star Wars installments, among the best in the entirety of Star Wars games, the story and atmospheres are great and it won't be long before SWTOR2 is re-released on the Unreal4 engine, or so it's said. Which it absolutely deserves. IMO the first game is better, better story hands down, better environments, etc, but unfortunately SWTOR didn't hold up well and while the Steam version has a positive rating, it doesn't live up to expectations like it's sequel. Hopefully the original will get the same love and care that this title got, and the developers who currently hold the license will update it and get it into the state it should be. For now, stick with this game, it's frickin awesome.			"

												Hello people of the Internet and welcome to my review for KOTOR II, I won't keep you waiting so I'll just cut to the chase. but before that I shall have you kno0w:I own KOTOR II as a physical copy back in 2008 still have till this dad and played it for years and completed it a least a few dozen times, yes thats how much I played the game and I hope you take my word for it .SW:KOTOR II____________KOTOR II is a sequel to the original game KOTOR , a game made by OBSIDIAN Entertainment along with associating with LucasArts.Now for a quick summary for the plot :Summary:KOTOR II takes place approximately 5 years after KOTOR,the first game, you are unconsious on the Ebon Hawk and soon awake on Peragus, inside a mining facility, there you will meet Kreia , one who is strong with the force and will be your guide to guide you through the game, you also meet Atton, the typical smugglers with charms, as you continue through the story you meet new companions which i will not name for the sake of spoilers. Your character is also known as the Exile, your character is exiled from the Jedi Council because you went fighting with Revan for the Mandalorian Wars the rest of the backstory and all is up for you to find out, young padawan.Gameplay:Gameplay is similiar to KOTOR, its the same pause and turn-based combat (if thats what it is). This time around KOTOR II is alot easier than KOTOR, such new gameplay elements include health regeneration which KOTOR I lacked in. You can still level the same attributes and feats and Force powers, however you like so each game through will be different considering the classes you choose and the choices you make.Graphics:Dating back to 2003 for KOTOR I in comparison for KOTOR II, graphical-wise it isnt much of an improvement, but i will say it has improved and is still pretty decents depending on your point of view or perspective. I MUST SAY THE HUD THIS TIME AROUND IS ALOT BETTER THAN KOTOR I, in KOTOR I your HUDS were the size of the a mint, so the HUD improvement from KOTOR I is well appreciated.Final Verdict:(8/10)Though the story for KOTOR II is not as interesting to me as KOTOR I, KOTOR II holds a dear place in my heart and no doubt in a few weeks time , you will see me playing the game over and over again just to experience the story all over again :D. So basically if you want a cheap Star Wars RPG at this time and age you wanna get the KOTOR franchises, because their drive on story and decision-making is amazing at tijmes the voice-acting is pretty convicing it makes me feel bad for being a bad guy on some occasions , so put on your Jedi robes, arm your lightsabers and charge right in this game, young exile  and May the Force Be with You.

												10/10 A++   (I run El Capitan on Mac)  I've been pulled back in the Star Wars franchise by the new movie, and recently played through both KOTOR games for the first time.  After throughly enjoying KOTOR, I honestly doubted if KOTOR II could live up to the first game, and hearing how it was rushed and incomplete-ish, I wasn't expecting that much out of it.  Boy was I wrong!!  Gameplay wise, there were a lot of small things that were improvements upon the first game (e.g. when you find a datapad it pops up right then so you can read it instead of having to search through all your belongings for it; your health points heal slowly when you're not in battle even without having to use a medpac, footlocked/corpse say whether they are empty if you've already looted them, no more really difficult to beat turret battles that you have to get through to continue the game!!!)The storyline and characters are wonderful.  There are so many well-nuanced, non-traditional-trope-following characters.  Kreia and the Exile are awesome.  Darth Nihilus is one of the best-designed scariest-looking Sith from the Star Wars Universe ever.  The storyline (to me at least) felt rich and complete up until the final planet/boss showdown.  Even with the Restored Content Mod (which is essential, by the way), the last level did feel rushed, empty, and incomplete-ish.  However, to me it still was a fairly-satisfying conclusion to the game.    I had a few small problems with bugs (namely on Nar Shaddaa and one at the beginning of Telos, so I recommend saving often and having save files available).  All-in-all, I really enjoyed this game and overall found it just as good if not better than the first KOTOR game.			"

												Kotor 2 for a long time has been praised and also criticized since it first released over 10 years ago. Obsidian, again working on a tight schedule(why does it happen to them all the time) still managed to put together one of the best story rpgs ever and now with the addition of the TSLRCM mod improves it to epic status. Its easily one of the best games i have ever played and the story and especially the characters are simply amazing from start to finish.In the game you play as Jedi(duh) who has been exiled due to you following 2 rouge Jedi into the Mandalorin wars. This exile has made you forget/ lose(hello? Amnesia) the force and your journey is about regaining that knowledge whether it be for light, dark or not at all. While on your journey you will also be dodging and fighting the Sith who believe you are the last of the jedi and your death will bring them an ultimate victory of the galaxy. And of course you will also be doing all that awesome RPG stuff of crafting, leveling, building a team, and making choices.I probably consider Mass Effect 2 as the pinnacle when discussing character, story driven RPG's but after Kotor 2....damn its close. And i don't know which is better but thats a great argument to have among fans. The party you build in Kotor 2 is as mysterious, scary, lovable, funny and dark that, like in mass effect, i could not wait to talk to them. Not only are all conversations engaging, but they are brought to life by probably by the best group of voice actors assembled for a video game. I cant recall one voice who does not represent the character they portray nor a voice who was weak, or just plain bad. I can finally understand the appeal and praise for the assassin droid HK-47 who I will never forgot, or Kreia, Atton, Bau-Dor, Mandalore, Mira, and Visas. All memorable in their own unique way and lets not forget about their ship the Ebon Hawk which i will glady place along side the likes of the Millenium Falcon, Normandy and Enterprise.The game play for Kotor 2 is real -time, pausable turn based combat. As you enter combat you can place 4 orders/ turns per character but you will be changing them constantly depending on enemies. In combat you can choose an active skill, buffs, combat stance which is very important and of course force powers. These powers and skills will all be rewarded as you level your character and progress through the story. The level up system is very deep for skills but the point system is i dont know how to explain but i always just hit ""recommend"" after the 3rd or 4 th level. Maybe too many points are given?One of Obsidians staple for their games are choice and Kotor 2 does not disappoint. Of course you being a Jedi your choice is obvious light or dark but the the way it is presented in writing makes it clear. There are no shades of gray for your choice. Those choices carry through to the end as well as what party members you will be able to recruit. There is also a rewarding crafting system though its a lot to absorb at the start but becomes a little easier to understand after a few trial and errors. You will be able to craft equipment, weapons and medicine but because of the limited interface and ease to compare items i used it sparingly. The game is not difficult even on the hardest difficulty and loot is plentiful so crafting is really just an option and not necessity.This is still a 10 year old game and not without noticeable game play staples of today. I would have given a left nut for fast travel, a better UI, and when crafting the ability to compare items and a simple who has what equipped. i dont actually know all the details of what the MOD fixed other than adding lost content, but graphically it looks sharp and the combat with some new added animations looked really cool. Kotor 2 is another amazing title from Obsidian and with the help of dedicated fans has not only preserved it for another generation but polished it to the diamond status it deserves. I finished the game a few days ago and still thinking about choices, characters and the story. Awesome game.Positives:One of the best Story, Character driven RPGs ever made and equals Mass Effect 2 in every wayIt maybe the best voice acting(including robots) cast everGraphics are dated but they still look sharp and the light saber battles look really good.RPG goodness everywherei want to immediately restart and go down the other pathNegatives The UI needs updated. I would rather see an MMO type toolbar than what is in place.You cant compare items and when crafting it just says ""equipped"" but doesnt say by whoA lot of running back and forth and sometimes, where do i go?The point distribution for leveling feels too rewarding? A little easy even on hard difficultyObsidian are not doing a complete remake or working on Kotor 3 Few notes: I played the game on my laptop with mouse and k/b at 1080P with only the TSLRCM mod installed. I experienced 2 hard crashes and i lost my cloud save? once.  To me these are minor and non issue.Steam shows playtime around 63 hrs which i feel is accurate. I tried to do everything, i talked to everyone and even played Pazzak.I am huge RPG fan and Obsidian/Black Isle are my favorite RPG developers. I had held off from playing Kotor 2 because of the constant crashes and problems that seemed to plague the game on initial release.			"

												This Game was released in an unfinished status and you sadly recognise that from the first moment on. I highy recommend the ""Restored Content Mod"", which improves the game a lot. Also this game now has full steam support, which means it should not cause any trouble in terms of compatibility or resolution choice.Even though it's not as well thought out and polished as the first KOTOR (which is my favourite Game of all time btw), it still has a lot of its incredible ingredients with a few usefull gameplay additions. This makes it still a very good RPG with a very high replay value(im surely into double figures at the time im writing this). If you liked the first KOTOR or the Mass Effect Games, this is a good choice. If you haven't played those, then you should try them first.			"

												Note: Didn't realize this was on Steam until today. Rest assured I've played the hell out of it. This is the perfect example of a sequel that outstrips it's predecessor in every way. KOTOR2 features the same great combat and exploration (6 planets! 7 if you include the tutorial zone, and 8 if you count the removed one.) The game has GREAT writing, really deconstructing the basic good versus evil methology of Star Wars. Lots of great quests, your own ship, and lots of unique companion characters. Best Star Wars game, period. Be sure to grab the Restored Content mod, though. Without Restored Content: 8/10With Restored Content: 9.5/10			"

												Kotor 2 was a mixed bag for a lot of fans of the first game. The game is a lot more cerebral then it`s predecessor.The original Kotor was a nice game with a ``Gather your friends and save the galaxy`` plotline. In this game you`re dealing with the fallout of the actions of the previous game. It`s a lot darker of a storyline and it has a nice climax when it ends.The voice acting is simply breathtaking and the storyline itself top notch. Just bare in mind that Kotor 2 was rushed on release and as such a large portion of content was cut out. Thankfully modders have restored most of it since then, so I recommend googling Kotor 2 restored content mod if you want to fully experience this game how the developers intended.			"

												Luke, did I ever tell you about Darth Maul? He was Sheev's apprentice before Dooku and Vader that used a double-bladed lightsaber. He fought against my master Qui-Gon on Naboo, and managed to kill him. Fortunately, even though I was still a Padawan I managed to cut him in half by taking advantage of the fact that he didn't know how to use the High Ground. However, it turned out that his hate somehow allowed him to survive getting cut in half and falling down a bottomless pit, and he somehow managed to escape from Naboo and become a cyborg spider on some other planet. Years later, during the Clone Wars, his brother Savage Opress found him and upgraded his cyborg legs. They went on a rampage across the Galaxy, trying to get revenge both on me and his former master Sheev. It's such a pity that he never told anyone that Sheev was a Sith Lord, that would have saved us a lot of trouble. They eventually took over Mandalore and killed the only woman I had ever loved right in front of me. After that I kind of lost track of him, not sure what became of him. I hope he's doing well, he was a good friend.			"

												Get the Restored Content mod. The planets are varied and interesting, the pacing on point, and the story very well written. Ony game I've played that you can agree to free someone's girlfriend from slavery, then bring her to him and tell him she's your slave now right to his face, then make her dance for money. Gameplay is fun but gets repetitive, and has some difficulty spikes (better start training Atton). Fortunately the story is so interesting you can't stop playing it.			"

												Star Wars : Knights Of Old The Republic II - one of the best RPGs of its time. Story - the strongest part of game play. The game is present magnificent pumping system. Apart from the usual skills ( blaster, knives, armor, etc.) and characteristics ( Strength, Dexterity, Wisdom, etc.) are present perks that allow a character, such as hacking, repairing or first-aid. The game also has Jedi Force, like healing, lightning, acceleration, suffocation, exhaustion life. They are divided into three types: Good , Neutral and Evil. As its name suggests, the Jedi force depends on your side. You can choose who you want to become, evil Sith or Jedi Master. All depends on your moral choices. You're choose, help the poor merchant defend himself from poachers or kill everyone and take all the money merchant. Tactical combat system is very convenient and effective. To give orders to the whole detachment enough just a couple of seconds. Also can not be noted that the game has a great soundtrack! With this music is associated very many fond memories. This is a great game, any fan of Star Wars or RPGs must play it.			"

												When I was a young kid, no older than 8, I was obsessed with Star Wars, and so my parents got me KOTOR 1 and eventually KOTOR 2 to play. About a year ago, I picked them up on Steam and played KOTOR 1 through again, and it was fun. But then I played KOTOR 2 again (this time with the Restored Content mod and the droid planet mod). And then I played it through again. And then a third time. And then a fourth. This game's story is incredible, the options the player is given are many, and the companions you meet are interesting. This has quickly become one of my favorite games.I think the only way you will like this game is if you are a Star Wars lore fan, even if the story this game tells is not technically canon anymore. There was a recent update to this game on Steam, adding a Workshop for mods, including the Restored Content mod. If you are going to play this game, you MUST install that mod. It includes a lot of content that the developers were not able to get in the game by launch due to time restrictions given by LucasArts. Save often and in different slots. Even with the mods and recent updates, there are bugs and the game can crash and the game can corrupt a save file. Awesome game. Most definitely recommended.			"

You can definitely enjoy this game whether you are a Star Wars fan or not.The real strength of KOTOR 2 is found in its variety of playstyles and dialogue options - you will definitely need multiple playthroughs to catch everything this title has to offer. Playing the first game is definitely recommended for a full grasp of the setting, but not mandatory by any means.Also a perfect example of a compatability update done right. The added controller support greatly improves gameplay and acheivements are appreciated as well. Still waiting on a similar patch for KOTOR 1.			"

												If you don't want to look in depth of what my review is on my score is 8.5/10 Pros: Immersive, Lore-Friendly Gameplay. Choices make you feel more involved with the game's outcome. Character Customization is has many options & gear to choose from. Combat is strategic and immersive.  Many characters with different traits that expect you to convince characters to your liking with the many dialogue options.Cons: MINOR Bugs that you collide into a wall and it interferes with combat. MAJOR Some choices that you make will make the game unwinnable, thus you not being able to complete the game. MINOR Although I said the choices make you feel immersed into the gameplay with the many dialogue options, there are many situations where you can only make one choice thus making the user feel more restricted and less immersed. However there may have been known mods that create more immersive choices. MINOR Some areas in the game are very small and  can make you backchannel a lot and may get confused with the direction in where you're going in some parts. A good example is when you make it to Taris after leaving Peragus you have roughly 4-5 zones to explore and which you'll be backtracking where to go and what to do at some points.Overall this game is very good but with some drawbacks that can be overlooked without too much thought being put in. Star Wars Knights of the Republic II: The Sith Lords is a very good game and it should be condemed as such. If you are interested in an immersive Star Wars RPG, then you have come to the right place. Feel free to explore and fight your way through the galaxy of Star Wars, with your choice of either to become apart of the dark or to be ascended into the light. I hope you found this review helpful and thumbs up if you did.			"

												A little bit rough around the edges, but it offers improved gameplay and a more complex story than the first, and a bit more role-playing thanks to a greater variety of dialogue choices.  It was clearly rushed by LucasArts though, and this can be obvious at times; not just because of the bugs but also with some of the characters who clearly weren't developed as much as Obsidian intended.  Despite this, it's an outstanding game with far more role-playing than pretty much any present day RPG, much like its predecessor, and the story is one of the best there is in gaming.It has recently been updated with native widescreen and high refresh rate support, so now you can just get The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod and enjoy the game.

Posted: March 14, 2016
												TL;DR: One of my favorite games ever. KotOR II takes all mechanics that KotOR had and makes them better, plus it adds a ton of new stuff. The companion influence system is one of the most interesting, deep and rewarding to be found in all of gaming history. You get different companions based on your force alignment and sex, and interacting with your companions will not only give you access to lots of personal background and general lore, but also lots of special unlocks - force powers, abilities, and new classes for your followers. The only downside to its vastness is probably that you never will be able to experience all of it in one go - you'll even need at least 2 runs to merely recruit all possible followers, and then probably some to reach maximum influence with all of them (or, use some of the various influence guides on the web). The characters never fail to attract my interest, and draw me into their stories - almost everyone has more to them than meets the eye at first. There are also lots of scenes of banter between you companions aboard the player ship, some of which are hilarious while others are dark and sinister, which lets you experience many different facets of their personalities, and many of them are also based upon your influence with the different companions. There are new force powers, as well as different fighting stances and 'force forms' which let you customize your style of play even more. For example: your a Jedi Master with nearly unlimited force use but a little squishy in hand to hand combat? Use a force form which makes your force attacks more powerful, at the cost of greater drain of your force points - of which you have more than enough anyway. Or you're a Sith Marauder who slays his enemies solely with his lightsaber? Adapt to every situation by employing stances which give you higher blaster deflection, increased defense against multiple melee fighters, or greater attack and defense against a single lightsaber-wielding opponent.Crafting is expanded and more useful, too. For example, lightsabers can be upgraded with 5 different components (2 crystals, energy cell, emitter, and focusing lens) instead of the 2 crystals only, as in KotOR. There are a lot more robes for Force users, with various boni to them, and they also look a lot better than those in KotOR. The story is a bit of a divisive point - some feel its attempt at analyzing the eternal light side vs dark side struggle and putting some moral ambiguity into it strays too far from the star wars formula. Yet, like many people, I think it's the most interesting thing that has been done in a star wars story ever. Overall the story is quite dark and at times melancholy in its tone, which is also aided by the game's fantastic soundtrack. I still don't tire of the atmosphere and the stories of the game, even 10 years after I originally played this game (and countlessly replayed it since). The 2015 update which brings support for widescreens and high definitions is the perfect excuse to finally play this game (again), and with steam workshop support it's easier than ever to experience what the game was meant to be, thanks to the incredibly great TSL restored content mod and the M4-78 enhancement project, which even adds a planet that missed completely in the original release of the game. I definitely recommend to get those mods, but I also loved the original, admittedly unfinished version. If you can't stand open endings, TSLRCM is an absolute MUST.			"

												As the preceding game, KotOR II is one of those classics everyone who digs RPGs should play before they die. It was released ridden with bugs because of humanity's base Christmas instincts and I remember having to do a lot of 'hacking' to even get to see the main menu back in 2004. It's said the devs having to rush it resulted in a weirdly incomplete final planet and ending, but I've always been mildly disappointed with the drabness of the first one, Peragus, and it seems I'm not alone in this as there's even a 'skip Peragus' mod out there. One of the many glitches I actually like - infinite Hssiss ('dark side lizards') on Korriban - going to the Sith homeworld and returning incredibly powerful totally fits the roleplay going on in my brain.KotOR 2 is generally exquisite though. It's a lot more complex and dark than the first episode. In KotOR I you were usually given the choice of being either a preachy goody-two-shoes Luke or a butthurt homicidal maniac. The Sith Lords offers shades of grey, even if not quite 50. All the accolades Kreia has received are deserved.Characters with motives alike hers are often the most intriguing in storytelling as a longing for the void is something us muggles can probably never quite wrap our heads around. Making the game truly revolve around you, the main character, helps immersion quite a bit. The influence system fits into the lore very well and I'm pretty sure it's the first game where you can twist your NPC companions quite as much. 'Best Star Wars game ever' rings true, I'd be hard pressed to name any other title that comes close.Too bad we were deprived of KotOR III.			"

												 Graphics: For an 05 game, it looks pretty damn good (if you have a good graphics card, that is). Keep in mind though that it 'is' a 2005 game, so don't expect anything incredible. 8/10Story: Here is where TSL shines. I have quite honestly never played a Star wars game with such in depth writing. From the deep and well thought out exploration of the moral grey areas between the Light and Dark sides of the Force to the deviously intricate, and VERY well written main quest, KOTOR II's writing is nothing short of incredible. 10/10Characterization: This of course ties in with the aforementioned excellent writing. The characters in this game feel more like living, breathing people, and less like the one dimensional caricatures of KOTOR 1. The addition of a good influence character influence system (you can't just give characters gifts to 'make' them like you ala Dragon age: Origins) that prevents you from pleasing everyone increses my score from what would have been a 9.5/10 to an outright 10/10Combat: Combat is greatly improved over KOTOR I's rather basic system. As you improve your combat feats, they don't just become more effective: they change visably as well, becoming more graceful, powerful, and masterful-looking all the time. 9.5/10General overview: I probably should rate the game's overall sound quality, but i'm not very good at distinguishing good game audio from bad due to hearing issues. Sorry about that. Overall, i would rate this game a 9.5/10. Besides Battlefronts 1 and 2 and Star Wars Galaxies, KOTOR II is one of the best Star Wars experiences you will ever have (BE SURE to download the Restored Content mod, as it will unlock much of the content that Obsidian was forced to cut out due to LucasArts' unreasonably short Christmas Deadline).

												""You were whole."" Let me start by saying that the game is largely incomplete in it's vanilla state. Large sections of the game were cut due to time constraints, a tragedy. This game is great without all the content, and I believe I speak for everyone who has played this game that it could have been so much greater had LucasArts given Obsidian the time required to complete it. Knights of the Old Republic III was eventually cancelled, leaving many fans wondering just exactly what happened. Later on, an MMO was made by BioWare in an attempt to complete the saga, to many fans distaste. A book titled Revan was written to bridge the gap between the MMO and this game, however it wasn't the KotOR 3 we asked for. ""Also, in private, we will be mercifully free from the opinions of imbeciles and fools."" Knights of the Old Republic II is a major improvement upon the first game. Don't get me wrong, the first is one of  if not the greatest RPG of all time, but the whole Good/Evil thing is overdone throughout Star Wars and Obsidian changed that a good bit with the sequel (""If you are to truly understand, then you will need the contrast, not adherence to a single idea."") . Rather than having the typical BioWare Good, Evil, and Neutral option, the game presents you with hard choices and makes you think. Perhaps by giving credits to the poor beggar, you have only made his life harder for him. Any who believe that BioWare should be making KotOR 3 and not Obsidian is sadly mistaken.""Find what you were looking for amongst the dead?"" This game despite it's age still has an active modding community, whether it be weapons, armor, or even some updated textures to make the game feel and look much newer than it is. The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod adds back the cut content that was left in the game's code, and the M4-78 enhancement project adds the planet that was cut from the game, designed from the ground up by a modding team who deserves a round of applause. *presses applause button*Oh, and LucasArts, if you're reading this...""You have failed me. Completely and utterly.""			"

												By far the most amazing underrated game i have ever played, KOTOR 2 was a shining beacon in my childhood. Right from the start the game throws you into a suspenseful story, and it never lets up. Unlike KOTOR 1, where you can clearly define right and wrong (lightside/darkside options), KOTOR 2 muddies the lines that define good and evil and has you make tough decisions, with the early acquired and amazingly well written and voiced companion character ""Kreia"", further blurring those already hard-to-see lines. You want to help that poor homeless man on Nar Shadda by giving him credits? Think again, because that same act of kindess can make him a target to his fellow refugees.But what really pulls everything in in this admittedly rushed-yet-amazing game is the not just the complicated moral choices and quanderies, but the feeling of urgency. Wether you decide to stay on the tride and true path of the jedi, or break out as a rogue dark jedi/sith, you can never forget you are being hunted by what must be THE scariest sith lords ever designed. Obsidian definitly took an already amazing game and, in my opinion, made it better than the original.Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of bugs and holes in some parts of the story, but what IS there is a fascinating take on that Galaxy Far, Far Away.My rating 9.5/10Edit: Finally, Steam and Lord Gaben (of the Sith) has finally decided to fully support KOTOR II in all it's glory! with the TSLRCM, I can safely say now, without a shadow of a doubt, that this game is a MUST BUY! Gone are the slightly annoying bugs, and in with the refined content.My edited rating with full steam support and TSLRCM: 10/10 would kill the galaxy and all the jedi again			"

												I love this game. I bought it when it first came out over a decade ago and it is still one that no matter how many new computers I get, I always make sure to have this one installed (much easier now with steam!). I have probably spent over 1000 hours easy on this game since first buying it. Over 10 years and still going strong!			"

												Meatbag!A new update to the game after 10 years? Awesome.Like the first game, this is a must play for Star Wars & RPG fans.Before starting a new game make sure you have the Restored Content Mod installed from the Steam Workshop as it adds a bunch of cut content from the original release.With the Restored Content Mod installed, this game is arguably as good as if not better than KOTOR 1.

												In some ways, it is stronger than the first game. The influence system is terrific as well as the storyline. HOWEVER: It is only stronger if you mod the hell out of it. You'll at least want  TSR, if nothing else.  Downloading some other attended content ones is suggested, as well as ones to make it look better.Your gameplay is about the same as KOTOR, with some added force powers. YAY FORCE POWERS. There's two romances for the females and two for the males, unlike the one you were locked too without cheats in the first one. *cough*Juhaniromancemods*cough*. I also suggest using KSE because some places are a total ♥♥♥♥♥ and a half to get through.All in all, it's a good game and well worth it. KOTOR is still in my top 5 games of all time and this one isn't, but it's worthwihle.			"

												The Sith Lords proved an imperfect, incomplete and yet paradoxically fantastic epic for an era in RPGs. It can't be defined by what it did right, (the industry-standard that was the first game in the series could be summed-up in such terms) but by those exceptional moments it offers the player in a way no other game by my recollection, has replicated since. The Sith Lords has a botched ending, dated graphics, and ""bare-bones""/minimalistic gameplay by today's standards- falling short in total of anyone's most basic expectations. On paper, it's failure. And yet, despite what little Oblivion did to encite players, lacking the usual flashy bells and whistles that commcerials are made of, it somehow manages to introduce the subject of the story, to a universe which is rich in lore, life, and charm. From the very beginning, you are awoken, injured and alone, aboard what looks to be an abandoned mining facility. The first few moments you spend collecting yourself, is in a morgue with an old, creepy, cryptic women, who shares with you her thoughts on your predicament. From there, you traverse the empty, earie halls of the base in search of answers which are few and far between, encountering next to no one in the process- (Spoilers) save for a handful of murderous mining droids, and the last holo recordings of a crew not long for this world: a bleak outlook to say the least. The atmosphere here is palpable- permeating with a sense of emptiness, mysticism, and awe along the way,  setting the tone for much to come. The unknown is a key theme from beginning to end, as you embark on a journey of self-discovery, putting back toghether the peices of your past, which if you played the first game, should be a familar feature. As you unravel the secrets of the Jedi and Sith, who have more or less, droped-off the face of galaxy- adding to the strangeness of it all, especially for a Star Wars game- you begin to fall deeper and deeper into a thick plot which is all consuming, and from which there is no recourse. But i'd better leave it at that, and focus on a few features which make the game: Dialogue: The voice acting here is par none -in both writing and cadance- with some of the most memorable lines of any game, that will leave you thinking long after you've played your first time through- and if you do pick it up, it will have you going back to pick apart what was meant here or there. Conversation drives the story, so careful attention to what is being conveyed is a must to make sense of whats going on, and from there, what choices to make. Characters: Each is unique, and with all there is to find out about them, I found myself loving or hating them with no such feelings in between. Which is an unavoidable consiquence of the influence system: a game mechanic that just means favoring one character (in dialogue) tends to♥♥♥♥♥♥off other characters. This adds another dimension to your light/dark side options, and the closer you get to some characters, the more you will get to know them and vice versa (the less the rest will tell you.) Their own personal plots come with alot of baggage to swift through, and dark backrounds to confront, with reveals which are the highlight of the game. Choices: Don't be fooled by Mass Effect and it's ilk; Knights of the Old Republic practically invented player-driven progression, with but a handful of forebarers to draw from. If you do play it, I think you will find that the choices that are available in this game, far surpass those offered by others RPGs. What you say and do matters in this game, and you feel it both in the consiquences and rewards. The impact of each is immediate and meaningful, which, depending on your path, will pan out one way or another in the ending. For every flaw you find in the Sith Lords, two great things pop up. My favorite game of all time, the Sith Lords is a must for story-loving RPG players- and I don't even hardly play or much like RPG's on the whole; I'm a strategy guy- But this story speaks to me and has left it's mark on how I see fiction, stretching the genre to the limit of it's creative ends, and leaving me with impossible expectations of what passes for a good plot on the market today.

												I played this game on Xbox, it was the first game my brother and I ever bought together. Maybe I'm biased but I will break it down. Story:Pros:Rich story, plenty of fully voiced dialogue.As always, choose your own ending/path.Updated from KOTOR: Character influence/ability to convert companions to Jedi -- YES PLEASE!So good at making the player character ""special"" or all-important, which is crucial to a good RPG imo.Cons:THE ENDING. There is now a mod to help this but overall the build up was 100x overhyped for the provided ending, at least there's a solid ""first ending"" where you finish the jedi master story arch.You majorly have to choose which companions you want to be jedis and sacrifice influence with others in order to achieve this, there's no having your cake and eating it too. A lot of vague hints and questions, particularly involving Revan that will go unanswered forever. Combat:Pros:Many more force powers available, and with 30 extra levels, a chance to get all the ones you wantThough not as well-clarified as some games, the attributes you select will affect the combat immensely, thus your original build will affect how often you hit and how often enemies are ""saved"" when using force powers. You have the opportunity to really boost your combat in the area of your choice.Cons:EIther boring or constant pausing and tweaking, you don't control the movements, only which attacks/items are usedCombat is very basic, all roll based, your roll plus bonuses - their roll plus bonuses = hit/missThe powers/medical supplies/feats are all in their own scroll menu in combat, MMO style key-binding & self-assigned options would've improved the flow of combat much more. If you try to go for middle ground in your attribute choices, I find that you are all around mediocre in combat rather than balanced.Clumsy combat queue, if you want to use a medi-pac immediately, you have to go into the inventory menu or cancel combat before you select it. Otherwise it will queue, and you or your injured party member will likely die before it is used. The idea is good, because you can switch to other characters and choose their next 3 actions but it wasn't smooth. Gameplay:The graphics are dated now, but still not terriblePlenty of character options available, and an added Jedi/Sith Master Class option at level 15While you can choose any order of planets, after your first playthrough, you'll know better. It is better to do specific orders for the characters you want to become jedi. Look up a guide if you're a One-go-Joe.More lightsaber colors.Overall, it's well worth your time, I wish the original KOTOR had a lot of the elements that this one introduced. Every game has some glitches and now that there are a good number of fixes both on Steam workshop and Kotor II Nexus, this game has recovered from its disappointing brokenness to become the gem it always should have been. Just play it.			"

												I began playing the Knights of the Old republic series when the first game came out, but grew significantly more attached to the plot and characters of KOTOR 2, compared to the first KOTOR. What the game lost when LucasArts rushed it out the door for a Christmas release, it more than made up for itself due to a colorful cast, and (likely due to Chris Avellone's influence), a total disregard for the standard Star Wars fare of ""Light and Jedi good, Dark and Sith bad."" Grey heavily entered the equation, and this game attempts to honestly give you that sort of choice, as much as an offical Star Wars game can get. However, you must understand when playing this - this story isn't about Revan, per se, or the Jedi, or the Sith - it's about the Exile, and why you (the player, the Exile), went to war against the Mandolorians, why you chose to follow Revan and Malak - and why you came back. You chose your own ambitions, in far greater depth than KOTOR 1's typicaly ""Light Side/Dark Side"" choices. That isn't to say though that you should be any one specific thing on the sliding scale of morality in the game - far from it. This game is a million times more satisfying as any side of the Force though, compared to KOTOR 1, so instead of being a rather...comical imitation of a bad guy who electrocutes people in KOTOR 1, you can get deeper into the mental aspects of the dark side. The same is for the light, but the game (rather, Kreia and through her, totally Chris Avellone), WILL indeed slap you on the wrist for being either side than grey...Which is also a major thing.KOTOR 2 is a wonderful game, that clearly has inspired fans the world over to cling tightly to the runt of the two KOTOR games - but there's a damn good reason for that.Also don't expect to get much romance, but it's not like KOTOR 1 had oodles of that either, so to each their own. HK makes up for it though.			"

												This is the somewhat disappointing lead-up to the amazing first Kotor. It bears all the strengths of the first game. However, everything is kind of diluted and unfinished. The writing is great, but the plot less engaging; the characters are nice, but the dialogue is annoyingly open-ended; there are more powers and items, but the game mechanics are extremely broken; the game is longer, but there are idiotic gaps and missing content.You can talk through the same stuff over and over again with the NPCs. You can go light side weapon master and still spam force storm a hundred times in a fight. You can get in serious trouble by going to Nar Shaddaa as your first planet. Or by playing even one of the side characters in the wrong way. You can miss important bits of information if you don't choose the exactly right dialogue options. And so forth.I would still say it's worth playing through at least two times. Despite all its flaws and being in the shadow of its predecessor, it's still a great Star Wars RPG. It's not like we have that many of those around.			"

It's a work of art.The Writing is superb, In fact, One begins to question if there is a 'right' or wrong 'choice', it's that good. gone are the black and white choices that plauge typical games. Not here. everything is Very, very grey. As for the combat, it runs on D&D's Mechanics behind the scenes, with real time Blended with turn based Mechanics. Nothing special, but that's not this game's draw. As A kid, I must have played this Dozens of times over, and over. It has this charm that is hard to describe.

												KotOR II is both the better and the more flawed of the two KotOR games. Someone once described it as ""Star Wars by people who don't like Star Wars,"" which is pretty apt, but make no mistake, this is a labor of love. However, the game's release date was moved radically forward without consultation of the Dev Team, leading to a lot of cut and incomplete content and a structure with a bloated beginning and rushed end. Overall, if a KotOR III is ever made, I would rather play as the Exile than Malak, as she is a more nuianced and interesting character than Revan's over the top OP Mary-Sueness. Of course, that ain't gonna happen because of garbage with the Old Republic MMO but bah, a man can dream, can't he?Anyway, I'd recommend this game to anyone who wants a solid RPG which deconstucts the Star Wars setting in an interesting way and has real choices and consequences, but warn that you are going to get a very flawed gem. Beyond the understandable problems stemming from corporate dickery, the game is not balanced at all and there are a few design decisions which are questionable. For example, the mechanics heavily incentivize going 100% Light Side or Dark Side, yet the game oozes an atmosphere of gritty moral ambiguity which I've heard describe as ""noirish."" This is a damn shame because it severely punishes role playing in a game filled with great roleplaying opprotunities. Those looking to be a badass Dirty Harry in space are better off trying Mass Effect 2. Also, the blackjack minigame ""Pazaak"" basically breaks the economy, which is kind of lame. TL;DR: Yeah, buy it. It's only ten bucks and you'll get far more value out of it than some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥'s shovelware ""art"" game for the same price.			"

												I played this game a ton when I was younger, and I had to get it when it came out for Mac OS. Although unfinished on release, the Restored Content Mod on Steam Workshop is easy to install and not only fixes many of the bugs but also adds ""new"" parts to the game that I hadn't seen before when I played. Like its predecessor, Knights of the Old Republic 2 has interesting party members and plenty of dialogue, with even more replay value. More items and upgrades, powers and classes, etc. Well worth the $10 and you can get much more out of it than that!			"

												This Game Is a hidden Gem. On release it was a broken, buggy unfinished Mess. But over a decade later, with patches and  the sweat and Blood of Modders, It's brillance shines through. And Somehow, it's more than a game to me. It's a work of art.The Writing is superb, In fact, One begins to question if there is a 'right' or wrong 'choice', it's that good. gone are the black and white choices that plauge typical games. Not here. everything is Very, very grey. As for the combat, it runs on D&D's Mechanics behind the scenes, with real time Blended with turn based Mechanics. Nothing special, but that's not this game's draw. As A kid, I must have played this Dozens of times over, and over. It has this charm that is hard to describe. Ever wanted to Kill those smug Jedi? well, now you can! :D			"

												This is the somewhat disappointing lead-up to the amazing first Kotor. It bears all the strengths of the first game. However, everything is kind of diluted and unfinished. The writing is great, but the plot less engaging; the characters are nice, but the dialogue is annoyingly open-ended; there are more powers and items, but the game mechanics are extremely broken; the game is longer, but there are idiotic gaps and missing content.You can talk through the same stuff over and over again with the NPCs. You can go light side weapon master and still spam force storm a hundred times in a fight. You can get in serious trouble by going to Nar Shaddaa as your first planet. Or by playing even one of the side characters in the wrong way. You can miss important bits of information if you don't choose the exactly right dialogue options. And so forth.I would still say it's worth playing through at least two times. Despite all its flaws and being in the shadow of its predecessor, it's still a great Star Wars RPG. It's not like we have that many of those around.			"

												I recently had the pleasure of replaying Knights of the Old Republic II with the Restored Content mod.  Taken as-is, KotOR II is a fantastic, if unfinished, successor to the first KotOR.  The fanmade Restored Content mod works to add in and finished content that didn't quite make it into the retail release while also stomping out the many bugs that plague the game.  It is an absolute must-have for the game.The game's main draw is its rather ambitious story, weaving a tale of shades of grey in the otherwise bipolar Star Wars universe.  Thematically, the game might even have less in common with Star Wars and be more of a cousin to the classic Planescape: Torment (a personal favorite), which is probably why I enjoy KotOR II even more than its outstanding predecessor.If you enjoyed the gameplay of Knights of the Old Republic and/or Obsidian's singular style of storytelling, give it a shot.

												Definitely worth playing for a great story and immersion into the expanded universe. Can’t recommend it enough.Pros:•	More in-depth RPG elements comparted to KOTOR1, with added Prestige Classes alongside unique abilities. •	Develops Sith lore beyond good/evil struggle.•	Surprising active modding community.•	A rewarding and surprisingly mature storyline.•	HK-47.Cons:•	Story is confusing at times. Most likely due to Obsidian’s rush to market.•	Prepare for some digging and background reading to fully understand the story. •	Slow opening chapter IMO.•	Tendency for both annoying and hilarious bugs. •	Atton.P.S Don’t play during or within three months of revision, work, socialising, weddings, funerals, birthdays, anniversaries or any other form of activity beyond the confines of the screen.

												I began playing the Knights of the Old republic series when the first game came out, but grew significantly more attached to the plot and characters of KOTOR 2, compared to the first KOTOR. What the game lost when LucasArts rushed it out the door for a Christmas release, it more than made up for itself due to a colorful cast, and (likely due to Chris Avellone's influence), a total disregard for the standard Star Wars fare of ""Light and Jedi good, Dark and Sith bad."" Grey heavily entered the equation, and this game attempts to honestly give you that sort of choice, as much as an offical Star Wars game can get. However, you must understand when playing this - this story isn't about Revan, per se, or the Jedi, or the Sith - it's about the Exile, and why you (the player, the Exile), went to war against the Mandolorians, why you chose to follow Revan and Malak - and why you came back. You chose your own ambitions, in far greater depth than KOTOR 1's typicaly ""Light Side/Dark Side"" choices. That isn't to say though that you should be any one specific thing on the sliding scale of morality in the game - far from it. This game is a million times more satisfying as any side of the Force though, compared to KOTOR 1, so instead of being a rather...comical imitation of a bad guy who electrocutes people in KOTOR 1, you can get deeper into the mental aspects of the dark side. The same is for the light, but the game (rather, Kreia and through her, totally Chris Avellone), WILL indeed slap you on the wrist for being either side than grey...Which is also a major thing.KOTOR 2 is a wonderful game, that clearly has inspired fans the world over to cling tightly to the runt of the two KOTOR games - but there's a damn good reason for that.Also don't expect to get much romance, but it's not like KOTOR 1 had oodles of that either, so to each their own. HK makes up for it though.			"

												I played this game on Xbox, it was the first game my brother and I ever bought together. Maybe I'm biased but I will break it down. Story:Pros:Rich story, plenty of fully voiced dialogue.As always, choose your own ending/path.Updated from KOTOR: Character influence/ability to convert companions to Jedi -- YES PLEASE!So good at making the player character ""special"" or all-important, which is crucial to a good RPG imo.Cons:THE ENDING. There is now a mod to help this but overall the build up was 100x overhyped for the provided ending, at least there's a solid ""first ending"" where you finish the jedi master story arch.You majorly have to choose which companions you want to be jedis and sacrifice influence with others in order to achieve this, there's no having your cake and eating it too. A lot of vague hints and questions, particularly involving Revan that will go unanswered forever. Combat:Pros:Many more force powers available, and with 30 extra levels, a chance to get all the ones you wantThough not as well-clarified as some games, the attributes you select will affect the combat immensely, thus your original build will affect how often you hit and how often enemies are ""saved"" when using force powers. You have the opportunity to really boost your combat in the area of your choice.Cons:EIther boring or constant pausing and tweaking, you don't control the movements, only which attacks/items are usedCombat is very basic, all roll based, your roll plus bonuses - their roll plus bonuses = hit/missThe powers/medical supplies/feats are all in their own scroll menu in combat, MMO style key-binding & self-assigned options would've improved the flow of combat much more. If you try to go for middle ground in your attribute choices, I find that you are all around mediocre in combat rather than balanced.Clumsy combat queue, if you want to use a medi-pac immediately, you have to go into the inventory menu or cancel combat before you select it. Otherwise it will queue, and you or your injured party member will likely die before it is used. The idea is good, because you can switch to other characters and choose their next 3 actions but it wasn't smooth. Gameplay:The graphics are dated now, but still not terriblePlenty of character options available, and an added Jedi/Sith Master Class option at level 15While you can choose any order of planets, after your first playthrough, you'll know better. It is better to do specific orders for the characters you want to become jedi.

Pick it up, and install TSLRCM (The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod) before playing, and it's a masterpiece. When I played this game as a kid, I was kinda upset about the ending and the way the characters felt kinda incomplete and unsettling. The mod clears all that up, fixing the unfixable by implementing the content that was cut to make Lucasarts' absurd Xmas release date. Definitely an experience I'd reccommend to anyone who loves a good story and doesn't mind a few technical inconsistencies			"

												Ten years later KOTOR2 is still one of the high water marks for the Western RPG genre, a flawed, brilliant masterpiece, and a deeply compelling revisionist take on the Star Wars universe. The first two levels are awkwardly-paced by contemporary standards, but the gameplay and narrative are engrossing. Chris Avellone peels back the skin of the Star Wars cosmology and deconstructs notions of morality and examines how people heal themselves - in a universe where an all-powerful Force connects all living things.With the Restored Content Mod you get to engage with KOTOR2 as completely as possible. This is literally the best this classic has been presented in a decade - updated to modern systems and aspect-ratios, mod-friendly and as complete as can be.You owe it to yourself to see the best Star Wars has been since 1983.

												When I was first introduced to KOTOR my friends have told me that it was one of the best RPGs of all time and an instant classic; quite possibly also one of Star Wars best video games. When KOTOR 2 came out my friends told me it was the worst one. Glitchy, terrible graphics, subpar story etc.After a few years I decided to try them out for myself. I hated KOTOR 1 and fell in love with KOTOR 2. I don't think the first one is a bad game, it just didn't click with me. But the second one, is one of my all time favourites. Admittedly I played this with the Restoration Mod (you can find it free in the workshop along with many other mods), but the game is so good.The combat is based on a D20 system reminiscent of D&D, the story is rich and wonderful, the characters have depth and have polarized the community (I think this is a testament to how brilliantly written the characters are), the game will take you to various places around the galaxy to explore and the game gives a Dragon Age:Origins vibe which of course an excellent feeling to the whole gameplay/character progression. To expand upon this point, the game features actions with consequences, lots of dialogue options (hello Fallout 4), companions with their own personalities and how the adapt to the PC actions and behaviours and of course excellent combat.If you haven't played this yet, do yourself a favor and indulge yourself in one of the best games of the past decade. Highly recommended for RPG/Star Wars fans, new and old!			"

Posted: January 23, 2016
												Is Kotor 2 a good game? Many reviewers here have already answered that question (read: YES you bloody meatbags) so I will move onto the follow-up question:Is it better than Kotor 1?Yes.If looked at from a broad perspective Kotor 2 is everything you would get from Kotor 1. Same RPG style. Same Combat system. Same adding more lore than needed. Same running around the bloody galaxy across a set number of planets in order to find a set number of plot devices. Since it's more of the same but more buggy (RCM disregarded) so you'd think that Kotor 1  would be the superior. However, what makes K2 in my eyes a much better game (and perhaps my favorite RPG) is two things:1) The story Don't get me wrong, Bioware has an excellent teams of writers and they've made some fantastic stories but the stories are always very simplistic. You are either the King of All Things Good or the World's Most Respected ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fighting against someone so evil (or more evil than you, if you choose to be the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) it would take a loon to say [obviously evil guy] isn't.  In other words, Kotor follows the Original Star Wars (and nearly every Hero story out there) to the letter. You answer the call to a quest. You mature and grow in strength. You go and defeat the obvious baddie as one of the two archtypes above and save the galaxy. Boom. Roll Credits. Kotor is a hero story with all your Star Wars tropes.Kotor 2 however takes said tropes and subverts them, throws them into fire, beats them to a pulp, and dumps them off into the nearest sun. What is a jedi without the force? Are the jedi really as good and deaaring as they are made out to be be? Or are they a bunch of jackasses? What is really difference between Jedi and Sith other than one likes red and the other a variety of colors? Or are both ideologies silly and just trying to stamp rules on a force (bum dum tsh) that they can barely understand? These questions and more are asked and played in Kotor 2 and they tie in with the overarching plot.Even with the Binary Moral Choice system there is depth. It actually ties in with your character and companions other instead of being something to change the last 30 minutes of the game. You have incentive to what you do. You are a Jedi Exile returning to a galaxy that has (almost) entirely forgotten you. Are you angry at your former masters and wish to gather power to reap vengence upon every last one of them? Or have you accepted (what you consider) your wrongdoings and wish to redeem yourself and forget your past? This small context of backstory adds metric tons worth of depth to your character and growth.TL;DR Kotor 2 manages to create a complex and fullfilling narrative that ties in both gameplay and story.2) It has Heart No really I'm serious. This is also a bit difficult to explain.At first I though this ""heart"" was just nostalgia ,but I realized that Kotor 1 never had this ""umph"", and Kotor 1 was leagues ahead in nostalgia. Kotor 2 is a game that really makes me care about the world, the characters, and the tale it is trying to tell. This is where Kotor 1 failed for me. Your companions have depth and personality beyond there aligned stereotypes. I can give a couple paragraphs about each of them without needing to describe their appearence. The personal interactions you have with each member of your crew gives volumes more impact and detail and emotion. The main quests of each planet made me feel like I was actually having impact on the galaxy. I felt change. After each planet I felt that something was going to happen and I was apart of it. I think this ""Heart"" is Kotor 2 being a much more ""local"" story. You are not trying to uncover some grand mystery that decides the fate of the galaxy. That is just icing on the cake. Kotor 2 is a personal story of your character and a battle with their past demons. You learn more about the Exile as he/she learns more about him/herself. Everything is a lot more quiet and that is the brilliant part of it. A quiet personal story that deals with the remnants of events long past, all trying to push their ends on a galaxy that no longer cares for them. And you are one of them.I picked Kotor (and this game up) out of nostalgia and to see how my views change on the games I played years ago and see how I view them now.Had I been asked which game was better several years ago I would have said Kotor 1 without a second thought. But after some time and returning I have to switch that feeling. Kotor 2 is better. Much better. The RCM makes it fantastic. And I can't stress it enough. As a small note I suggest you play this game with the Restored Content Mod, as it is more of a patch and less of a mod. and is the closest thing we'll (likely) get to a finished game that Obsidian wanted.

												KoToR II is one of those sequels to a game that is just as good, if not, better than the original. In my opinion, you can't choose between the two games. They're both equally masterpieces and due to the short time period between releases, they practically have the same value in terms of gameplay and graphics. What it really comes down to is the story. Which one has the better story? SPOILERS: Is it the first game? The rise and redemption of Revan who has lost his memory and taken on a new life? Or the second game? The story of an exile whom returns to civilization to find out, once and for all, why she was exiled and who is trying to kill her? As I said before, I can't pick between the two. The games are so well done in terms of RPG mechanics, gameplay, story, voice acting (okay, maybe the voice acting wasn't that amazing) and animation in certain areas.The RPG mechanics is pre whatever we have now. It's a mixture of real time and having the ability to pause the game to plan out your course of attack. The people who updated KoToR II managed to implement the Steam controller, which, in this case, works just like a 360 controller. So it was less of a point and click situation and more so scrolling through the enemies before un pausing the game to continue the attack, if that makes sense. The game ran perfectly, no issues in any areas. The graphics are from 2004 or something, so it's not exactly pretty. At least the levels were really diverse and nothing was repetitive at all. The audio design, of course, was stellar. From the soundtrack to the sound foliage, it's just really well done.Probably the greatest highlight in any Bioware (in this case, Obsidian) game are the characters. As I already pointed out, Obsidian did this one, but it's the sequel to a Bioware game. Bioware always sets a standard when gathering companions and what their perks are and how they interact with the player character during certain random events and whatnot. Each of the characters are unique and have their own unique sets of dialog in various situations, it's what's so remarkable about RPG games such as this. No other developer really goes that far and beyond to create such a wide and diverse set of characters that the player can bring along on their adventure.Really, a great game. A masterpiece. Brilliant ending, too. It really should have led the way for a third game, but instead, we got that MMO. Still waiting on KoToR III Bioware or Obsidian!10/10			"

												I remember disliking this game the first time I played it.Compared to the first Knights of the Old Republic game, it was a major tone shift and didn't evolve gameplay enough to justify it as a proper sequal.  It doesn't have a plot twist like KOTOR 1, and I was quick to deem it a wasted oppertunity.Now after replaying it a few years later, I've completely changed my mind.This game is darker, more mature than KOTOR 1.  The characters have all suffered at the hands of the Force in one way or another, and the Jedi aren't just the good guys.  There's moral complexity in the plot.  Sadly this muddled morality doesn't really factor into gameplay, but the story is great.It is carried almost completely through characters and their dialogue.  Everyone is flawed in some way, and it makes things a lot more interesting.In terms of gameplay, it just uses KOTOR's system with a few more upgrades and weapons.  Force powers make things more interesting.Where KOTOR 2 really shines is with the graphic upgrades and score.  The game has aged really well, thanks in big part to the fantastic modding community now available with the Steam Workshop.That being said, the game feels unfinished unless you install the Restored Content mod.  It's critical to letting this game pack the biggest punch.  It makes an incomplete game feel whole, and the extra battles are fantastic and a delight to returning players who felt short changed.Overall, I recommend KOTOR 2 to people who liked KOTOR 1, because things aren't so simply good and evil.  Everyone is in the middle to some degree.  It's just a shame that the moral choice system doesn't really factor that, as the influence system can make every character 100% good or evil while they're really not.			"

												I could drone on about the stellar story, the magnificient environments and how great of an RPG this game truly is, especially with the restored content mod, but it'd be better if I phrased the game like this. This game is a MUST buy for any Star Wars fan, and a SHOULD buy for any fan of RPG's, and stories so deep that it'll leave a permanent grip on your heart as it has mine.I first played this game as a young, young boy, but even know it is still a permanent inclusion on my computer, and parts of the soundtrack from both games are favorites on my Youtube account. This game somehow manages to explore the idea of good and evil, light and dark, and truly make you think about everything in between. The characters are amazing, with returning cast as well as new, in-depth companions that all have their own opinions and goals. Characters well-rounded enough to match Bioware's Mass Effect 2, and 3. I may be biased because of the effect this game has had on my childhood and my view on games in general, but I am very passionate about the KotOR games.Just buy it. Play it. If you're not gripped by an engrossing story, you'll enjoy the fun combat and witty companions that accompany you on vastly different planets, and the vast range of force abilities at your disposal. The Content Restoration mod is a MUST HAVE to enjoy the full potential of this game.Visas Marr is waifu.			"

												I highly recommend this game, it has what is in my opinion the best story out of any game I've ever played. If you have never played this and decide to get it, keep these things in mind: The game is super old, and not everything it does has held up over the years.The game was released unfinished and unpolished, so it is *highly* suggested that before you even start the game for the first time you download the Restored Content mod. Due to the age of the game, don't expect the most amazing graphics ever.This is the type of game that will expect you to occasionally solve fairly challenging puzzles and will *not* hold your hand through some of the more challenging areas. As thus, don't be afraid to reference guides if you get stuckThere are occasionally game breaking bugs, but those are super rare and generally very easy to fix. With that, I hope you enjoy the game.			"

												I bought both SWKOTOR 1 and 2 yesterday as I had a hankering to return to these games after not playing them for many many years. I installed part 1 and began to play, but with no native controller support and graphics that haven't aged so well (not to mention the HD resolutions are low), I uninstalled it and installed part 2 (As it was upgraded to 4k res and has controller support.)I haven't been dissapointed. Great game just like I remembered and well worth the discount price. I still give it a 9/10 after all these years. And don't get me wrong, I recommend the first game as well, especially if you never played it. The story in these games (and the writing) is top notch.Oh, I also installed the restored content mod. So far no problems, and it comes recommended as well ;)			"

												Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II - The Sith Lords is a game originally developed by Obsidian entertainment. The game release back in 2004 was riddled with missing gaps, as the game was rushed out and lots of intentional game implementations never made it on release. Fortunately, the TSLRCM (The Sith Lords Restoration Content Mod) brings back the missing spots, thanks to the fact most of the ""cut content"" was found in the game files. This game came out on Steam not too long ago, and initially it got bad reviews for having a lack of up-to-date support on Steam, thus leaving people on their own to figure out how to run the game. Fortunately, eventually some developers came in and actually fixed the game with a nice patch. Aspyr Media, being the bros that they are; developed a Linux port for this game which I must say; is phenomenal. Not only did they port this game, but it runs fantastic; but there is no surprise there with a 11 year old game. Still, I am impressed they chose to take this older game and port it. With TSLRC Mod added through Steam Workshop, this game is even BETTER than it was when I first played it back in 2004. The graphics show their age, but there are some mods around the corner that look like they are trying to upgrade the lower end graphics. I am simply blown away that this game was taken and given a nice update on steam as well as workshop integration featuring some really nice mods. The windows side works great too, but now I am playing it on Linux and I am loving it too on Linux! One simply does not play this game without including the TSLRCM, that completes it. 8.5/10.0 - Amazing revitalization of a older game. The Ithorians who are restoring Telos would be proud. Now I would love to see the first Knights of the Old Republic ported over to Linux, with full workshop support!			"

												Amazing complement to the first game.  Whereas the first game has a very ""New Hope"" kind of feel to it; a very classic Star Wars type heroic tale of galatic grandeur, this game delves into the more personal and darker elements of the Star Wars universe.  Character development is extremely thorough and integral to the story, along with the tremendous focus on party member relations.  Improves on all fronts.  Easily a top five pick for me.  Worth $10, but sometimes it goes on sale for as low as $5 or $2.50.  At that rate, there's no reason not to put it on your wishlist.			"

												TL;DR: Prepare to become the hobbit that sits in their mothers basement, making calls for buckets to put excrement in, as you will refuse to get up and go to the bathroom. 10/10 would♥♥♥♥♥♥my pants again. Very much the same type of game as Dragon Age: Origins. Turn based strategy rpg, so if you don't like tactical games where you have to think about your every move, this is not the game for you. As long as you don't have a brick for a computer, anything should be able to run this game fairly smoothly.I have completed KOTOR1 on both the Xbox, and on PC (though it is not in my steam library). And I must say this game stands up to its predecessor very well. You will want to get the Restored Content Mod from the Workshop as this adds much more to the game. With the most recent steam update, you can play in larger resolutions. There is no reason not to purchase this game as well as the original. You will find yourself lost in the story, gameplay, and much more. There is much replay value, you will never make the same choices as you did the previous play through, as there is a Karma system (Light Side & Dark Side). Become a Jedi, or Sith Lord? The choice is yours.Please do yourself a favor and buy these (As they're both currently on sale for $2.49 each! What a steal for 20+ hours of gameplay for each game, not including the Restored Content + other mods)			"

												Obsidian Entertainment's follow-up to Knights of the Old Republic, this volume deals with the Jedi Exile. Five years have passed since the end of the Jedi Civil War in 3956 BBY. A new group of Sith, the Sith Triumverate has appeared and have nearly extinguished the Jedi. You wake up on the Peragus Mining Facility and have to escape as a new threat arrives: Darth Sion, a Sith Lord whose hate and anger allow him to surpass death...Featuring a slew of characters that are almost as iconic as those in the first KotOR (as well as two returning companions, one the very iconic HK-47), KotOR II is a classic. This version is slightly revamped, ridding it of many bugs the original had. As you play as the Exile, will you save the galaxy or doom it?My playtime is a little low compared to how much I've actually played. That is because of two factors. First, most of the time I played off-line, before they added achievements. Second, I also played this game before I found it on Steam, so...			"

												One of my FAVORITE RPGs ever with the restored content mod. Seriously, like, Planescape good. Pick it up, and install TSLRCM (The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod) before playing, and it's a masterpiece. When I played this game as a kid, I was kinda upset about the ending and the way the characters felt kinda incomplete and unsettling. The mod clears all that up, fixing the unfixable by implementing the content that was cut to make Lucasarts' absurd Xmas release date. Definitely an experience I'd reccommend to anyone who loves a good story and doesn't mind a few technical inconsistencies			"

												SW:KOTOR 2 is an RPG game Developed by Obsidian Entertainment. The game takes place  a few years after the events of KOTOR 1 after Revan defeated Malak and saved the galaxy. But now after departed deep into the outer rim of the galaxy, a bunch of Sith Lords, have appeared and have almost completly destoryed the Jedi order and the remaining Jedi Masters are into hiding. You play as a male or female Jedi Exile which you learn later into the game about why you were exiled from the Jedi Order. After escaping a Mine Fuel facuilty (Either by blowing it up and evading a sith ship) you head to a orbiting facilty above a planet called Telos. After being imprisoned and captured by them you find out the ship you traveled in, the Ebon Hawk has been stolen. After helping a light or dark side corporation and meeting a soldier that knows your character, you travel to many places into the planet until you get your ship back after finding out a Jedi Master lives in a acdemy in a polar region of the planet. After a companion gets the data base at the academy you find out why, your charcter was exiled and leaves you between two roads: Do you gather up the rest of the Masters to help you fight the sith, or do you join the sith and hunt down and kill the Jedi Masters?The companions you meet are all cool and deep. They all have secrets behind them which you have to get them to trust you to find out. Some of them you may not enjoy (like a stupid robot that is a jerk), but alot of them are fun to talk too, a few of them were in KOTOR 1 that make a return like T3-M4 and HK-47.One of the highlights of this game is the Light and Dark side paths. Through multiple parts of the game you sometimes given a choice such as kill an innocent by raiding his house then kill him as he returns (Dark Side) or saving someone from mercneary thugs (Light Side).The gameplay is a turn base or real time action (Can be chosen through menu) game. The game has powers that are ran by a 1d20 system. I'm stupid so I don't know much about the system but if you know stuff from Dungeons & Dragons you might understand it. The level cap is to belive is 30 but that doesnt mean its easy and should be taken lightly. Like how Fallout 3 and NV take a while so does this. This also means you want to spend Attributes when making a character very carefully as messing up might make it harder to clear the game. For example: putting alot of points into Constitution and Intelligence might give alot of VP and skill points to use, but at the cost of FP (force points) which might make it harder for you to use force powers.OVerall KOTOR 2 is a fun game, with it just getting workshop, people can get the restored content mod and get the true and perhaps best parts of the game. Problem is sometimes that game can be difficult with what planets you decide to visit and there are some annoying puzzles. I find the 10$ to be worth it but if you would like try to get it during a sale...This game gets a 9/10 - A fun and amazing game but with some minors problems.			"

												Finally, the game is working on Windows 7 and 8.x (at least it does if you have an Nvidia graphics card). A much darker, in-depth storyline compared to the first KOTOR and if you install the Restored Content mod, many of the bugs are fixed and a lot of the cut scenes are brought back, making the story far less disjointed. An excellent sequel to KOTOR (and coming from someone who hates sequels, that's high praise!) that's well worth the low asking price.			"

												Let's start with the bad: What you heard is true. The game is BUGGY. I mean very very buggy. Before you go, install the latest version of The Sith Lord Content Restore Mod (TSLCRM). It fixed a lot of bugs and restored some content that was not presented in the game because Obsidian rushed the game to the market. Yet, the game still feels unpolished. SIde quests may be bugged out, your characters will be randomly stuck in odd locations, and the companion AI is very dumb. If you can standl the bugged out quests in your journal and all the other weird bugs you may encounter, Kotor 2 is a very unique Star Wars and RPG experience. The story did not take the straightfoward good-defeat-evil cliche like in the first game, instead, it is very deep. I think it's probably one of the best Star Wars story out there. It also looks very cinematic. Some camera moves during cutscenes are very well done. The ending is left to be desired however. Gameplaywise, the game is pretty much the same with the first one with some new skills and combat animation. You can mess around with almost all the items. If you played the first Kotor or other DND games like Dragon Age, you won't take too much time to get your hands on.To be concluded, it's a very good game. Buggy, but still good. I will give it an 8.5/10.			"

												My favorite RPG of all time.Before you play, I recomend downloading the RCM(Restored content mod). Alot of content was cut from the game because it was rushed for a christmas relise, but they left the files in the games folders for the modders to make use of. This mod does just that: make use of it.Amazing game. Limitless hours of gameplay.Everytime you play, its a little different. Weather you chose light side or dark side, Male or Female, or even say ""I will not kill you"" instead of ""You deserve to die"", could change the rest of the game.Tons of levels and powers to unlock. I did almost all of the side quests and I still dont have everything.Fly aboard the legendary Ebon Hawk across 7 different planets(including the final planet), from the fuel rock of Peragus II to the cesspool of Nar Shaddaa.Without the mod I give it a 7/10With the mod its a full 10/10.

												One of the best Star Wars RPG's i've ever played. On par with the first KOTOR, this sequel takes place 5 years after the events of KOTOR 1 and are an extension of the great sith war taking place 4000 years before the Battle of Yavin and the destruction of the empire's ultimate weapon. The story follows a jedi exile, canonically a female, however a choice of male doesn't affect the storyline in any way besides dialogue options, and is a story of loss, betrayal, ardousness and above all redemption. From amazing scenery, to great weapons and an addictive turn based combat system with pause features, this game is one of the most enjoyable from bioware and an integral part of the star wars canon of the Old Republic days. It isn't the graphically advanced games of new, but this in my opinion is the last requisite on a list to enjoy this game. Amazingly done voice acting, dialogue is on point, fantastic environmental work and just a great RPG game that really makes you feel like the hero, or villian if you want to be. choose your path, paragon in action, or a devil in disguise, you play as jedi or sith, be aware that each choice has repurcussions! and the fate of the galaxy will once again rest on your shoulders. An exceptionally made game, easily a 9/10 and even a 10. Would buy it for any price, and would suggest playing the first to grasp the entirety of the plot and story linearity, however is not required. Great game and an absolute Star Wars iconocism.			"

												Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II is a sequel to the first PC RPG game set in the Star Wars universe. Its action takes place roughly five years after the events presented in the previous episode. Since both of the games are nearly identical, most of the points mentioned in my previous review are valid.The protagonist is a Jedi casted out of the Jedi Order for following Revan in the Mandalorian Wars. As a result, the player no longer can play as a Scoundrel, Scout, or Soldier. Instead, one can choose to start as a Jedi Guardian, Jedi Consular, or Jedi Sentinel. Later on, there is an option to choose a prestige class*. There are six of them: Jedi Weapon Master/Sith Marauder, Jedi Watchman/Sith Assassin, or Jedi Master/Sith Lord.The gameplay has not changed much. Everything that we love about the original is there, along with a few additions and improvements. More skills, powers, weapons, items, upgrades, Force points (it's easier to change the alignment), and so on.  Interaction with companions have been taken to a new level (influence points), inventory has been improved, two switchable weapon loadouts have been added, et cetera. Now one can also craft items. Speaking of changes, the atmosphere is gloomier. I would even say that the whole game is more mature – the line between good and evil is blurred.Amongst the things which have remained the same are... bugs and glitches. They are back and strike fiercely. This time, I have encountered a gamebreaking error which resulted in having to load my previous save and replay the whole location. You bet I was not content...In conclusion, this is a textbook of how sequels should be made – this game just feels like home.*As far as I know, you cannot choose one if you're neutral (which is a shame).EDIT: Due to the July update, this game has steam cloud support and achievements.P.S.

												8/10Obsidian, the king of sequels! Known not only for the sequel to KotOR, but also the sequels to Fallout 3, and Neverwinter Nights, and also making the 3rd Dungeon Siege game. One thing we can learn from these guys track record is that while they will sometimes make a decent engine seem a lot more buggy, they have a good ability to craft an even better story than their predecessors (most of the time). And that is no different in KotOR 2. Taking the ball that Bioware handed off, and running full force with it, Obsidian brings players back to the world of the old Republic, and puts them back in the role of a Jedi, and his or her team as they battle the evil forces of the dark side, or ultimately succumb to it. More so in this game than its predecessor, you actually feel the changes in your choices having an impact on your entire team, and people you meet.  You can be the good jedi, following the righteous path and helping those in need. You can go straight evil, and fell those who get in your way despite being good natured. You can be sneaky and devious, neutral, or whatever you wish. Most dialogue paths have a good number of options to change the outcomes. Ultimately though, it either leads to a gain in light or dark side points, or nothing at all. So play it how you want!KotOR 2 is a team based RPG adventure game, with 3D visuals, and battles happening in real time, with a mix of turn based elements that use the age old 'dice rules' method for any moves you may choose to dish out to your foes in the heat of battle. You see enemies, you choose your moves. You can also switch between one of the 3 currently chosen party characters at will at any time, during and out of battle to strategize. And over the course of the game, you will find a number of teammates to accompany you on your adventure. Some required for the adventure, and some can tag along based on choices you make. Like in most RPGs, you can gain new skills and abilities by leveling up. Speaking of which, the level cap from KotOR 1 has not been rasied, but rather, removed!Rather than taking place on 1 world, like in most RPGs, KotOR 2 will have you venturing across many different planets on your journey. Aside from a lengthy first few areas, the game opens up into something grand and open ended after about the 3 or 4 hour mark, with several planets to explore. You will travel from planet to planet on your ship, the Ebon Hawk, which is also where can converse with your entire team. Once on a planets surface, feel free to explore the locals. Shop, talk to people. Do side quests. And more! There are a few mini games even to be found in the game, including a card game, and a sort of pod racing mini game. While there is a lot to be said positvely about KotOR 2, it is not without its faults. The game is still a bit buggy, but not as much as when it first came out. Animations can be a little off when interacting with objects. Characters can get still get stuck. Sometimes characters will stand in odd places when conversing, and more. Also, there is little adjusting for graphical settings. You will pretty much need to mod the game if you want to play it at your monitors resolution. It can be a hassle, but it is easily done with the right tools, and very much worth it. Modded, KotOR 2 looks a helluva lot better than what I remembered playing many years ago. Bottom line, if you are a Star Wars, or an RPG fan, you owe it to yourself to pick up one of the games that helped pave the way for games like Mass Effect. Buy this game!			"

												Huge fan of the first game when it came out and I've completed it more times than I can remember. I got this game in January 2015 hoping it to be as good as the original.I was not disappointed.Its  fantastic game that you can repeat over and over again and it doesn't get boring. Each time you play you discover a new challenge, extra interactions with characters, new possibilities and new gear. Whether you start as a grey jedi, dark or jedi the possibilities are endless.If you enjoy RPGs and strategy games then this is perfect for you- the best thing is, is that you don't need to know much if anything about the first game or Star Wars in general to play.Great game!

												A good sequel to a great game. It improves on the first game in many ways, but was held back by a rushed development (missing content) and buggy release. This can easily be fixed by using the restoration mod - available on the Steam workshop for easy install.Put these things aside and you will still find the game to be amazingly good fun. This and it's prequel are two of the best Star Wars games ever made. Scratch that, they are two of the best games ever made, period. A real shame that we don't get to see more of this kind of genius these days. The new MMO ""The Old Republic"" can't hold a torch to this classic.Jimbo Rating: 9/10			"

												This is an amazing game, but it was rushed to be released and so it has many game-breaking issues. To fix these issues, and add the content that was intented to be in the game, I reccomend downloading the TSLCRM mod and the M4-78 mod. Those are the only ""mandatory mods"", so after that you can get any other ones, provided they're compatible. This game picks up a bit after where the last one left off, so I'd reccomend playing that one first.STORY (Minor spoilers)[Canonically, the protagonist is a human female named Meetra Surik]You play as the Exile/Meetra Surik, a former Jedi who fought in the Mandalorian wars under Revan(The first game's protagonist). However, the Exile, like her name suggests, was exiled from the Jedi Order for going against them by leaving with Revan. This is just the Exile's backstory, as the game picks up on Telos, a space station that is barely functioning and soon going to explode. The Exile must escape the station and return to her ship with the help of 3 companions you find along the way. After that, depending on whether you want to play as a good little Jedi, or an evil Sith, you will try to find all of the leftover Jedi to get their help and find out why you were exiled, or to murder them all, with the help of 9 companions you find scattered around the galaxy.Pros+ Interesting, suprising ending based on your choices in the game+Solid, tactical gameplay.+ Not just an open world, an OPEN GALAXY+ Each companion has a rich backstory and companions are actually very useful+ Detailed crafting and upgrading systems+ Great replayability+ Filled with great Star Wars lore+ Your actions affect the entire galaxy and many of the people in it, including your companions+ Prestige classes change things up early/mid-game+ YOU CAN TURN YOUR COMPANIONS INTO JEDI OR DARK JEDI!+ When you reach end-game, you will be god-like with your force powers; On my way to the final area, I was clearing rooms with just one shot of Force Storm. Cons- Dated graphics- Game breaking glitches are present without proper fixes- Dialogue can be strange and confusing at times- In many cases your quests will fail to update or you'll be clueless on where to go- Some game-breaking glitches can be exploited and make the game too easy- Game rarely presents the player with a challenge Mixed-/+ Forced to use certain companions at timesFinal RatingThis game is a solid 9/10 for me. The game is NOT perfect because of the heavy amount of glitches present, yet the gameplay and story make up for it. I reccomend this game for ANY Star Wars fan or RPG fan.

												Rating 7.5/10Note: I played with the restoration mod. It is HIGHLY recommended that you play with this mod as it fixes a lot of bugs/glitches as well as restore lost content. It brings the game closer to the original intentions of the developers  The Good:+ The game has a lot of robust options in how you build your character. You start by choosing between 3 classes: Guardian, Consular or Sentinel. Each class obviously focuses on different aspects of combat. Further in the game you can then further specialize your classes. You can fully customize your character how you wish between attributes, skills, feats and Jedi powers. All of this leads to many different options and replayability in how you design your character+ The core aspect of the game is that as you can either play as a Jedi that is good or evil. Saving people, being kind and choosing the peaceful solution leads you to the light side while doing the opposite leads you to the dark side. Doing so leads to certain bonuses to your Jedi Powers. Being good means Light side powers will use less mana and dark side powers cost more and vice versa. I find the system to be very effective because it ties morality choices into game play, a feature that seems to be very lacking in today's modern games. + The second core aspect is how you respond and handle situations with your party members. You can gain or lose influence with them. If you gain enough influence with any particular party member, new dialogue options open up resulting in more background to the story, and/or stat increases for you or your party member. It is not mandatory as you can easily complete the game without gaining any influence with anybody but it adds a nice touch to the game and offers more options. + The story, although confusing in the beginning because it throws so much at you does get increasingly better. The story is presented very well because of the great dialogue options and fantastic writing. Obsidian is easily one of the best in the industry regarding writing. + If there is any company that can match or exceed Bioware in writing for npc characters its Obsidian. Every party member that joins you in your quest is well written and interesting. Every party member has alternative motives for joining you which makes things more exciting and not every party member gets along with each other. These ideas are explored the further you progress in the game.  + Every planet you visit feels different. The game throws a few twists in for good measure to keep things fresh. + Well written Side Quests+ modsThe Average:Sadly there was no improvement with combat. The combat in the game is really showing its age. I never particularly liked the combat because it's not very engaging. Certain force powers, skills, feats are game breaking while others are completely useless. The Bad:- The UI especially navigating to find items in your inventory is a chore and frustrating. The inventory screen is a long list of your items. There are options to filter the list based on specific items but this doesn't fix the overall problem of a bad overall inventory management system.  - The game forces you to do solo missions either as yourself or one of your party members. These sections are frustrating and awful only because the combat was never designed around solo play. This problem is further compounded if you auto-leveled up any of your party members. Playing a solo section with a party member that has all the wrong attributes/skills/feats is painful. - Last few areas have cut and paste environments. Obvious that development was rushed at the end.  ConclusionA worthy follow up to one of the best RPG's for its time. Obsidian once again shows that it is one of the best when it comes to writing a great story with great characters. It's sad that it takes a mod to fix a lot of the problems with the game. If you loved the first game then there is no reason not to love this one as well.  "

												Preface: I used the Restored Content Mod while playing this game.  KotOR 2, this time brought to us by Obsidian Entertainment, at first glance appears to be its predecessor's hotter, younger cousin.  There are many fixes to complaints I had for the first game: better menu system (inventory management still needs work), cleaner, faster, better looking, containers show if they're empty, datapads are read automatically, even walking in spacesuits is faster (although it looks funny, seems they just upped the animation speed).  There are more force powers to use, cool special character abilities, and there's better rollplaying since there are a lot more options to what you can do.  For example if your level in Treat Injury is high then more dialogue options open up for you allowing you to truly play the game how you want!  Or...it actually doesn't.  This game was *extremely* aggravating at times.  Once again the designers felt like it was a good idea to throw you into 1v1 duels, so the belief that you could actually roleplay was a mere fantasy that is ripped from your fingers less than a quarter through the game.  To make it worse, there are sections where there are *unskippable cutscenes* right before duels.  This is the biggest pain ever, especially if you're already getting annoyed at the required 1v1 battles you go through.  I would highly recommend ignoring anything but force and battle prowess (melee too, blasters blow), not only for your main character, but for *all* of your characters.  That's right!  It wasn't bad enough making your main character duel, now a large portion of your companions have to do battles (or even entire segments of the game - ie long dungeons) by themselves.  The worst offender of this has to be the HK factory, where you're expected to use HK-47 against an army of droids.  It was terrible, I literally *could not* play through that section the way I built my HK-47.  It made me feel as if I was playing ""wrong"".  No game should have that effect, *especially* an RPG.  Luckily this game has a console that you can enable because that was the only way to struggle through that section of the game.  As if this complaint wasn't bad enough, the *most important* part of an RPG, the storytelling, wasn't very good.  I enjoyed the journey of the original much more than I did in KotOR 2.  Even *with* the rcm I felt like some of the character's backstories were done halfway through the game and the plot and storytelling was convoluted to put it lightly.  Your companions *attack* each other, seemingly without consequence at times.  It was confusing and distracting.  And the ending straight up sucked.  It was literally dialogue choices, and this is coming from a guy who didn't mind Deus Ex: HR's ending.This game didn't just need a restored content mod, it needed a drastic overhaul, fix, and rewrite - that's the only reason I can recommend this game - the modding community.  It's really big, even to this day.  The RCM is the tip of the iceberg, and if you didn't like the way the game did something you can probably fix it.Pros:ModsUpgraded EngineT3-M4 has a personailty now!Cons:StorytellingBuggyGameplayHK-47's personailty sucks now!This game really disappointed me.  It had so much potential but fell flat on its face.  I recommend it if you like getting your hands dirty with mods as that's the only redeeming factor KotOR 2 has.  If you're looking for a good sci-fi RPG play the Mass Effect series instead - and I *like* Star Wars. B			"

The actual gameplay is great, but it is buggy, very buggy, because this was a rushed christmas release. This also means that there are segments of the story that were cut, in order to experience them you can download the mod TSLRCM (The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod), but even then you may still have issues with bugs and glitches. All and all, however, this is a great game.			"

												Both a massive improvement and a massive disappointment over the first KotOR, this is, unfortunately, another one of Obsidian's rushed games. Through no fault of their own they were forced to release an unfinished game, leaving us with some plotlines that didn't go anywhere and quite a few bugs. Although Obsidian were denied the chance to fix their game through patches by Lucasarts, modders went to work on restoring a lot of cut content and fixing bugs. I waited for a lot of years and saw a couple projects dissolve, but eventually one came out and it's pretty great. I would recommend playing with The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod (TSLRCM) on a first playthrough, as without it you may be left with sour disappointment in some aspects of the game.http://www.moddb.com/mods/the-sith-lords-restored-content-mod-tslrcmOn that page there's also the planet M4-78 which was cut from the game entirely. You can try it out but I personally did not like it very much. Even on a modern machine I ran into performance issues, and it felt awkward and long. I wouldn't recommend it for a first playthrough.

												I originally got this game shortly after release (4 cds!) and it was a terrible disappointment; bugs, incomplete plot, a mess of unfished quests, etc. However, through the magic of modding, these issues have been mostly cleaned up and the result is an amazing game.Lots of quests, choices that make impacts, and roleplaying to be had here. I'd even say that, mechanics wise, it is better than the first due to the new prestige classes, better ability to influence party members, and crafting. It's at least as good since they haven't really changed much else.The story is weaker than the first game though, with no great twists or anything. Well, there are one or two, but they are either painfully obvious or lack any prior hints to give them any real punch.Still, with the Restored Content mod, it'll offer 25-30 hours of great gameplay per playthrough and you'll likely want to play it twice to see all the light and dark side choices.A word of warning to any Windows 7, Vista and 8 users, make sure you check the forum for help getting the game to run... and don't be surprised if you're stuck playing it in windowed mode.

												This game is quite possibly one of the best RPGs that I have ever played. Once you get a hang of the game, as in what to do when, and where,  it becomes a bit easier than you would expect it to be, however there are often bosses that will throw you off of your game every once in a while. Since the game takes 5 years after the original KotOR it is recomended that you play the first one in order to get the 'full effect' of the story. All in all, this game is definitley worth your money if you are an avid RPG lover, Star Wars Lover, or just a person looking for a good gaming experience.			"

												KotORII:TSL is a phenomenal game. Seriously. If you're even bothering to read this you probably already know you want the game. It's like KotOR, but with a bigger and better story, and it stood the test of time much better. (Player KotOR on a modern system is more aggravating than playing TSL on a modern system.) The only thing I have to say is that the game was extremely rushed through development and was released with a lot of bugs. So you should get TSLRCM (The Sith Lords Restored Conent Mod) before you start. It's basically a mod that put back in content that was blocked out because of the rushed release, and fixes a lot of the bugs.			"

												The better of the 2 Knights of the Old Republic game.But only because this has a darker more adult storyline to it.I know EA and Bioware say the canon version is to play a female character in this but dont beleive it for a second.This game makes a ton more sense and has a ton more interaction when you play a male character (dont want to spoil it but a key figure in the storyline only joins your team if you play male character).I have not tried the content patch that fills in all the missing content as Lucas Arts rushed Obsidian to release this originally, but even the content lite version was a excellent game. I strongly recommend people purchase and play this game and dont take just my word for it, judge for yourself and play the male and female character through. You will see how expanded part of the story is as a male character and how empty it feels  when that content missing from the female storyline.			"

												If you're a fan of any type of RPG - Star Wars or not - I guarantee that you'll love Knights of the Old Republic 2. It's execution is very simple yet very effective, something games tend to miss these days; being too complex for the sake of complexity. The storyline (while a little cliche) is extremely well written and thought out, revealing itself slowly to the character as they make their own choices through the game. Characters like Atton Rand and especially Kreia have very deep and rich backstories that not only add to the fantastic story and atmosphere to the game, but will also change depending on what you do in the game. Depending on the choices you make, some characters will favor you while others will not. For example, if you decide to execute a criminal, one character might applaud you for such an action while another will disapprove. All these choices affect how much information you can gather from them during your playtime.The combat is simple, and if you've played the original Knights of the Old Republic, you know exactly what to expect. This is not a bad thing, however. If you enjoy pause/point-and-click combat, then you have nothing to worry about.Keep in mind, this game was released in 2005, so the graphics aren't going to be hyper-realistic and since the game was rushed during development constrictions, content WAS cut from the final release. That being said, there was a fan-made mod that actually restored all the lost content - You can find it with a simple google search: ""KOTOR 2 TSLRCM""Had this game been given the time it deserved for development, it would have been WIDELY recognized as one of the best RPG's ever made. Nonetheless, Obsidian Entertainment did a fantastic job taking the reigns from Bioware, and formed a story that was ten-times more interesting and engaging than the first game, introducing rich characters - both fearsome and loving - and bringing moral choices that sculpt your very adventure. Do NOT miss this game - It's worth your time.9/10			"

												At this point, if you are looking at this page you doubtlessly know about KotOR 2's reputation for being buggy and incomplete. Just to make sure you know: this wasn't the studio's fault - LucasArts gave them less than half the time they actually needed to finish the game. Still, a review isn't about what something could have been but rather, what something is.If you liked KotOR 1, KotOR 2 is more of that but refined, enhanced, and... admittedly, yes, buggier. However, the bugs (in general) are rarely crippling and the more serious ones tend to be both not universally experienced, and tend to only occur in side missions (like swoop racing). As for gameplay, combat is streamlined while still providing plenty of options for variety what with blasters, lightsabers, Force powers, and special attacks. Feats, equipment and their myriad upgrades, and to a lesser degree skills allow for crazy amounts of customization while remaining simple enough to easily understand.The story is really where KotOR 2 shines through, though. As mentioned before, the game was a rushed job and much had to get cut at the last moment, however aside from the final stretch most missing plot threads are in the minor side quests and are only missing the very end that some may not even notice. Dialogue is natural and is one of the few examples where dialogue trees actually work well. Very little exposition (if any at all) is given straight through endless monologues, but is woven in from bits and pieces grasped from various characters (including the main - no amnesiacs here) including some who outright lie (and well, might I add)! Every playable character is well characterized with great personalities and motivations that are believeable enough not to make us question why they hate everyone else on the ship stick to the main character regardless (except maybe Visas...)This game is also much darker than it's predecessor. It's enough that whether you liked or were simply lukewarm towards the original Star Wars trilogy of movies while the new trilogy left you cold, you are practically guaranteed to appreciate this game. On the other hand, if you really liked all of the Star Wars movies you may find the departure from the standard too much for your tastes. Honestly, despite the lightsabers and Jedi, there are points when KotOR 2 almost doesn't even feel like Star Wars (which I actually liked, to be honest).One last thing that is worth mentioning - while a significant portion of the game was unfinished at the time of its release, a group of fans have been digging up the not-quite-removed game files, finishing them up, and reconnecting them to the game. It is very well done (particularly for a group of fans digging through broken scraps), adds much to the game, and helps fill in most of the holes in the story. Just search for The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod.			"

												Wow! If you played the original version of KOTR 2 you are going to love this. I played it when it came out on the Xbox and loved it and the first one and I have them both now for PC on Steam (duh!) and KOTR 2 has gotten such sweet love with the restored content mod (in the Steam Workshop) and added controler support (Xbox 360) and increased the graphics that it is *almost* like a new game. Everything is here, the graphics, the sound, the story. It is just amazing how much love the community has given this game. I wish they would do the first KOTR like this but if you are trying to decide between the two then I have to say get KOTR 2 and ""May the Force be with you.""			"

												When it comes down to it, this is simply the best Star Wars story ever written. Mainly, because of it's break from the usual ""the Jedi are perfect and always right"". Of course, it is well known for being buggy and being produced and pushed out so quickly. Obsidian cut too much from the final product if you ask me but there are tons of mods out there for this game. From fixing such annoying bugs to unlocking entire new planets for you to explore. And don't let the hours fool you, I've played this a dozen times on console before I got my PC. Also recommend playing the first one as this game takes place 5 years after the first. Overall, I love this game, because of the story, the companions, and Kreia. And if you can get past the bugginess, I have no doubt you'll love it as well.			"

												The better of the 2 Knights of the Old Republic game.But only because this has a darker more adult storyline to it.I know EA and Bioware say the canon version is to play a female character in this but dont beleive it for a second.This game makes a ton more sense and has a ton more interaction when you play a male character (dont want to spoil it but a key figure in the storyline only joins your team if you play male character).I have not tried the content patch that fills in all the missing content as Lucas Arts rushed Obsidian to release this originally, but even the content lite version was a excellent game. I strongly recommend people purchase and play this game and dont take just my word for it, judge for yourself and play the male and female character through. You will see how expanded part of the story is as a male character and how empty it feels  when that content missing from the female storyline.			"

												Infamously incomplete, the darker tone and feel of KOTOR 2, sequel to the lauded KOTOR, was met with acclaim and almost consistent ""What if...?"" scenarios.  With the help of some dedicated modders that question has been answered, and the end result is (still) one of the most developed and worthwhile romps through the Star Wars universe.  Where the first game in the technically three part series (if you include The Old Republic; I don't) focused on a Sith Lord of unrivaled strength and he intrigue that followed, KOTOR 2 breaks the mold by casting you as a fallen Jedi of, as many describe him or her, unremarkable attribute.  But as the story unfolds, and their connection with the Force is restored/rebuilt, a dark plot begins to reveal itself.  In many ways this game outshines its predecessor, and it explores an interesting question of how a Jedi would respond after willingly giving up their power.  Some parts drag on, some characters are easy to forget, but that's really in the minority.  Pitch perfect voice acting, dark themes and tones, expansive environments and a few welcome cameos make this game a terrific addition to the lore that is Star Wars.			"

												It's not as ""big"" as the first game. It doesn't have the classic Star Wars feel. But if I'm being honest, KOTOR 2 is my favorite of the series -- specifically BECAUSE it doesn't fit nicely into the themes of the Star Wars universe. In most Star Wars games, there is a sharp and clear divide between the dark side and light side. You are good, or you are bad. Not so with this story. KOTOR 2 takes every preconception we had about the Force and subverts it. Most characters fall into shades of gray. There are dark Jedi with kind souls. Charming rogues with murderous pasts. Gentle heroes who committed unspeakable acts of violence. To be inherently evil is destructive, but to be inherently good can indirectly harm others in the long run. The game completely challenges the notion of ""light"" and ""dark."" You may rack up more light side points than Luke Skywalker himself, but there are consequences for being too nice -- your actions will always been questioned.The gameplay is essentially the same as the first title, yet they are two very distinct games with very different themes. In many ways, the two games are reflections of their main characters.KOTOR 1 is charismatic, popular, action-packed, adventurous. It sucks you in. Makes you want to follow the plot wherever it leads, no matter how dark or harrowing it may become. It gets all the attention, and people continue to talk about it years after it hit shelves.KOTOR 2 is overlooked and often forgotten by the gaming community. It is small, and sad, and little broken. But despite this, it possesses an immensely powerful story that makes you question everything you thought you knew about what it is to be a ""Jedi"" or a ""Sith."" Sometimes, the quiet, broken stories are the loudest and most powerful -- silent screams that are only heard by a few. "

												I initially gave this game an unfavorable view, but felt this was unfair because I was 'stuck' at a certain point in the game. I was finally able to overcome my obstacle, and stick with the game until the end (or one of the endings, rather).This game certainly has its appeal, but not without some drawbacks:~The game is dated: and I'm not just referring to the graphics. I'll be honest, the biggest headache with this title (and similarly with its prequel) was compatibility issues with Windows 10. I had to wait a few months until another update fixed what the last update broke. ~There's still a few bugs: or at least my copy had em. I was pretty into the story up until the ending, which felt very anticlimactic because it would skip over all of the dialog that was between my choices; it left me with only a very fuzzy idea of how the story ends.~It has many RPG features that were pretty advanced for its time like item upgrades and breakdown/creation; however the combat style was very clunky, and turn-based feeling, almost like FFX was. It can also get pretty repetitive with the game pausing with every new enemy that enters your line of sight.~The quest info from your journal entries were sometimes pretty vague, which took me much longer to find out where I needed to go, or objectives I needed to accomplish. Nothing the Internet couldn't fix with no shortage of walkthrough guides, but nonetheless made the game more tedious than fun~The added achievements are really the only thing that gave the game any replay value. The story was good, but even going back and finishing with the alternate ending seems pretty empty, knowing all the twists and turns that ultimately lie aheadIf you're a Star Wars fan, I would definitely pick this one up for a bargain price, or in a bundle. It's no Skyrim, so exercise patience while playing. 5/10			"

												KotOR II is one of the best RPGs of the modern age, rivaling even that of it's predecessor. To this day, after hundreds of games, it is still one of my absolute favorites. It has one of the best stories, a great combat system, gorgeous graphics (even by today's standards).Unlike most games being thrown at us with a big ""BUY ME!"" sign attached to it these days, this game actually makes you feel what you are doing. If you help that random person with a few credits, you feel like you actually matter in the universe. If you kill that person and steal the 3 cr. they had in their pocket, you actually feel terrible for it (unless you really are that cold heartless person that belongs with the Sith). You take note of your actions in this game, and every little detail and encounter/conversation is memorable.That being said, there is one problem I have encountered. Just one. In order to make this game work in wide screen, and higher resolutions, you have to do a little work. But don't let this deter you from playing it, as this little set-back will not effect your gameplay experience at all, only your screen size is affected.I whole-heartedly guarantee that this game will become a favorite for you as well. There is no doubt about it, you will love this game, and may even fall in love with it's characters.			"

												I am about halfway through the game right now, playing through for the first time and wow wow wow. I am a huge fan of the first game, and this takes it to a whole new level. Basically the same software as the first game, same graphics and menus and all, but the gameplay has been expanded so much, and there is so much more you can do and NEED to pay attention to.  -The updated crafting system, which involves salvaging items and creating weapons, armor, and modifications for both, is really addicting and much more deep than KotOR 1.  - The dialogue options and personal connections you can achieve with the characters is amazing, including the Lore, the relationships possible, the twists (most of which I have yet to experience I'm sure) are, again, very deep and enjoyable to explore.- The locations and planets you visit are large and worth of the Obsidian/Bioware partnership. These dev's are well known for the deep content they are able to produce, and the large worlds they can create. George Lucas would♥♥♥♥♥♥his pants if he played this game. There are things about Star Wars in this that he probably doesn't even know. If you like Star Wars and RPG's, MUST BUY			"

Everything is here, the graphics, the sound, the story. It is just amazing how much love the community has given this game. I wish they would do the first KOTR like this but if you are trying to decide between the two then I have to say get KOTR 2 and ""May the Force be with you.""			"

												At this point, if you are looking at this page you doubtlessly know about KotOR 2's reputation for being buggy and incomplete. Just to make sure you know: this wasn't the studio's fault - LucasArts gave them less than half the time they actually needed to finish the game. Still, a review isn't about what something could have been but rather, what something is.If you liked KotOR 1, KotOR 2 is more of that but refined, enhanced, and... admittedly, yes, buggier. However, the bugs (in general) are rarely crippling and the more serious ones tend to be both not universally experienced, and tend to only occur in side missions (like swoop racing). As for gameplay, combat is streamlined while still providing plenty of options for variety what with blasters, lightsabers, Force powers, and special attacks. Feats, equipment and their myriad upgrades, and to a lesser degree skills allow for crazy amounts of customization while remaining simple enough to easily understand.The story is really where KotOR 2 shines through, though. As mentioned before, the game was a rushed job and much had to get cut at the last moment, however aside from the final stretch most missing plot threads are in the minor side quests and are only missing the very end that some may not even notice. Dialogue is natural and is one of the few examples where dialogue trees actually work well. Very little exposition (if any at all) is given straight through endless monologues, but is woven in from bits and pieces grasped from various characters (including the main - no amnesiacs here) including some who outright lie (and well, might I add)! Every playable character is well characterized with great personalities and motivations that are believeable enough not to make us question why they hate everyone else on the ship stick to the main character regardless (except maybe Visas...)This game is also much darker than it's predecessor. It's enough that whether you liked or were simply lukewarm towards the original Star Wars trilogy of movies while the new trilogy left you cold, you are practically guaranteed to appreciate this game. On the other hand, if you really liked all of the Star Wars movies you may find the departure from the standard too much for your tastes. Honestly, despite the lightsabers and Jedi, there are points when KotOR 2 almost doesn't even feel like Star Wars (which I actually liked, to be honest).One last thing that is worth mentioning - while a significant portion of the game was unfinished at the time of its release, a group of fans have been digging up the not-quite-removed game files, finishing them up, and reconnecting them to the game. It is very well done (particularly for a group of fans digging through broken scraps), adds much to the game, and helps fill in most of the holes in the story. Just search for The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod.			"

												This game is quite possibly one of the best RPGs that I have ever played. Once you get a hang of the game, as in what to do when, and where,  it becomes a bit easier than you would expect it to be, however there are often bosses that will throw you off of your game every once in a while. Since the game takes 5 years after the original KotOR it is recomended that you play the first one in order to get the 'full effect' of the story. All in all, this game is definitley worth your money if you are an avid RPG lover, Star Wars Lover, or just a person looking for a good gaming experience.			"

												Quality game. A solid follow-up to KotR, which was a gem that set a new standard in Adventure-RPG's upon it's release once upon a time. Stay true to the original while providing the mandatory upgrades / adjustments to avoid being tagged as an expansion masquerading as a sequel. Some fan back-lash regarding the story is not without merit, but also a bit over-blown. Not as great as KotR was, but few games of the era were, if any. Definitely worth $2.50 - $5, but no more.

												A great case of an oldie but a goodie. With the newly added addition of The Restored Content Mod, this game truly is restored. KotOR II is one of the best cRPGs I've ever played. Its beautiful background and stunning music backs up the amazing voice acting and brilliant scripts that carry this game far further than any Star Wars title ever could on the silver screen. Player agency is at an all time high in this game. While it may not be as free roaming as the earlier Fallout games, this title will give you decisions that shape the game as you play. Most importantly, this game deals with the concept of ""morality"" better than any game I have played since. KotOR II changes the way you think about black and white choices, with there always being more to a situation than just the upfront value of A or B. It is that simple factor right there that makes this game what it is. It is a collection of choices wrapped in excellent storytelling, a beautiful background, and a masterful concert of talented musicians.TL;DRChoices, Morality, Music. Great game for in-depth RPGs			"

												Loved the game on the disc so decided why not buy it on Steam, saves me having to fork out more and more cash incase I accidentally sell this masterpiece.So the story goes as this, you are the Jedi Exile also known as Meetra Surik (Female Canon Name), you've been exiled from the Jedi Council because you followed Revan to the Mandalorian Wars and took both Jedi and Mandalorian Lives. You awake in the Peragus Facility after an astromech droid by the name of T3 saves you from near death, you awake, without most memories but with your wits intact.You open the morgue and look for a Plasma Torch, overlooking a female corpse who turns out to be alive, her name is Kreia Or Darth Traya if you know her backstory , she tells you that you are her rescuer and she is your rescuer and that there was no time to discuss anything since the whole facility was under attack, you leave Kreia to meditate and venture forth to find a ship to leave Peragus II, but end up finding a pilot named Atton Secretly, a Dark Jedi or a Jedi Killer , you end up freeing him whilst you search for a way into the Mines to get a ship and leave, possibly with or without your companions but the entry is blocked since Emergency Shutdown was initiated.T3 is called up to get the Shutdown reverted and he does, sacrificing himself for his team, ending up stunned and thrown in the fuel line, but you manage to make it through to the Turbolifts where the shutdown was reverted to find the Captain killed and a HK Droid standing there. You progress through space and come inside the Dormitories, find your way back to the team and try to run to the ship thats just docked when oh no, that HK Droid wants the bounty on the Exiles head. You beat HK and his floating mines and end up on the Harbinger, a Republic Ship now controlled by Darth Sion and his crew of Sith Assassins.Not going to spoil any more, just enjoy playing the game yourself.

												This review will cover only the gameplay.  There are a myriad of other reviews that cover the game's story or bugs.A good way to indicate whether a game is great or terrible (or anywhere in between) is how compelled I feel to continue playing.  There are some games that are so fun to play that I find myself still playing after several hours have passed.Is KotOR II that kind of game?  Not really, no.  Don't get me wrong, KotOR II's story and characters are far superior to BioWare's original title.  The game's theme is so immersive that I found myself thinking about it all the time while not playing it.The problem is that when I AM playing the game, it doesn't take long before I quit out of irritation.  I was able to blow through KotOR I in a couple of days and have replayed it many times over the years, but KotOR II takes me much longer, and I have not replayed it as much.  Here's why:-The game's central premise is that most of your party members can be converted to Jedi.  Sounds great, right?  The problem is that it takes a while to sufficiently influence your party members, and once they become Jedi, you don't get to reroll their skill points and attributes.  You essentially lose what the character was good for and are left with a mediocre Jedi.  Indeed, it's better to not influence them at all purely from a gameplay perspective.-The various levels of the game feel awfully rushed.  Especially Nar Shaddaa.  There is a brilliant story going on, but you can go from long periods of relative quiet to suddenly being dropped into very difficult situations with little warning.  The flow of the game is simply inferior to KotOR I, which was not any less difficult but always seemed to give me sufficient time to prepare.This game conflicts me.  It has one of the best stories of any game I've ever played, certainly the best story that has ""Star Wars"" in its title.  It's just that it's a mediocre game.  If it was a book, it would be the best book ever written.  Nonetheless, I'll recommend it.  I owe it that much, given all the memories I have of it.			"

												[NOTE: this review assumes that the player will use the The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod (TSLRCM) from the game's workshop. This reviewer think that said mod is a necessary part of the game at this point and can't be separated from the vanilla game itself]Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II - The Sith Lords is a sequel to the original roleplaying game by BioWare by Obsidian Entertainment. Set once again centuries before the Star Wars' movies timeline, The Sith Lords' story picks up immediately where the story of the first game ended: the galactic Republic is now in disarray due to the Jedi civil war and Sith forces still run rampart through its planets, with the Jedi order in ruin and no Force practicioneers in sight. You take the role of a Jedi who has been exiled from his/her order before the civil war and your objective is to survive the dark forces coming after you and discover the true reasons behind your punishment and the origin of your peculiar connection to the Force.As far the gameplay goes, the Sith Lords manages to be a better roleplaying game than its predecessor. Several gameplay elements have been overhauled or change to support different styles of play and to truly allow you to build a character following your tastes AND be able to overcome the game's challenges. While in the first Knights of the Old Republic the balance favored pure melee Jedi characters, now other specializations and characters have a chance too: enemies are less prone to resist Force powers, making them viable for pure damage or CC, and both melee weapons and blasters can now benefit from unique upgrades that really give lightsabers a run for their money. It's worth mentioning however that the Sith Lords' endgame somehow favors caster characters: by that point in the game the Force points (your mana, if you will) regen rateo has become gargantuan, allowing you to spam damaging spells or incapacitating effects ad nauseam (something that becomes really useful, since the last portion of the game are a series of straight fights against crowds of opponents).The Sith Lords' main new gameplay gimmick is the influence system. The companions you travel with will react to your actions and choices, approving them or else following their own moral compass and objectives: therefore, your influence with them will increase or decrease accordingly. Having an high influence with a character means unlocking new conversation options and even the possibility to turn him/her into a Jedi. The main downside of the influence system is however that the parameter is increased mainly during world events, so you'll manage to get a good influence with the characters you'll use most only. Another gimmick the game likes to throw at you is the sudden playable characters changes: at many points during the game you will be forced to put aside your main character to play in the shoes of one or more companions. While these sequences are interesting in their own right and have their place in the main story, they can easily becomes frustrating if you are forced to play a character you are not familiar with or whom you neglected beforehead.Knights of the Old Republic II is also infamous for the somehow shifting quality of its levels. There are some levels that are universally loathed by the playerbase, with the two main examples being Peragus (which is quite long for being your first proper level after the tutorial prologue, with the story going on at a snail's pace) and Nar Shaddaa (which is another planet that takes far too long as far as the main quest goes, requires a lot of backtracking and has a brutal endgame). Also, the final area of the game, Malachor V, hasn't many fans around due to having been hit the worst by the rushed development cycle and consisting in a series of straight fights against several opponents with little to none interaction or exploration involved.Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II - The Sith Lords remains a very divisive game in pretty much ever aspect, even the story and the setting. Some people like the deconstruction the writers wanted to pull off on the Star Wars canon as a whole and the main morality system of the series, while others find it pretentious and too much shoehorned. Some people see the game as an incomplete, rushed mess, while others can somehow get past the blatantly missing part and enjoy what they got their hands on. Personally, while the Sith Lords could had been a far stronger sequel and a Star Wars RPG in its own right, I found myself enjoying it more often than not due to the high level of the writing, the refined and more custom gameplay and its central interesting themes			"

												I initially gave this game an unfavorable view, but felt this was unfair because I was 'stuck' at a certain point in the game. I was finally able to overcome my obstacle, and stick with the game until the end (or one of the endings, rather).This game certainly has its appeal, but not without some drawbacks:~The game is dated: and I'm not just referring to the graphics. I'll be honest, the biggest headache with this title (and similarly with its prequel) was compatibility issues with Windows 10. I had to wait a few months until another update fixed what the last update broke. ~There's still a few bugs: or at least my copy had em. I was pretty into the story up until the ending, which felt very anticlimactic because it would skip over all of the dialog that was between my choices; it left me with only a very fuzzy idea of how the story ends.~It has many RPG features that were pretty advanced for its time like item upgrades and breakdown/creation; however the combat style was very clunky, and turn-based feeling, almost like FFX was. It can also get pretty repetitive with the game pausing with every new enemy that enters your line of sight.~The quest info from your journal entries were sometimes pretty vague, which took me much longer to find out where I needed to go, or objectives I needed to accomplish. Nothing the Internet couldn't fix with no shortage of walkthrough guides, but nonetheless made the game more tedious than fun~The added achievements are really the only thing that gave the game any replay value. The story was good, but even going back and finishing with the alternate ending seems pretty empty, knowing all the twists and turns that ultimately lie aheadIf you're a Star Wars fan, I would definitely pick this one up for a bargain price, or in a bundle. It's no Skyrim, so exercise patience while playing. 5/10			"

												Great game if you're a fan of Star Wars and RPG's. Some might find issues with the graphics which do show their age, and the combat mechanics however. But if you can look past that, then you will find a game with a good engrossing storyline, and great chracter interactions and development. Great sequel to the original, although it does suffer from a lot more bugs. Which is why I'd also recommend anyone who ends up purchasing it to install the The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod, which you can find on here through the Steam Workshop, it's an easy install.			"

												Played it Vanilla. Loved it. But is glitchy as hell. But i hear the fan restoration patch fixes things to be more stable and brings back cut content. However, Ten hours into the game i realized i forgot to subscribe to it on the workshop. Great Star Wars RPG and my only real gripes are stability and the rushed ending. So i highly suggest the fan restoration mod and at least eight save slots. I also enjoyed the main villian's motivation being different than the six films. Too bad j.j Abrams is too busy with rehashing the original trilogy 2.0 to explore villians with such motivations. Highly recommended if the current Star Wars games and films have felt stale to you and you are willing to possibly put up with some minor bugs/freezing on occasion. We need more single player story driven star wars games, Not all this mobile gaming and post-Galaxies MMO crap.			"

												Okay, everyone gives this game a lot of♥♥♥♥♥♥for not being a worthy sequel of the first one. Everyone talks about how it was rushed, it's buggy, there's a lot of things unfinished, and honestly I can't really dispute those claims. BUT, this game, for me, is actually better than the first one.The dialogue in this game surpasses KOTOR I's dialogue by leaps and bounds. Honestly, I have never, and probably never will, experience such incredible storytelling as Obsidian's writers managed to pull off. Your story of being the last Jedi, exiled from your rightful title after a horrible war, will drag you through the jungle moon of Dxun, the dry, evil sands of Korriban, and the gangster paradise of Nar Shaddaa, to name a few. The first character you meet, Kreia, shoud be forever considered one of the most interesting characters ever created in a video game. She is so mysterious and wise that you can't help but be influenced by her presence, and every dialogue tree with her makes you crave more after it's over.I love the dynamism of light side and dark side in this game. Being the last Jedi, you can choose to walk the path of redemption, reclaiming your rightful title as Jedi once more, or doom the galaxy to eternal pain and suffering, becoming an incredibly powerful Sith Lord. All the possible choices you have in certain scenarios give you Light Side or Dark Side points, and building your character to become an unstoppable force, slaughtering everyone in sight, is hilariously entertaining.I played the Xbox version previously before I bought it on the PC, and I can tell you, if you look up TSL Restoration Mod, the creators have done an AMAZING job bringing back all the things that Obsidian wasn't able to deliver on due to the rushed production. I think that many people think KOTOR II is inferior to I for this reason, but with the restoration, I don't think that there's any real argument that this game wouldn't have completely outshadowed KOTOR I in every way.

												KotOR II is one of the best RPGs of the modern age, rivaling even that of it's predecessor. To this day, after hundreds of games, it is still one of my absolute favorites. It has one of the best stories, a great combat system, gorgeous graphics (even by today's standards).Unlike most games being thrown at us with a big ""BUY ME!"" sign attached to it these days, this game actually makes you feel what you are doing. If you help that random person with a few credits, you feel like you actually matter in the universe. If you kill that person and steal the 3 cr. they had in their pocket, you actually feel terrible for it (unless you really are that cold heartless person that belongs with the Sith). You take note of your actions in this game, and every little detail and encounter/conversation is memorable.That being said, there is one problem I have encountered. Just one. In order to make this game work in wide screen, and higher resolutions, you have to do a little work. But don't let this deter you from playing it, as this little set-back will not effect your gameplay experience at all, only your screen size is affected.I whole-heartedly guarantee that this game will become a favorite for you as well. There is no doubt about it, you will love this game, and may even fall in love with it's characters.			"

												KotORII:TSL is a phenomenal game. Seriously. If you're even bothering to read this you probably already know you want the game. It's like KotOR, but with a bigger and better story, and it stood the test of time much better. (Player KotOR on a modern system is more aggravating than playing TSL on a modern system.) The only thing I have to say is that the game was extremely rushed through development and was released with a lot of bugs. So you should get TSLRCM (The Sith Lords Restored Conent Mod) before you start. It's basically a mod that put back in content that was blocked out because of the rushed release, and fixes a lot of the bugs.			"

Once you get a hang of the game, as in what to do when, and where,  it becomes a bit easier than you would expect it to be, however there are often bosses that will throw you off of your game every once in a while. Since the game takes 5 years after the original KotOR it is recomended that you play the first one in order to get the 'full effect' of the story. All in all, this game is definitley worth your money if you are an avid RPG lover, Star Wars Lover, or just a person looking for a good gaming experience.			"

Good Star Wars RPGStar Wars Knights of the Old Republic: The Sith Lords (KOTOR 2) is an RPG developed by Obsidian and sequel to Bioware's Knights of the Old rebulic (KOTOR 1). Renowned for being released unfinished and buggy, I chose to play the game with 'Restored Content Mod' (Fixes bugs and adds cut content), Glowing lightsabre (lightsabres look much better) just so I can get the best experience.The Good- Excellent soundtrack = Definitely reminds you of Star Wars.- Interesting characters = Your companions have a wide range of personalities, credits to Kreia and HK-47. - Plenty of armor and weapons = Your can waer light, medium or heavy armor (when you unlock the ability) which have unique perks. There  are tons of weapons including pistols, blaster rifles, grenades and lightsabres. Weapons and armor can also be upgraded to have various effects and efficiency.- Wide range of powers = You get a wide range of dark, light and universal jedi powers to play with.- Train jedi/sith = As you play the game you can impact your ""influence"" over party mmebers by either your dialogues with them or actions (when they are in the party). When you have enough infleunce and meet certain conditions, you can train your companions into Jedi or Sith, giving them a wide range of abilities and access to lightsabres.- Plenty of side quests = Each planet you travel to has plenty of things for you to do.- Darker atmosphere = The plot is alot darker than it's predecessor.- You can get lightsabre earlier = Unlike the first game where you can only get lightsabre mid/late game, in KOTOR 2 you are able to get your lightsabre early on if you go to certain planets first.- Better graphics = The animations and lighting look better than the original KOTOR- Controller support- Widescreen supportThe Bad- Still buggy = Got stuck (unable to move character) a few times while playing.- Ending not that great = Just didn't feel as good as the previous game.- Pazaak is a pain = Pazaak is a card game where you need to score higher than your opponent without busting (going higher than) 20. The draws are random and it can get frustrating since the game is linked to some side quests. There is a mod in workshop that makes it easier if your just want to progress through quests.- Swoop Racing isn't fun = Similar to the first game with a few alterations at different araes. The problem is that you need to get an almost perfect score to win (fastest time), which generally involves not colliding to anything and getting most boosts (or else you need to start from begging). There is a mod in workshop to make this easier as well.- Not Morally Grey enough = After you go to 'Nar Shadar', you are told that sometimes good actions can have offorseen consequences (such as when individual got mugged after giving him money). However whilst playing the game I found that this wasn't prevailent at all with 'Good' choices not having any consequences and vice versa.- Shorter than original KOTOR = There are fewer planets to explore than the previous game and gameplay was shorter.- Environments/map design isn't that great = I just didn't find them that interesting. They needed more things to make them feel more alive, like the previous KOTOR- HK Factory boring = (Restored content mod) This factory wasn't interesting at all and it was understandable why it was cut. It is also very difficult so you need to make sure you have plenty of repaire kist and items for HK-47. - Difficulty Curve = Also prevailent in previous game, sometimes you will face enemies which are a cakewalk to get through. Other times you'll be struggling to survive against the relentless horde.Overall, KOTOR 2 is a good RPG. It's improves upon the previous games in a few areas, though in others it takes a step backwards. I highly recommend you play this game with mods to get best experience.			"

												This game will always reserve a very large place in my heart.I played it on the original Xbox and must have put thousands of hours into many different saves both into this game and the first one, only beating each about 3 times. After that I bought a 2 pack of this and the first one on disc at Walmart.After seeing that this game had gotten an update from the original developers, which included up to 5k resolution, controller support,  achievements, cloud saving, and mod support, I knew I had to RE-rebuy this game on Steam.Not to mention the Restored Content mod, which adds most if not all of the content the developers cut from the game before release. It's experiencing even more of the game than I have before.25/10 rating, paid full price and worth it. I encourage ASPYR and LucasArts to release a similar update for the first KotOR with achievements, native 16:9 resolution, and controller and cloud save support, much like this one.			"

												I have severe bittersweet feelings for this game because it is incomplete.The graphics, the custscenes, and NPCs are pretty dated but the narrative, the lore and the characters you encounter are rich and fleshed out well.The characters give long soliloquies on their histories and motivations and towards the end they just kind of give up.There is a restored patch mod but there are rumors entire planets were removed, as evidenced by one of the characters mentioning a future quest and never coming to fruition. Also in the final dungeon you can see map markers of rooms with no doorways or tunnels connecting to them.The devs rushed this game to completion and thus some of it's appendages were mercilessly cut out.Then Bioware comitted an even greater sin by continuing the story in an MMO.Consider this, if you play Mass Effect pretend they were all Star Wars characters and in that universe and you can get a sense of the Star Wars series of games we were robbed of.10/10 will play again "

												The better of the 2 Knights of the Old Republic game.But only because this has a darker more adult storyline to it.I know EA and Bioware say the canon version is to play a female character in this but dont beleive it for a second.This game makes a ton more sense and has a ton more interaction when you play a male character (dont want to spoil it but a key figure in the storyline only joins your team if you play male character).I have not tried the content patch that fills in all the missing content as Lucas Arts rushed Obsidian to release this originally, but even the content lite version was a excellent game. I strongly recommend people purchase and play this game and dont take just my word for it, judge for yourself and play the male and female character through. You will see how expanded part of the story is as a male character and how empty it feels  when that content missing from the female storyline.			"

												If you're a fan of any type of RPG - Star Wars or not - I guarantee that you'll love Knights of the Old Republic 2. It's execution is very simple yet very effective, something games tend to miss these days; being too complex for the sake of complexity. The storyline (while a little cliche) is extremely well written and thought out, revealing itself slowly to the character as they make their own choices through the game. Characters like Atton Rand and especially Kreia have very deep and rich backstories that not only add to the fantastic story and atmosphere to the game, but will also change depending on what you do in the game. Depending on the choices you make, some characters will favor you while others will not. For example, if you decide to execute a criminal, one character might applaud you for such an action while another will disapprove. All these choices affect how much information you can gather from them during your playtime.The combat is simple, and if you've played the original Knights of the Old Republic, you know exactly what to expect. This is not a bad thing, however. If you enjoy pause/point-and-click combat, then you have nothing to worry about.Keep in mind, this game was released in 2005, so the graphics aren't going to be hyper-realistic and since the game was rushed during development constrictions, content WAS cut from the final release. That being said, there was a fan-made mod that actually restored all the lost content - You can find it with a simple google search: ""KOTOR 2 TSLRCM""Had this game been given the time it deserved for development, it would have been WIDELY recognized as one of the best RPG's ever made. Nonetheless, Obsidian Entertainment did a fantastic job taking the reigns from Bioware, and formed a story that was ten-times more interesting and engaging than the first game, introducing rich characters - both fearsome and loving - and bringing moral choices that sculpt your very adventure. Do NOT miss this game - It's worth your time.9/10			"

												I am about halfway through the game right now, playing through for the first time and wow wow wow. I am a huge fan of the first game, and this takes it to a whole new level. Basically the same software as the first game, same graphics and menus and all, but the gameplay has been expanded so much, and there is so much more you can do and NEED to pay attention to.  -The updated crafting system, which involves salvaging items and creating weapons, armor, and modifications for both, is really addicting and much more deep than KotOR 1.  - The dialogue options and personal connections you can achieve with the characters is amazing, including the Lore, the relationships possible, the twists (most of which I have yet to experience I'm sure) are, again, very deep and enjoyable to explore.- The locations and planets you visit are large and worth of the Obsidian/Bioware partnership. These dev's are well known for the deep content they are able to produce, and the large worlds they can create. George Lucas would♥♥♥♥♥♥his pants if he played this game. There are things about Star Wars in this that he probably doesn't even know. If you like Star Wars and RPG's, MUST BUY			"

												This game was infamously incomplete upon release, with a ton of cut content and numerous bugs which can infrequently rear their ugly heads. At times (albiet not in a long time for me, and on the old 4-disk version, not Steam), it became literally unplayable, blocking me from progressing the story or even being a jittery, graphical mess that's liable to crash from the get-go. But although it can be really frustrating at times, if you're willing to press on, which I highly recommend you do, what we have here is an astounding Star Wars game with a wonderful sense of atmosphere, and a terrific, really dark story about the aftermath of huge wars. While a lot of content is missing from the game (and should you not be willing to try the Restored Content Mod for whatever reason), the stuff that's there is still amazing. The voice actors do a tremendous job and the writing is very solid. In short, gameplay allows you to explore several parts of this war-weary galaxy, learn more about their history and current situations, and even choose your own outcomes - light or dark, adding to replay value. I've lost count of how many times I've played through the entire thing, and whatever the actual number is, it is guaranteed to rise in the future. Despite its problems - and they are big problems, I admit - this has become my favourite game of all time.			"

												Many people criticize this game for bugs and all I can say is that there are solutions!!Specifically you just have to download the TSLRCM mod and it fixes the majority of the bugs and missing cutscenes.The reason the game is so broken in it's released stage is because when they were making it they were suddenly rushed to finished it and what happened was a game with many bugs and missing cutscenes. If you download the mod than this game will be amazing, just like it's predecessor it has a rich story and clever dialogue and is without a doupt worth 10$.			"

												It might say only 0.5 hours on record (no idea why), however, I have played through the entire game, plus the TSLRCM and M4-78 Enhancement Project mods. This game is great. There is a large amount of content, a great amount of choice, the gameplay is balanced well, and it makes you want to keep coming back. With the newest update adding widescreen support, that almost perfects the game for me. I personally find the story to be weaker than KOTOR 1, but it has more mystery surrounding it, and is good in its own right. I urge any Star Wars fans that have not played this to do so, and even people who are not Star Wars fans to play it too. This game is definitely an 8/10 for me.			"

												I've owned the CD retail distribution for years, but I ended up buying the steam version for the convenience of the workshop.Many would like to argue that the first game bests this one, and in many ways it does, but I believe that KOTOR II tells a different story that carries its own value, and one that very satisfyingly puts the Jedi and the Sith in an ambiguous position for the player to judge for themself. It's a great game. Buggy, sure, and the graphics don't look all that great. Hell, even the restored content mod fails to correct a lot of audio glitches, especially at the beginning of the game. But this game is quite the work of art from a writing perspective, and I find the characters to be far more interesting and compelling than in the first KOTOR.My suggestion to enjoy this game the most is to play it just how you yourself would react to the events that happen to the main character. Don't try to stick too hard to the light side or the dark side, because then you end up being either overly generous or stupidly aggressive and homocidal to be taken seriously. Just play it like you would, and enjoy the events as they come.I play this game once a year almost religiously. A+, would recommend to anybody who loves the Star Wars universe to bits. ^^			"

												I'm going to be frank and say that this is probably one of the best-written video games I've ever played.  With a bevy of plot-twists and an engaging system of character building in d20 format, Knights of the Old Republic 2 grabbed my attention and never dropped it.Obsidian's trademark writing style is in full tilt here as they show off their amazing ability to elaborate on characters such that you know precisely who you're talking to in-depth beyond surface layers that most companies would present, and unlike the way KOTOR 1 was handled by Bioware, you're not a moustache-twirling cartoonish loony if you go for the Dark Side choices.The game is deeply philosophical and looks into what it really means to be a Force Sensitive person; it provides an interesting perspective into the nature of the Force that in my opinion isn't really seen very much elsewhere via both the insight and backstory of one of your companions and your own personal journey through the story.The biggest cons that I would give to it are that it's unpolished.  I'm not sure if Obsidian built themselves up over an indian burial ground or what happened but it seems like these guys just -cannot- catch a break when it comes to actually getting enough time to finish their product before it gets rushed to the market.  There's a lot of amazing content that's restored by the appropriately named Sith Lords Restoration Project and its sister issues, including scraps of what was left of an -entire droid planet- and several storylines that were kiboshed and remained partially in or were stripped completely from the remainder of the game.  This adds several hours of playtime and is really worth it in the long run if you want the full experience even if you can easily tell for the most part what's been spliced back in by a modding team (the scenes in many cases weren't complete).Personally, uh, if you're going to go for the complete experience, though, I'd recommend you skip the Droid Planet. Last I checked that fan-project was unstable and buggy, not to mention really long-slogging and full of lag.  Might be worth it for a completionist, but there just wasn't enough data left to make it seem worthwhile.  Correct me if I'm wrong, folks.Anyway, finishing up, get this game.  It's worth it just to sit back and listen to some of the conversations.  The gameplay's just a plus.			"

Big, Bold and Beautiful One of, if not the best Star Wars games to date, and an essential addition to anyone with love for the Star Wars universe or RPG games. Runs surprisingly smooth on Windows 10, looks beautiful in 1080p, and is an all-round great storytelling experience that keeps players invested in the characters they create. The soundtrack (like KOTOR before it) is just beautiful - reflecting the locations and characters perfectly. I was also rather impressed with the improvements to customization whether it be aesthetic or abilities. I'm currently back into my 4th playthrough, and still thoroughly enjoying all the game has to offer. If you're currently fence sitting about purchasing, jump right in and I guarentee you won't be dissapointed.			"

												Knight of the Old Republic II.This game. The more you play it, the more it gets better. This belongs to the Underrated category, being superior than its predecessor, biowares KoTor.This game sets up few years after the events of the original KoTor game. This Time you play as ""the exile"" an ex jedi who followed Revan to war against the Mandalorian threath. On your journey you discover a terrible thruth: You are the key to kill the force.This new concept on killing the force is really something new in star wars. Every single star wars game is about ruling something. Lets talk about locations.Tutorial:  This game has an skippable tutorial level, but i recomend you to play it, since there are few mechanics that are different than the Biowares KoTor. The level is located inside the Ebon Hawk. Revan's ship from the last game.1st level. Peragus mining asteroid.Wow. I really enjoyed this level. You face countlets of enemies and try to find out why everyone is mysteriously dead. Venturing deeper this mysterious dead rock you meet your 3 first companions. The level desing is great lightings are marvelous.2nd. Level. Telos shipyard and surface.This location acts like a pit stop. A location for you to catch up what has happened during these years and why there are no more jedis. As location this is the weakest on my opinion. There is much to do, but at that time of the game I really wanted to get the hell out of there. Still enjoyable.(Next locations will be mentioned briefly, because these I dont want to spoil)Dxun moon, Onderon, Nar Shaddaa, Dantooine, Korriban, Malachor.All of them have enjoyable areas. many cool enemies and really beautifull landscapes.Companions: The companions are ALL good. Best written characters in star wars. Depends on your affection to them they are seen wandering around the Ebon Hawk. They argue against eachothers and even plot against some characters. And for the first time it really matters wich gender you pick. Female: gets the Diciple.Male: gets Brianna.And even your Dark/Lightside affects 2 companions. Hanharr and MiraIf you are evil you get the mad wookiee. If you are a saint, a good bounty hunter will aproach you.These details add replay-value, because they add their own story to the game and own dilemas that you have to solve.Many people dislike this game, but to be honest Obsidian made an amazing job with this one. Lack of time and money made the game shorter and many good content were cut off from the final product. This is one of the greatest star wars games that i have played (I have played many). From PC tie fighter to the newest Star wars Battlefront. This Game is on my top 3. Maybe even the Best star wars game that i have played. Surpassing KoTor and Jedi Knight serie.Overall score: 9/10Try it? yesBuy it? yesHave physical copy? YES			"

												[NOTE: this review assumes that the player will use the The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod (TSLRCM) from the game's workshop. This reviewer think that said mod is a necessary part of the game at this point and can't be separated from the vanilla game itself]Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II - The Sith Lords is a sequel to the original roleplaying game by BioWare by Obsidian Entertainment. Set once again centuries before the Star Wars' movies timeline, The Sith Lords' story picks up immediately where the story of the first game ended: the galactic Republic is now in disarray due to the Jedi civil war and Sith forces still run rampart through its planets, with the Jedi order in ruin and no Force practicioneers in sight. You take the role of a Jedi who has been exiled from his/her order before the civil war and your objective is to survive the dark forces coming after you and discover the true reasons behind your punishment and the origin of your peculiar connection to the Force.As far the gameplay goes, the Sith Lords manages to be a better roleplaying game than its predecessor. Several gameplay elements have been overhauled or change to support different styles of play and to truly allow you to build a character following your tastes AND be able to overcome the game's challenges. While in the first Knights of the Old Republic the balance favored pure melee Jedi characters, now other specializations and characters have a chance too: enemies are less prone to resist Force powers, making them viable for pure damage or CC, and both melee weapons and blasters can now benefit from unique upgrades that really give lightsabers a run for their money. It's worth mentioning however that the Sith Lords' endgame somehow favors caster characters: by that point in the game the Force points (your mana, if you will) regen rateo has become gargantuan, allowing you to spam damaging spells or incapacitating effects ad nauseam (something that becomes really useful, since the last portion of the game are a series of straight fights against crowds of opponents).The Sith Lords' main new gameplay gimmick is the influence system. The companions you travel with will react to your actions and choices, approving them or else following their own moral compass and objectives: therefore, your influence with them will increase or decrease accordingly. Having an high influence with a character means unlocking new conversation options and even the possibility to turn him/her into a Jedi. The main downside of the influence system is however that the parameter is increased mainly during world events, so you'll manage to get a good influence with the characters you'll use most only. Another gimmick the game likes to throw at you is the sudden playable characters changes: at many points during the game you will be forced to put aside your main character to play in the shoes of one or more companions. While these sequences are interesting in their own right and have their place in the main story, they can easily becomes frustrating if you are forced to play a character you are not familiar with or whom you neglected beforehead.Knights of the Old Republic II is also infamous for the somehow shifting quality of its levels. There are some levels that are universally loathed by the playerbase, with the two main examples being Peragus (which is quite long for being your first proper level after the tutorial prologue, with the story going on at a snail's pace) and Nar Shaddaa (which is another planet that takes far too long as far as the main quest goes, requires a lot of backtracking and has a brutal endgame). Also, the final area of the game, Malachor V, hasn't many fans around due to having been hit the worst by the rushed development cycle and consisting in a series of straight fights against several opponents with little to none interaction or exploration involved.Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II - The Sith Lords remains a very divisive game in pretty much ever aspect, even the story and the setting. Some people like the deconstruction the writers wanted to pull off on the Star Wars canon as a whole and the main morality system of the series, while others find it pretentious and too much shoehorned. Some people see the game as an incomplete, rushed mess, while others can somehow get past the blatantly missing part and enjoy what they got their hands on. Personally, while the Sith Lords could had been a far stronger sequel and a Star Wars RPG in its own right, I found myself enjoying it more often than not due to the high level of the writing, the refined and more custom gameplay and its central interesting themes			"

												When you buy this game, make sure to get the TSLRCM ( The Sith Lords Restoration Content Mod ). Adds content that was left off the orignal release, a must have in my opinion, tons of praise for the modders work.			"

												This may be the single most underrated video game of all time. In fairness, the original version (as I played it on my Xbox) was indeed a bit of a mess. I have no idea why this game was recently updated with full modern game amenities (steam cloud, achievements, controller support, workshop, etc) but it's one of the happiest gaming surprises I've ever experienced. Playing through this game again - this time with the restored content mod - was an awesome opportunity I never thought I would have.If the philosophy of Star Wars has ever interested you in a deeper way, this game was written for you. The way the story deconstructs the Force - what it means to be a Jedi, a Sith, what generalizations those titles reflect, and what meaning they contain is infinitely fascinating, and I find myself reflecting on the scenarios and characters introduced in this game more so than any other Star Wars property (and most science fiction in general).If you want to unravel the true mysteries of the Force - or just want to find out what happens after the first KotOR - this game is definitely worth your time.

												KOTOR II has some of the most compelling character development in an RPG. Though the game is notoriously buggy (save frequently! look up known bugs so you're prepared!) there is an excellent restored content patch available that makes the game more stable and restores content the developers were forced to cut from the game due to time constraints. Do yourself a favor, and play this game.			"

In KOTOR 1 and the Star Wars movies, you have the light side and the dark side, the good and the bad. KOTOR 2 goes way deeper and shows us how both sides are ♥♥♥♥ed up in their own way I guess.

												In my opinion, the second game far outweighs the first one.  It improves everything the first game did, in every way.  Some people say it was unfinished, at least that's the rumor, and to an extent it is true.  However, I've completed this game many many times, don't let Steam fool you, and I can honestly say I""ve never encountered any real bugs or glitches.  The last time I completed it, I installed the Lost Content Mod (do a Google Search).  The Lost Content Mod makes the game a lot different, in a good way, but you'd only really notice the big differences if you're like me and you've beat it multiple times already.  Still I highly recommend you install it.The resolution is low because this is an old game, but you can rig it to go higher I believe.  I could write a full professional review here detailing all the solid points as well as the highs and lows of the game, but I'm not.  It's a fantastic role-playing game, and it's the best Star Wars story I've experienced so far.  It's been so many years since I first played this on original Xbox, and I'm still finding new things to love about it to this day.  There's much replayability, especially if you're into games like Mass Effect, and once again the Lost Content mod adds quite a bit to the experience.  Plenty of role-playing afficionados will likely claim that the first game is superior, but you can take it from a lifetime Star Wars fan: everything about this game really just captures me.			"

												The first in a series of flawed diamonds by Obsidian.It was a warm summer's day when Bioware was busy working on other projects that they had started and soon discovered that they couldn't fit KoToR 2 into their projects. So they walked over to Obsidian entertainment and knocked on the door and formed an agreement to allow Obsidian to develop KoTor 2 for them. However, Bioware was impatient so they only had a year of development time to work on it. Obsidian sat down and immediatley got to work, as the studio only had around 10-15 people working in it at the time, all the time they had was invaluable. Lots of time was spent making assests that were never put into the final game, thus, time was spent. Obsidians greatest strength was in the writing department, as they did not view moral choices just as a simple ""black & white"" dialogue option. No, to them it was all grey, as in you could save the princess but you had to let the dragon destroy the village choices. In Obsidian's characters, everybody has a personality that expressed what kind of person every character was, just through talking to the player. Obsidian were true nobles in this field.As Obsidian got closer to the deadline, more and more assests were cut from the final game. Leaving the original vision a ""Treasure in a deep sea of monsters."" Many assests were cut and untested and unfiltered bugs were present due to the short QA testing period that was received. Distraught as they were at the final product, Obsidian regretted spending too much time developing certain assests of the game and too little time in other parts. With fear of negative criticism from the press, fans, and of course Bioware, Obsidian took to the internet to see what the public was saying about KoToR 2. To their surprise, the fans loved it with negative criticism going toward the number of many bugs and glitches that were present, and postive criticism going toward everything included in the writing, especially the dialogue from party members like Kreia and Atton. Given the number of people working at Obsidian at the time and the amount of time they had, Obsidian managed to turn a Hardees into a Jack-in-the-box. Kreia even went on to win ""Most Original character of the year"" from Gamespy that year.Obsidian learning from their first project, went on to make memorable game such as Alpha Protocol, Neverwinter Nights 2 + Expansions, Fallout: New Vegas (which suffered a similar experience), and soon to be South Park: The Stick of truth and Pillars of Eternity. If you like RPG's with great characters and grey morality, then Obsidian has it down. "

												In general everyone seems to think KoTOR is better than TSL. I am not among the general.That said, TSL has some buggy stuff where suddenly you and all your people are Sith aligned. CTDs. The script language does not always make sense, and the paths forward are not always clear. The said, the scope here is almost as impressive as the philosophy.You are again a mysterious stranger. You don't wait as long to find out who you are. Mentored by an old Jedi, once again you assemble a team and make choices. Some of these forward your relationship to gain character backstory. Some of these increase your leanings. Again, you decide how you want to play: Kill 'em all and let the force sort them out, be at peace with anything that doesn't aggro you, or meh.The depth of the story, though, is impressive. There is betrayal, Jedi gone rogue, some dude who is literally falling apart after trying to kill his master, and a boss that consumes the force for sustenance. They all tie-in to the greater story explored in the novels of who is Revan, was he good or bad (or she, again, the canon is overthrown), and what force exists beyond what can be seen by the Jedi council that threatens all of Republic space? You can also help ""rebuild"" the Mandalorians, train your own Jedi/Sith team, and destroy a planet. It's really cool. Toss in the restored content and other mods (just like KoTOR), and you've got serious replayability.recommended buy, but again, wait for a sale. It happens a lot. Save them dolladolla bills.			"

												So I've owned KOTOR 2 for many years now. I got it for Christmas the year it came out, same as the original. Since then, I've owned 2 more copies of the game, one on the original xBox, and then this version on Steam.First off, this game is amazing. Comparing it to the original, it keeps a lot of the good, and makes most of it better. Don't come into this game expecting an amazing story based on your character, however, because rather than that, it gives you an amazing (and in my opinion, better) story based on how your character's actions affect your companions and the galaxy as a whole.While this game's combat and mechanics are basically the same as the original KOTOR, several mechanics are much deeper than before. Upgrading is greatly expanded, giving many options for creating your ultimate weapons. Creating and Breaking Down items has been added, forcing you to decide on what to sell and what to break down into components, in order to create another weapon or item. And since this game focuses on companions, an influence mechanic has been implemented into your interactions with them. Now, what you say and do can change how your companions look at you and change their light and dark side orientation.Now, for the bad. This game is packed full of amazing content, but due to some issues, the game is left… unfinished. The final few areas are lacking. The developers were rushed for the end of the game, and it feels lacking. Luckily, there is a fix for this. The Restored Content Mod is available here on Steam, and helps to fill in the gaps and slightly clear up the problems the developers left behind.As for the quality of this version, it is superior to the other two I owned. The others were riddled with bugs, and frequently crashed. This version hasn't crashed once in the hundred hours or so that I've played it. On top of that, it is extremely easy to get mods for the game, some of which are very important (such as the Restored Content Mod), for creating a better experience for your game.			"

												This game brings back some serious nostalgia. It was one of the first RPG's I ever played and help solidify my passion for Star Wars. If you played the orginal and enjoyed it than this game is for you. If not...its made some marginal improvements but it isn't drastically different than the first. PROSMore complicated morality system. Makes you question wheter your actions are truly good or evil.Intriguing story filled with twists and turns.Likable companions.A large variety of force powers and feats to choose from.CONSSomewhat glitchy.Terrible AI.Severely limited unless The Siths Lord Restored Content Mod is installed.  Overall I would reccomend this game to anyone who like the orginal KOTOR and any Star Wars fan. I would suggest downloading The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod from the workshop for the optimal experience. If either of these apply I would wholeheartily reccomend this addition to your library.

												10/10 Play Kotorand Kotor 2Played them both when i was 14 and was pretty much a supplement to my childhood addiction.Kotor 3 flopped.As so is life.[Edit : I also when looking for kotor 2, because i actually still have kotor one on disk. To old of a game to pawn for drug money. kek. The game store told it would be $80 for a copy of this game. I then went home and bought it on steam on sale for $2. I'm very disappointed with the way game companys and the internet mlg players differ.]Kotor is a great game. Full of choices similar to New Vegas. You can say this inspired most games like Dragon Age.I bought Mass effect, dragon age, fallout new vegas, pretty much all of the major roleplay games for the next century after around 2005. I played Kotor 1 at maybe 11. Didn't really know what i was doing and put 50 hrs into the first planet.This game kind of has a really [Quick-not as good as kotor1] ending and left me puzzled as a teenager. So i'm going to give it another go.I remember as a child wanting to be a mandelorian. Glithced my gear in the underwater sea in kotor 1 and made them all warriors. I know i refered kotor 1 but these two games are my all time favorite, secondly red faction gurrila, new vegas, mass effect (whole series). If you want nostalgia for the rest of your life.

												TL;DR: Beautifully made game, deep story. Fixes below. You're all meatbags. All hail the Gizka's.Absolutely one of my most favorite games of all time (and I play many games). This game is a gem of both RPG's and the star wars universe because of the amazing depth in storytelling and the way it engages me and allows me to make my own choices, something I've found lacking in games recently. Originally I owned both KOTORs on xbox (and shamelessly logged  hundreds  of hours into each) and rebought them on steam for the third time (original disk broke) just to play it again.---What you need to know---Yes, the game is buggy. This was made for much earlier versions of windows and you're likely to suffer the odd glitch every now and then. HOWEVER there is, of course, a fix! A few of the catch-all fixes that I've used and have worked for the PC versions are as follows; The  swconfig  file which can be found in your game folder installation directory. Open this and check 1) Enable Hardware Mouse and 2) Disable Movies. You miss a little disabling movies and so you may want to go back and uncheck it and see whether it works for you. Last resort you can watch them through the main menu or through the magic of the internet. Editing the ""swkotor2"" configuration file, found in the same directory. Should fullscreen not work out for you as it didnt for me then paste the following line below [Graphics Options] --> AllowWindowedMode=1Then change the ""Fullscreen=1"" to ""Fullscreen=0"" and you'll be playing in windowed mode. Enabling compatability mode. Not difficult to do, which compatability you use depends on your system.The internet is your friend! By no means is this a comprehensive list, just the major ones that I've confirmed to work for myself or others.Truly this is a fantastic game and easily worth its price. Also look out for the Restored Content mod, which flushes out the story to its true potential and adds so much great stuff to the game! Now quit sitting around and buy the game already meatbags.			"

												TL; DR: KotOR II is excellent, but unfinished. A must play for Star Wars and/or RPG fans. Play through it once without the Restored Content Mod and play through it again with the mod installed.I have owned this game for a very long time. I originally played this game countless times on a disc, so my Steam hours do not accurately reflect the time I have spent with this game. I am one of those people that say that this game is better than the original (although the original is extremely good too).Let's get this out of the way first. Knights of the Old Republic II is an unfinished game. It was rushed to release to meet a Holiday release date. As a result of this, many sections of the game were cut out entirely, including an entire planet, along with vital story dialogue with characters and an ending that actually makes some sense. I am aware that there is a mod that restores a good chunk of the cut content called The Sith Lord Restored Content Mod (which is very good by the way), but I will bring that up into more detail later.Take the Star Wars formula that you know (Jedi = Good, Sith = Bad) and completely flip it on its head. It doesn't do a complete turn around, but you start thinking of the Jedi and the Sith more in shades of grey than in one being absolutely good and the other absolutely evil. You get more of a nuanced education in the Force from one of the best Star Wars characters ever, Kreia. Let's be honest here, Kreia is absolutely the best character in this game and is probably one of the best Star Wars characters ever, yes you heard that right.In KotOR II, you play as the Jedi Exile, a former Jedi Knight that was kicked out of the order due to his/her involvement in the Mandalorian Wars. You were one of the Jedi that followed Revan and Malak off to war, and you were also the only Jedi that returned to face judgment. Ten years have passed since then and you return to find a threat facing the galaxy that hides in the shadows. What follows is a galaxy spanning quest in the same ship as the first game collecting companions to aid you in this threat while rediscovering your connection to the Force. It is one of the most unique takes on the Star Wars license.But, as was said earlier, it was rushed to meet a deadline. A lot of vital content was cut from the final release, but the files were still in the game. A team of modders took it upon themselves to restore this content (what they could, anyway), and it is a crime that Obisidian was not given enough time to finish this game properly. However, I do recommend that new players do not play through the game first with the Restored Content Mod and save it for a second playthrough. Playing through it first unfinished and then switching to the mod gives you a much better idea of exactly how much stuff was cut, and how important the cut content really is. If you are a fan of Star Wars, or of RPGs in general, then there is no question, KotOR II is a must buy.			"

												Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II is a very special game to me. It has a well written storyline with plenty of side quests. It has really solid gameplay especially for its age. Being able to take the turn based combat into real time freely while preparing the next few actions you want to take in combat is a brilliant mechanic. The story aside from towards the end where it just felt rushed, was actually better compared to Knights of the Old Republic I. Gameplay was heavily improved over the original game and the companions you have felt just as well developed. The tag story rich is no understatement. This in my opinion is one of the best RPG's of all time. A lot of people find you towards the end of the game are a bit strong at least within my circle of friends who have played the game. Which I find in certain parts is true but Kotor II really does bring a moderate challenge in its gameplay. I felt many of the boss battles were a pretty entertaining. Towards the end i'm not ashamed to say I abused Force Lightning Storm and some kiting strategies to deal with a lot the enemies that i'd be fighting in groups of 5 or more. The game's lightside darkside system as always is just so well designed. My favorite part of my playthrough was me trying to perspective how i'd interact with these characters thrown into the scenario of the Jedi Exile and acting on my opinion and not a light side or dark side choice.The crafting system is really well done I loved the lightsaber crafting options and skill system requirements for crafting. The skill tree for combat was amazing a lot of diversity and freedom. Getting to the force skill tree it's in my opinion one of the best skill tree's i've ever had in a game really one of my favorite parts of the whole game is the amazing force abilities and the progression they make. I only wish there was more because it was so much fun achieving these force powers. Kotor II is the dream sequel to Kotor I honestly all it makes me want is for another one. We all pray for Kotor III because of how amazing these gems of the past are. There are still a few flaws obviously in the game glitches mostly. The biggest issue the game has is its age. Not because of graphics but more because of modern optimization.To start with the issues is how often it crashes. If it crashes at the loading screen for you or something i'm sorry never seen that issue happen to me once fix its resolution in its files. I found the game crashes from being full screen in very specific cutscenes often in world transitions. Hitting alt enter in the loading screen windowed modes the game. This fixed all of my crash issues i'd often just save before a cutscene since in most games they're obviously coming and alt enter if it crashed so I could enjoy my full screen glory. (When it didn't crash happened like 5 times throughout the game no mods installed)The inventory system itself is very poorly sorted wish I had a search bar to find items or certain stat types not even a big issue though. Abusable medpack tricks like activating one during your healing round inside your inventory while casting heal. Albeit I like this trick since it helped me in a situations where I failed to pay attention to gameplay and got chunked down. The AI for companions is pretty bad they like to run into fights repeatedly forcing my to loop between characters to continuously get them away from enemies as they'd run back in on 10% health and no force points. Good times with that I can say that much.Lightsaber on lightsaber combat damage is a little bit too high. For boss battles and even regular lightsaber combat I could say even having half damage on lightsaber damage. Maybe by having a special melee defense perk to reduce the damage would be nice since my Master Flurry Shreds boss HP. While bosses shred my HP way to quick kind of reducing the excitement of drawn out boss battle. This is the biggest fault of the combat system in the entire game and it's still not even that bad. I don't know if there is a mod for this but my final complaint is these older games often have no map markers which helps exploration but is more irritating when you have no idea where to go and the journal isn't helping much. I found this an occasional issue that can be extremely annoying. My last real issue besides the rushed ending is the slow start definitely wish I could skip that start.Also not enough Sith using force lightning abilities that ♥♥♥♥♥ top tier. (Fighting the Sith was really cool in all seriousness)Summing up review in a Tldr;Pro's:-Good RPG gameplay-Amazing Real time turn combat-One of the best written Star Wars stories ever made-Pretty Lightsabers-Strongly developed characters including the player character-Brilliant Force Powers-Decently Challenging-Awesome light and dark side choices-Amazing level up skill tree-Diverse gameplay options even though most of us go with jedi for the sake of our childhood-(Apathy is death)-Great Crafting systemCons:-(Forgot to add this) Getting a lightsaber takes a bit which kind of sucks but some might find this to be a good thing-Slow start (First 4 Hours)-Rushed ending (Last 2 Hours)-Inventory system is in need of a search bar you get a lot of garbage and have a lot of inventory space I think infinite-Cutscenes crash issues which for me were cured by windowed mode in certain cutscenes (Biggest issue in the whole game)-Lightsaber combat damage is really quick the damage to saber users have is too fast I personally just wanted longer fights because how epic they were.-Small abusable glitches nothing special-Not the brightest AI but not even near broken (Sorry if this isn't written that well i'm far from an English major)Overall Kotor II is the best Star Wars game I have ever played hands down and one of the best RPG games I have ever played it's one of my top 5 favorite games and if you get into it you'll understand why.9.5/10Try to get the original first if you can and playthrough it but if not this game can stand alone easily because of how good it is.

												Suffers from some of the fundamental janky-ness of the old KOTOR games. Alien dialogue noises get uncomfortably  repetitive. And...it packs possibly the most brutally subversive Star Wars story ever told. Give it a shot, you won't regret it.One could only imagine what delightful things might happen if the writers behind this game were given a Mass Effect title.			"

												The best Star Wars game since Jedi Knight, and one of the greatest RPGs of all time. Now made even better with the latest patch! Buying KOTOR 2 on Steam means not only do you get an amazing RPG, written by the likes of Chris Avellone, but it also has full widescreen support, cloud saves and, yes, achievements.There's something new to be found in every playthrough, all play styles are catered for. Saber fighting or Force powers, it is possible to play either or mix up the two.Picking Light Side or Dark Side choices will affect how your companions develop through the game, but one of the most fascinating paths is the Neutral path - the one that Kreia endorses. Kreia is a fascinating character and has an excellent voice actor.Make sure you get The Sith Lords Restored Content mod from the Steam Workshop to get the full experience. If you want more, M4-78 restores some additional cut content, but it isn't necessary for a first playthrough.			"

												I loved this game, played through it in 2 weeks (school). It has a truly in depth story ranging from the comic lore to where the previous game left off and beyond.  There are little tidbits and easter eggs of characters that exist in the series.  I also loved the soundtrack, which my opinion, gave suspense and serenity where it was useful.  A plethora of unique characters gave it a unique asthetic about the game. When I finished the game I felt so satisfied, because there was so much freedom in the game that you could honestly express yourself through it.  5 stars.  Made me love Star Wars again.			"

												I didn't like this game at first. I had just finished Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and was eager to try out the second game, a game a lot of people consider even better than the first. Excited to be absorbed into the Kotor universe again and to experience a new perspective of my favourite Era in Star Wars history.When I first played Kotor, I couldn't stop playing it. I started during a school break and entered a routine of waking up, eating, playing kotor, sleeping. But when I picked up Kotor II, I just couldn't get as invested. The tutorial was boring and lengthy and the first planet Telos was uninteresting. I stopped playing for a while.After a break I played the game again. I'm having a lot of fun now that I have lowered my standards and stopped comparing it to Kotor 1. Now that I have experienced the faults I can see all of the great strengths. My advice for you is to enter the game without raised standards and to accept the game as it is. You will find a fantastic RPG with great characters and an interesting premise.Also, use the Sith Lords Restored Content Mod.			"

While some of the stuff ""stays the same"" there's a lot of things that are different each time. Your experience can vary wildly from game to game.I last played this game this year, and i had just as much fun now as i did when it was released.			"

												Have you ever wanted to be a jedi swinging around your lightsaber and force pushing dudes well to bad cause you dont get a lightsaber till about halfway through the game( unless you got mods) but that doesnt take away from the beauty of this game infact it adds to it. You start off as a man or woman on a mining asteroid with mo clue as to how you got there on this asteroid you meet Kreia who will become your mentor in the ways of the force and atton a dude whos a mercenary i guess. well it turns out your the last of the jedi and without spoiling anything everyone is out to get you.this game has an expansive Darkside-Lightside system that effects things from how much Mp a move takes up, if your lightside and you want to force choke someone well say goodbye to your mp cause its gonna take a hit, or maybe you want to heal yourself cause droids are destroying your body welp dont try to use force lightning later cause your mp is gonna be gone sucka. The more evil you are effect how good or evil your teammates are and how much they like you. if your team mates really like you they may awaken some new abilities.  look i could go on and on about this game but youve gotten this far into my ""reveiw"" and i can personally tell you as someone who spent countless hours playing this as a child and now 10 years later counless hours as a young adult just buy the game youll love it. and if you dont you can refund it and you can like internet crucify me (is that what the cool kids do i never know) but that wont happen i know you know and all the other reveiwers know adios amigos			"

												Played both KOTOR and KOTOR II back in my teens with hard copies for PC. They were my first RPG's and as such I view them fondness and no small amount of nostalgia, but I was always dissappointed with how incomplete this game felt in its original vanilla release form. This play though on steam with TSLRCM has been an absolute blast though I think in my heart I still prefer the original it is now only by the barest of margins instead of a land slide. I would recommend this to any RPG fan and indeed I have to quite a few over the years. Great Game.			"

												This game is a fun game, but only if you know what you're coming into. To get right down to the issue, this game is unfinished. Parts feel unpolished and incomplete. The game is glitchy and places and some of the events that happen in the game happen for no discernible reason. The first quarter of the game is pretty well done, but the instant you're able to travel to other planets, the game falls apart. The narrative is poor, most characters are poorly written and I don't think the game does a good job at providing you incentive to continue for the story's sake.That said, the gameplay, when it works, is absolutely fantastic. If you've played the first KOTOR and enjoyed the gameplay, this one is on a whole new levels. More force powers, more feats, prestige classes, being able to get your companions to change classes if you have enough influence (which in itself is a weird system that feels very wonky, but still). Mechanically, this game is fantastic in terms of combat. Also, though I've said most of the characters are poorly written, some of them are actually very well written. Kreia, Hanharr, and Atton being a few of my favorites. The characters never really say much, as their backstories could probably be contained to a two page document (with the exception being Kreia), but they still have good personalities.Overall, if you liked the first KOTOR for the story, I'd be wary. If you like the game for the gameplay as well, I'd definitely check this out, but make sure you have the restoration mod.			"

												KOTOR II is unlike any other star wars game experience, as it is extremely story rich, introducing themes, atmospheres, characters, and locations that all have a story to tell. In summation, it's a dark game. Speaking to your companions and gaining influence, as well as progressing through the story naturally, allows you to witness many fine character developments just as in the first game. The combat is decent, and at times will require you to use your recources. Ultimately, KOTOR II is a must-have for any Star Wars fan.			"

Pros:-Immersive star wars role playing experience-Morality is more intricate than just light side/dark side this time-Wide range of character customization-Well developed companions-Weapon customization (you can have whatever lightsaber color you want!)-Large amount of content-Relatively high replayability-Nonlinear gameplay; player can choose to do the plots in whatever order they desire-HK-47 and all his quotesCons:-Cut content; Obsidian had to rush this game into retail, and had to cut a lot of content.  Thus, the plot has some noticeable gaps and seems choppy-Mild bugginess, but nothing game breakingOverall: First, it's worth mentioning that there is a Restored Content Mod that Obsidian took part in allowing.  This mod adds a lot of cut content, including an entire plot arc with HK-47, back into the game.  If you buy this, you should absolutely install that mod as well.That said, Obsidian took up the reins and did the series justice.  It's unfortunate that they had to rush the game near the end, because the plot is fantastic and really deserved to have its day.  But the gameplay is still fun, immersive, and captivating, and the amount of customiztaion for your character has only increased from the first game.  It's a pleasure to play, and rarely does the game become tedious.  Instead it's just a fun ride from start to finish.Bottom Line: Absolutely recommend			"

												The charatcters are some of the best written characters in video game history. The only down side about this game is that you can really tell deadlines became an issue towards the end of the game. Even with the restored content mod. It is not that the stroy goes from good to bad, but goes from good to very obviously rushed. Still a highly recomended game though, and still way better than KOTOR I.			"

												Ive decied to update my review, having been a massive Star Wars fan pretty much my whole life this game has always been amazing to play the story i love and the game just brings back memories playing this on my Xbox original, but the one think that stands out as of today is the work obsidian did they went back after nearly 10years and added mod support (steam workshop) also making a mod of there own adding content that was not put in the game at release adding new quests items ETC and lets not forget they added support for 4K hats off to Obsidian!  this game i would recommend to any Star Wars fan!

												I loved this game, played through it in 2 weeks (school). It has a truly in depth story ranging from the comic lore to where the previous game left off and beyond.  There are little tidbits and easter eggs of characters that exist in the series.  I also loved the soundtrack, which my opinion, gave suspense and serenity where it was useful.  A plethora of unique characters gave it a unique asthetic about the game. When I finished the game I felt so satisfied, because there was so much freedom in the game that you could honestly express yourself through it.  5 stars.  Made me love Star Wars again.			"

Pros:-Immersive star wars role playing experience-Morality is more intricate than just light side/dark side this time-Wide range of character customization-Well developed companions-Weapon customization (you can have whatever lightsaber color you want!)-Large amount of content-Relatively high replayability-Nonlinear gameplay; player can choose to do the plots in whatever order they desire-HK-47 and all his quotesCons:-Cut content; Obsidian had to rush this game into retail, and had to cut a lot of content.  Thus, the plot has some noticeable gaps and seems choppy-Mild bugginess, but nothing game breakingOverall: First, it's worth mentioning that there is a Restored Content Mod that Obsidian took part in allowing.  This mod adds a lot of cut content, including an entire plot arc with HK-47, back into the game.  If you buy this, you should absolutely install that mod as well.That said, Obsidian took up the reins and did the series justice.  It's unfortunate that they had to rush the game near the end, because the plot is fantastic and really deserved to have its day.  But the gameplay is still fun, immersive, and captivating, and the amount of customiztaion for your character has only increased from the first game.  It's a pleasure to play, and rarely does the game become tedious.  Instead it's just a fun ride from start to finish.Bottom Line: Absolutely recommend			"

												Have you ever wanted to be a jedi swinging around your lightsaber and force pushing dudes well to bad cause you dont get a lightsaber till about halfway through the game( unless you got mods) but that doesnt take away from the beauty of this game infact it adds to it. You start off as a man or woman on a mining asteroid with mo clue as to how you got there on this asteroid you meet Kreia who will become your mentor in the ways of the force and atton a dude whos a mercenary i guess. well it turns out your the last of the jedi and without spoiling anything everyone is out to get you.this game has an expansive Darkside-Lightside system that effects things from how much Mp a move takes up, if your lightside and you want to force choke someone well say goodbye to your mp cause its gonna take a hit, or maybe you want to heal yourself cause droids are destroying your body welp dont try to use force lightning later cause your mp is gonna be gone sucka. The more evil you are effect how good or evil your teammates are and how much they like you. if your team mates really like you they may awaken some new abilities.  look i could go on and on about this game but youve gotten this far into my ""reveiw"" and i can personally tell you as someone who spent countless hours playing this as a child and now 10 years later counless hours as a young adult just buy the game youll love it. and if you dont you can refund it and you can like internet crucify me (is that what the cool kids do i never know) but that wont happen i know you know and all the other reveiwers know adios amigos			"

												This is a deeply brilliant game, but it's flaws are real and present. the original release was brutally cut for financial reasons and released early, full of bugs and plot holes. it's derivative of the original and suffers a muddier plot, disjointed and abandoned story threads and muddled antagonists that don't drive the narrative. But there was clearly something here, and it was based on one of the best RPGs to date. Every game system is a refinement and extension of the first game; but more elegantly implemented and more polished.  The events and world of this story are natural outgrowths of the back-story or events of the first game;  but where the first game barely sketched the universe with stock characters, this game renders the fine details of the darkest days of the old republic with complex and compelling characters.This is a game that tells the aftermath of the hero's journey. Depicted is a galaxy limping off and winding down after the great blows struck by the Mandalorian wars (in the back-story to the first game) and the Jedi civil war (the last half of which are the events of the first game).  The more complicated plot hides multiple interlocking stories, telling many tragedies. the characters are all richly developed, but there are no simple heroes or outright villains. the heroes are all tragic, with deep character flaws that drive them more then the events.  There are no clear villains because even the villains are tragedies in their own right, deftly interwoven with the larger narrative, and each a demonstration of their failures and a warning of the danger of their paths. Years of work by the community have restored the cut content and revealed the ambitious pattern of story threads lost to budget and time. Community fixes have corrected bugs and fixed issues, even to the point of hex editing and reverse engineering. Even the developers have gotten into the act, releasing a patch 10 years after publication (and subsequent commercial failure) adding support for high resolution wide screen monitors, steam achievements, and workshop mods.Now we have a game that approaches realization of the ambition of the developers, and delivers on that narrative with competence, provided you're willing to take the time and spend the effort to breath with it. Taken on it's own, it's fractious and oppressive world is a cautionary tale of hubris, but when combined with the original, it's a dark counterbalance to that bright tale, putting both into sharp relief. This truly is the “Empire” to the original KotOR's “New Hope”. This is a deeply flawed game, but there is a genius beneath it's surface.			"

												Awesome game, one of the best (along with the first KOTOR) star wars game out thereStory is interesting, so are the characters, your choices do affect the story and the outcomes of the different planets way more than in the first one imo, This game is dialogue heavy but you wont mind because that what makes this game so interesting. Your companion roster actually changes based on your light or dark side alignment, and they react to your actions as well, in a way that can change their personalities.There's tons of weapons (and light sabers, of course) that you can customize depending on your play style, more dmg? more blast fire reflect? More dmg base on your light side alignment? your pickThe strongest aspect of this game are the villains. Those Sith lords have awesome designs, backstories and powers. It shows that a lot of work went into creating themIts an awesome game, worth the price imoHowever there are some downsides, that i can't overlook in a reviewBiggest one: Its unfinished in some areas, and it shows. The developers were rushed to finish this game. There's a lot of dialogue/scenes/plot points that were deleted and that's a shame. Because of it, a lot of questions remain at the end of the game as certain plot lines never actually get a resolution, particularly one established at the beginning of the game2 planets are really a drag, and make me miss Taris from the first game (which is a drag to complete) Main reason is, since you're on one of those planets to solve a mystery that never completely gets solved, the whole area feels pointless Not playing as the character from the first game can be a disappointment for someSay what you will about Darth Malak, but he got a lot of screen time in the first game which makes us despise him even more. In this game, although one of those Lords gets a lot of attention, the equally interesting other Sith lords barely get any. Lastly, while the story of this game is better in a lot of areas compared to the first one,  the story of the first KOTOR felt, imo, a little more... epic, in proportionsNot a perfect game, but one thats definitly worth checking out. Still one of the greatest RPG's out there "

												I played this game on the original Xbox and always found it lacking vs KOTOR 1. I purchased this game reluctantly knowing that. Nostalgia feels are amazing so I wanted to add it to my steam collection. I also had no idea how many bugs this port had and how it would preform on Windows 10 and 1440p display. I was suprised when I found it was steam community workshop. I tried the mod ""The Sith Lords Restored Content Modification (TSLRCM)"" and not only am I staisfied with the game, I am exicited to play this game multiple times again. Game does not run perfect but its one of the best ports I have ever played. Runs great on Windows 10, 1440p resoultion capped at 60 FPS. I would highly recommend this game EVEN if you played it before without the restored content mod.			"

												I awoke in an unknown place in space, missing most of my clothes and armed with nothing but what swings between my legs. After a quick,  failed attempt to find pants I instead found a creepy old woman who insists she knows me. My God, what did I do last night? I immediately made a vow that would be the last time I drink at a cantina on an empty stomach. In my heart, though, my fingers were crossed.After wandering around an semi-abandoned mining station with this woman and a guy I had to restrain myself not to punch, we fled on a ship while running from arguably the ashiest man I had ever seen in my life. No amount of lotion in this galaxy could undo years of poor skin treatment. The ashy man said he knew the old woman, and it began to click...did I meet him last night too? I didn't...no...I wouldn't entertain the thought of touching such such dry, dry skin.If only all RPGs began like this and ended with me fighting with lightsabers. A must play for any Star Wars fan, as it teaches you the dangers of not moisturising your skin properly can lead to dire consequences.			"

												This is one of the best games I have ever played.  I love how I can play this game so many times and have a different experience each time.  I have completed this game over a dozen times and know there are still things I could do differently to change my experience with it.  The characters are al unique and fun to try to get to know and influence.  And it has a great story, continuing after the events of the first Knights of the Old Republic game.  While I find this game great as it is, if you play it with the restored content mod it's an even greater experience, with far more possibilites and details to the story.			"

												Knights of the Old Republic 2 takes place four thousand years before the events of the movies and before most of the major events had even occurred. It is a classic turn based RPG based around a player created ""Exile"", and it includes a massive roster of returning characters and new characters such as Atton, Kreia, Mandalore/Canderous, HK-47, T3-M4, and more.Pros:Game has aged wellCombat is planned and can be very rewardingDeep and enriched storyline with multiple villainsIt builds upon the greatness of the original gameCompletely unexpected plot twistsExcellent voice actingThe morality system is back and better than everCons:The combat, while rewarding, can be frustrating for those who haven't played this genre of games			"

												Best replay value of any story-based game I've ever played in my 35 years on this earth. I originally had this on Xbox back in the day and it was a popular replayable game for many years, then on PC with mods for many more years. I've played through this game about 1-2 times per year on average for over a decade and it still never really gets old (although certain parts do).   Maybe swap around some mods and decide to go a different direction with your light/dark side choices and which combination of companions to focus on and you get a completely different gaming experience. TSLRCM breathed new life into the game, and just added to that replay value by refreshing it and adding enough content to make it interesting again. The game has enough depth and variable that even with all those playthroughs I still find myself occasionally consulting a walkthrough or guide to get a hint or reminder how to unlock a particular plot point, piece of gear, etc.  I'd normally be loathe to pay more than about $5 for any game this old but it is still a great value at 2-3x that.

												There has never been a better bunch of ragtag heroes to save the galaxy. Whether they are likeable, evil or a little psychotic there is no better company to shoot up thugs with a couple of blasters and a lightsaber. Honestly this is the only game i consider not skipping every sentence a Companion or NPC has to say. This remains one of the very few Star Wars RPGs out there and is definetly worth a play (especially if you are new to the story). Choices actually matter, the companions are useful and interesting, and to top it off the story is strong and has depth. The ending for KOTOR fans can be a little disapointing, but it doesn't change the fact star wars fans SHOULD 100% buy this game. (Probably should pick up KOTOR 1 as well whilst you're at it, probably has the stronger story - companions can be more one dimensional at times though)			"

												I really loved the first game, so I was excited to play this one. I have to admit, though, that the first time I played KOTOR II, I didn't enjoy it at all. Everything seemed opposite the first game; the planets felt more empty, and the companions all seemed like they had something to hide. It wasn't until I played through the game a second time that I realized what the fuss was about - you. In this game, you play as an exiled Jedi, whose force powers have been stripped by the Jedi council. As you progress through the game, you amass a great group of companions and gain back your force powers, influencing your companions with your alignment. At the end of the game, it's revealed that the exile is responsible for countless deaths, and was experiencing that pain throughout the game. It's almost as big a shock as the reveal in KOTOR I. the Exile's story is one of the most tragic in Star Wars, and Kreia is one of the best characters in Star Wars. This entire game dwells in the moral gray area of the Force, where few other Star Wars games or movies dare to go. Kreia in particular is the antithesis of what Star Wars should be, and that's exactly why she's so great. While I may love the original KOTOR, I have an immense amount of respect for this game, and in particular for Chris Avellone, who is one of the best video game writers of all time. This game is Amazing.			"

												Got to play it again through the Star Wars Humble Bundle and with the Restored Content Mod (Which I highly recommend installing). The story is very exciting, expecially its message to the players on the influence of the force itself through the enigmatic character known as Kreia, who in my opininion is one of the most spectacularily written characters in a game. Also, in comparison to the previous title, the story offers the player much more food for thought, and follows a much more complex route than the traditional hero defeats villain formula that the previous title followed. In terms of characters, nothing has changed. They are all very memorable, unique, and full of life.Gameplay wise, it is an upgrade to the first with much better personalization and customization with more feats, and force powers. The game also improves upon the first with the introduction to new Jedi specializations which you may learn alongside the original three classes of Jedi.  With the amount of love it has recieved from the modding community, and with the memorable characters and companions along with their humorous dialogue, this may be the best Star Wars game to this day.10/10 would love to have another bad feeling about this again.

												This may be the single most underrated video game of all time. In fairness, the original version (as I played it on my Xbox) was indeed a bit of a mess. I have no idea why this game was recently updated with full modern game amenities (steam cloud, achievements, controller support, workshop, etc) but it's one of the happiest gaming surprises I've ever experienced. Playing through this game again - this time with the restored content mod - was an awesome opportunity I never thought I would have.If the philosophy of Star Wars has ever interested you in a deeper way, this game was written for you. The way the story deconstructs the Force - what it means to be a Jedi, a Sith, what generalizations those titles reflect, and what meaning they contain is infinitely fascinating, and I find myself reflecting on the scenarios and characters introduced in this game more so than any other Star Wars property (and most science fiction in general).If you want to unravel the true mysteries of the Force - or just want to find out what happens after the first KotOR - this game is definitely worth your time.

												The best Star Wars game since Jedi Knight, and one of the greatest RPGs of all time. Now made even better with the latest patch! Buying KOTOR 2 on Steam means not only do you get an amazing RPG, written by the likes of Chris Avellone, but it also has full widescreen support, cloud saves and, yes, achievements.There's something new to be found in every playthrough, all play styles are catered for. Saber fighting or Force powers, it is possible to play either or mix up the two.Picking Light Side or Dark Side choices will affect how your companions develop through the game, but one of the most fascinating paths is the Neutral path - the one that Kreia endorses. Kreia is a fascinating character and has an excellent voice actor.Make sure you get The Sith Lords Restored Content mod from the Steam Workshop to get the full experience. If you want more, M4-78 restores some additional cut content, but it isn't necessary for a first playthrough.			"

Good Star Wars RPGStar Wars Knights of the Old Republic: The Sith Lords (KOTOR 2) is an RPG developed by Obsidian and sequel to Bioware's Knights of the Old rebulic (KOTOR 1). Renowned for being released unfinished and buggy, I chose to play the game with 'Restored Content Mod' (Fixes bugs and adds cut content), Glowing lightsabre (lightsabres look much better) just so I can get the best experience.The Good- Excellent soundtrack = Definitely reminds you of Star Wars.- Interesting characters = Your companions have a wide range of personalities, credits to Kreia and HK-47. - Plenty of armor and weapons = Your can waer light, medium or heavy armor (when you unlock the ability) which have unique perks. There  are tons of weapons including pistols, blaster rifles, grenades and lightsabres. Weapons and armor can also be upgraded to have various effects and efficiency.- Wide range of powers = You get a wide range of dark, light and universal jedi powers to play with.- Train jedi/sith = As you play the game you can impact your ""influence"" over party mmebers by either your dialogues with them or actions (when they are in the party). When you have enough infleunce and meet certain conditions, you can train your companions into Jedi or Sith, giving them a wide range of abilities and access to lightsabres.- Plenty of side quests = Each planet you travel to has plenty of things for you to do.- Darker atmosphere = The plot is alot darker than it's predecessor.- You can get lightsabre earlier = Unlike the first game where you can only get lightsabre mid/late game, in KOTOR 2 you are able to get your lightsabre early on if you go to certain planets first.- Better graphics = The animations and lighting look better than the original KOTOR- Controller support- Widescreen supportThe Bad- Still buggy = Got stuck (unable to move character) a few times while playing.- Ending not that great = Just didn't feel as good as the previous game.- Pazaak is a pain = Pazaak is a card game where you need to score higher than your opponent without busting (going higher than) 20. The draws are random and it can get frustrating since the game is linked to some side quests. There is a mod in workshop that makes it easier if your just want to progress through quests.- Swoop Racing isn't fun = Similar to the first game with a few alterations at different araes. The problem is that you need to get an almost perfect score to win (fastest time), which generally involves not colliding to anything and getting most boosts (or else you need to start from begging). There is a mod in workshop to make this easier as well.- Not Morally Grey enough = After you go to 'Nar Shadar', you are told that sometimes good actions can have offorseen consequences (such as when individual got mugged after giving him money). However whilst playing the game I found that this wasn't prevailent at all with 'Good' choices not having any consequences and vice versa.- Shorter than original KOTOR = There are fewer planets to explore than the previous game and gameplay was shorter.- Environments/map design isn't that great = I just didn't find them that interesting. They needed more things to make them feel more alive, like the previous KOTOR- HK Factory boring = (Restored content mod) This factory wasn't interesting at all and it was understandable why it was cut. It is also very difficult so you need to make sure you have plenty of repaire kist and items for HK-47. - Difficulty Curve = Also prevailent in previous game, sometimes you will face enemies which are a cakewalk to get through. Other times you'll be struggling to survive against the relentless horde.Overall, KOTOR 2 is a good RPG. It's improves upon the previous games in a few areas, though in others it takes a step backwards. I highly recommend you play this game with mods to get best experience.			"

												This game will always reserve a very large place in my heart.I played it on the original Xbox and must have put thousands of hours into many different saves both into this game and the first one, only beating each about 3 times. After that I bought a 2 pack of this and the first one on disc at Walmart.After seeing that this game had gotten an update from the original developers, which included up to 5k resolution, controller support,  achievements, cloud saving, and mod support, I knew I had to RE-rebuy this game on Steam.Not to mention the Restored Content mod, which adds most if not all of the content the developers cut from the game before release. It's experiencing even more of the game than I have before.25/10 rating, paid full price and worth it. I encourage ASPYR and LucasArts to release a similar update for the first KotOR with achievements, native 16:9 resolution, and controller and cloud save support, much like this one.			"

There are little tidbits and easter eggs of characters that exist in the series.  I also loved the soundtrack, which my opinion, gave suspense and serenity where it was useful.  A plethora of unique characters gave it a unique asthetic about the game. When I finished the game I felt so satisfied, because there was so much freedom in the game that you could honestly express yourself through it.  5 stars.  Made me love Star Wars again.			"

												I didn't like this game at first. I had just finished Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and was eager to try out the second game, a game a lot of people consider even better than the first. Excited to be absorbed into the Kotor universe again and to experience a new perspective of my favourite Era in Star Wars history.When I first played Kotor, I couldn't stop playing it. I started during a school break and entered a routine of waking up, eating, playing kotor, sleeping. But when I picked up Kotor II, I just couldn't get as invested. The tutorial was boring and lengthy and the first planet Telos was uninteresting. I stopped playing for a while.After a break I played the game again. I'm having a lot of fun now that I have lowered my standards and stopped comparing it to Kotor 1. Now that I have experienced the faults I can see all of the great strengths. My advice for you is to enter the game without raised standards and to accept the game as it is. You will find a fantastic RPG with great characters and an interesting premise.Also, use the Sith Lords Restored Content Mod.			"

												If you like RPGs this is one game you just have to play (likewise for the first one).The first game was amazing, but the second one polishes and improves on many things the first game introduced.I played this game about 2 dozen times, each time with a different combination of classes, spells and companions. While some of the stuff ""stays the same"" there's a lot of things that are different each time. Your experience can vary wildly from game to game.I last played this game this year, and i had just as much fun now as i did when it was released.			"

												I hope this reviews help somebodyStoryline 7/10The story is good, a republic shattered by war, jedis almost extinc, the sith returns, and you, the lastest thing close to a jedi can defeat them and be the heroe of the story. All was fine, until that crappy ending. Is very know that they game study didn't finish the way it was meant to be, and there is a mod out there that reveal the cut content that was going to be used. So i gave him a 7Gameplay 7/10Is good, like his predecessor, but any notable change in the way you play, also sometimes you want to cast a force but yet the game says ""no hell, first one attack and then the spell"", freaking annoying. Also, don't use the automatic level system, is very crap. I'm giving him only 7 because it reminds me so much to D&D (Yeah, yeah, all the role games came from D&D, but the game literaly puts on the descripcions things like your damage is a ""D6"" or that you use ""Will Saves"", etc"". Also the game is kinda short, i felt that Kotor 1 has more lenghtGraphics 8/10The graphics are good, for his time, but they could do better. The game models repeats too much, is like you go to the store and ""Hello Human Model 1"", then the  go to talk to a crucial npc to end the game and, hello again human model 1.Music 8/10I liked the music, but i felt it lacked some of the classics of the franchise, but still is good.Conclussion: I wouldn't recommended to buy it alone, you better wait for the discount on the Star Wars Pack, but if you want it for the achievements, go ahead, just be prepare for a crappy end, beside everything else, is good.

												This game is amazing. While the ending is really sloppy, the rest of the game makes up for it. Excellent combat, story, and character development gets you attached to the characters. Its a good idea to play through at least twice to see as much as you can due to the difference in the game because of gender and alignment. Alignment in this game is very well done. Picking light side will make you feel like a saint. While a dark Jedi will probably doing some twisted  things you yourself will have difficulty doing.If you're gonna get this game, you'll definitely need the restored content mod for the full experience, the extra Droid Planet will be good too.

												Only the greatest CRPG of all time! No, really.Well, maybe if you value things like 'not having bugs' or 'balanced gameplay' or 'not being rushed out the door for Christmas'. But, what classic CRPG (Bioware aside) isn't filled with these little character flaws? Frankly, it still feels more polished than Alpha Protocol, which, while remaining one of my favorite all-time games, doesn't have the 'rushed out' excuse so much.Despite being a licenced game and sequel, the story of the Jedi Exile and her companions (oh, did I mention the player character is canonically female?) manages to have the best narrative I've seen in any video game I've ever played, one which still sparks debate over its true messages and intent. Without giving too much away, you'll be touching on the nature of good and evil, the scars that remain from war, the struggle against objective morality and appointed fate, and the very real consequences that come from being a video game character. (No, really.)Also, this game both stands up to repeat paythroughs and doesn't make you hate the vast majority of the supporting cast. (LOOKING AT YOU, BIOWARE)More importantly, thanks to the good people at Aspyr and the dedicated mod community, the game has both the content it deserved to ship with and a slick control and graphical update for the modern gamer. Fully playable using a 360 controller, widescreen without stretching or patch hacks, and on whichever operating system you fancy most. (IN YOUR FACE, BIOWARE)Star Wars love not required, and perhaps detrimental! Being a person who hates Star Wars, I have to make the obvious admission that some fans of that saga might not like this game too much. That said, the depths of the story and its themes, and the ambiguity they bring, should make up for that...and to be sure, this game still packs a lot of love for the old hokey science-fantasy epic, all the same.

												Finished the game twice 10 years ago, but it still feels like an epic game today.Going through the story again, and the latest patch, combined with the various mods you can find on the web make it one of the greatest RPG game ever. You can count on at least 15-20 hours of gameplay if you want to finish the game on 1 side of the force, while doing all the side quests.Nice story, more complex than the 1st one, and for any Star wars fan, it's a must have!Graphically, while not being impressive, it's still nice to play, but you don't play a Kotor for its graphics.Musics are nice and fit well in the universe.The only point I would have loved to see improved are the fighting animations, too few in my opinion. Definetely recommend it.			"

												I played this game when it first came out on the XBox many years ago when it first came out, and like the first game, I loved it. When this appeared during the holiday sale, I decided I ought to have it on a current device and snatched it up. The game and story are still every bit as engrossing as I remember them, but I find the lack of controller support to be super-annoying. Furthermore, perhaps it is just my laptop, but graphical issues abound. I can't Alt-Tab without the program crashing (which means that any time I adjust the volume it crashes); it also crashes frequently during cutscenes. I am sure I could rectify some of these issues with some internet research and some editing of the .ini file, but I don't think I should HAVE to do that. I sort of expect the games to, y'know... work. The game itself is to be recommended, but I really have to grit my teeth and put up with the lackluster port.			"

												One of my favorite RPGs and probably the best story I've experienced in the Star Wars universe aside from maybe Empire Strikes Back. This story gives you a completely fresh set of characters (aside from HK-47 from the first game but his return is most welcome) and a fresh story that isn't simply copying wholesale from the movies. The game challenges the broad themes we see in other Star Wars stories while still absolutely feeling like its a part of that setting.I don't have a lot to say about the game play. Obsidian did the best they could with what they were given. I like the way you can unlock abilities for yourself and others in your crew through repeated interactions. If you've played any old school rpgs, the gameplay should be adequate, being based on d20 rules. You at least get some choice for how you level but you always have the option to autolevel if you don't want to fool around with it. You're really here for the story anyway.  And I have to tip my hat to the makers of The Restored Content Mod which, as other reviewers note, is absolutely essential. Google it, download it. I'm on my third playthrough coming back to this game after some months and the Restored Content Mod has been updated to version 1.8.3 in the interim. With this version of the mod, the experience is very minimal on bugs. The only crashes I've had could be attributed to other improperly installed content mods. Aside from this, I recommend googling to find the widescreen solution for this game. It takes a little work sadly to get this game to support modern monitor resolutions (if your monitor is 4 by 3 aspect ratio, you should be fine but if you're using a 16 by 9 or 16 by 10 and you don't want your characters to look bloated, google the widescreen fix and then the minimap fix for the widescreen fix.) So yeah, some up front work to be done but this game is 10 bucks and IMO, even with the extra work, its going to be the best ten bucks you'll spend on an rpg outside of Fallout New Vegas.			"

It has all of the features of the original game and has added many new ones that seamlessly integrate with this second entry in the series. The story is rich and in-depth and the characters are memorable for the most part but feel a little flatter in this game than they did in the first. It also cleverly uses mechanics so that you can compete missions and fights in a variety of fashions and lots of your choices have very visible effects, but not all of them. Overall, this is a good game.HOWEVER, I played the first KOTOR on my smartphone and I must say I prefer that one easily over this one, though for mostly personal reasons. The story of the first one felt tighter and more polished whereas with this game it feels like they tried to stretch it out for no good reason. I felt plagued by unnecessarily long fights as a result of too many enemies and zones that are large but I couldn't see the reason why they had to be so large. I also am a completionist so I try to do every sidequest possible and so quickly became annoyed with the constant trecking and back-tracking all over every map. There is also the fact that the characters are there but feel flatter and less developed than they did in the first game; they also don't feel like they are crucial part of stroy like they did in the first game. Finally is the fact that this story just doesn't feel as good as the one from the first KOTOR. I felt like it left too many loose ends, the plot twists fell flat, and it just plain left me feeling unsatisfied as compared to the first entry there just isn't a sense of closure.Now, a lot of this has to do with personal taste and so someone else might completely disagree. As for bugginess I didn't encounter any bugs, glitches, etc. during my playthrough.In conclusion: I would recommend the game, but I'm worried you'll feel less satisfied if you've already played the first KOTOR.

												NOTE: This review is a redux of my original review.Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords is made by Obisidian Entertainment and serves as a sequel to Bioware's Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. I've played through this game twice. My first playthrough was on the Jedi path and without the Restored Content and M4-78 mods. Honestly, I didn't like it and I wrote a negative review on it. However, after some time had passed, I tried the game again, but I went down the path of a Dark Jedi and had the previously stated mods installed. This review is based on my second playthrough:Pros:+Slightly better graphics than KOTOR I+Story is decent and more clear thanks to the RCM and M4-78 but does have some minor issues.+Details of the environments surpasses KOTOR I+Like the idea of influence and converting your party to be a Jedi or Dark Jedi+Well designed characters, but I felt their backstories weren't as fleshed out as in KOTOR I (however there are some exceptions to this criticism)+Maintained alot of elements that made KOTOR I great (choice / morale system, path of Jedi or Sith, etc)+Mods like the Restored Content Modification and M4-78 fix most of the problems found in the ""Vanilla version"" of the game. (Hats off to the people who developed the mods)Cons: -The turn-based combat (like in my KOTOR I review, this is something I don't like in RPGs in general)-The ending (those of you who've played the game know what I'm talking about)-The influence and Jedi conversion can be VERY tedious as some characters aren't as easy to convert / influence-I was a bit disappointed that the story didn't really relate much to KOTOR I as I thought it would be. The story is connected to KOTOR I by characters from the previous game but kinda are like side characters and refernces to events and other characters from the previous game.Overall, (8/10) Star Wars KOTOR II: The Sith Lords is a solid game but (in my opinion) not as good as the original. However, its still worth a try if your a die hard Star Wars fan or an RPG fan. NOTE: If you want the best version of this game get: 1. The Restored Content Mod, 2. M4-78, 3. Visas HD Re-Skin from the Steam Workshop.			"

												What can I say?.. It's good 'ol KOTOR.. Not as polished as the first, but that's what The Sith Lords: Restored Content Mod is for. Download that and you will be set to start on your tale of heriosm or villiany in a broken galaxy far, far away.. This game is a fantastic addition to the KOTOR family and sadly the last. It improves upon much of the mechanics of the first KOTOR, adds a great cast of new and some old companions, nice locations to visit, and a great continuation of the storyline we loved.Sadly, you can feel how frenzied they were to get this out the door. In it's unmodded state it is lacking both in a finished story and 2-3 extra planets/missions. It was cast aside when it was released but, years later it has made a triumphant return and finally got the love and attetion it deserved from a great community of players and modders.In summary 7.5/10 in release-state and 9/10 with the restored content mod. So go ahead an pick this up for yourself and make sure to download TSL:RCM.			"

												Definitely better than its predecessor. Here's 3 reasons why:1. You can craft upgrades for your weapons and armor. All your skill can be used for crafting except persuade. A simple blaster can be deadly with the right upgrades and used with appropriate feats.2. Your Ebon Hawk crew/allies interact with each other and now you will actually care more for your allies because talking to them will reveal more than just sidequest like in SWKOTOR1.3. You can use the force early in the game (if you play as a consular) which is cool.			"

												Obviously, after playing much more than my steam registered 162 hours as of writing this post (planning on having many more) i have concluded this to be one of my favorite games of all time (no doubt in star wars universe). it has a darker and lonely feel to it and although i do see many people's point on which ways the predecessor was more developed, i still feel as if (of course when using the restored content mod making it a complete game) it stands next to the best RPG's of its time easily and ahs definetely left a mark in their history as a genre.

												TL;DRA Noir setting in the Star Wars universe. Need I say more?Honestly I enjoyed this game much more than the original.With the Restored Content Mod (which is super easy to download in case anyone has trepidation over downloading something from another site to make your game better) I can honestly say this is my favorite game of all time. In my opinion the reason why this game is so amazing is because all of the party members are so interesting and so well fleshed out that the only thing I can tell you without spoiling anything is if I had to make a top ten favorite video game characters of all time list, I know at least two characters from this game would be on it. One reason why I like this game so much more than the first one is because, again, without spoiling anything, the main character of the original KOTOR doesn't feel like an actual ""character"" until around 80% into the game, until then you're kind of just a blank slate. In this game however, you're a broken jedi with borderline PTSD. How cool does that sound? In this game your party members evolve and change personalities depending on how much influence you have with them. Its an amazing system that can change the core ideals of party members with whom you've curryed favor, and without spoiling anything, (getting kind of hard not to spoil this fantastic game haha), can lead some of these characters to become ""something greater"".On top of this, It also has a fantastically ominous and foreboding atmosphere not unlike Dark Souls of all games. This is a top notch game that checks all the right boxes to create a cinematic experience like no other. It opened my eyes and got me to think in a very different way that has pretty much effected the way I play all my games with morality systems to date: some times neither good nor evil are the way to go, its best to remain gray.

												Not sure where to start with this i'm just gonna compare it to the first KOTOR i wouldn't say this one is better i liked the first as it had some very memorable characters and what not it was also easy to know where i was ment to go and i didn't even have to use a guide or anything. This one though was alright however i got lost most of time and lost interest after a while when i get it though i came back to it about 3 months later There are however two things that really bothered me about this game the first being sometimes you get no audio if you were to tab out so you have to reload your save to get audio this made me miss some dialogue the second which i guess is a spoiler so don't read it if you're going to play the first KOTOR or this one though for this one you are told at the start so not sure if it really is a major spoiler DON'T READ IF YOU HAVE YET TO PLAY THE FIRST KOTOR  I hate how this one you just start as a jedi right off the bat which i dislike the first one had it right where you can become a jedi later on and you are trained to become a jedi it's better when you train to become a powerful jedi and use the force and lightsabers instead of this one where you are already a jedi and don't need any training to become one the only thing that they didn't do was give you a lightsaber at the start you just had to build it which was more annoying then satisfying	 In conclusion if you loved the first KOTOR then i'd recommend getting this game though don't expect it to live up to the first one and if you haven't played the first one then i'd suggest getting the first one before playing this one7/10 it was alright			"

Featuring a more grey side of the story instead of the classic evil vs good as we've seen before in Star Wars.

Since Obsidian rushed KOTOR 2's release for the holiday season, they had to cut out parts of this game, most of which were pretty integral to the plot.)Synopsis: You, the player, are The Exile (canonically a woman named Meetra Surik). Like many of your fellow Jedi, you followed Revan to help the Republic during the Mandalorian Wars. Revan, who was impressed with your combat prowess, decided to appoint you as one of his top generals.The final battle of the Mandalorian Wars took place near the Sith planet of Malachor V. Since the rest of the Republic's fleet could make it to the battle in time, you decide to utilize the Republic's ultimate weapon: The Mass Shadow Generator, designed by the Zabrak technician Bao-Dur. The Mass Shadow Generator activates, pulling the planet, the Mandalorian armada and the Republic fleet into a gravity field. The death of the planet and all parties involved was so great that it gave you a Wound in The Force, severing and deafening your connection to The Force.However, unlike the rest of your Jedi colleagues, you were the only one who did not fall to the Dark Side. When the war was over, you decided to return to the Jedi Council on Coruscant to face judgement. The Council, both butt furious over your insubordination and incredulous at your voluntary return unanimously chose to banhammer you from The Order. You were then exiled to wander the outer reaches of the Galaxy. Oh, and they took your lightsaber as well.-Fast forward five years later. The war with Darth Malak and the Sith was so costly the Republic can barely defend itself. Strange, phantom-like Sith assassins have dogged the Jedi, hunting them down in an effort to completely destroy the Jedi Order. The crime syndicate known as ""The Exchange"" has put out a bounty for any live Jedi. Strange, durasteel droids have integrated themselves into the Republic government.

												This is one of the most immersive titles from the franchise. The story is brilliant and twists and turns constantly, leaving you with a dawning understanding of something world shaking taking place as you play through the game. Obviously good or evil decisions are mixed in with more subtle or subjective choices meaning that this can be role played properly if you wish and with so many choices throughout the story line it makes it replayable enjoyable for a long time to come. The interface is a little aged but once you get used to it you will be immersed in the story and universe before you know it.			"

												In its original retail form, even after patches, this game is a buggy mess on the PC. However, the game itself is brilliant. This is a very adult take on the Star Wars universe, with a story that is deep, mature and disturbing. Luckily, there is a community-made mod that not only fixed many of the game's bugs, but adds in content that was cut from the retail release. Any meat bag with an interest in RPGs and the Star Wars universe should play this.			"

												I've only logged a few hours on this game, but I've had quite the adventure on this so far. I've played as an Astromech Droid and repaired the Ebon Hawk, a ship that I had many good memories in the game before this one. I escaped a mining facility in space with the help of a rather odd Protocol Droid with Atton, who I picture as the new Carth Onassi. I met a creepy old woman with pure white, or rolled back eyes. I barely escaped that facility with a cracked and fractured man with a white eye chasing me. I made it to Telos and helped Ithorians fight of the Czerka Corporation (Never liked those guys in the first one either.) and the hired Mercenaries. Now, i'm off to find the Ebon Hawk and get off that godforsaken planet. 10/10 so far on the game.			"

Personally I'd say the story isn't as good as the first KotOR, but the new gameplay changes more than make up for this.-You can upgrade any weapon or armour in the game, unless it says otherwise. Plus you can CRAFT upgrades for them depending on your skills anytime you want at a workbench. The previous game would only let you upgrade certain items, mainly just ""Unique"" items such as ""Mission's Vibroblade"" or ""Zalbaar's Bowcaster"" or whatever, you get what I mean anyway.-Influence your companions.Hell this change alone is awesome! Do you like being the biggest jerk in the universe? Well now you can drag your companions down with you. Do you like to pretend you're Jesus and help every and anyone you possibly can? Well fear not, your companions still make comments to stroke your ego, puny Jedi.There's more but just bloody jump in already.			"

												In its original retail form, even after patches, this game is a buggy mess on the PC. However, the game itself is brilliant. This is a very adult take on the Star Wars universe, with a story that is deep, mature and disturbing. Luckily, there is a community-made mod that not only fixed many of the game's bugs, but adds in content that was cut from the retail release. Any meat bag with an interest in RPGs and the Star Wars universe should play this.			"

												What can I say?.. It's good 'ol KOTOR.. Not as polished as the first, but that's what The Sith Lords: Restored Content Mod is for. Download that and you will be set to start on your tale of heriosm or villiany in a broken galaxy far, far away.. This game is a fantastic addition to the KOTOR family and sadly the last. It improves upon much of the mechanics of the first KOTOR, adds a great cast of new and some old companions, nice locations to visit, and a great continuation of the storyline we loved.Sadly, you can feel how frenzied they were to get this out the door. In it's unmodded state it is lacking both in a finished story and 2-3 extra planets/missions. It was cast aside when it was released but, years later it has made a triumphant return and finally got the love and attetion it deserved from a great community of players and modders.In summary 7.5/10 in release-state and 9/10 with the restored content mod. So go ahead an pick this up for yourself and make sure to download TSL:RCM.			"

												Definitely better than its predecessor. Here's 3 reasons why:1. You can craft upgrades for your weapons and armor. All your skill can be used for crafting except persuade. A simple blaster can be deadly with the right upgrades and used with appropriate feats.2. Your Ebon Hawk crew/allies interact with each other and now you will actually care more for your allies because talking to them will reveal more than just sidequest like in SWKOTOR1.3. You can use the force early in the game (if you play as a consular) which is cool.			"

												Hands down one of the best Starwars game out there, great graphics for the fact it's a 2005 game, it has a great system itself and lot's of different choices and a great modding community.Pros:- Has both light/dark side choices- Can train companions to be jedi's- Great indepth story with restored content mod- Amazing graphics for when it was made- Good combat system- Fun to replay and find out the different light/dark endingsCons:-Repetitive Fights-Mobs don't respawn once they die it's over you can't power level-Endgame when the game ends its over you can't do anything else but sit there and watch the credits-Might be annoying at some points since it's difficult, not as bad when you load up a lot of mods.-Has some annoyig bugs sometimes where you can get stuck or game can crash etc.Overall I rate this game 7/10 without mods 9/10 with mods, it's a great game and a great RPG I really recomend it.

												This is one of my all-time favorite RPGs solely for its deconstructive approach towards common Star Wars tropes, with the primary vessel of the deconstruction being one of the most well-written characters I've ever encountered in a video game.  Other than that point, it's a solid, if not rushed (because of the publisher, not the developer) game.  Installing the restored content mod is a MUST in order to make it feel like a complete experience: http://deadlystream.com/forum/files/file/197-tsl-restored-content-mod/http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Star_Wars:_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic_II_%E2%80%93_The_Sith_Lords "

												Star Wars: KOTOR II TSL is a classic game. The story is good, and picks up some time after the events of the first game. When I first bought this game it had 7 CD's to install so having the digital version is convenient and more reliable too. I initially made the mistake of playing this game first so if you are purchasing this game I recommend that you go and play Star Wars: KOTOR 1 first. Fans of the SWTOR MMO should also play KOTOR 1 first because it deals with Revan and the story is more relevant to the MMO. This game puts you in the shoes of the Jedi Exile and your plot-convenient amnesia as you piece together who you are while regaining the force and making critical decisions. These decisions impact your party which is an improvement over the first game's mechanics but the story isn't as groundbreaking as the first KOTOR game. I always blamed Obsidian for rushing this game, but in reality they were the ones who were prodded along to finish the game and produced a great Star Wars classic that managed to fill the shoes of the original game. It's worth the money and time to play this game if you're a Star Wars fan, and an RPG fan. The combat is fun and the story is good. Replay value is high.			"

												If you loved Knights of the Old Republic and you're into philosophy, morals, and wide, somewhat cynical worldviews, you will love The Sith Lords. (However, it is almost essential that you play it with the Restored Content Mod.) Where the films and the first game treat good and evil as if they were black and white, this game paints every decision past and present as various greys. This is Star Wars Noir - difficult to digest and somewhat bitter.Like the previous game, it is slow in parts, but this is one of the deepest and profound stories I've experienced. Heck, it's even somewhat meta. The first game is bombastic and grand - quintessential Star Wars. This one is subdued and brooding and it shows in the colour palate, the music, and the mood of your companions.May the Force be with you? Must it? Is the Force even worth it if it just seems to cause suffering to ripple outwards from well-meaning Jedi?			"

												The devs at Obsidian Entertainment have always been exceptional storytellers. Despite this game being 10 years old, KOTOR 2 has memorable NPC's, an epic yet personal story, and great characterization and atmosphere. The main complaint (rightly deserved) that people had with this game was that it was originally released in a buggy, obviously rushed state. But that was several years ago. Today with The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod (TSLRCM) available on the Steam Workshop, we can experience KOTOR 2 as it was meant to be played. It's amazing.Here are some of the things that TSLRCM does: 1) It fixes 99% of the bugs that Obsidian never got around to fixing. This allows Obsidian's excellent story to really shine.2) Cut content from quests and cutscenes have been restored. This enriches the story and makes the characters' motivations *much* clearer. 3) HD Widescreen resolution support. You will have to seek out other mods to get higher resolution textures, though.			"

Just because the game is old and kinda has bad graphics doesnt mean the quality overall is bad.

												i overall really love this game, if you know how to min/max you can pretty easily solo kill pretty much anything in the game. the art style and story seems more on the gritty side but i think it works well. the people you meet in the game are ok, by far not terrable and above average but i cant think of anyone new who made a big impact for me in the game. the story is solid and has a good abound of complexity to keep you invested to see that happens next and the diolog is ok, alittle on the campy side but its star wars. my only major grip is the endings. there are 2 ending that i know of and both fall short for me. it hurts the game but not enough to make it so i wont play it more than once. this game is the prime example of its not about the destination, its about the journey.

												Very deep and cerebral RPG. Explores the moral ramifcations of having the force in a way that no other Star Wars medium has. Worth playing for the story alone.Gameplay is enjoyable if you can really figure it out, it's based on D+D and the combat is turn based, but it still feels pretty visceral. Being able to properly level your character and knowing where to properly spend points to get the character build you want is very important and very rewarding.The recent update is great, it runs at modern resolutions excellently and the controller support is actually quite pleasant to use. It could be better though, there's no dedicated inventory, stealth or weapon switch buttons despite how important those features are and combat can be a bit finnicky, as the left and right d-pad buttons control both the usable items menu and the combat menu. It would probably benefit from a seperate, controller focused UI, but the controller support is otherwise rather good - there's nothing you can't do with the controller. Due to the nature of the game, there is no benefit to using keyboard and mouse over a controller, or vice versa. It's all personal preference, and since I've played through this game about 10 times using keyboard and mouse, I found it quite nice to be able to relax and play with controller.Performance is a bit dodgy, I'd recommend turning off Frame Buffer Effects to maintain a solid 60fps. This removes some of the effects though, like the stealth effect, so bear that in mind. I found that I got about 25-30fps with the buffer effects on and 200fps+ with them off, so it's quite a difference. This is with an I5-3570k and two GTX 780s as well, so it's a bit ridiculous that I have to turn off any effects.The game is a bit buggy, but far less buggy than it was prior to the recent update. The bugs I had before the update included suddenly being unable to move, which required quicksaving and then re-loading, and dialogue randomly skipping. The random dialogue skipping pretty much ruined the ending of the game for me, as it just skipped all the important dialogue and I didn't realise what was happening. This was prior to the update though, so I'm keen to know if that bug has been fixed. I'll update the review if I experience that bug again.So yeah, if you enjoy Star Wars, enjoy RPG games and enjoy being immersed in lore and thinking about things, this game is worth picking up. Try and play the original game first though, this game is a direct sequel to the original KoTOR.			"

Please bring us KotoR 3 please. Or a reboot that doesn't change much other than the graphics... PLEASE BIOWARE/obsidian. If your a true Star Wars fan, you'll love the lore that this game has to offer because not only does it have the lore, it has a crap ton of voiced dialog like any good bioware game should have.This game may have been a little bit disapointing in it's time because of what it had to live up too aka the previous KotoR, but this game still has a lot to offer if you take the time to sit and enjoy the game.

												Bioware passes the torch to Obsidian Entertainment where Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II - The Sith Lords is born (TSL). During the initial release, Obsidian faced criticism over the game's abrupt ending which was later blamed on LucasArts's unwavering timeline for a holiday release. Fortunately for fans--from fans!--there is an essential modification to download to restore most of the cut content named, The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod (TSLRCM). The game itself features a much darker atmosphere and expands on everything that made the original game great so this sequel is a must for fans.			"

												This game is a prime example as to why Obsidian is my favorite developer, no other story that I have ever read, watched, or played has ever satisfied me the way this game does. The dialogue, the characters, the atmosphere, and the teaching of neutrality is all executed perfectly. I have played this game once a year since it was released and I see no signs of me ever stopping, you owe it to yourself to buy this game and enjoy the ride. Download the restored content mod and look past some of the issues with the game just to experience The tale of The Exile.Also my grammar is terrible.			"

												This game is one of the most moving pieces of Star Wars history.  Kreia your wanabe teacher says very true statements that you are actually lulled into trusting her judgements (that are VERY worth listening too).  You also can change the personalities of the people you travel with by just talking to them in a positive or negative fashion (reinforced by your alignment (Jedi or Sith)).This game actually makes me feel more intelligent by Kreia's speaches and opinions.  She also reveals a great deal about backstory and possible future events at <removed due to spoilers>.The gameplay itself is actually pretty nice.  It has a lot of combat options and things you can personalize.  Whether you want to fight with a lightsaber or not.  The armor you wear can compliment your characters abilities, and your companions aren't typical support characters.  They actually add some welcome and very real context to the game, as well as great combat efficiency.As for the level designs they could be better, but they remain pleasing to look at.  Even with the polygons that the game had to work with (considering it was put on an older disk).  Also the companions never feel dull because they actually go and talk to each other.  Their conflicts add to the suspence.  Their personalities actually collide, and in the end every mission is a real experience with each of them.  Hell each one has specially added dialog for whenever you use them.  (keep in mind this data is still all compact in an older disk).  All in all?  Worth it.  Story is great, characters are inspired, gameplay feels good, and it leaves an impression on you.			"

												This game genuinely suprised me. I was deeply in love with the first game, but I never  could get into this game because of all it's bugs and glitches.. until now. I HIGHLY recommend playing the game with The Sith Lords: Restored Content Mod, because it adds so, SO much more content to the game that should of made it to the final cut. The characters, oh my god, the characters.. Intriguiging backgrounds, wonderful dialog. The places.. To see places previously seen, previously unknown, remastered and in some cases, made, is just.. wonderful. The main story is amazing, IMO, even though others seem to disagree. The choices truly make you feel like you are doing a good thing or a bad thing, and the music adds to that. The music also makes the game much better, with atmosphere and such. The beauty in KOTOR games is that you can play through them twice, Good and Bad. Even then, you still miss a heap of content without realizing. I haven't even mentioned the characters that you have seen in the past play a fairly huge chunk of the story, which is amazing.I used to be of the opinion that this game was horrible compared the the first one, but that is because I encountered countless game breaking bugs, because I was playing without the previously mentioned mod. Now, I am of the opinion that this game is almost as good as the original. The only things that make the original better are: 1. It's Revan's Storyline, for peats sake! 2. More polished 3. It's the original! All in all, this was a wonderful sequel, amazing Star Wars game, and you should have it in your library, like, RIGHT now. Get this game or Nilhius will anhiliate Earth. :)			"

												Holy crap.I loved this game as a kid, and I've replayed it many times. It was a day one, full-price purchase for me when the retail build was released on Steam, and I thought it was worth that price. After today's surprise update, it is definitely worth full price, let alone sale prices. Huge thanks to Aspyr for a fantastic upgrade, with slightly better graphics, widescreen, I expected those, but I was absolutely blown away by the addition of achievements, Steam Cloud, and especially workshop. This is awesome, and I really hope Aspyr gives KotOR and the Jedi Knight series the same treatment.So yes, if you like great RPGs with good stories that will make you question your moral compass and perception of right and wrong, get this game, on sale, off sale, I don't care, buy it, play it, play the original, nag Bioware or Obsidian for a sequel.

												Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic was a good roleplaying game developed by Bioware. KOTOR 2, the sequel, was developed by Obsidian. The core differences here is that Obsidian still legitimately cares about making a good stat based RPG and not a shooter with romance options. I think I'm projecting modern Bioware shortcomings here but KOTOR 2 took everything that was wrong with the original and tried very hard to fix it. The game is by no means perfect, and you WILL need to download one of the Restoration Project mods to fix bugs and add content that was cut but as a role-playing game KOTOR 2 is still absolutely great. Your choices matter, the whole game is seeing how the consequences of your choices play out. This whole game is about choice. The characters are excellent, the writing is everything you would expect of an Obsidian title. The game almost starts out as a satire of Bioware cliches but quickly becomes its own animal, allowing you to explore a deeper aspect of the morality of the Star Wars universe that a lot of games never do.While this game certainly is not perfect, I find it better than the original in nearly every way. That said, I do recommend playing the original before you ever get started on this, the original game is still a good title and deserves the respect its earned. There are better RPG's out there, but you won't find a lot of them on Steam yet. For what it is this game is great and I love playing it. 8/10 would play again.			"

												Any Star Wars fan worth their salt must play this game.  The Knights of the Old Republic series of games are the penultimate of Star Wars gaming nirvana.  Sure, there are other good Star Wars games to be played, but none of them will allow you the pure visceral experience of ""being"" a character in the Star Wars universe quite like this.  Flying between planets, fixing droids, shooting blasters, learning to use the force, earning your very own lightsaber, and mingling with the locals in cantinas.  Of course, it's an RPG.  Not everyone likes RPGs.  Those people are morons and we should feel sorry for them.The Sith Lords picks up five years after the end of the last game.  The Mandalore wars are over, the Jedi are all but extinct, the Republic is on verge of collapse, and the Sith wait in the outer rim of the galaxy like a lion in the grass.  You play the role of an exile.  You were once a Jedi, but you have been cut off from the force and cast out of the Jedi order for disobeying them and following Revan and Malak to war.I could say that The Sith Lords is a better game than it's predecessor, which is true, but it wouldn't be completely fair to the first game which laid the essential groundwork.  What makes it better?  First, and foremost:  the story.  The story is top-notch.  I had come across some spoilers, I thought I had it figured out, and the game still pulled the rug out from under me with it's plot.  Then there is the moral ambiguity.  The first game let your choices in conversations with people affect your drifting to the Light side of the force or the Dark side of the force, and the conversation options for each were fairly obvious.  The Sith Lords is more complex in it's dialogues in that regard, and it adds Influence to the fold.  How you interact with your party members affects how they respond to you.  So, disagreeing with a party member might lose you influence with them.  Losing influence means they aren't going to divulge everything they know.  So, appeasing certain party members may create a moral dilemna and how you deal with it may affect both influence and whether you go Light side or Dark side.  Other factors affect it too.  Who doesn't remember the cave on Dagoba in The Empire Strikes Back?  Yoda warns Luke about the cave, but he dismisses him and♥♥♥♥♥♥happens that leaves everyone scratching their head asking: ""what the hell just happend?"".  Well, you get your very own cave of Force phantoms and the choices you make there also affect your Light and Dark side standing with the Force.  Better still, they make sense this time.Of course, the game builds on the sequel with more items, more powers, more aliens, more...  stuff.  It also pays great homage to the original.  You don't have to play the first game to thoroughly enjoy this one though.  The game goes to great lengths to explain what happened in the previous game.  Not only that, it allows you a chance (through dialogue) to decide what happened in the history of the previous game.  This affects how The Sith Lords unfolds it's story.  A bunch of the characters from the previous game make appearances, some only cameos, and it gives you a sense of what happened to the peripheral characters of the first game.  The game isn't all about you though, you narcissist.  The game will often switch to another party member for you control in their solo outings.  It's a nice change of pace to step into another character who has different specializations and motivations and such.  I thought it was brilliant and reminded me of the movies whenever characters split up and went on their own missions.I could go on...  but bottom line is this is a gem of a game.  And it only gets better with this very special mod that restores cut content to the game:  http://www.moddb.com/mods/the-sith-lords-restored-content-mod-tslrcmThis mod fixes bugs, tightens up dialog and finishes/restores content that was cut in order for the game to meet it's publication deadline.  There is another mod that adds a droid planet that was planned for the game, but don't bother.  It's reputedly bad.  Anyway, Padawan, you need to purchase this game and fulfill your destiny!  ...or something. "

												Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic 2 takes place 5 years after the events of the first. We now play as “The Exile”, a jedi cast out of the order for going to war without the councils permission. As luck would have it he/she is one of the last jedi after the Sith's successful purge and has a huge bounty on his/her head. The situation really shows in game as a good amount of people will try to kill you or deceive you for that huge bounty. It does become a tad tiresome when the same assassin droids show up time and time again spouting the same dialogue each time.  As for the game itself it plays it very safe and only improves upon a few things while keeping everything from the original intact. It is not made by the same developers as the original. Companions are far improved in this game and now feature a influence system in which they either disprove of you or like you  depending on the actions you take.  This time around there is a much better balance between Light Side and Dark Side companions unlike the original where near everyone had a holier than thou attitude. You never trust any of them either which I found very neat as I half expected the people that have my back to turn on me any moment. Some will flat out refuse to talk to you ever again if you annoy them enough. I still would like the option to kick teammates out of my ship. Which brings me to the ship, it is the same exact ship from the first game. They reuse a lot of material from the first game including planets that are ruin down but the same exact places as the original and much smaller.They really took a huge step back when it comes to environments. Where as the first game had huge unique environments this one has small gray corridor after small gray corridor. Your choices in the last game doesn't really make a lick of difference and they even get the gender of the 1st game's protagonist wrong and they will default to being female. Not a big deal at all but slightly annoying.  This sequel is far more prone to glitches and crashes. I actually had to cheat to get past a game breaking bug.  It has this incomplete feel as if they either rushed the game out or just didn't care.  It does have a few improvements like your teammate AI is much better at following you around, a small improvement to inventory menus though they are still awful and regenerating health which is neither a good or bad feature.Gameplay is pretty much the same as the original but with a few different force powers. I don't think they reused any music and it sounds just as amazing as the first.  You now seem to level up much faster and when I was done with the tutorial I was already half the level of the lasts game's character which I had at level 20 by the end of the game. Same abilities, same skills  and same stats as the first, they didn't really do anything to enhance character building. Story is pretty cool and feels much more mysterious than the first. There is no clear good and evil side in this game which is a huge improvement from the first. You never receive a lightsaber either, you have to build it if you want one. Overall I enjoyed the story more than the originals even though I saw the ending coming from a mile away unlike the first.I mentioned the first a lot in this review but it cant be helped. This sequel is pretty much a carbon copy of the first with a new story and a few highly uninteresting new worlds. It felt like an unnecessary sequel since the last game ended so well and this  game does nothing to enhance the  last game's overall story or makes any improvements to gameplay. Though if you enjoyed the last game and wanted more then it is nearly guaranteed you will love this.  It is definitely more of the same but if that is what you want than this would be a great purchase.			"

												Truly could've been one of the best star wars games ever made if it hadn't been rushed. That said, I still say it's really worth playing. Massive props to the people who wrote and acted for the character Kreia, she stole the show with her superb dialog amplified by fantastic voice acting. She truly is one of my favorite star wars characters in the EU. Back when this first released I could understand peoples frustration due to the games climax, spending 50 dollars just to have the game stop when it wasn't over would've been extremely disappointing, though now that the game is only 10 dollars I would say it would be a complete mistake to miss out on this if you're a true star wars fan.

 The port To catch up to the times and when this review was written, it's about the rerelease of Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II - The Sith Lords, which was meant to, as previously said, catch up with the times. However it does feel awfully detached from the original Xbox version of the game, of which this rerelease seemed to have been aimed to recreate.First off and foremost, the native widescreen resolution is, simply said, very nice. Being able to launch the game straight from Big Picture Mode with a controller while kicking your feet upon the coffee table and relaxing on the couch staring at your TV is somewhat reminiscent of what it was like to play it on console many years ago. However, with it being ""native"", there was a very large  lack of effort  on  Aspyre's  side of things, as it was simply just the widescreen modification that users could have done themselves on the older release of this game. What that entails is that the text on screen, on a TV, is relatively difficult to read without squinting your eyes until they turn red. Needless to say, they just added something that many have been able to do through WSGF for some time now.Secondly, the controller support. Pardon my barbaric comment on this specific topic, but WHO DESIGNED IT. Absolute RUBBISH. I still haven't figured out what the triggers are supposed to do, they added a mini pop up window. A POP UP WINDOW. With functions that were previously mapped to dedicated buttons in the original version of the game on the original Xbox. Furthermore, they excited everyone with the additional controller support, however, it seemed to have been a last minute after thought by those who were porting it. They had the tools to make it original, yet they still screwed it up.Thirdly, the action bar will always, I say again, ALWAYS, appear on your character's head. Unlike the original that we have come to know and love, they butchered this unique, simple and useful feature by, I don't know... Attempting to ""generalize"" it for all scenarios? Whatever the reason is, they butchered it. It gets in your view during combat or when you simply want to see what you are hitting.Quadruply, they did not add a virtual keyboard into the game. I know many games don't have this capability, but guess what... It's 2015. People don't want to deal with the hassle of using a physical keyboard to type their name or save game title in if they are using a controller. They proved that controller support, once again, was an after thought.I'm giving this port a 0/5However, the game is receiving a 5/5, simply because it's KOTOR.For any of those who don't want to deal with subpar garbage and wouldn't mind doing some simple set ups to get your BPM setup up and running with a controller and KOTOR widescreen that feels like the original, feel free to search for my controller support on YouTube by searching the following: SW:KOTOR [GAMEPAD UPDATE] [Dualshock 4 Support!]I proved that I could make a controller profile, for free, that had nearly 90% replication using digital red neck methods of creating my own controller support. In fact, I took the two seconds out of my life to grab the KOTOR 2 manual and replicate the controls of each button and add them into a functional control scheme. The amount of downloads that my controller schemes have acquired and the views my videos have earned merely prove the requirement of PROPER controller support in such games, especially games that were released approximately 10 years ago.

The X axis speed may need some adjusting for me, but not bad at all. I'm sure I'll find the gamepad mapping somewhere here on the store page or discussions board.

												One of my favorite rpgs of the last 10 years and for me this is a top 5 ever as far as writing goes. KOTOR1 was fantastic, but KOTOR2 was even better in my opinion. I liked the story, characters, dialogue and gameplay much more. Wish we could get a KOTOR3 one day, done by Obsidian! Also when you add the KOTOR2 RESTORATION mod to the mix this is even better! Adds alot to the game and the newest version just came out in July.If you want a fun old school rpg give this one a shot! This is also in my opinion the best star wars story yet. It is not so black and white with good vs evil, it is alot more of a grey area. More Obsidian magic, what more can I say?			"

												Truly could've been one of the best star wars games ever made if it hadn't been rushed. That said, I still say it's really worth playing. Massive props to the people who wrote and acted for the character Kreia, she stole the show with her superb dialog amplified by fantastic voice acting. She truly is one of my favorite star wars characters in the EU. Back when this first released I could understand peoples frustration due to the games climax, spending 50 dollars just to have the game stop when it wasn't over would've been extremely disappointing, though now that the game is only 10 dollars I would say it would be a complete mistake to miss out on this if you're a true star wars fan.

												I've never played Knights of the Old Republic (and it's 2015) so my review will be based on my experience alone. Personally, I don't think it's aged too well, graphically it looks like a PS2 game, the voice acting isn't great, and the default controls for a gamepad are missing some of the vital commands. (Support for gamepads are from a new update, but don't do the game full service)However, the game seems to be rich in dialogue, characters, Star Wars lore, and filled with RPG elements and plenty of loot to make each step feel rewarding. It does a great job to make you feel like you are in a large Star Wars Universe filled with uncertanties and adventure. (controlling droids is actually pretty cool)The combat system is... kind of dated. It's basically a real time action turn-based system where you select what attack you want to do, and your character will basically move for you and do the attack.  I kind of feel like this is where I was let down.  If there is ever a sequel, I'm hoping that it'll be more like an FPS or Third-Person with more user control. Overall, I feel like it's a good, but a bit dated. If you are a fan of RPGs, want some Star Wars lore, and are okay playing with some PS2 era graphics / gameplay, than I'd definitely reccomend this for $5 or so.			"

												Great game in general and in sequel to one of my favorite games.  And while it shares many similarities it does a lot to set itself apart from its predecessor.  Although this game was initially rushed to release and suffers on account of it, most of these quirks were covered up by a restoration mod that I used.  Things like fixing low resolution cut scenes, glitches, and adding back in a whole level among many others this mod is an absolute MUST.  One quirk that couldn’t be fixed by this though was the ending being a bit lackluster.  While it can only be assumed whether the ending was effected by this I can definitely tell the ending felt had less interesting decisions compared to the rest of the game.  If you have played the first Knights of the Old Republic, the game play is generally the same but really stands out with great dialog and deep characters as opposed to the original.  I feel like there was a bit more exploration present in the first Knight of the Old Republic as far as the world and environments, but even with a rushed release I feel that most of the components of 2 are on par with 1.  Where KOTOR 2 really shines though, is the sheer amount of amazing dialogue and dialogue choices with the many deep characters in this game.  It’s honestly mind blowing how connected you feel to the characters and how deep they are for a video game; one of the few games I’ve played personally that did so.  There are many dialogue choices and consequences that may block communication with others so you have to choose wisely and it’s not just a game about choosing every dialogue choice to get the most exposition.Like the KOTOR 1 this game also features a sort of karma system so that your actions in game affect your whether you are light side or dark side.  Decisions like this aren’t strictly for role-play however and will affect how well you can use either light or dark side force powers.  As opposed to the first game however, KOTOR 2 provides you with really interesting decisions to really bring out your character.  This game focuses on the grey areas of morality, like the negative effects of blindly doing good and the positive effects of the dark side as well.The deep dialogue, story decisions and consequences make this an amazing game for those looking for a deep role-playing experience and I would recommend this to anyone more into the role-playing aspect of RPG games.  Absolute beauty of a game.Restoration mod mentioned earlier in the review: http://www.moddb.com/mods/the-sith-lords-restored-content-mod-tslrcm "

												Obsidian is, as usual, the master of making great games that also suck.To preface, I did generally enjoy KOTOR 2.  But the combat is still unchanged and as hilariously unbalanced as the first game.  I played through with a Jedi Consular and obliterated everything as soon as I had the Force Lightning tree available to me.  To boot, as a Dark Sider with Force Crush, all I had to for all the end game bosses was literally stand perfectly still and spam that power over and over again.  It deals ridiculous amounts of damage, disables the target and is irresistable, meaning you effectively stop them from responding so long as you have force points.  And you can get a looooooot of +Max force point and regeneration upgrades.And then, jarringly, there are some sections of the game that are stupidly difficult and for all the wrong reasons.  See, if you're like me, you won't spend time optimizing every single party member with the best gear and character builds.  You'll probably have a few favorites you take out.  A lot of the companions, mechanically, are simply redundant.  So when there are sections of the game that FORCE you to play as a SPECIFIC character that you have not paid any attention to, you're in for a terrible time.  At one point I had to beat two melee mini-bosses with Atton.  Atton, who's only real combat strengths involve creeping up and dealing sneak attack damage.  Of course, you don't get to creep up for this fight.  You just start with two Twi'lek bounty hunters breathing down your neck.  I had to cheese that section with mines.This game is also a technical mess, even with the recent update.  With my card (AMD R9 200 series) and V-sync on I experienced egregiously distracting frame stutters.  But with V sync turned off, you encounter a bug where your character freezes after finishing combat unless you save/reload.  Thankfully this latter bug is only prevalent for the first few hours of the game for some reason, but it's still worth noting.  Other people have reported many other technical problems, and the game still crashes every so often.Finally, the story.  This is what you're really here for after all.  The narrative does deliver on most fronts; it's chock full of Star Wars lore and you basically get to experience several events that are considered canonical (although your choices may not be).  The characters are well written and there are a lot of choices to make.  My only gripe with the story was the ending.  Simply put, the ending felt rushed and unfinished.  This might be because I played with the Restored Content mod, but I can't imagine that not having that mod would do anything but make this problem worse.  There are certain cutscenes that are simply not followed upon.  A string of events happens near the last hour of the game and it's never really explained how or why.  I still don't know what happened to most of my companions by the time the credits rolled.  There was only some closure for a couple, with the rest seemingly forgotten about.  It was an underwhelming ending, and really, it just felt unfinished.  Both from a narrative standpoint and from a mechanical one (empty dull corridor after empty dull corridor full of bad guys to Force Storm.)KOTOR 2 is really the apposite Obsidian game to inform of the stereotype; flawed in just about every aspect, but with redeeming qualities in each, and still enjoyable as a whole.  At about 30-something mostly enjoyable hours for a playthrough, it's still worth a recommendation and the 10 dollar admission price.			"

However, know with the gift of Steam Workshop, the game is now perfect due to the TSLRCM Mod that restores content that the developers had to cut! This is a huge win for the KOTOR community and I am glad to be having fun with this game! I will finally be doing a series on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf_gVjTDjZ4v4YU9EnwgtVw "

												KOTOR 2 is hands down one of my top favorite games. I was a huge fan of the first one and fell in love with the second one. You can play this game without playing the first one, but you will miss some references and details. The gameplay is the same (fast turn-based) and is a true RPG but it doesn't bog you down with too much. The pause feature is also very helpful to plan combat, especially under a hard difficulty. The graphics are unfortunately a bit dated, so they have that early 2000s look. The music is wonderful and one of my favorite gaming soundtracks.The characters in KOTOR 2 are unique and you can access their backstories through character influence. There is still a Karma Meter but the main theme of KOTOR 2 is questioning the light/dark or Jedi/Sith dichonomy. The story does have holes due to the unfornuate rush to finish the game. This can best be seen in the ending, However, I would highly recommend the Restored Content Mod, which fixes some plot holes, adds deleted lines and characters, adds cut ending details, and fixes TONS of bugs: http://www.moddb.com/mods/the-sith-lords-restored-content-mod-tslrcmDespite the existing holes, the game is great. If you liked the first game, like Star Wars, or even just like RPGS, I would highly recommend giving the game a try!			"

												*DISCLAIMER: LIke my kotor 1 review i did not play this as a child, infact i just recently bought it but have been unable to beat it.*Many think as this game to be the little brother of KOTOR 1 who looks up and tries to be just like his brother. Well KOTOR 2 is like 1 a little too much for my taste. While this is a good game and i absolutley recommend this game take the following into concideration.1: It looks just like KOTOR 1 graphically wise almost as if they were unable to make any improvment, this isn't much of a problem but its just that KOTOR 1 was in 2003, this in 2005 you are really going to sit there and tell me you didn't have the ablilty to make it look any better than the one made 2 years ago? i know technology doesn't develop fast but the least they could do was give the character rounder noses so you didn't feel like you needed to wear saftey glasses while playing.2: Exact same battle system and control scheme.3: The story line does not feel very energetic to me, you are a ex-jedi running from the sith till you can build up enough strength to be able to storm in the capital ship singing ""take on me"" while slaughtering anything that even looks barely sentient. Other than that i really enjoy this game and highly recommend it to anyone getting into the star wars franchise 9/10			"

Improves on its already amazing predecessor one of the best Star Wars games of all time.

												*DISCLAIMER: LIke my kotor 1 review i did not play this as a child, infact i just recently bought it but have been unable to beat it.*Many think as this game to be the little brother of KOTOR 1 who looks up and tries to be just like his brother. Well KOTOR 2 is like 1 a little too much for my taste. While this is a good game and i absolutley recommend this game take the following into concideration.1: It looks just like KOTOR 1 graphically wise almost as if they were unable to make any improvment, this isn't much of a problem but its just that KOTOR 1 was in 2003, this in 2005 you are really going to sit there and tell me you didn't have the ablilty to make it look any better than the one made 2 years ago? i know technology doesn't develop fast but the least they could do was give the character rounder noses so you didn't feel like you needed to wear saftey glasses while playing.2: Exact same battle system and control scheme.3: The story line does not feel very energetic to me, you are a ex-jedi running from the sith till you can build up enough strength to be able to storm in the capital ship singing ""take on me"" while slaughtering anything that even looks barely sentient. Other than that i really enjoy this game and highly recommend it to anyone getting into the star wars franchise 9/10			"

												The original game is a masterpiece and if you don't own KOTOR go buy that instead. Now that I got rid of those people who haven't played KOTOR this is for those of you that have. KOTOR 2 is better. The game has bugs, pieces are broken, dialogue is meh, but despite all of this the game is amazing. With party interaction and depth to the characters many times deeper than KOTOR and a story that is darker and more ambiguous than the origonal game KOTOR 2 will stun and amaze. But, it does have some problems that you can't get past(due to lucasarts pushing an early release). Which is why I recommend the KOTOR 2 completion mod. The creator worked for 5 years to fix the errors in the original game. And frankly the mod makes a great game far better. All in All worth the $10 and if you aren't sure pick it up on sale. It's worth it.			"

												KOTOR II takes everything from the first KOTOR game and makes it all but perfect. Its fantastic storyline and good characters not only make this game one of the best ever, it could quite easily be the best Star Wars game ever made. The gameplay is addicting and fun, the characters are great, the planets and environments are beautiful, and it's got a lot of replay value. If you haven't played the game yet, then you are truly missing out on a gem, no, a diamond of a game.			"

												KOTOR 2 is hands down one of my top favorite games. I was a huge fan of the first one and fell in love with the second one. You can play this game without playing the first one, but you will miss some references and details. The gameplay is the same (fast turn-based) and is a true RPG but it doesn't bog you down with too much. The pause feature is also very helpful to plan combat, especially under a hard difficulty. The graphics are unfortunately a bit dated, so they have that early 2000s look. The music is wonderful and one of my favorite gaming soundtracks.The characters in KOTOR 2 are unique and you can access their backstories through character influence. There is still a Karma Meter but the main theme of KOTOR 2 is questioning the light/dark or Jedi/Sith dichonomy. The story does have holes due to the unfornuate rush to finish the game. This can best be seen in the ending, However, I would highly recommend the Restored Content Mod, which fixes some plot holes, adds deleted lines and characters, adds cut ending details, and fixes TONS of bugs: http://www.moddb.com/mods/the-sith-lords-restored-content-mod-tslrcmDespite the existing holes, the game is great. If you liked the first game, like Star Wars, or even just like RPGS, I would highly recommend giving the game a try!			"

												KOTOR II has been one of my favorite RPGs since the day I first played it. Many people seem to consider this game a disappointment after KOTOR I, but I played KOTOR I first and still prefer KOTOR II by orders of magnitude. In KOTOR II, you're playing as the Exile, a (you guessed it) exiled Jedi whose connection to the force was severed when he or she chose to walk away. As you progress, you slowly regain your character's former strength, and the main plot has you hunting down your former Jedi masters to either save or destroy them, depending on how you want to handle the situation.KOTOR II has excellent writing, first and foremost. Its moral choices are great, much better than those found in KOTOR I (which is a game I love dearly).  It has a better cast of villains that KOTOR I, which is something that can make or break a good story. The cast of party members is great, and your influence over them will affect their appearance, their demeanor, and even their skills. Many of the people who join your crew can be trained into Jedi (or Sith) if your influence over them is high enough, which is a great feature.A big difference between KOTOR I and KOTOR II is that in KOTOR II, you begin the game as a Jedi. It takes quite some time to be able to get your first lightsaber (although you can fast track the process by making the right choices), but starting out as a Jedi lets you build your character that way from the beginning, instead of KOTOR I's awkward pre-Jedi class system. Furthermore, when you reach a high enough level, you can choose a specialization for your character which grants new and unique abilities depending on your choice.It's true that this game has a lot of cut content, but we live in the age of The Sith Lords Restored Content mod, which takes an already great game and makes it into an undeniably better game that its predecessor. I cannot recommend that mod enough. Way back when, Obsidian was forced to rush KOTOR II out the door. As a result, a lot of planned content was cut. However, they shipped all that content with the game, hidden away and unusable, in the hopes that modders would take it and restore it. They did. Now that KOTOR II has Steam Workshop integration, installing the Restored Content mod is a breeze for anybody, and I would go so far as to say it's essential if you want the KOTOR II experience as it was meant to be.KOTOR II is honestly one of the only games I'd go so far to call a masterpiece. If you've ever avoided this game because you heard it's not as good as KOTOR I, I would urge you to give it a try and see how great it is for yourself. INSTALL THE RESTORED CONTENT MOD THOUGH.			"

The mission isn't designed well and becomes quite confusing and frustrating and with it being a mod there isn't alot of clear walkthroughs. After going through M4-78EP once I wouldn't want to again.

This game would be perfect if it hadn't been rushed by the publisher. Obsidian was only given only a year to make this. Howerver, if you download the ""KOTOR II: the Sith Lords Content Restored"" mod, all of the content that was cut due to time limitations, has been restored. I highly recommend installing this mod for a second playthrough. (Play the vanilla version first!)			"

 Review - Star Wars: Knight Of The Old Republic II - The Sith Lords === Rating: 9.5 / 10 - The Force is strong in this one === Disclaimer I have played this game using the Restored Content Mod, which you can find in the Workshop section. The mod doesn't modify the game in any way, but instead restores content that for many reasons has not been included in the original release by the Developers. I recommend this mod to enjoy a more complete experience, this game deserves it.===GRAPHICS - 8.5 / 10Considering this game is from 2005, graphics and art style are totally above average. Everything is very well made and polished, and if you crank up the resolution to maybe even 4K with some graphics driver tinkering, you will be amazed by the results this game still gives out.SOUND - 9.0 / 10All the effects are very similar or the same of the Star Wars movies, also the soundtrack and the spoken voice of the alien species you encounter, it is all faithful to the original series. Very high quality in this part, really helps with immersion during gameplay.GAMEPLAY - 10 / 10A master-crafted roleplaying experience. Deep combat system, meaningful and astonishingly articulated dialogue trees, myriads of interactions with NPCs and choices to be made. Tons of things to do, varied gameplay that never gets tedious or repetitive, but instead always proposes new things to the player and keeps him/her involved. Exceptional.CHALLENGE - 8.0 / 10On maximum difficulty, this game will give even to a seasoned role-playing enthusiast a good challenge. With endless party build possibilities and very varied enemies, you will never have to be too sure of your party's strenght, because around the corner there is always a greater challenge.=== The Good - Exceptional role-playing experience. As i said before, dialoges are stunningly articulate and will vary in major ways based upon your choices, alignment and several other factors. Choices you make will drastically change what happens to you, the world and your companions, granting top level replayability.- Exceptional combat system, i mean really, really good. Advanced saving mechanics, opposite attribute test mechanics, tons of different Roll types, all made exquisitely well and in real-time with dynamic pause system.- Absurd quantity of loot variety. There are literally 30-40 weapons per category, so that amount for melee weapons, blasters, rifles, modules, and so on. You will always find new stuff.- Quality crafting system. You will be able to craft upgrades, hacking devices, weapons from scratch, armor plates, and much more stuff with a crafting system influenced by attributes and skills, that will unlock new stuff progressively as your skill in a certain field rises. And there are many fields of expertise.- Meaningful and well-done Karma system, your choices will not only modify your alignment and your relationship with your companions, but also will influence combat, as you tend more towards the Dark or Light sideof the Force, or maybe neither of those, you will be granted unique abilities, bonuses and also maluses based on your actions. - Deep companions backstory, personality, variety, optional missions to gain their trust, aligments. all this flawlessly done. Nothing is what it seems as your companions may lie, may change during your jurney, based not only upon your choices but also bu the itneractions between them. Exquisite.- Tons upon tons of quests, if we count the bonus ones, the hidden ones, the secondary ones and the main quest, well let me tell you, there is a lot to do. Really a lot.- You will feel how the force changes your character. I mean, no spoilers obviously, if you choose the Dark Side you will be a very powerful Sith and then do more damage and be more powerful in battle... but what have you sacrificed to get that power? Instead if you stand in the middle ground and be Neutral or Light side maybe you won't have the raw power the Dark Side grants its disciples, but will have to resort to different means, maybe unaccessible to the Sith ways, to solve problems.- The story, main story i mean, is quite good. Varied, many possibilities, you won't expect what's coming, mystery, drama, all there. Not absurdly exceptional, but it does the job and maybe something more. Above average for sure.=== The Bad - Alright, in late, late game, Force Power built character, so a character that solely relies on Force Powers, is quite overpowered even at highest difficulty. If you are not careful you will die, i dont' mean steamrolling anything in your path, but some powers and some item combinations can make you and your party pretty powerful. Then again, you are supposed to be like that by being a master of the Force so it could be intended as part of the lore, but still for balance reasons i had to put this in the bad category. Not major flaw and no big deal.- Sometimes you will be forced to use certain character against your own will, this is quite bad because the game will not ever tell you, and you can find yourself with a completely unequipped character because you have all the good stuff on the main ones. This can lead to MAJOR frustration in some missions, and leads to the player having to reload a previous game, equip the guy good and then go with it. You can always give good stuff to all your companions, sure, but it will cost you!- There is a certain mission, involving a factory and that is all i will say, that is absurdly difficult and unbalanced. Now i am all for challenge, but this particular mission WILL force you to use only one party member, and you will not be able to leave the area until mission complete, against very powerful enemies in huge quantities. Very unbalanced honestly, but is possible. Will make you very angry believe me.- There is a bug that happens in the first stages of the game at random. It causes your character to freeze after a fight, so you have to save, reload and then will be fixed. This is random and if it happens you stick with it for a good part of the first 2 areas of the game, but then it just disappears.=== The Ugly There is nothing ugly here my friends.=== Conclusions This is hands down the best Star Wars game ever made in all of history. I have played them all, i know them, and this one is the one to rule them all.Obsidian, again, never disapponts in RPGs, delivering an experience that can be compared to only the best and finest RPGs out there, maybe Dragon Age Origins, System Shock 2 or Pillars of Eternity can hold a candle to this game, that righteously is in the pantheon of the best of them all.Like Star Wars?

However, know with the gift of Steam Workshop, the game is now perfect due to the TSLRCM Mod that restores content that the developers had to cut! This is a huge win for the KOTOR community and I am glad to be having fun with this game! I will finally be doing a series on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf_gVjTDjZ4v4YU9EnwgtVw "

												Holy crap is the battle system better than the first! Much less glitchy, and while the story is not nearly as original and surpising, it still grips you and draws you in. One of my childhood favorites, and it's still an amazing game today.			"

												In KotOR I, the underlying question was always ""Are you good or evil?"" In Obsidian's KotOR 2: The Sith Lords, the question quickly becomes ""What is good? What is evil?""This is the key difference between the two, because otherwise not much has changed. There are little improvements, such as being able to influence your companions in more meaningful ways, perhaps even in ways they don't agree with. But the main differences, which sets it apart from its predecessor by miles and miles, are the characters, the story, and its almost critical treatment of the Star Wars universe.KotOR I was an amazing game that faithfully translated the Star Wars Experience. You have a crew, you travel through space, you become a Jedi, you face the temptations of the dark side, and challenge an evil force in the galaxy. But for all its achievements, it was a very black/white experience with very little gray area. In fact, BioWare seemed to draw some novelty of the fact it introduced a ""Gray Jedi"" in the form of Jolee Bindo, who was neither good nor evil.For Obsidian's outing, *everything* resides in that gray area, not just one character. Every decision you make will be called into question; your profound acts of charity will be deemed selfish and ignorant, while your outrageous acts of tyranny will be deemed weak and cowardly. If you go by the morality scale KotOR I favored, you will not be able to win, and that's really the point. There are no absolutes in life -- giving some credits to a beggar on Nar Shaddaa will get him beaten and robbed later on, and treating the same beggar with malice will encourage him to treat others in the same manner -- and the game's characters will encourage you to make informed decisions over choices made solely to improve your good/evil alignment.This makes Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2 - The Sith Lords a tremendously engaging experience as far as immersion, choice, and consequence, with memorable characters who strive to be more than the SW archetypes we've become familiar with, and a masterful story that dives into dark territory that few storytellers in the Expanded Universe have bothered to touch. It's a very unique experience and, in my opinion, boasts some of the finest writing in a video game, period.It's an old game, but a great one -- and one that's stuck with me for nearly a decade. If you decide to take the leap, be sure and download the KotOR 2 Restoration Mod for the definitive experience.			"

												One of the best RPGs ever made. Be a dark-side badass (or a goody-goody Jedi, I guess), and work your way through a variety of planets collecting a motley crew of scum and villainy who are like the Dirty Dozen with more personality issues. Better than the original in pretty much every way (except for the lack of sweet masks), and a real achievement. Great writing, good combat, fantastic characters - buy it now, god dammit.P.S. For ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s - Force Persuade is the most wonderful thing.			"

												I'm a sucker for the KotOR franchise apparently, the amount of story here is incredible, at this juncture I am 25 hours in and have probably only completed a quarter of the game. If you have a mac and are running it through bootcamp with an NVIDIA graphics card, or just have an NVIDIA graphics card, be sure to install the most recent drivers and before playing the game set it so it only runs on one CPU otherwise the game doesn't work. Also download ""The Sith Lords Restored Content mod,"" it fixes a bunch of bugs (of which, admittedly, there are many). Lastly save. A lot. There are some sudden encounters that will destroy you without notice the first time and take some strategy to get through.			"

												I like the first game a lot more, primarily because it did not rely on the restored content patch to be so great. That said, I liked this one a lot. For the most part the game is the same as the first with returning characters, powers, and combat system.Pros(+) Highly immersive for new Star Wars fans and old.(+) Lots of quests, characters, and activities that can suck you in for well over 100 hours.(+) Great customization even for its time it still holds up today.(+) Powerful force abilities like Death Field and Force Lightning.(+) Neutral Options for ‘that guy’ who doesn’t want to play full good or evil.No Opinion(/) Combat system is flawed but forgivable. Your character will sometimes charge when you order them to heal.(/) Ranged combat will never be as effective as close combat, sadly.(/) You’ll use certain characters more than others. (Sorry, pretty much anyone without a lightsaber)(/) Invisible walls galore. (/) No real reason to speeder race like in the first game.Cons(-) BUGS. Crashes, freezes, not loading, broken characters, glitches. Console or PC this game will bug out at least once.(-) No fast travel like in first game but that might have been console only. I don’t remember.(-) Some traits and feats mean little, bosses will still hit you and hurt you.(-) Relies on restored content to be better than just the regular game.(-) Kreia. Just Kreia. "

												Many people consider this game inferior to KOTOR.  I think they are wrong.  With the SIth Lords Restored Content Mod, this game goes from a flawed but wonderful game into one of the greatest games of all time.  Everything in KOTOR is expanded and improved.  Play it through both light and dark, and male and female.  So much choice, so much fun!  Don't forget to get the following mods: TSLRCM and M4-78EP.  They are crucial to making this game the best it can be.			"

												Truly an underrated masterpiece. One of the most engaging stories of any RPG I've ever played and manages to stay fresh even after so many years. Dialogue and character development were impeccable, especially Kreia, being one of the deepest and profound characters I've encountered in any video game. The amount of ways you can play through the campaign is boggling, I've run through this game about 4 times and still I feel like there were things that I missed.The Restored Content Mod is vital to anyone who's played this game before. It gives a more satisfying ending as well as some extra cutscenes. Wouldn't recomment the M4-78 Mod though. Though enticing as the prospect of an extra planet is, the maps were horribly designed and badly paced. It physically pained me to play M4-78. PLAY. THIS. GAME.			"

												Anyone saying KOTOR 1 is the better game is... wrong.KOTOR 2 feels less like traditional Star Wars however. You still carry the signature lightsaber although it's hard to come by at last. Story is more brooding and contains a lot of text and talking. The traditional good and evil appear more greyish although simple choices still exist at gameplay level. (redeem or kill etc.)Had Lucas grown up after the original trilogy like we did he might have made a story like that instead he made the soulless and senseless prequel trilogy.Good things: -old-school ""like"" Bioware, no hand-holding-deeper characters and story compared to KOTOR 1, better battles-D&D 3 Ruleset-HK 47 returns, meatbags!-fleshed out companions with own agenda and a lot of lying involved-force lightningBad things?:-dated graphics and gameplay-old school, no conveniently placed autosaves, you must remember to tap f4 yourself-few bugs-difficult ruleset-almost no romance, sniffSome content was cut in the game, so install ""restored content mod"" by some nice dudes to get more content back. TLDR; should be played by fans of classic year 2000+ RPGs. It's good and despite the age still addicting.			"

												As a massive Star Wars fan and RPG fan, and a huuuuuuuge KOTOR fan, I believe KOTOR 2 TSL lives up to the first game.Rating: 9/10Pros:- A good, classic RPG.- In depth story & lore. There's a lot of detail that I feel was ahead of its time.- Just plain overall fun. It's easy to learn, easy to play, but hard to beat.- PUZZLES! I enjoy me some puzzles, and this game has them of all sorts of difficulties.Cons:- The game was rushed, so there's some bugs & missing content. THANKFULLY there's a mod that finished the missing content and fixed the bugs, and it's available here on the Workshop!- It can get *really* hard at points. I don't mind, I like a good challenge, but if you're an RPG breezer style player you're going to hit some rough spots in the game. "

												Easily one of the greatest games of all time. 10 years later the characters still haunt me. I still can't think of the Force the same way after playing this game. It's examination of what the Force is and what is means to connect to it, Jedi or Sith. There is a depth to the story that few books, games, movies, comics, or any other media can touch. There are hard choices and a hardness to the story that truly makes it stand out among it's peers. KoToR 1 was A New Hope, bright and hopeful, black and white, just touching on the edges of a deep and murky pool. KoToR 2 is Empire Strikes Back. The true depth of the universe is unveiled and it is a much more serious and grey, melancholy and doubt and revelation intertwined. The combat is wonderful. Using a d20 based combat system the options are limitless and powerful. By the end of the game you truly feel like a seasoned Sith or Jedi Master, crushing armies with a gesture.The recent update has made the game even better. Bugfixes and native widescreen support alongside the Steam Workshop. The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod (TSLRCM) in nearly required. It adds tons of content and story that was cut for reasons left unexplained. Buy it, play it, remember it in 10 years and wonder how you can change the galaxy the next time.			"

This is a huge win for the KOTOR community and I am glad to be having fun with this game! I will finally be doing a series on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf_gVjTDjZ4v4YU9EnwgtVw "

												+Decent story+Improved gameplay+More feats and force powers+Prestige classes+Mandalore-Worse story compared to the first game-Incomplete, in typical Obsidian fashion-Dreadfully boring starting mission on Peragus-Nar Shaddaa somehow even worse than Peragus, playing as Mira put me on suicide watch-Kreia's constant ♥♥♥♥♥ing-Very few decent companions. The game either couldn't make me care less about the rest, or made me hate them-Disappointing boss fights-Malachor V mentioned every 10 ♥♥♥♥in' minutes-ObsidianNot nearly as good as the first game, but still a great game.

												This is a VERY underrated game. While it is unfinished an easy mod installation will fix most of that. This game is very fun but with it's witty dialogue, thought provoking morals and points, and one of the best stories I've ever seen. (Tied along with KOTOR 1 of course.) This game is AMAZING a true masterpiece, Obsidian is known to me for occasionally dropping down games I play, and when they drop them down MAN do they drop them down. Fallout: New Vegas and this game are both in my top ten favorite games of ALL TIME! (I am not mentioning Bioware because they didn't work on this game as much as Obsidian but rest assured KOTOR 1 is in my top ten too.)			"

												A flawed classic. There are so many ways to complete quests and different dialogue choices that change the story. The combat can be unbalanced when you get your first lightsaber and you just spam master flurry attack. Once you get a lightsaber, there is no better weapon and you might as well duel-wield them rather than go two-handed as you do more damage overall. You actually don't get your first lightsaber until 7-10 hours into the game. Instead you have to build it by completing optional quests (make sure to look up the Nar Shadaa one, it is very easy to screw up the quest that gives you a part). The lightsaber is teased multiple times throughout the first two planets, but it isn't a let down when you get it. Instead, it opens up new unlockable moves such as using force jump to jump thirty feet and stab a guy and a dialogue tree to become a true Jedi or Sith, which unlocks more moves!TLDR: If you can get around the crashes and performance issues, you can find an experience akin to Bioware's Mass Effect series (they also made KoTR1) and Fallout New Vegas (which was also made by Obsidian).Update: Whelp, they updated the game. Now there aren't any bugs, crashes, or performance issues. Now you can also use a controller, which is awesome as I first played this on the original Xbox. The story is still pretty sweet and so is the combat, but it can be quite unforgiving if you don't pay attention and blaze through everything without reading (Hint: you may think force speed is trash, but it allows you to attack two extra times each turn you attack. Master flurry also gives you an extra attack with no downsides, so spend those rare upgrade points wisely!)			"

												Obsidian no surprises here has taken the Knights of the Old Republic franchise and actually improved it gameplay wise by implementing new features like a more advanced crafting system, the lightsaber forms and a wider range of abilities in general. I was particularly overjoyed by the lightsaber forms as I felt Obsidian had paid close attention to the Star Wars lore and each form brought something new to the table and promoted a more strategic approach to fights.  Story wise, I felt Obsidian made an impressive story but it did feel a little too cryptic and convoluted at times and I have to admit that the first game set the bar very high with the amazing twist which this game lacked. However, the characters were astounding and I loved the Handmaiden's backstory in particular and I could tell that Obsidian had invested a lot of thought and time to make these characters relatable and likeable.  I felt that this game was less bug ridden than it's predecessor and it ran smoother altogether which is always nice even though it wasn't free of bugs entirely as at times some cutscenes skipped for whatever reason. Once again, the choices you make in the game heavily influence what kind of character you become and the interactions you have with your crew and Obsidian proves that KOTOR is one of the best titles when it comes to decision making.  Another triumph by Obsidian here and a more than worthy sequel and I expect more greatness from them in the future.			"

												This game is one of my favorite games out of all the Star Wars games I have played. A lot of people will tell you how broken and buggy it is, but in all honesty, I blame Obsidian. They have a history of taking great games and copy/pasting them into a new game with some extra stuff and a ton of bugs (*cough cough* Fallout: New Vegas *cough cough*). Basically, that is what this game is. It plays just like the original, looks just like the original, and is just as great as the original. This is not what most want out of a sequel. I was disappointed at first by the lack of originality and lack of new looks and feels. It was more of a big expansion. The same game as the first.But while I sit here and make the game sound awful, worry not! It actually is a fantastic game. The game's story takes you on a journey across a bunch of awesome planets (I <3 the Onderon/Dxun stuff) and the dialogue is extremely well written. Each character has a huge and deep past that you can figure out as you travel with them and watch them react to your actions. Mandalore might think you are a stupid runt that could never be as great as those damn Mandalorians for giving some credits to a beggar, but Visas might think that it is a noble and beautiful act. Maybe Atton, who used to hate when you were cruel to people, now relishes in every innocent victim you slaughter for no apparent reason (Yo, dawg, the Force has no power in Hell, so go Light Side or go home). Shaping the will of others is an incredible part of this game that you can make different each time you play it. All in all, the game is incredible. If you can acually get the game to start up properly, actually avoid all of the grass block bugs on Dxun and Dantooine, and avoid the annoying dialogue skipping glitches (which can be avoided by taking a break from the game and booting it up after a walk in some sunlight), you are going to really enjoy yourself with this masterpiece of a game. You don't have to play the first one, but I recommend doing that because it also has a story and writing to die for. I'm a sucker for good video game dialogue. Get out there and kill some Sith Lords.			"

												I played this years ago back on the original xbox and I have to admit I enjoyed this game far more than the first KOTOR. Personally I think the sith lords is heavily underrrated compared to the first game in the series.The gameplay is pretty much the same as the first games with a couple of tweaks but not much but needless to say it plays well for it's time.What really got to me was the story, it was downright dark and bleak compared to KOTOR 1's plot and that was something I loved about this. The story spared no punches and even parts of it's themes dissected the star wars universe and mythos allowing us to see it in new ways and ask some questions about it. The story was pretty deep and had some unique characters which is why the expanded universe retcon was such a heavy blow for fans like myself(but we have the clone wars etc we're good LOL111)But snark aside this is a good game. If you enjoyed the first one then you will most likely enjoy this but I would say it's worth getting the lost content mod because it restores a lot of meat to the game. theres also a couple of other mods worth hunting down to polish things and add a few extras if that floats your boat.

												This is an interesting take on Star Wars, the Old Republic timeline. KOTOR 1 was astronomically critically successful, so I'll assume familiarity with that. This sequel to that legendary RPG takes things further and is 100% worth your time. Bioware's KOTOR 1 was about Good vs Evil, and was groundbreaking with its moral decisions and player agency. Obsidian's KOTOR 2 is a deconstruction of the more normal Good vs Evil themes - it goes deeper into questions of what makes right and what makes wrong. It's not just about choosing to be good or choosing to be bad - Obsidian put more effort into making the themes more nuanced than that, and often the player will second-guess their choices and think very carefully about such things as greater goods, or ends justifying means - moreso than in the more straight forward KOTOR 1, anyway.   KOTOR 1 is a great game and one of my all-time favorite RPGs. KOTOR 2 one-ups it in narrative and maintains the same gameplay and structure that made KOTOR 1 great.     Be sure to get the Sith Lords Restored mod that is on the Steam Workshop. KOTOR 2 was originally released in quite a rushed state (as Obsidian games unfortunately often are) but that mod ""restores"" much of the missing content and really improves the base game.    "

												A worthy sequel to the first game, if anything I would've liked to see more variation and a bigger step forward, but this was a very rushed sequel. If you're looking for more KOTOR, then you must play this(get the restored content mod, otherwise I hear this game is pretty awful, this and a few other force power mods made my playthrough really fun). If you weren't a fan of the original, then you definitely won't be liking this one. Story is worse and some of the characters aren't very interesting. A few cast members from the first game show up, and the few new characters seem pretty much like new versions of old ones. Still, I'd definitely recommend it for any RPG fan, and a must play for a huge KOTOR fan like myself.			"

												Update: The update has made it that much better, it was such a enjoyable experience with the acheivments.Kotor 2 is one of the best rpg's of all time, and one of the best star war's games, if not the very best.Pro's:The story is truely amazing,The gameplay is fun with ways to edit it to make it more enjoyable (Such as makeing it pause after evrey attack, or kep going)Character Leveling is very well done (Makes you fill like your playing a table top game)Side missions are very intresting, many of them are very very fun, and add great addition to the game. The soundtrack goes along with the game very well.Good/ Evil system, makes you really think about your actions, and what the consequnces will be.Hk-47 Is really Kick ***, and has some of the best lines in gaming history. What really sets this game apart from the first one (Which is also good, but no where as good as kotor 2)Is your companions. Dont like one of them? Disagree with evreything and lose influenceLike one of them? They will be influenced moreDont want to collect parts for one? Sucks for you, you miss out on a amazing character concept.Say the right thing's to a person? You can learn more about their pastWish someone was a jedi? With enough influence and talking, you can get most characters down this path.Your playing a good character? Your allies will go down this path as well, giveing better responses.Going down the bad path? Your allies will go down also, Their character portrits will change also (baodur looks awesome down the bad path btw)What is your characters gender? One allie depends on this. The cons:Can be glitchy at times(even though i alredy said glitchy) The jedi temple with atris is completly brokenSome of the worlds can get boreing after multiple play throughs (But this happens on any game)The fact that its a perfect game, and it makes it difficult to think of cons.This is overall a perfect game11/10 Defently worth playing			"

I remember the load times being stupidly long. They weren't on the PC.I wasen't able to finish it because I couldn't beat the final boss.I was able to here.Not to mention the replayibilty! So many playthroughs you can do.Lightside? Sure. Darkside? Awesome. Kill your friends? Sure! Total♥♥♥♥♥♥to everyone? That's ok!10/10 nostalgia run best run			"

												This game is an absolute necessity for any Star Wars fan. As much as I love Bioware's effort with the first KOTOR, Obsidian really just brings it home with KOTOR II. Obviously, I must strongly suggest you instal the Sith Lords Restored Content mod (found on ModDB.com). I am not a modder even in the broadest sense of the word (this is actually the one and only mod I have ever installed for  a PC game), but it is absolutely a necessity to fully enjoy all of the content of this game. 100% must play for any sci-fi RPG fan, and even moreso for Star Wars fans.

												Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic I was nice; but in a way the story was somewhat predictable, certainly not in a bad way, but there were two main options - good or bad. Knights of the Old Republic II remedies this by introducing far more ambiguious characters and a third more neutral stance in dialouge options and action options; for the more pragmatic Jedi. But sadly when released it seems Bioware may have ran out of time to finish it for the deadline and some important bits got cut out or ommitted; thankfully some dedicated modder types released the ""restored content mod"", aptly titled, it fills in the blanks that were cut. (See ModDB for the content mod) Other than this KOTR II polishes up the KOTR I engine in a technical sense and adds more depth to weapon customisation, item creation and character interaction. So despite being a little dated by todays standards it still should be on any self respecting Star Wars fans list; even without the content mod it should still provide good fun and hours of gameplay. And for those who pay very close attention you can see where the Mass Effect series was born but in a different franchise.			"

												I thought, when I got this game a second time (originally having played on the Xbox HUEG), I had perhaps been having rose-colored glasses remembering it too fondly as one of the best written Bioware (or whatever the studio Jesus Christ give me a break my voice hadn't even broken yet back then) games. If only they had kept those writers for another game that recently came out that rhymes with Ben Affleck: Another Brawny Movie.Anyway, enough of the passive aggressiveness, one reason I had so loved I and II as a child, and more so enjoyed them now since my big boy brain understands themes and superb writing, is how well both I and II handled ""Evil"". Evil is a nebulous concept, yet we can generally point to things and say without a doubt, ""That's evil"", such as many people will say dictators ordering the death of thousands or millions of innocent people are evil, that radicalized religious extremists conducting violence or acts of terror are evil, or that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who kept using a lag switch in ♥♥♥♥ing Halo 3 so you could get the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ katana armor but couldn't get ♥♥♥♥ing Mongoose Mowdown, RICK. Got off track, but many games' writers, try as they might (and writing concepts such as evil are not easy) simply miswrite ""Evil"" as just being a murderous♥♥♥♥♥♥ Hitler wasn't a♥♥♥♥♥♥ he was extremely charismatic and most people are willing to say that he or his methodology was evil (Himmler was apparently a♥♥♥♥♥♥though and arguably more evil). Or those cults' leaders that may go into shootouts with police and then immolate their followers to, I don't know, weird♥♥♥♥♥♥  Shepard in Crass Defect 2 and 3 for example, was just a♥♥♥♥♥♥ there was nothing evil about him/her, though one can argue that it's ""Paragon and Renegade"", not ""good and evil"", okay I'll give some leeway to that, albeit s(he) had moments where  you can break the nebulousness of ""Evil"" and say, ""yeah that was evil"" allowing the Saladman to disseminate a more efficient form of the genophage, for exampleIn my objectively true opinion, the definite, absolute core of what evil is, is corruption. And that is the core of your character in KotOR I and II, you can corrupt these people who've such strong beliefs and philosophies to the side you've chosen just by proving to them your way is correct without coercion or threats, that, is well-written evil. Though I do believe KotOR I did a better job of demonstrating it in action, but it also had an entire section of the game dedicated to a Sith academy.And then there's the Good way too but no one cares about that.I posted a picture of the Darth Maul looking dude in a video game group I'm in on Facebook saying I couldn't remember him, and they thought I was ♥♥♥♥ing memeing, I was serious!Uhh about the actual mechanics, combat is essentially board-game RNG put into 3 dimensional interactive form. AND IF YOU SAY IT'S NOT RNG THEN EXPLAIN HOW I MISSED A LOCKER THREE TIMES WHILE ONLY 2 FEET AWAY WITH A MELEE WEAPON. If you choose light side, the end boss fight is just ♥♥♥♥ing awful; dark side always has better powers, and I didn't like Sass Reject 2, almost at all, everything was orange, and thermal clips is the stupidest ♥♥♥♥ing idea I've ever heard of.This game and its prequel are the epitome of creating a meaningful binary philosophy, and should always be included in game developer type majors in schools to demonstrate how to create a strong narrative. Thanks to the devs for coming back and basically adding all the stuff they didn't get to put into the game at the time it came out, for free as well, unlike some developers, with names rhyming with Berate.Thanks for reading and God bless.

												A flawed classic. There are so many ways to complete quests and different dialogue choices that change the story. The combat can be unbalanced when you get your first lightsaber and you just spam master flurry attack. Once you get a lightsaber, there is no better weapon and you might as well duel-wield them rather than go two-handed as you do more damage overall. You actually don't get your first lightsaber until 7-10 hours into the game. Instead you have to build it by completing optional quests (make sure to look up the Nar Shadaa one, it is very easy to screw up the quest that gives you a part). The lightsaber is teased multiple times throughout the first two planets, but it isn't a let down when you get it. Instead, it opens up new unlockable moves such as using force jump to jump thirty feet and stab a guy and a dialogue tree to become a true Jedi or Sith, which unlocks more moves!TLDR: If you can get around the crashes and performance issues, you can find an experience akin to Bioware's Mass Effect series (they also made KoTR1) and Fallout New Vegas (which was also made by Obsidian).Update: Whelp, they updated the game. Now there aren't any bugs, crashes, or performance issues. Now you can also use a controller, which is awesome as I first played this on the original Xbox. The story is still pretty sweet and so is the combat, but it can be quite unforgiving if you don't pay attention and blaze through everything without reading (Hint: you may think force speed is trash, but it allows you to attack two extra times each turn you attack. Master flurry also gives you an extra attack with no downsides, so spend those rare upgrade points wisely!)			"

												So first my hours via Steam Client for Star Wars:Knights of the Old Republic II isn't neccessarly correct to my actual hours playing this with my psyhical copy that i own. This and Morrowind should belong in any true Pc gamer's collection. It's an instant classic. I would rate this port for Steam 9/10 from the original's rating i would give (10/10) because it took me about 5-10 minutes of research to get it to play on newer OS systems. Which to get it to run wasn't to much of a hassel (honestly a couple clicks of a button thanks to help from two other Steam clients) The game seems to run like it's CD counter part and i haven't experienced any glitches yet, which in all respect no game is perfect. There's always flaws and exspecially with and older game expect many fun and heart breaking glitches. This game should be for any RPG gamer or Star Wars fan. Which i am of both. The graphics maybe a bit out dated but they're tolerable,and if you're like me you actually prefer the older graphics ( i know i'm weird) but older graphics don't seem to bother me. BUT if you're the type of gamer who can't stand old,out dated graphics then i'm sure somewheres you can find a mod for this game because any PC gamer needs to and should play this. Willl update review when more hours get put into this game but for now this is my Review via 4 hours into it. ""May the force be with you""			"

												Obsidian no surprises here has taken the Knights of the Old Republic franchise and actually improved it gameplay wise by implementing new features like a more advanced crafting system, the lightsaber forms and a wider range of abilities in general. I was particularly overjoyed by the lightsaber forms as I felt Obsidian had paid close attention to the Star Wars lore and each form brought something new to the table and promoted a more strategic approach to fights.  Story wise, I felt Obsidian made an impressive story but it did feel a little too cryptic and convoluted at times and I have to admit that the first game set the bar very high with the amazing twist which this game lacked. However, the characters were astounding and I loved the Handmaiden's backstory in particular and I could tell that Obsidian had invested a lot of thought and time to make these characters relatable and likeable.  I felt that this game was less bug ridden than it's predecessor and it ran smoother altogether which is always nice even though it wasn't free of bugs entirely as at times some cutscenes skipped for whatever reason. Once again, the choices you make in the game heavily influence what kind of character you become and the interactions you have with your crew and Obsidian proves that KOTOR is one of the best titles when it comes to decision making.  Another triumph by Obsidian here and a more than worthy sequel and I expect more greatness from them in the future.			"

												THIS IS EASILY ONE OF THE GREATEST STAR WARS GAMES EVER:Star wars knights of the old republic is, in my opinion, the best in the series and has a wonderfull storyline, but these are not the only reasons I love this game so much, yes, I said LOVE.I, truly love this game because of all of the memories I have playing it, this game has always brought me comfort if I was feeling sad and it will continue to do so. But the reason I love it so much is because of my best friend and the best 5 years of my life.It all started on Christmas day 2008, I was an excited kid ready to open his gift, and guess what it was, an actual never-before opened copy of Star Wars Knights Of the Old Republic II. I was allowed to play the game afterwards and at first I found it quite confusing, but now it's like a third language to me. But now let's get into why this game is really special. Every weekend, if I was lucky, my best friend and I would have a sleep over at each others house. Every weekend we would play star wars knights of the old republic, we would always take turns, playing with our own and each others characters. but then in 2010 our dog rummaged through my games, and decided to destroy my copy of this game. It's needless to say that I was furious. But the thing is, that only cd3 and 4 broke, the other two were completely damaged. This meant that I could only play this at my friend's house, but we didn't mind. Me and my friend played it untill our very last year together, before I moved.I rate this game, and the memories that come with it 999999999999/10Live long Hornik Hayne			"

												A proper sequel to one of the best RPGs from Bioware, developed by Obsidian. More Jedi options, a more interesting(though originally incomplete) plot and characters, it has everything the original game had and more. Now with easy access to mods that not only clean up the game but restore the lost content, the complete version can be played and it practically a new game. It still has issues in that there is no easy way to get HD support and there are some engine issues that require restarts of the game but beyond that, it is a great game. If you're a fan of RPGs or Star Wars this is a fantastic game to get. And it is a no brainer for fans of the first game.			"

												Note: Almost 100% copy-paste from my review of KOTOR 1, as I had little else to add. Personal rating: 10/10Replayability: MediumBudget: Worth it, unless you dislike Star Wars severely. Lenght: A few days to a week. KOTOR II is one of the best roleplaying games I've ever played, while gameplay wise better than KOTOR I, the plot and main character are both slightly less interesting, but non the less, the game is extremely captivating. Anthing that I should point out as a serious mistake from the developers side, is that you can only have 3 active party members at a time. Instead of such a set up, I'd have preferred if encounters were just that much harder, and you'd need all 9 or however many party members it is you have. Many party members end up just being ""extras"" in the story, only taken out for air when you realize it's been a while, and you need to level them up, and possibly unlock some dialogue with them. Many other games pull the same stunt, such as Dragon Age or Mass Effect, and it's equally silly. If you have the man-power, use it!. Apart from that, this game, being a Star Wars game, dives head first into the lore and setting for Star Wars and introduces villains and heroes that can compete with the heroes from the original trilogy. The plot of the story is, I'd say, even better than that of the original movies, and much more immersive. Gameplay wise, the game is very similar to dragon age origins. Any Star Wars fan should play this game. Any RPG fan should play this game and become a star wars fan.			"

												Do not buy this game unless you understand that if you run windows 10, you'll be pressing f4 and f5 a lot because for some reason windows 10 is incapable of understanding the games mesh's unless the music for combat stops/changes.  That being said.  This is easily one of my all time favorite games.  Anything obsidian touches is sheer brilliance, and any gameplay faults lie with the greedy♥♥♥♥♥developers who forced them to release an unfinished game, and still refuse to let them fully release it.  That being said, there is a restoration mod in the workshop.  Do download it if you purchase this.			"

												This game is an absolute necessity for any Star Wars fan. As much as I love Bioware's effort with the first KOTOR, Obsidian really just brings it home with KOTOR II. Obviously, I must strongly suggest you instal the Sith Lords Restored Content mod (found on ModDB.com). I am not a modder even in the broadest sense of the word (this is actually the one and only mod I have ever installed for  a PC game), but it is absolutely a necessity to fully enjoy all of the content of this game. 100% must play for any sci-fi RPG fan, and even moreso for Star Wars fans.

												Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic I was nice; but in a way the story was somewhat predictable, certainly not in a bad way, but there were two main options - good or bad. Knights of the Old Republic II remedies this by introducing far more ambiguious characters and a third more neutral stance in dialouge options and action options; for the more pragmatic Jedi. But sadly when released it seems Bioware may have ran out of time to finish it for the deadline and some important bits got cut out or ommitted; thankfully some dedicated modder types released the ""restored content mod"", aptly titled, it fills in the blanks that were cut. (See ModDB for the content mod) Other than this KOTR II polishes up the KOTR I engine in a technical sense and adds more depth to weapon customisation, item creation and character interaction. So despite being a little dated by todays standards it still should be on any self respecting Star Wars fans list; even without the content mod it should still provide good fun and hours of gameplay. And for those who pay very close attention you can see where the Mass Effect series was born but in a different franchise.			"

												Well as a more distant sequel to the first game, they give you KOTOR II.KOTOR II has a lot more depth when it comes to gameplay overall and different battle interactions.But at the same time is riddled with something im going to talk about.The story aspect has been driven away from the traditional KOTOR/RPG style, instead of a two sided light/vs/dark there is a far more greyzoned area, which will make you think again of who is really right and wrong in your aspect.There are several nods to the previous game (no spoilers) such as Carth, Bastila, your characters future fate, depending on what path you chose and descision made throughout the game.This makes the story part a WHOLE lot intresting as it creates a dilemma where right is hard to tell from wrong.Now enough about this, the biggest downsides to this sequel was the production period. The game was rushed, and a lot of content cut, no debate, and as a result there is a huge amount of content missing, and a lot of, and when I say a lot of I MEAN A LOT OF BUGS, some which may even be game breaking, to a point where you are forced to restart or go a load way back to a earlier save. (trust me I had to play through this twice to even get half through the game)Now this can be fixed by installing the TLSCRM mod which, through amazing modders enabled players to play cut content with a lot less bugs, as well as fixed and missing dialogue and bug fixes in the game itself, honestly I can´t even think of how I would´ve gotten through the game without this mod.Anyway conlusively this game is definitly worth it for the story, the combat is meh, and is sadly bug ravaged, execpt with the TLSCRM mod, which is practially essential.

												This game is an interesting beast.Obsidian was rushed during the developing of the game and was forced to release it without fulfilling their vision of the game, and thus it has a LOT of missing content.Thankfully, there is a mod that restores some of the content that was cut from the game, and trust me, it really improves the experience and fills a lot of holes in the story. If for some godly reason you decide that you want the vanilla experience, well, it's still a good game, but missing vast chunks that by the end of the game make you feel like you somehow missed some of the story.With the restored content mod this game becomes a solid 10/10Without it it's an 8/10Visas best waifu.

												One of my favorite games of all time.  It tears down everything that Knights of the Old Republic built up and questions some of the core assumptions of the Star Wars universe.  Interesting, well written characters that have their own motivations and don't fit into traditional niches.  The gameplay is more of the same, but it lets you build up your Jedi to be an overpowered god, which is the goal of every RPG derived from D&D.  The recent update added support for mods on Steam and modern resolutions.  Make sure to play it with the Restored Content mod.			"

Don't worry about the first game, you can just jump into KOTOR ll completely unaware of the Star War franchise as a whole and still do just fine. A must for gamers that like sci fi and for those seeking the feeling of wanting to be good but being so bad, or vice versa. 10/10 Would have the light and dark side battle it out inside of me again.

												I literally could not be happier with this development, and especially now that the game is rightly regarded as a brilliant classic. See, I got it on release and remember the sheer, unfiltered hate that this game recieved.  This was pretty much all because it wasn't KOTOR 1 - a by-the-numbers RPG with a hot jedi lady and redeemed by a masterful plot twist.   Reading the hate was like visiting the COD forum, bland idiocy about how Atton wasn't Carth (Thank God for that, he's one of the most boring characters ever) - or how there wasn't an easy surrogate for Bastilla in this game (OMFG NO WAIFU?!?! what am I gonna dooooooO!)In fact this pretty mucy sums up Kotor2 in a nutshell.  It has a far darker, more complex story than the first with fewer cliches and cop outs - and of course Kreia, one of the best characters ever in a game.Although the cut content in the original did give the second half of the game a very appropriate feeling of desolate emptiness, the restoration patch greatly improves the overall quality of the game and, though the barren finale somehow made sense to me in vanilla (how appropriate, given what we know about the exile?), it's far superior with the restored content.  Maybe finally people will wake up and realize that this game is better than the original.			"

												I've played through this game fully over the course of my life probably 6 or 7 times, and everytime I come away with something new. I had it on my original Xbox as a kid and never realized how deep the story or the game is if you dive into it fully. It changes you, and changes with you. Sometimes, you just want to be a powerful badass who blows away every enemy in the universe. Other times, you want to spend the whole game just helping people down to the smallest tasks. That's the beauty of this game. If you have not played the original KOTOR, I would recommend them both highly. My only wish is that they should have allowed more of a ""grey"" side approach of neutrality, as things in the world are over all pretty dualistic. It's a beautiful game and I would highly recommend.			"

												Grew up playing this game, and to see them give it a big update after ten years is great! It's hard to find good Star Wars games these days, and this one alone beats every ""new"" Star Wars game by a long shot. They don't make Star Wars like they used to! So don't let The Old Republic ruin you on a Star Wars RPG expierence, because unlike that one, this one is worth your money.....and not utter crap.			"

												I've played through this game fully over the course of my life probably 6 or 7 times, and everytime I come away with something new. I had it on my original Xbox as a kid and never realized how deep the story or the game is if you dive into it fully. It changes you, and changes with you. Sometimes, you just want to be a powerful badass who blows away every enemy in the universe. Other times, you want to spend the whole game just helping people down to the smallest tasks. That's the beauty of this game. If you have not played the original KOTOR, I would recommend them both highly. My only wish is that they should have allowed more of a ""grey"" side approach of neutrality, as things in the world are over all pretty dualistic. It's a beautiful game and I would highly recommend.			"

												With the random patch and massive updates and fixes + Workshop support, this game went from a port failure to a winning success!We loved this on console, bugs and missing content and all. But the port was horrendous and non functional, as of 7/24/15 it got a community developed patch, acheivments, modern system support upto 5k graphics, and steam workshop!For the full reconstructed experience use the mods from my collection, all compatible and working for the most uptodate fan patch TSLRCM


KOTOR2:TSLRCM 1.8.4 Mod Combo! 

By: [TAW] Derisat Hartfelt

			This is my collection of fully TSLRCM compatible mods from steam workshop. I combine them with other mods which I'll link below. This collection USED to use the hak_pad mod, but that mod CAN screw up how the game reads...		


Another GOTY from the past brought to the present, in style!Buy it on the cheap, may the force be with you			"

												It's not everyday that a 10 year old game gets an update, and it's even more rare for that update to completly fix the game and make it compatible with a mod that literally finishes the game. My rating for KOTOR II when i played it on my xbox in 2006: 3/10 ""Buggy and unfinished dosent even begin to describe this pile of trash."" My rating for KOTOR II after playing it on steam in 2015: 10/10 ""One of Obsidian's best and a true gem that every RPG fan should play.""			"

												Despite what you may have heard about this game being unfinished or maybe not good, with the restoration mod this fixes 99% of of those problems and you find yourself a star wars RPG that is really deep and actually branches out a really meaningful story. Some side history incase your not familiar why parts of the game were cutout in the first place. After the release of KOTOR 1 Lucasarts wanted to get the sequel pumped out around some tight scheuduales. Obsidian entertianment wanted to make a really deep and different game with lots of ideas that unfotunatly were constrained by time. To make for a holiday release, lucas arts rushed obsidian and that's why A LOT was cut out from the game and why certian aspects of the game weren't fully integrated as obsidian would have wanted. In short, lucas art's fualt, not obsidian.Now thanks to the kind folks on the kotor 2 restoration team, we now have the really great complete experience that it was intended to be. Graphically its a little better than the first one and thanks to the recent updates you can now play with a controller, unlock achievements and play in HD resolutions. The voice acting, plot elements and of course the music hold up really damn well. There are plenty of mods for this game, though I should warn that the filefront site that hosted them shut down recently, however it seems steam workshop will be filling up soon with them. This game doesn't take you down a similiar theme like the movies, but instead does its own thing almost. I wont spoil anything, but if your looking for a fun game with good voice acting, a good story and a good amount of mystery this game is for you.			"

												After hearing about this game from veteran palys of the first KOTOR, it appeared to be not very good. On top of the fact that my operating system could not support the game, I had little intrest in it and continued to play only the first game. I now see I was wrong. This is a really good game, a great one actually. It improves on many of the aspects of the first game. My two complaints are that one of the bosses wasn't very good, and I wish the romance options were more important and visable rather than some mediocre flirting.			"

												Star Wars were pretty simple and straightforward science fantasy action movies. Mostly. Except for those needlessly convoluted, idiotic prequels. KotOR takes the whole world of Star Wars and puts things into perspective; it's no longer just a story about wacky aliens and robots, sassy space pirates, talking carpets and laser-sword-wielding wizards who rally under the banners of Good and Evil so that they might distinguish who's fighting who and whether they like sand or not. Gameplay-wise, KotOR is an action RPG, resemblant of Neverwinter Nights and other D&D-based RPGs. Upon character creation you pick one of the three classes, resembling the Warrior, Rogue and Mage archetypes, each with their own array of skills. Dialogue system gives you several options on how you can handle the talking with the game characters, you have to weigh your options and sometimes put your skills to use to achieve the desired results. The combat consists of round after round of skill/power/item usage or simply watching your characters trade auto-attacks with the enemy. As solid as the gameplay may be, the story and the writing is where KotOR really shines. In KotOR, even the most basic RPG mechanics such as murdering thousands of creatures, and assembling a party to become stronger, are questioned. What moral right do you have to take people's lives, even if you seek to protect others?  Why certain characters are drawn to you, seemingly eager to follow your orders? What events will you set in motion by touching with their lives? What gives you the right to shape the world around you as you see fit? Is it the mysterious Force, an ability to wield a lightsaber and throw things with the sheer power of will? No. It's not just about the Force. It works in numerous, mysterious ways, and it is a great ally. However, it is just a part of what life really is. Lightsaber is not your life either, it's just an instrument. Or perhaps, a weapon. Lightsabers, codes of Jedi, teachings of Sith, the Force — these things alone do not shape a person.   The Force may be the single greatest power in the universe. And sometimes, you have to turn yourself away from the Force to see the world around you for what it really is.			"

I highly, HIGHLY recommend that you download the Restored Content Mod for this game. It fixes a whole slew of bugs and adds everything the developers were forced to cut.I had some trouble getting the game to start initially, but there is plenty of advice online to tell you what you have to do to get the game running, so don't let that deter you.I recommend this game to all fans of Star Wars, RPG's, and good plot.

												Wow what an asstonishing sequel to knights of the old republic! though i must point out a few things that i was kinda♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off at. One making a lightsaber. Now before all you fanboys start yelling at me oh that part was so easy, but honestly in the first one it was easy right when you made it to dantoniee you could just make one other than having to scavenger the galaxy to find a freakin core crystal. Second, story line good but honestly not as intreaging as the first one, sorry for spelling. I dont know it just seemed that i was more like no i need to play for like 20 more minuets kind of thing. That started for me on Peragus but still. After a while it lost me.Why i say peragus was awesome was because it had that creepy effect i mean that assasin droid and sion coming in with the ship my heart was beating idk why but it had that effect. Also i might point out ONE WRONG MOVE IN THE SIDE MISSIONS MIGHT MAKE YOU HAVE TO RESTART....THE WHOLE GAME. i experienced this when i got it on steam i was supposed to let the hutt stay asleep on nar shadda but i woke him and i couldnt get into the fault.I do must say this ally combat is♥♥♥♥♥♥ because you are there fighting off enimes while your allies are doing no damage to others. I understand i can upgrade them to become better but guess what......THAT TAKES FOREVER.  BY THE WAY BIG TIP GET RID OF ATTON AND KREIA ASAP.And the ending sucked, it was a dissapointment; it had a good twist but i was expecting something more exciting and crazy like the first one.Though now that i got it off my chest i must say this is really a great game. Fighting is well made, costumes and masks are cooler. And gosh talk about your allies they are cool and and have a way better stories than kotor 1. And of course graphics are better i mean not as amazing as now with battlefield 4 that has really realistic graphics but hell this was pretty good for a 2003 game. I noticed that they have most of the same force powers but that is okay because the force powers are amazing. Nothing you will ever see in any star wars movie (which disapoints me but that is what makes this game special) I will give Knights of the Old Republic 2 a 8.5/10.But i wouldnt recommend playing this first play kotor 1 first it is helpful. And i Cant wait for kotor 3 or if they will go on with making it (STUPID FREAKIN DISNEY) it has to do a lot to top these two amazing games.Thnikkaman out.			"

I really recommend downloading the Restored Content Mod and the M4-78 Mod. I enjoy games that have a really intresting storyline that is easy to follow and is easy to play, which is why I like this game so much. So if you ever feel a bit bored and want to play a RPG - get this game.			"

												Simply put the greatest RPG I have ever played.Some of the Pros-Takes the Stars Wars universe and flips it on its head -Kreia is the greatest NPC in gaming. -Your actions truly have an effect. -You can make your crew sith or jedi. No one is incoruptible.-HK-47-Great companions with interesting stories-Interesting planets to explore-A wide array of force powers-The best story ever told in the Star Wars universeCons-Don't play without the restored content mod. Just don't do it.All in all far better in my opinion than the first game. Obsidian shows us how its done.10/10 "

												UPDATE JULY 2015:The game has now received a major patch, 10 years after the release, which is crazy! This makes it easier to recommend, since the patch allows you to play in higher screen resolutions, has a neat selection of achievements and most imprortantly allows the Steam version to install the famous Restored Content Mod. This replaces a significant amount of the cut scenes and dialogue, thus improving the story a great deal.n.b. - neither the patch nor the mod fixes the litany of bugs that plague KotOR 2 (some of which can be game breaking). 'The Sith Lords' remains an unfinished game and something of a chore to run - but what works is still very high quality, and now there is more of it.====ORIGINAL REVIEW:====Knights of the Old Republic 2 had an extremely hard act to follow (Bioware's original is damn near perfect) and very little time to do it in. That a game this good was written and put together in only a year speaks volumes about Obsidian's skill with role-playing and story.Gameplay, graphics, sound and pesentation are near identical to KotOR. Though little improvements have been added everywhere from the voice acting to the design of the Jedi robes, it almost feels like a very compehensive mod more than a game of its own. But KotOR's strength is the immersive, rich adventure it adds to the Star Wars mythology, and this sequel wisely puts all of its effort into the same area, with impressive results.The plot follows immediately from the original (playing the sequel first is not recommended) and follows a similar structure and creates a similar lead character, but the much darker, more thoughtful tone becomes apparent immediately and just keeps growing. The great strength of KotOR 2 is its cast of characters - especially your mysterious mentor Kreia and sidekick-with-a-past Atton. These two (and a few others) are written and played with a subtlety and depth that the first game lacks even in its best moments, and manage to create a rivalry between the two games. KotOR is consistently fantastic, but KotOR 2 has moments of something better. It's a more cerebral, more thematic, sober affair than almost any other Star Wars story out there, and all the better for it. Where the first game apes the films to a fault, the sequel is compellingly unique.It can't be denied that the game is buggy, inconsistent in its difficulty, tone and plot, very linear in places and has a very flawed ending (developers have admitted having to cut large sections to meet unreasonable deadlines) to the point of its last hour being barely compehensible. The first 90% of the game is solid, but newcomers should expect some headscratching during the endgame. It's not a gamebreaker, but it does marr (ha) the overall product.Its confusing cliffhanger ending was eventually resolved in a disappointing novel from Del Rey, but the game itself may leave you frustrated. That said, the not-quite-finished product is packed with exceptional characters, moments of brilliant dialogue and world-building, and the overall gameplay remains great fun. The game experiments a little too, helping to develop the Bioware-style RPG model: you are able to train followers to become Jedi knights, for example, strongly effecting their character arc and role in gameplay. Some missions require you to play without your party, or without your player character. Puzzles often require creativity and thought and can have multiple outcomes.For fans of quality RPG writing and those looking for a darker, more pensive Star Wars - and especially for those who enjoyed KotOR - it's an easy recommend.Expect broken rooms, missing voice files and a deeply confusing plot. But for a year's work, it's amazing.			"

												The rushed sequel to KotOR is actually my favorite to play. I know. Shocking right?Being a straight follow up to Knights 1, The Sith Lords continues 4 years later. Your character has been exiled from the Force and you must reconnect through the wonderous art of adventure.The gameplay remains more or less the same as the first game, but it's a lot more streamlined. The locations in the game I feel are bit better designed (at least in my opinion), and are far less tedious to play than Knights 1 areas are. (Everyone hates Mannan).Although the game is almost the same as Knights 1, the game has some techincal downsides. The first is lack of widescreen support. Knights 1 has this issue too, but it can be patched in if you use the original disc version of the .exe file. You can find a widescreen patcher via google. The downside to this though, is that the original bugs in the game that are patched in the Steam version, will be back in full force if you implement that fix. Although they are still rather rare to come across.You should also save scum the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game. Rushed development has caused bugs, and one of the most noted is the save corruption glitch. Although much more prevelant in the Xbox version of the game, there have been instances of it happening on the PC version, although it hasn't happened to me yet.Secondly, a lot of the game's quests are actually simple fetch quests glorified around the fact that you go to not only Point A and B, but also Point C and even D. Various loop and grind quests are here where as Knights 1 had a bit more variation.All things aside though, Knights 2 is my favorite game. The characters you meet in your party are memorable in my opinion. The scoundral Atton Rand remains one of my favorite characters from this game series, and there is so much you can do with your party. Your actions and how you treat them will decide how they react to you. Being a♥♥♥♥♥♥and doing dark side things will make them fall to the dark side, but being courageous, kind hearted, and nice to them will shift them to the light side.All this drastically changes their dialogue trees, and some party members might even just flat out stop responding to you if you do the wrong thing.Knights 2 is I'm pretty sure as long, if not longer than Knights 1. It's not a game you are going to be picking up and finishing in one day. This game requires your dedication to time to play and enjoy. The hours shown on my play counter don't lie, it really is a game that will need devotion of time to enjoy.If you enjoyed the first game, you'll love the second. All of the main Star Wars games that remain in my disc collection to this day are availible via Steam, and this is one you should grab. Even if you aren't a Star Wars fan, this game is still a master class in RPG game archeo-types, and it really deserves to be in your library.			"

												As a fan of the first Knights of the Old Republic, I don't know why I skipped out on the sequel until 2015. It's a good thing I finally played it: KOTOR II: The Sith Lords is a deep, thought-provoking experience and a worthy follow-up to its famous predecessor. Known for feeling less like Star Wars because of its many shades of gray, KOTOR II has you search for answers about your past while playing as a fugitive of sorts, the supposed “last jedi knight” that Sith all over the galaxy are eager to capture. You pick up a number of colorful companions along the way, and it is these characters and their nuanced perspectives that form the backbone of the story. The gameplay is much the same as the first Knights of the Old Republic: pausable real-time RPG combat, with tons of force powers and weapons to experiment with. Playing with the restored content mod (a piece of cake to install), I encountered very few bugs, but some of the new content stuck out like a sore thumb; I thought, “Yep, that was added in later.” Even with the fixes, KOTOR II still has some lingering flaws. The graphics have not aged well, and the game drags in places due to excessively large environments, minimal guidance (not clear where you need to go next) and too much dialogue. It's all well-written, yes, but trimming it down would have helped the pacing by making events proceed faster. As it is, the game feels too long at 40 hours, and I probably won't be playing it again any time soon.It's still totally worth it, though. KOTOR II is a very good RPG that I'm glad I finally got around to, and it feels good to know that quality content like this is available on Steam at such a low price.  (Rating: 8/10 “Very Good”)			"

												Here it is, almost as you remember it, but optimized to run at resolutions higher than 1600x1200; the game will now go up to and including 5k, as long as you have the necessary hardware, of course. This is the same game it was, nothing has changed other than being optimized to run on Windows 7 & above. Solid 8/10....until you visit the workshop and download the Restoration mod. Then, and only then will you get a glimpse of what this game was actually supposed to be. Lost content has been restored; files that were not available on the PC release of the game were contained in the Xbox version. Someone ripped those files, and found that they fit with the PC version of the game. So, after a considerable amount of coding, programming, and bug testing, this is what we have, the closest to what this game was meant to be before LucasArts rushed the project so they could get it out the door in time for Christmas. With the restoration mod, this is one of the best Star Wars games ever made, up there with the first KotOR, and TIE Fighter.Guys, if you ever played through KotOR 2 and felt the game was missing *something*, you owe it to yourself to play through the game with the restoration mod.Game: 8/10Game w/restored content: 10/10			"

												A really great game, definatly deserves the score and it's probably one of the best RPGs of all time. Very close to being as good as the first one. Though... There are some problems with it. I don't know if this is the game in general since it was rushed (We'll get to that later) or just steam in general but when I first started it, it kept crashing. ALLOT. It may not act up for you if you have windows XP, or vista, but anything above 7 you probably will experiance crashing. How I found to fix it, is go into your options and fix your resolution. If you have an HD monitor, having it play below HD will cause it to crash, aswell as having it 1080p if you have a 720p monitor. Long story short, just use the resolution your screen was meant for. I also oddly experianced frame rate drops from around a solid 35 FPS to around 15 when I was around smoke or fog. There might be an option for it, but I never bothered. Also, a downside is in some cutscenes, and even for a few characters in game from time to time, the audio was completely gone. Like some others have said, it doesn't have the ""full audio"" checked off, but that's not a game breaker.  The story itself is suprisingly good, before I got it I'd heard allot of hate on the game. It's not bad, I actually really enjoyed the story except it felt a bit... rushed. In some places you'd have a very slow intense buildup, then all of a sudden you'd be rushed through waves of enemies and boom. You're done with the mission. It was somewhat annoying. Also, devolopment with other characters is really screwy... Some characters are completely numb, and the others that you can devolop a close relationship for, you seem to never have the time for it. To devolop a relationship with a character you need to gain influence, the best way to gain influence is to appeal to them while they are traveling with you. You can only have two other people with you, and you'll soon find that some characters hold themselves in combat FAR better then others. The combat is as smooth as ever and you'll use the same tactics from one, nothing has really changed in that aspect. Yet it's far from the first. In the first KOTOR you'd be fighting both sith and jedi, having epic lightsaber battles. You do have a lightsaber, and some of your companions can use a lightsaber and the force, but it doesnt feel right. Lightsabers are meant to fight other lightsabers, though throught the whole game (Untill the litteral last part) Maybe like... 12 people? Yeah, around 12 will have lightsabers. They compensate for this by having these ""Sith assasins"" that use staffs to make up for it, but they throw them in WAVES AND WAVES AND WAVES; to the point where it just becomes a damned chore to fight them. The very begining planet, is very slow, which is nice since it teaches the new people to play, but if you are like me and have played the original hundreds of hours you will get frustrated with it. The game is great, but the devoloper obsidian was rushed to produce it, so allot of things fall flat, and many things that should be in place. aren't. There's a mod to fix this, called the restored content mod, which even adds a new planet and hours upon hours of new content to enrich the story, you may want to check that out.Overall I got about 30 hours out of the main storyline and some important sidequests, I didint finish all the sidequests, so adding those would probably add another two or three. Also this game brings back the 'organic meatbag' slaughtering HK-47, so that's a plus on its side.All in all heres an overviewStory: 9/10Combat: 7/10Character Devolopment: 6/10Customization: 7/10Replayability: 6/10Overall, I'd give it a 7.5/10 If it's on sale, pick it up. But I wouldn't be too keen on buying it full price, even though it is ten dollars, for that you should either buy the original KOTOR if you don't own it, or one of the Jedi Knight games. Those are good.			"

												When the first Kotor game came out, from what I've read of professional reviews, professional reveiwers and fans considered it revolutionary and awarded it high praise.  Naturally, when a sequel was announced high hopes were set and the community seemed to be disappointed.The problem with TSL is that it was rushed for a Christmas release so much of the content was cut.  Yeah, cutting out extra side missions might not have been that big of a problem.  But areas that would have major characters interact or provide some sort of explanation were cut (ex. an area involving the HK factory on Telos was cut, a fight between Nihlus and Sion were cut, interactions between Atton or the Disciple and Sion - I can't remember whether it was Atton or the Disciple - were cut, a possible scene towards the end that would've been more fulfilling comared to the current ending we have now with Kreia was cut).  Sure there are mods to restore cut content but I don't think it's the same.  First impressions are the most important, and unfortunately TSL didn't create as good of one as its predecessor.That being said, I do enoy playing through TSL.  I won't add any more spoilers but I can say that I find the plot interesting, as well as the support characters.  There was, it seems a bit of fan service, *ahem* *Atton* *cough* *Han* *hack**Mandolre* but I can deal with it.  It's a fond memory of my childhood despite its slight shortcomings.All in all, I would give this a shaky 3/5.			"

												The first KOTOR is the reason I bought an Xbox. It was cheaper than a PC, and my roomate had gotten me hooked. It was one of the most enjoyable gaming experiences I'd had. Now that I'm back on a PC, I decided to pick up KOTOR 1 & 2 on a Steam sale. Boy, am I ever glad that I did.This game, in particular, really caught the struggle of a Jedi trying to do what's right, despite the over-bearing Council and their antiquated view of having white vs. black ideals. It is a study in what it means to be Jedi or Sith, showing an overwhelming need for thinking more skewed towards the gray. It was once said that only Sith deal in absolutes, but this duo of games prove that is not the case. It is as much the harbingers of the Light as those of the Dark that are to blame for the state of things in the galaxy; the death, suffering, and loss included.Each side seeks to eliminate the other to bring about balance. Absolutes of Light and Dark, by their very nature, forbid balance. Balance can only be achieved if both exist... or neither.This story is worth your $10.Mastered the Light Side and stopped the death of the Force, 11/10 will play ad nauseum.			"

												This game has always held a special place in my heart.  IMO, the story, characters, and wars, had so much better story and characters than current timeline with Luke Skywalker and then Anakin Skywalker. Getting back on topic, the game was rushed so it is highly recommended that those playing it should get the complete version. Otherwise not only will you be missing some very cool dialogue that I wished was there normally, but less bugs will ruin your day. Without the mod the game would be an 8/10. With the mod the game is a 9/10. If a movie comes out and does justice for the Old Republic I would give a 10/10.			"

												The graphics may be aged, the gameplay may be simple, but the writing is the best you will find within the Star Wars universe. This is one my favourite Star Wars games, and RPGs in general. The story of the exile returning to the galaxy alongside her mysterious teacher is IMHO the greatest, and most morally complex story within the Star Wars universe. It may not be as epic as the movies, or even the first KOTOR, but it explores more themes and asks more questions than any of these.Additionally, the game is excellently supported, and was even given achievements and technical updates something like 10 years after its original release. Magnificent. Mod support from Steam Workshop also makes it easy to install mods such as Restored Content Mod, that is basically mandatory for the ending to make any sense. It restores a lot of cut content, that never made it in due time constraints.			"

												The KOTOR games are the reason why I love being a Star Wars fan - rich story, exciting combat, and phenomenal world design. KOTOR II improves on the gameplay found in the first game, adding new feats, force powers, animations, prestige classes and most noteably the influence system, all of which heighten immersion into the Star Wars universe. KOTOR II is one of my favourite games of all time, and this new update by Aspyr has allowed me to enjoy it on my PC's native resolution for the first time in years! Now I can finally transition from playing it on a disc from 2005 to enjoying it in 5K on Steam. Highly reccommend this game to Star Wars fans and fans of the RPG genre in general. 10/10!!!			"

												One of the very best Star Wars games, and possibly even RPGS. Thanks to Lucasfilm wanting Christmas money this game was rushed, and a lot of the story had to be cut, even the the audio lines for most of the game were already made. Obsidian was smart and kept those audio files and some of the incomplete areas in some game files. Some modders were able to recreate and add this content over the years, and thanks to the recent Steam workshop support, it is even easier to download these two mods. With the restoration mod, the game is transformed into one of the most well written and thought provoking games that I have ever played. While the first one serves as an excellent homage to the original movies, Kotor II takes the Star Wars formula and flips it over and asks questions morality never seen in a Star Wars game, or any other meda. Absoletely timeless.			"

												I remember getting this game for the first time for the original Xbox, being quite young i played it for five minutes and then shelved it as it wasn't what i expected from a ""Star Wars"" game. Then, some time later, i think it was in a caravan, i picked this game up again and started to play late at night, the dark story has to be the best and most engaging i have ever seen from this franchise. The characters are all interesting and have mountains of dialogue to get through, i've completed this game at least 10 times and everytime i find a little tidbit that i don't quite remember from the previous play.The morality system is great, and does provide shock to some of the desicions you can make. One of my favourite aspects of the game is all the little side-cutscenes that happen throughout the travels that add to the atmosphere, it constantly feels like you're on the run from a larger threat and it's so dark it's fantastic.You don't need to play the first one to get the idea behind this, just absorb the large amounts of lore that you can find from all the interactive stuff (computers, logs), the prolouge in this game is the best i have ever played in any game and if played late at night does send a chill down you.To be honest, in terms of bugs, there can be a few small annoying things, for me personally on the PC version it's if I alt-tab out and the game doesn't move requiring me to re-load my savefile, but there is probably a fix for that now i'm just too lazy to find it. If you want mods, theres plenty, but i love this game just for the vanilla content on its own, a must-buy if you want something totally refreshing for star wars.10/10			"

												'Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords' is the sequel to one of the best games of the 21st century. It had an awful lot to live up to, and I believe it did so surprisingly well. Many of the companions are fun to interact with and bring along on your adventures. Players of the original 'KOTOR' will be pleased to find themselves reunited with more than one familiar face. One of the companions is simply awful, and barely deserves mentioning. The character I'm referring to is a droid-like drone, and you *won't* want him around for long. I have no further criticisms of the companion system, though; in fact, I'd say that a few of the player's sidekicks are outstanding. I'm chiefly thinking of Atton and Kreia - two characters you meet very early in the game - but it could be extended to several others.The story is considerably more complex than the original game's. Some people will welcome this; others won't. I *did* welcome it, and found the network of plot twists and unforeseen developments to be fascinating. The RPG quality of the game also means that the twists may not occur on your playthrough, or that you may experience other developments that I haven't faced.This game has two key antagonists - Darth Sion and Darth Nihilus. (This isn't really a spoiler as they're featured on most cover art!) I don't think that either of these two Sith Lords are quite as intimidating as the original game's Darth Malak, but the way in which they are written will really challenge your perception of the 'Star Wars' universe, especially where the Force is concerned.The planets and other environments open to exploration are broadly as good as those in the first game, but I found it slightly disappointing that none of the worlds became quite as immersive or deep as Taris, the first planet the player experiences in the original 'KOTOR'. I view this rather negatively, but not all players will: some will welcome the lighter approach to the worlds of 'KOTOR II', as you can cover more ground in less time. My only other criticism of the landscapes of 'The Sith Lords' relates to Korriban. You may recall visiting this planet in the first game. I do, and I remember finding it considerably more interesting and enjoyable in that earlier game.The side quests maintain the high quality set by the first game, you'll be pleased to hear. It should also be noted that there appear to be a greater number of them in this game, and many of them can be completed very quickly. They're absolutely worthwhile, though, as they often expand on the player's understanding of the various lands, characters and events experienced throughout the game.Pazaak and swoop-racing both make a welcome return. Pazaak hasn't really changed a great deal (although I don't think NPC pazaak players are quite as easy to find), but the swoop tracks have been made significantly more challenging - and addictive! Overall, whilst 'KOTOR II' falls slightly behind the original game in certain areas, I believe that it actually surpasses it in others. The first one was a great game for RPG fans. The second one is a fantastic game for 'Star Wars' fans. It's definitely one of my greatest gaming experiences this year, and I have to recommend it to almost all gamers.			"

												Enjoyable game, interesting and reasonably engaging story. I have only played it with the The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod, so I can't comment on the unmodded version.Whilst not the key focus of the game, I did find the combat to be... jarring? Some force powers seem to be resisted every time, whereas others seem to be resisted by no one at any point and can be spammed to win. Some of the puzzles seem a little bit arbitrary, and at one point in the game the number of assassins who tried to kill me was reaching a ridiculous number. I'm talking two groups a minute when I was just wandering around a city.Anyway, I feel like there problems are largely down to preference and how I played the game, which is fine. The story is interesting, as are the characters. Ultimately I don't think it's as good as the original KOTOR, especially the ending which I thought was no one near as interesting. In summary, KOTOR> KOTOR 2> not playing any KOTORs.			"

												6 / 108-19-2016Currently at $10 it is worth the money, and a play through.Although this game is from 2005, it is definitely worth playing. The 2005 graphic's are a bit chunky. The control's are simple, make sense, and are easy to use.The game play make's up for chunky graphic's. It play's a lot like Mass Effect 1, only less refined. Through adventures, you assemble a team of specialized member's, and build up your skills to defeat a growing evil, save the galaxy, learn a lot of back story, and claim your destiny. The game follows a story line, but you can take several path's to the main goal. There are a lot of side quest's and main quests.There are only currently 68 mods in the Steam workshop. However there are also many more on the Nexus website.http://www.nexusmods.com/kotor2/mods/searchresults/?There are a few bug's. The 2 main bug's, for me, are:1st After a cut seen, the view won't stop rotating.The fix is to, hit esc. save the game, exit the game and log back in to your save. The spin will be gone.2ndCrashing when during a cut scene, when you enter the next step in the story line.This is mostly caused by one or more of the mods I have installed.This is just my guess. What usually seems to happen is, during a cut scene, The game use's thing'sa character is wearing or using, so the character's look like they did going into the scene. Then the game doesn't find some file, and crash's.A cut scene looks like a movie, but is not a movie. It is actually a string of event's that happen in the game that get triggered, like when you step on a mine, or trigger a door. The reason it looks like a movie, it is seen from "" cinematic view "". When a cut scene can't find a file. The string of events gets broken and you get a crash. That is my guess. I'm no expert.The fix for this is to REMEMBER to save your game before you leave to a new map, like entering and leaving your ship.When the game crash's:Step 1 Remove suspected mods. This is easy enough to do in Steam workshop. Just unsubscribe the mods.Step 2 Restart Steam. This is so Steam will remove the unsubscribed mods.Step 3 Relog into the game from your last save. Then play the game, without the mods, until you  get through the cut scene's that crashed.Step 4 Save your game, log out, and reinstall your mods. If using Steam workshop mods, just resubscribe the mods you want.Step 5 Restart Steam. This is so Steam will load the mods you just subscribed to use.Step 6 Relog into the game at your last save, and continue playing.			"

												A fantastic game, obviously there are things that could be better, it *is* over 10 years old after all. That said, it's really well put together, it plays good, it runs good even in Windows 10.The story is well put together, there are some really good mods for it that can improve some things as well as add new skills, although unfortunatly you can't run very many mods at once as this can cause the game to crash. Some bugs include text speeding past at an unreadable rate, only pausing when you need to make a comment. This can be fixed by closing, and reopening the game. I believe there's a real fix for it in the forums, but I forget what it was now.....I also highly recommend getting the Restored Content mod, as this addes in missing conversations and things of that kind. LucasArts pushed BioWare hard tog et this out before it was ready and that does show in places throught out the game.All in all I would recommend you get this game if you like Star Wars and the lore of the series, even look into grabbing up the first game too. This game especially is more about the story and characters than the actual gameplay itself.I would also really recommend waiting until the 4th of July, Steam always does a deal on most of the Star Wars games. It's worth the £7's but why not get it cheaper?			"

												One of the best classic RPGs to date, and a Star Wars one no less. The quality of the game is there, especially for something so old. The combat is sadly lacking, it is turn-based, but it was high quality for when it was released. The combat is not that horrible though, it just isn't that interesting. The overall character development is there, and the decisions you make matter. There are different ending for different choices, some minor, a few major.			"

												A pure example on storytelling and innovation, it's probably my favourite in the series. It leaves it on such an unsure note as well. (Depending on your ending) It's a great example of how to make a sqeaul, of how to develop characters and actually start to give a damm about what is happening. Unlike a certain MMO... *Erhem* Now don't get me wrong Swtor was good, but to try and supass the beauty of this game and its predeccor it's a bar that is simply too high, an achievement of storytelling.

Posted: October 19, 2016
												As a huge fan of Star Wars since my early childhood, I've always looked forward to the next great experience based within its universe. Following the crushing knowledge of the great disappointment that Battlefront was to so many of my peers, I looked instead to the past for a rejuvenation of my connection to the Force. Having played the fantastic original KOTOR on my Xbox in days long past, I decided to journey into the depths of its sequel.I will account for its negative aspects first, and let you decide whether you're willing to overcome them. Following these, will be the reasons for which I feel you owe it to yourself to play this title regardless of these nagging issues.The biggest issue first. The ending is one of the worst I've ever witnessed. There is absolutely no closure for this storyline, putting aside the cliffhanger (presumably due to plans of making a third part to add to the duology) which only sufficed to compound the feeling of rage I experienced as I sat watching the screen fade to black. The conclusion served to devalidate so much of the time and effort I had put into the game in a vain attempt to enjoy a satisfying end to my self-chosen journey. Hilariously (in a bad way) you will have one character standing there, literally fortune-telling what will happen to all the characters involved in the story. Garbage, especially considering the stellar quality of storytelling in the majority of the game. Also, I managed to accidentally skip it, thinking that pressing one wrong dialogue reply couldn't possibly be such an integral part of the created experience. I was wrong. I only found out afterward on Youtube, with absolute astonishment, that there was this minimum set of revelations hidden within a couple of the dialogue responses.Exuding the same lack of quality encased within the ending, many sections of in-game dialogue (once again... integral to the game) are skipped over or cut entirely, due to glitches that still have yet to be fixed. This is unacceptable, especially in a heavily story-focused game such as this. Yes, yes, they rushed the game due to publisher interests... yadda yadda yadda. I don't give a flying ♥♥♥♥. It's your baby. Don't release it prematurely. A previous patch has seemingly addressed many of the game-breaking concerns that the very first steam customers had, reintroducing missing cutscenes and conversations. So it seems somewhat appalling that the developers have yet to alleviate such a fundamental issue, especially a decade after release.Finally, an issue which I have a neutral opinion on... the combat mechanics. They are severely imbalanced, making certain sections of the game super easy, and a minute few exceedingly difficult; mostly though, they are a walk in the park on a breezy summer's day. This may be an issue for some, although I did not find it much of a bother, as I was more focused on characters and lore anyway. It still kept my attention. It was adequate. The bottom line is, if you delegate your stats and bonuses properly, as well as apply the proper skills, and make sure to upgrade your weapons, this game will be a cake-walk.NOW FOR THE POSITIVEMmm Mmm Good. That's how I feel about the quality of the story and the writing (with the exception of the ending!). There is an obvious sense that the writing style was made to cater to intellectuals. It is a blend of mature views on justice and morality, with an additional focus on the supposedly untarnishable reputation of the Jedi Order within the Star Wars universe. It places both the Jedi and the Sith on an even playing field, and shows you that they both have their strengths and weaknesses. Their methods and motivations may differ, though they're not exactly polar opposites, as is commonly believed due to the films.The music quality of the KOTOR universe is fantastic as usual, hitting all the right notes. The combat is satisfying to watch unfold, especially when donning your favorite lightsaber. The crafting system for upgrading armor and weapons is addicting for some weird reason. The scenery and environments, although dated, are still often a treat for the eyes, especially the urban areas, with all their requisite Star Wars themed architecture and lights. The quests are often interesting, and the exceptions are all adequate. I don't remember a single truly boring quest. The characters are all interesting and differentiated from one another. You will want to talk to and get acquainted with all of them.All in all, I'd say this is a journey that's definitely still worth it despite its more disappointing aspects.Don your robes, strap on your boots, and let that blade roar.

												So far I think the game is great, I wasn't expecting much after learning that LucasArts rushed the game, but after getting the Cut Content Mod from the Workshop, I am expecting the game to be better than what we got. I think I may have played Kotor 1 a little over a decade ago, never played 2 until buying for $2.49 during the current May the 4th be With You Sale. I do believe I would recommend this just based off what I have played. I know Bioware didn't make the game, but after playing Dragon Age you could never tell it was made by Obsidian Entertainment, especially since they had no idea how the first game went or anything. It's not often I find an RPG that makes me want to play more of it after I quit the game. Last game that did that was DE:HRDC.			"

												This game is phenomenal, considering that it from Bioware and the sequel to my all time favorite game makes it even better. But even as a standalone title this game will blow you away. From it's great RPG elements to the unique story that builds up the Star Wars universe this game is great from the get go. I have been postponing playing this game for years and I am sorry I did that. If you have ten bucks to spend and want a great RPG title then this is the game for you. Many elements you see in this game were later implemented in more games by bioware. You can see a echoing of the elements in Mass Effect. Great game buy it, don't miss out.			"

												Before you start playing, download The Sith Lords: Restored Content Mod. Overall this game has been one of the best RPGs in the history of gaming alongside its predecessor. The gameplay, story, and voice acting are all 10/10. This game offers so much freedom in gameplay from moral choices to combat. If you want a story driven RPG which excels in about every aspect, many hours of gameplay and replayability, and especially if you love the series of Star Wars, then this game is a must have for your steam library.On a side note, just finished the game with an unarmed build, and I still have many more builds and quests to complete.

Has fun combat that will keep you entertained from its aesthetically pleasing animations to its simplistic gameplay. It also contains something that the first KotOR didn't, the ability to influence your companions. All in all it's a 10/10. Highly recommend TSLRCM to restore content that was supposed to be in the game in the first place, but was rushed.			"

												Great game. I've played more time than is showed, but my Wifi was out. and this game can be incredibly diffuclt and may require a lot of strategy, Also, some segments shouldn't be skipped unless your game crashed and you know the jist of what was said. Also, the choices are sometimes very diffuclt, but you can't please every follower or character. Also, you must be wise in choosing wether or not to be dark or light side, what followers, what armor that you use, because each has benefits. Also, I forgot to get the first game, but the events of the first game are explained in the game.Rating 9/10			"

												One of the best Star Wars games out there. The atmosphere, the characters (especially Kreia), and the story all come together to make a memorable experience worthy of succeeding its legendary predecessor, KOTOR. Backed by a still active modding community via Deadly Stream, it is still worth the play through after almost a decade.			"

												This game is good. I played the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of the first one as a little kid. I got to Nar-Shadaa however, and the game glitched once I ran into the twin bounty hunters. I was so mad I'd had about 30 hours into that game. So, if it doest't glitch, it's a perfect 10/10. But for me, since it ruined my game, (even though since then I've started a new game just can't get back into it), I give it an 8/10. Gameplay is awesome, graphics are standard KOTOR graphics.

												I only recommend this game at a sale of half off or better.I can also only recommend this game with the mod that let's you skip Peragus, which is a must have.As a kid I beat the first KOTOR all the time because it was amazing but Peragus and an eventual broken XBOX and disc kept me from beating this game until about a week ago. On XBOX the game was terrible, but on pc, it's pretty good. Pros: Patches, and yes, patches are still rleased for this bad boy.It's the sequel to KOTOR.Star Wars game so you get both Sci-Fi and Fantasy in one game.The price tag.Mandalore (Canderous from the first game).Cons:I hear it can't run on Windows 10, so if you went that route it's on you.It's age is showing a bit.Most of the character are ♥♥♥♥ing annoying (Atton, Kreia, both bounty hunters that can join your party, and even the second floating robot you get is annoying.

												A pretty good game now thanks to modding - especially given the price.  Some really annoying issues from the first game are still around, though.+ Some really good characters.  HK-47 even gets a personal mission!+ Pretty good writing throughout with a few really brilliant bits.+ Music is well done+ It's STAR WARS!  Wizards, space ships, glowing swords, and robots!+ Graphics are good enough that you don't feel like you're playing with Lego people.+ Steam Workshop integration makes modding a breeze.+ Characters often get stuck on their own so you often have to deal with their individual weaknesses.+ Price!  You get a LOT of game for $10.  (You can get the game for even less if you wait for a sale but come on - even a 100% off sale only saves you ten bucks.  Buy it whenever you're ready to play it.)- Balance is a mess in the last half of the game.  Most of the time you'll be facing enemies that are trivial.  Then you'll suddenly be forced to have your gun specialist fight a couple of melee fighters alone in a small room.- Bioware didn't get party AI right until Dragon Age.  Melee fighters will run off and attack enemies before you're ready.  Jedi won't bother to use their powers unless you take control and force them to do so <ahem>.- You get to tell the game a little about what you did in KotOR 1 but most of it isn't up for debate.  Even though it's been over a decade since I played the first game, it was still jarring.- Economy and crafting become pointless quickly.  I spent a little money at the start of the game but the balance is so far off that there's no need to buy new stuff or upgrade what you've got.  I stopped bothering to sell about a third of the way through the game.Overall the game gets an up vote from me.  You'll be cussing at the game and your AI companions but you get used to the quirks eventually and can just get on with pushing rooms full of enemies around and/or zapping them with evil force lightning.

												I'm just going to put it simply: If you enjoy the star wars universe and the story behind it, this is the single best game out there for you. Installing the restored content mod is a must, as it fixes many bugs and adds a fair bit of cut content, that really ties up lose ends from the vanilla game. Installation is easy. Just go to the workshop and subscribe to the mod.This is not a very difficult game though, but this leaves room for many odd builds and party combinations. Get this game for the RPG and story aspect, and stick for the combat. By the end of the game, you truly feel like a powerful jedi. "

												This will be hard to start... I played kotor 1 (on Ipad) and it was great! After that I wanted more of the story of Raven and the galaxy before Dark Veder and the clone wars, and thats when I dicided to buy kotor 2 on pc. I started playing the game and spent 7 and half an hour on the game. But after problems with the pc over a long period I restarted my pc complytely.I saved the last place I left off on the Cloud servic so I dident have to place the saved data over to a diffrent storage divice. After that I rastarted my pc. I downloaded Steam and downloaded kotor 2 to my pc. I opened the game and loaded the saved game up. When it was finished loading it crashed. I tryed agein and agein but it would not start. So now 7 houers of game play is gone. I tryed to start over agein but the whole world wouldent loade inn. PS: I used restored content mod.But frome what I played was great. Just pure entertainment and fun. You should absolutely buy and play the game, and the restored content mod is a ""MUST HAVE"". This is a great game and I hope Kotor 3 will come out one butifull day.			"

												is quite good as you start off as a jedi who has survived the colapse of the jedi order and galactic republic. You start off ats the Paragus mining facility were your ship the ebon hawk is being held captive. You then go on an adventure to find the peices of your lightsaber and peice the puzzles of your past. You then get companiams who you choose to drop or keep along your journey. Will you stay on the path or the jedi and be a savior or will you fall down the dark path and be the galaxys conquror.			"

												I only recommend this game at a sale of half off or better.I can also only recommend this game with the mod that let's you skip Peragus, which is a must have.As a kid I beat the first KOTOR all the time because it was amazing but Peragus and an eventual broken XBOX and disc kept me from beating this game until about a week ago. On XBOX the game was terrible, but on pc, it's pretty good. Pros: Patches, and yes, patches are still rleased for this bad boy.It's the sequel to KOTOR.Star Wars game so you get both Sci-Fi and Fantasy in one game.The price tag.Mandalore (Canderous from the first game).Cons:I hear it can't run on Windows 10, so if you went that route it's on you.It's age is showing a bit.Most of the character are ♥♥♥♥ing annoying (Atton, Kreia, both bounty hunters that can join your party, and even the second floating robot you get is annoying. No. "

												One of the bst RPGs I've ever played. I literally played it non-stop basically over three days. The only complaint I really have is that there is a disconnect from some of the companions, in that there isn't enough options to talk to them when on your ship. It eventually just becomes them saying the same things over and over again, but otherwise this is an awesome JRPG that I would highly suggest. It made me an even bigger fan of Star Wars, and now I'm really bummed that there isn't a KotR 3 so I can continue the journey to find Revan. Bottom line... GET THIS GAME, YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!			"

												Great game, one of my favorites. It added and/or made better so many good features they didn't have in the first KOTOR game it's wonderful to see KOTOR continued. The best choice Bioware made was definitely the choice to bring back HK-47, he's the best character to ever have come about in any story in the history of the world tbh.			"

												Great game. I've played more time than is showed, but my Wifi was out. and this game can be incredibly diffuclt and may require a lot of strategy, Also, some segments shouldn't be skipped unless your game crashed and you know the jist of what was said. Also, the choices are sometimes very diffuclt, but you can't please every follower or character. Also, you must be wise in choosing wether or not to be dark or light side, what followers, what armor that you use, because each has benefits. Also, I forgot to get the first game, but the events of the first game are explained in the game.Rating 9/10			"

												As a huge fan of Star Wars since my early childhood, I've always looked forward to the next great experience based within its universe. Following the crushing knowledge of the great disappointment that Battlefront was to so many of my peers, I looked instead to the past for a rejuvenation of my connection to the Force. Having played the fantastic original KOTOR on my Xbox in days long past, I decided to journey into the depths of its sequel.I will account for its negative aspects first, and let you decide whether you're willing to overcome them. Following these, will be the reasons for which I feel you owe it to yourself to play this title regardless of these nagging issues.The biggest issue first. The ending is one of the worst I've ever witnessed. There is absolutely no closure for this storyline, putting aside the cliffhanger (presumably due to plans of making a third part to add to the duology) which only sufficed to compound the feeling of rage I experienced as I sat watching the screen fade to black. The conclusion served to devalidate so much of the time and effort I had put into the game in a vain attempt to enjoy a satisfying end to my self-chosen journey. Hilariously (in a bad way) you will have one character standing there, literally fortune-telling what will happen to all the characters involved in the story. Garbage, especially considering the stellar quality of storytelling in the majority of the game. Also, I managed to accidentally skip it, thinking that pressing one wrong dialogue reply couldn't possibly be such an integral part of the created experience. I was wrong. I only found out afterward on Youtube, with absolute astonishment, that there was this minimum set of revelations hidden within a couple of the dialogue responses.Exuding the same lack of quality encased within the ending, many sections of in-game dialogue (once again... integral to the game) are skipped over or cut entirely, due to glitches that still have yet to be fixed. This is unacceptable, especially in a heavily story-focused game such as this. Yes, yes, they rushed the game due to publisher interests... yadda yadda yadda. I don't give a flying ♥♥♥♥. It's your baby. Don't release it prematurely. A previous patch has seemingly addressed many of the game-breaking concerns that the very first steam customers had, reintroducing missing cutscenes and conversations. So it seems somewhat appalling that the developers have yet to alleviate such a fundamental issue, especially a decade after release.Finally, an issue which I have a neutral opinion on... the combat mechanics. They are severely imbalanced, making certain sections of the game super easy, and a minute few exceedingly difficult; mostly though, they are a walk in the park on a breezy summer's day. This may be an issue for some, although I did not find it much of a bother, as I was more focused on characters and lore anyway. It still kept my attention. It was adequate. The bottom line is, if you delegate your stats and bonuses properly, as well as apply the proper skills, and make sure to upgrade your weapons, this game will be a cake-walk.NOW FOR THE POSITIVEMmm Mmm Good. That's how I feel about the quality of the story and the writing (with the exception of the ending!). There is an obvious sense that the writing style was made to cater to intellectuals. It is a blend of mature views on justice and morality, with an additional focus on the supposedly untarnishable reputation of the Jedi Order within the Star Wars universe. It places both the Jedi and the Sith on an even playing field, and shows you that they both have their strengths and weaknesses. Their methods and motivations may differ, though they're not exactly polar opposites, as is commonly believed due to the films.The music quality of the KOTOR universe is fantastic as usual, hitting all the right notes. The combat is satisfying to watch unfold, especially when donning your favorite lightsaber. The crafting system for upgrading armor and weapons is addicting for some weird reason. The scenery and environments, although dated, are still often a treat for the eyes, especially the urban areas, with all their requisite Star Wars themed architecture and lights. The quests are often interesting, and the exceptions are all adequate. I don't remember a single truly boring quest. The characters are all interesting and differentiated from one another. You will want to talk to and get acquainted with all of them.All in all, I'd say this is a journey that's definitely still worth it despite its more disappointing aspects.Don your robes, strap on your boots, and let that blade roar.

												Whether KOTOR II is better than KOTOR I is a matter of preference. Personally, I prefer KOTOR I due to better story and companions.KOTOR II added a few new features such as creating and breaking down item, more force powers and better use of cinematic cutscene. However, these new features could've been done better as most of the times, they are practically useless.Remember how easy and fast players got their lightsabers in KOTOR I? Players had to wait for a longer time in KOTOR II to actually get a lightsaber.Some of my complaints in KOTOR I remained in KOTOR II. Kreia tried to balance things out with the light and dark side but ultimately, you are either benevolent as f*ck or evil as sh*t. There's a few new force powers but still not enough useful powers. Items and equipment are still disappointing, even with more upgrade.My main complaint is the difficulty spike and the main bosses. Most parts of the game is easy and the two main bosses are complete pushovers, while in some parts of the game, it's very hard due to the game separates players from it's companion. I had to rely on a bug to defeat the twin Twi'leks using Atton. And the last boss? Unfair is the word I'll use.Speaking of companions, KOTOR II's companion are easily inferior to KOTOR I. Their characters aren't well fleshed out and it's hard for me to get attached to them. I loved HK-47 in KOTOR I but in KOTOR II, he's just... well, there. The only other character I had some attachment is Handmaiden but not enough for me to care for her.Like I said, whether KOTOR II is better than KOTOR I is a matter of preference. I prefer KOTOR I. But it's still an enjoyable 2005 game.RECOMMENDED       : KOTOR I fansNOT RECOMMENDED: KOTOR I fans who wanted better story, companions and improved gameplay.			"

												I enjoyed this game enough when I was younger, that I was willing to pay to replace the copy I lost. The gameplay is 11/10, being very indepth. The story is incredibly well written, and defined much of what is held as canon in the Star Wars extended universe. Unfortunately, there are a lot of bugs that show up from playing this on a newer PC. The cinematics are often faulty, along with the dialogue (requiring restart), and my game has crashed out of the blue several times (one time, it corrupted every save to the point I had to start the game over). There is a restored conent mod aimed at fixing this, but it made some of the issues worse for me. If you can get it to work, great! I love the morality component of this game. It is the first that ever made me feel guilty for making what I thought was a ""good"" decision. The story is A+, which is rare in modern gaming. The gameplay is very RPG stylized, with rolls, and all that fun stuff. It took some getting used to. But this is a game worth getting for $10. BUY IT.			"

												Background: Obsidian developed sequel to KOTOR 1 (Bioware developed game) that puts you 4,000 years before the original trilogy of Star Wars.  So there is no connection to the Skywalkers or Solos.  A fun RPG with a huge cast of characters.  IT IS AWESOME.  The recent patch added widescreen support, fixed some bugs and added steam workshop.  There are still a number of bugs though.Plot: You play an 'exiled' Jedi from events that transpired in the first game.  You do not need to play the first game, but I would wiki the story.  And as the first game hasn't gotten a patch for widescreen and runs badly on newer systems you may just want to do that.  There are some recurring characters (party and non party) though.  Just, FYI: Cannon exile is a woman.Gameplay: The gameplay is based on d20 role-playing game system. You can pick your class and your skills. Force powers are yours to choose. There are different endings based on your choices as well (light side vs dark side only).  The characters you get in your party are of a wide variety and are great.  You can converse with them, gain influence them, turn some into jedi/sith.  There are some characters specific to male/female, but nothing light/dark.  You really can choose to play full on melee lightsaber wielding mad man or you could just be a force nut (much easier on dark side).I played both light and dark to completion and the dark side run had many more bugs than the light side.  I played with KB/M, but you can use a controller as well.Graphics: It's a 10+ year old game.  I think the graphics have aged well.  There are a couple mods to have better graphics but nothing huge.  Runs fine (i5 haswell and gtx780) on my system, I mean it's 10+ years old, it better.Audio: Nothing flashy, works fine.LOVE this game.  You should play it.			"

												Been a Star Wars fan for a long time and KOTOR II in my opinion is the best out of Star Wars video games. This new update they've implemented has been very much needed for a long time. I'm not going to list the improvements, because I think of this as a reboot of the game. That's how big this update is for this game. I mean, it no longer crashes on start up on modern computers. Just that bug fix would've made me happy so I wouldn't have to search the internet for 6 hours to figure out how to make it work. (sigh)Now to the actual gameplay:Much like Fallout, but in the Star Wars universe, but with less customization of the character.Like Fallout, you can make good decisions and bad decisions, but instead of karma, it's the side of the force you're on. (Important in late game)FANTASTIC STORYLINE: Obviously I'm not gonna put spoilers in here, but the story telling of Bethesda is 10/10 once again.This game is both RPG, and a realtime strategy game, all in third person. Who should I attack, with whom should I attack, what do I attack with, when do I heal, when should I use the force? So many variables to think about.Many different force powers are in this game, and when certain powers are combined with a certain character setup, (levels of strength, charisma, wisdom, etc.) they can become very powerful.EVERY PLAYTHROUGH WILL BE DIFFERENT. Unless of course you do the same combination of things everytime, but that's boring.That's just a handful of things that are good about this game. With that said, if you're a graphics snob, you're gonna have a bad time because, yes, this game is over 10 years old; and even with this update there are still some bugs that happen, but I haven't had any bug experiences that make me lose game progress unless I have forgotten to save in a while. Basically, if you are a fan of Fallout and a fan of Star Wars, this is a must-have game for you, but when it comes down to whether you should buy it or not, that is a decision you have to make for yourself. I'm not gonna be ""that guy"" to tell you to buy or not buy this game. Hopefully I've helped you make that decision.RebelBubba out. "

												The Game is awesome, but I seem to have experienced a slight issue when it came to actually progressing through the story line once I've come to the point of getting abducted by Gota and when Kreia enlisted the wookie in her services.. My created character has magically vanished along with all of my previous saved files resulting in my involuntary discontinuation from playing the game. So in conclusion, GOD MOTHER♥♥♥♥ING DAMNIT STEAM GET YOUR ♥♥♥♥ING♥♥♥♥♥♥TOGETHER WITH THESE GAME DEVELOPERS AND STOP WASTING MY ♥♥♥♥ING TIME.

												This is a great sequel to an amazing game.  The game itself is about as good as the original.  However, it is not better due to the rushed ending.  But the game is paced well with a different atmosphere than the first.  The first is bright and then dark and intense towards the end.  This one is eerie and mysterious all the way through.  The first level is great just because you have no idea what is happening.  If you want a better ending, get the Sith Lords Restored Content Mod.  Otherwise, it is another masterpiece in the Kotor series.			"

												I really don't know how to put this, Knights of the Old Republic II is...a bit strange compared to its predecessor.In the first game, the story seemed linear but was very interesting and overall pretty great. The combat and enviorment and everything was great, and KOTOR was amazing.Knights of the Old Republic II is a step in a very interesting directions.The story is a bit of an exaggeration when it comes to clarity. I didn't understand the story's total capacity and I really didn't get all the story. Without spoiling the game, the story was good, but it really seemed to end strong.The Combat is virtually the same, and I've played the first game around accouple hundred hours. Newer powers and some neat crafting items is really a refreshing step in the game. I love upgrading newer parts for my lightsaber and I thought some unique parts in the game were a lot more flushed out.Overall, KOTOR II fell back in the story aspect. I really enjoyed the game though. I only wish the conclusion and story outcome was a little better devolped. (Yes, I know there's multiple endings, light and dark sides.) I wish though that you were'nt seperated from your party as much. It falls slightly short of the first, but I would say it's a must own for Star Wars fans alike.                    My Final Score-  8/10			"

												Ok this game is amazing i would recommend this game to anyone. if you do get the game i would recommend getting the TSRCM mod it restores the content that was left out of the game. But even without the TSRCM mod it is still an amazing game.			"

												THERE IS A SPOILER FOR THE ORIGINAL KOTOR IN THIS REVIEW. IT IS A BIG ONE. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.I think that the original KotOR is my favorite of the two. While this game is leaps and bounds better than The Old Republic, it doesn't give me the chills I got when I discovered I was Revan. That was a brilliant twist, and it made me feel like an idiot for not realizing. It is certainly cool knowing that as the Jedi Exile some of your entourage will go on to rebuild (or destroy) the Jedi Order after it was nearly wiped out in the First Jedi Purge. I have only done one playthrough, so I have undoubtedly missed a lot of cool side missions and hidden gear, as well as not being able to flush all the characters out. However, even then, I still prefer the original. I do however like the addition of the extra weapon loadout, and like the original it is suprisingly mod-friendly, so have fun doing that. Even so, I will champion KotOR 2:TSL as a sequel that was, in my opinion, made to continue the cool story rather than reel in the fanboy bucks. However, unrelated  to this game, the MMORPG The Old Republic is pretty trashy. It went from subscription to free-to-play in a year. To sum up, KotOR 1 is the best of the 3, KotOR 2:TSL is a worthy sequel that while not as good as the original, again in my opinion, is still a great game that will rack up hundreds of hours of your life. TOR on the other hand, is the other one. You know when you invited all your friends to your 4th grade birthday party, and your mom made you invite that one kid you didn't like (I can say that because I still am that one kid)? That's TOR. It's the worst, hands down. KotOr 2 is like Terminator 2. Great, awesome explosions, brutality against cops, but doesn't quite hold up to the original. If Arnold was in KotOR 2, it would be an immediate 10/10, especially if he was one of the Sith Lords. Darth Toomah, that would be his name.  Anyway, to sum it up quickly, KotOR 2 is worth the $3 it goes for on Steam and much more, and you should buy it, because it is fun and improves on the original in many ways. Anyways, Darth Toomah...			"

												Yes! Very interesting and enticing! I've played the first and the sequal to the KOtOR series and they are one of my favorite RPG series of all time... The only thing that you must watch for are the many bugs in THIS game (KOtOR 1 is fine). I recommend downloading the ""The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod"" mod, it fixes many bugs and improves aspects of the game that were not too good. Don't blame the developers, but the publisher for the mess that this is without that mod... It was rushed out.			"

												Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II - The Sith LordsThe game is set 5 years after the original. The Republic has since been weakened from the Jedi Civil War and the Jedi have are being hunted down by the remaining Sith. You play as the lone Jedi Exile who throughtout the game reconnects with the force. This game unlike it's predecessor is set in a more darker tone. If you're familiar with the first game you will know that your actions in the game will affect whether you lean towards the light or dark side. Though with this game, it is more grey than black and white. It can be hard to tell whether doing a good thing is actually the right thing to do.The game's story is not as straight forward as the original. As it may have a defined story, but there are generally two or more sides to most of the game's plot points. As like the first game, there are multiple endings. There are also some nice side quests you can play that add some extra play time although they are optional. Another large part of the game is the party system. Throughout the game you gain party members, some may be familiar if you have played the predecessor while others are new. The game includes an influence system. The influence system works by increasing or decreasing the influence you have with your party by performing actions that they either agree or disagree with. Having a good influence with party members can give benefits, those that you will have to play the game to find.Although this game is 10 years old and may be a little dated by current game standards, it is still quite enjoyable. Also due to the fact that this game was rushed and is unfinished, there may be an assortment of bugs but nothing that is too game breaking, as well as missing story points. Although with it's unfinished state it is still a pretty polished game as all the features from it's predecessor have been upgraded and refined. Though if you want to play a more finished game I recommend getting the Restored Content Mod as it adds the cut content that was originally supposed to be in the game.My personal rating for this game is 9/10 and was one of the most enjoyable games in my childhood.

												I have and always will recommend this game. An atypical SW narrative, KOTOR2 plays like a true fantasy game should, with interesting and investing characters, with well fleshed out back stories, and a deeper and more rounded sense of lore. The Force and its magnitude is explained in greater detail, as well as the socio-political status of the galaxy at large during the time of the Old Republic. The villains are far more deserving of praise than the one track Malak from KOTOR and the companions of this game actually seem to have character archs, stories, and meaningful interaction, unlike those of KOTOR.The game does feel a bit devoid of content, however. I recommend the Restored Content Mod. It will put that icing on the already delicious cake.			"

I was able to play this game and KOTOR easily with no issue really. However through steam this game crashes my PC and crashes the game, I played for about 30 mins then spent more time trying to fix the issue by reading loads of forums and tweeking my game. Sufficed to say that it didn't work and this game will forever broken through steam for me atleast, basically its just another one of those old games where Valve has gone ""this was great 12 years ago lets get it for Steam and leave it the way it is even though computers have advanced greatly over these past years""...Yeah thanks Valve, I wasted £6.99.

												9/10If you liked Kotor 1 then you'll like this. From playing the game, I can say that Obsidian needs to work on their romantic dialogue or drop it all together considering the romance, and I say that loosely, isn't as good as the first.Gameplay is exactly the same. That isn't a problem.Story is not as good as the first, but better than most RPGs, probably due in part because it takes place in the Star Wars universe.Screwing people over as a dark side character is great. Saving innocent people as a light side character is also great.The one problem this game has is the story-ruining bug that occurs out of nowhere: Cutscenes, dialogue, and voice acting being skipped and/or cut out. This happened a lot near the end of the game and so I had no idea what really happened.The game will occupy your time and you'll never want to take a break whether it be of the story, or the unique side quests.

												This game could have been great. It really could have. Kotor was FANTASTIC! I was very eager to begin Kotor 2 so I bought it right after finishing the first one. I was almost through the first area, which took a few hours, when I couldn't advance any further. Turns out this game is FILLED with bugs, but thankfully someone made a mod that fixes those bugs. No biggie, I say. I was still at the beginning of the game. I installed the mod and started a new file. All was fine and well until I hit Nar Shadaa.  Then everything went to crap. Cutscenes didn't trigger when they were supposed to, game constantly crashed, and the framerate bombed. Upon consulting google I found that this is a very common, even with the mod. The solution? Start over again. No thank you. In terms of reviewing the story, it was decent, but when paired with this absolute mess, it doesn't even matter.			"

												This game, this game....now I understand where the “average rating” scored came from and here's why.I played the first game and gave it a review; it was a good standard star wars space opera game that had good story, characters and good gameplay. When I bought the sequel I thought it would be epic but no, it felt more on the lines of average. Probably slightly below average but average is what I most felt it.STORYThe story here had potential it really does! It builds up to this sense hype of the reveal. As you start to progress from the story you meet this old Jedi name Kreia and you start having this bond between you and her as apprentice master, you start noticing that the Sith is back (not big surprise honestly) and you must convince the Jedi order to join your side but it will be difficult because of your exile from the Order that you had committed. It felt so exciting but it began slowly with plot holes that make no sense, like leaving the mining field and suddenly boom! Sith just appear right out of nowhere in the mine facility, those moments you swear you feel you miss watching some cut scenes. Not to mention the ending where it leaves you a cliffhanger and you just ask what happen to this certain event, or why is he important to the certain role that at the end you forgot about him in the first place. All of this doesn’t explain and it acts that kotor 3 will come “for the truth” which honestly doesn’t deserve that excuse for an easy explanation to the minor plot holes (especially of how nice the revelation came to be.) Not only that but certain moments of the game you feel a rush of excitement when combat starts but in moments where you think the “badass” comes, it falls flat. Sometimes those moments are good but sometimes there are weak moments I can’t explain why they didn’t pursue those moments to be epic once, maybe budget or time cuts?Star wars the clone charactersNow don’t get me wrong, there are now many new aliens in kotor 2 and they have improved on the human models to not look the same all the time. No, I am talking about your AI companions, they aren’t that bad is just that first I notice that most of the personality they act comes from the previous characters from kotor 1, I don’t know if is me but I swear Atton is like a copy of Carth, but much annoying, his back story doesn’t even help liking him more. As for the rest of the characters I don’t find them as much of a connection as to my old crew, for one thing the new “trust” system looks good at first but then certain dialogues tend to repeat themselves if not few, so there is not much of open conversation unless I’m missing something? The worst thing about your companions is that half of them are useless on their purpose to ""follow you"", Mira and especially G0-T0 is the worst offenders because their existence is absolute pointless, they could just be easily set aside as quest favors or temporarily companions, those characters I stumble upon almost at the end of the game, which by the time I go for the final mission I forgot I can select this character she/he decide to tag along. There are few new characters I sort of fond of like Visa a blind Sith who seeks the truth of your adventure and Kreia, an interesting wise old (yet selfish she seems within her reason) Jedi who wants to lead the protagonist to the right path, at least in her view. The technician and finally the always fan favorite HK-47 who is now I think funnier than ever before especially if you give him the Pacific chip, you will get a chuckle out of him. You can always influence your partners to be good or bad depends of your Force meter and even train them to be Jedi padawans! Though their attitudes don’t change only when enough “trust” and finish some certain dialogue you can teach them of the force, that’s all.How about the villains they are great right! Well….one of them, Sith Sion looks so cool with its corpse shape body, don’t feel any pain and just want death! The other with a haunted mask, um…what’s his name again? Half of the play through I completely forgot his name, he had potential he looks like a badass next level villain going on, he is a leech that sucks up the Force and drains it out until the person is dead is sounds so cool-if we get more scenes out of him! Back story I don’t know much about except when I look in Kotor 2 wiki to know more about the guy and I only know little of him in the game, the comic seems to show a bit more backstory and shows more of an actual intimidating villian. Sadly in the game he is an underrated villain that gets a few lines and screenshots like Darth Maul and not the full extend potential this guy could have been. I love him and Sion and I want him to have as much attention as he had but I guess the comic should make it up for it.dark side, light side what’s the difference?Sadly they dumb down the “moral meter” like if you're going for light side, yes you have good moments with people you met but the major characters that will judge you near the end, nope they will treat you like a monster and at the end your effect will be “good” but only through story telling instead of seeing the effects. Want to be dark side, be a prick to everyone with no reason and the major characters will see you the same monster they still sees in you and at the end your effects, same thing story telling that you ""feel"" the horrid impact but the effect is less than when you are good, show don’t tell is always important. Especially in the “trust” system your partners morals are really one sided, like one of the good character calls you out on doing something bad but next mission she slaughter innocent characters and even encourage the players to do so. There is the flaw of the trust system the inconsistent character moral placements, it just do what it wants to nag you and the characters will have no impact if you did something terribly wrong, they would not question nor abandon you or any, though if you go to the dark side you will get more dark side characters than it is light side characters, but it is the same. Bad characters don’t react on your good behavior on some missions but in one particular simple mission they would go all out on you.  Gameplay and ConclusionGameplay is nice and it adds a few elements to it like crafting, new force powers, new partner trust system, they are good but it feels like this game had been rush like it could have add more than just a few treats and that’s what most people had an issue with. Not only cut contents but the bugs is everywhere!  I spot many dialogue glitch problems when talking to an NPC, not to mention some scenes will froze itself or don’t do anything, it is frustrating. Thankfully and I can’t believe I haven’t realize the existing of it, but there is a very good mod called “the sith lord restored content modification (I will link it at the end of the review) it fixes “most” of the issues even add some of the plot holes that was missing, it is like the actual sequel to Kotor 2. At its “vanilla” state I will give a 5/10 (I wish steam has a medium choice option, but as for vanilla state is a no option, but the mod defiinatly a yes on improvment) it had potential but for the “holiday rush” it did show the end result of bugs, missing contents the works. But for the restored mod content if I played it again fully, it could get a 6 or maybe 7 out of 10 but as of now I am moving on to other games so hopefully when I have the time and energy I will play the full version, is a must have to get the full experience.


(English) The Sith Lords Restored Content Modification (TSLRCM) 
A Workshop Item for STAR WARS™ Knights of the Old Republic™ II: The Sith Lords™
By: Hassat Hunter

			This mod's intention is to restore much of the content cut from The Sith Lords, that was lost to the main game due to a rush to release the game.

												Just finished the game after over a decade of procrastination. Honestly, it pales in comparison to the original KOTOR. I would recommend playing KOTOR and forgetting about KOTOR II unless you feel some dire need to finish both of them (like I did).Pros:-The journey towards getting your first lightsaber is delightfully, frustratingly long.-The game retained my interest until I finished it.-The gameplay mechanics are *significantly* improved over KOTOR I, but that doesn't make up for the lack of substance in the rest of the game.-There were some fights that made me have to load previous saves more times than I care to admit, which I consider a good thing since a lot of games these days are way too easy.-Some of the voice acting was phenomenal, particularly Kreia. -You really do feel like you are becoming the most overpowered Jedi/Sith/Whatever in existence, and that gave me a raging brainer.-I would totally bang the Handmaiden, despite her blind obedience to whoever she is following around.Cons:-Ending was nowhere near as satisfying as I would've hoped, especially considering my aforementioned decade of procrastination.-For a game that is based on choices, it is incredibly linear.-The game rewards you for playing as either good or evil, but I take pride in being a ""chaotic neutral"" and my character suffered as a result.-Some of the environments felt half-a$$ed, and most of the worlds were already in KOTOR I. A good amount of the game seemed like a copy/paste job.-The Sith Academy was an absolute joke compared to KOTOR I. ""Hurr durr the 'training' is now automated since we didn't have the budget to actually put any interactive characters in the academy.""-Some of the voice acting (particularly Mira) was so bad that I began to wonder if half of the voice actors even read their lines *once* before recording them.-Visas had the same few dialog options for about 80% of the game...bleh.-I think I had some awful interaction with Bao-Dur way back and as a result, I couldn't say anything other than ""nevermind"" to him for 90% of the game. He seemed cool but I think he may have gotten butthurt when I insulted the Republic. Sorry dude, it's not my fault that the Republic is one of the most boring/vanilla political bodies in science fiction. -The game did not feel nearly as complete or well-designed as KOTOR I.-Carth Onasi is a whiny little ♥♥♥♥♥. He only appeared in KOTOR I, but the Onasi Blaster reminded me of how much of a party pooper he was and I felt the need to mention it.			"

												Not as good as number 1, that's for sure. Can't explain why but when you start on KOTOR 1, you feel like you have a mission or duty to carry out. in 2, you just don't. 2 was very complicated in terms of gameplay (to much interraction with robots, light shields and other♥♥♥♥♥♥ plus the controls for PC are all over the place. do yourself a favour and get number one instead, i must have played that game about four times over wheras i don't think i got past a few hours in this game.

												Not a bad game, but the ending ruined it for me. I will keep things vague so that there are no spoilers. I loved KOTOR1 and was pretty excited to play this one, and at first I had fun with it. But then I got to the end. It felt rushed and unfinished. None of the interactions with any of the other characters payed off.  Major characters just disappeared for no discernable reason. You are basically just plunked into a series of half-baked boss battles and then told that the game is now over, thanks for playing. And unlike the excellent KOTOR1, the major plot developments were so obvious that it was almost insulting when the characters acted surprised by them. There are fan mods that restore some cut content to the game, but even then the story feels incomplete. It certainly wasn't a terrible game, by any stretch. It was fun to play and started strong, but the ending was so disappointing and badly done that I don't think I will ever play it again. Had I known before, I wouldn't have wasted my money. After some fun space adventures I was left with nothing but a bad taste in my mouth. I guess if it is cheap and you just want to play some more KOTOR but with a few fun new mechanics, I might recommend it. But don't expect the story to really pay off. I'll just play KOTOR1 again.

												If you have a moderatly high end PC, running Windows 7, don't bother.  The Steam page implies you can run this game as well as KOTOR, don't believe either one.  That being said, you might get lucky and have the exact proper setup to allow you to play, both games failed for me.  KOTOR after just a couple of minutes, I didn't even get past the character creation.  KOTOR II after getting to Telos and getting the first cut scene showing the Sith with the Guy Fawkes mask and needing a new set of vocal chords.  After that, it constantly crashes to the desktop and the few times I can get to the loading screen it doesn't recognize either the keyboard or the mouse.  Thanks Steam, thanks LucasArts.  Yes, I know the game is old, irrelevent in my moron opinion.  If you are going to offer software for sale, make sure it works.  If you're not going to make sure it works, don't offer it for sale, just give it away and let someone else fix it.			"

												I really wanted to like this, but the amount of content that is missing is just embarassing. While there are tons of interesting characters and subplots, practically none of them are fully developed or even concluded. Even major parts of the main quest are ignored by the ending. This becomes painfully obvious on the game's final planet, where a load of random things happen but are never explained in the slightest.			"

												It pains me to not reccomend this game... or rather perhaps it's simply this version that's on Steam.  I played and finished KOTOR 1&2 years ago but this version has been nothing but a buggy mess.  Mind you I haven't ran into any game-breaking bugs but I have had to exit and run the game many times to fix some.  For example:-Rapid dialogue skipping bug.  Only fixable by completely exiting the game.-Clipping bugs.  Getting stuck inside of objects.-Weird clipping bugs.  Getting stuck inside of nothing.-Camera panning bugs.  Camera gets stuck on one angle.-Inability to skip dialogue bug.  Forces you to listen to the full audio dialogue without the option to skip.-Mouse button simply stops working bug.  Self explanatory.Suffice it to say, this bugs are enough for me to have turned off the game in frustrated disgust more than once.  Considering how much I love the Star Wars franchise and KOTOR, that should tell you something.			"

												First off, I love the style of this game. I love the Skills like Security and Computer Use, and I love all the Feats and Powers you can obtain. However, there are a few things that ruin this game. First off, the allied AI are stupid as heck. There were several times in the game when I charged into a fight, turned around, and saw my comrades weren't there. Sometimes, even in wide open areas and I specifically tell them to, they don't even attack enemies unless I switch to them. Then there was also a time when one of my characters ran straight into a minefield, even though they were set to stationary. Another thing is the Cursor. I was just playing a minute ago and attempted to shoot a group of enemies hiding behind a minefield by clicking on them. However, the Cursor wouldn't let me click on them, it kept wanting to select the mine that was in front of them. No matter how much i moved the camera, it wouldn't get to a position where I could select the enemy and kept clicking on the mine. This was a very bad design choice. All in all, this game would have been so much better if these flaws were ironed out. But of course, Big Game companies don't care.			"

												I played this game without any mods or cheats, and for the most part it worked and was a great experience. I did not have issues that some others have reported with broken mechanics or cut scenes. However, what ruined this game completely was the incredibley rushed ending that left too many unanswered questions. It felt like an incomplete game. The story, though not as good as the first game, was engaging enough, but I cannot recommend this game as it stands solely because of the unsatisfying and sloppy ending. All the developers needed to do was put in more time to develop a better way to close things off, but instead they chose the lazy route and cranked out an incomplete game that they never even bothered to patch (although I've read that they actually did patch it fairly recently, a decade after its release). I have no respect for this kind of rush-job and lack of respect for the consumer.			"

												Let me start of by saying this game is amazing, very fun and well thought out. However my experience with technical issues and bugs completely ruined the gameplay and left me feeling robbed. Let me start of by listing all of the bugs and problems that drove me away from what would have otherwise been a spectacular game.1. Cutscenes- they didnt work at all, the opening of a cutscene would close my game window and leave the screen black until I reopened it. It was a minor problem, I got used to, but it was annoying as hell.2. Looting bodies- Another minor issue (also super annoying) was 99% of the time bodies couldnt be looted right away, I had to walk away for 30 secs and come back until the game gave me the option to loot. (sometimes I got the option immediately, but that was rare.)3. Unable to reach or open certain containers or bodies- After killing certain npc's or encountering lockers or containers the game seemed to register them in areas that cannot be reached. For example I would kill a group of soldiers and a few bodies would die behind a barrel or in a patch of grass and i wouldn't be able to loot them because they got stuck behind some barrier in the environment. Same thing with the containers, for ex I would walk up to a plasteel container and try to open it, but my character couldn't reach it to loot.4. Issues with quest objectives- Here comes my major problem that made me unable to play the game. On many quests required cutscenes are supposed to appear that trigger the end of a level or create certain conditions that allow the character to continue a playthrough. Unfortunately over and over I encountered bugs where these scenes or situations didn't appear, which forced me to reload saves and restart entire quests and levels. This was bearable too, until one level where all the doors became locked and I was unable to leave because the cutscene didn't appear. I tried reloading saves, retrying levels and even resorted to modding but nothing worked, This forced me to terminate the game prematurely and leave me salty enough to write this long♥♥♥♥♥review. TL;DR Too many bugs and some are gamebreaking.			"

												It's just not worth it... You're fighting against poor autosaves (make sure you manually save throughout the game, btw, you'll think the autosave system is working fine but then you'll kick yourself), poor game balance (G0T0's yacht), game breaking glitches, incomplete quests, blatant dialogue omissions, shoddy cutscenes... In the end, finishing the sequel to one of the great classics is not worth the effort or spoiled experience.			"

												Never, in all my life, have i been more disatisfied by an ending of a video game.If you have not played the original KOTOR, stop reading this, and buy that instead. I would give it five stars.I would give KOTOR2 two stars at best. the late game was obviously rushed and unfinished, and leaves so many questions unswered.  the design is incredibly clever, great mechanics, and a good early to mid story, but the ending sucks. as i understand there was a ""knights of the old republic III"" scheduled but it was canceled. so, imagine the watching the empire stikes back, but having no return of the jedi following it. (also imagine Empire took you 30+ hours to watch)the gameplay was great, and you get really stong late game (as a Jedi master/Sith lord sould be) and i was loving it right up untill the last 6 hours. the ending ruined the whole game for me, and i probobly wont play it again.If you enjoyed the original game for the gameplay rather than the story than KOTOR2 is a great sequel.If you Enjoyed the Original game for the story and Characters, is a terrible Sequel.

I get to the tunnels and try to go through the super-heated rock WITH the shields equipped, and I die. They say move quick ebough with the shields. Can you sprint? NO. Can you jump? NO. Can you do teh combat yourself while constantly clicking? NO. The combat mechanic is so slow and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that you die when yo urun into 5 mining droids with a maintence droid. AND your character misses alot. I know you can skip this mission, but really? That's almost the only way for newer players. I try to get out of this mission by beating it.

												One of the best rpgs ever made. This game is so intense, and Ive played it for years and  istill love it. Even better with the restored content mod that are available in the workshop (you just need to hit the subscribe button and it works). This game doesnt go on and on and on about how jedi = good and sith = bad. It gives you consequences of every action. For example, in one part of the game, you can help a beggar and give him some cash (credits). If you give him cash, he gets robbed. If you dont give him cash, then he will probably starve or be less happy (that doesnt affect you, just saying that realistically), and if you kill him, you get obviously dark side points and become ""evil"" since it wasnt needed to kill him. Point is, every action has consequences and this game stresses that. Amazingly addicting, rating 10/10.			"

												Tirando o fato de que o jogo foi apressado para ter um lançamento rápido, esta versão da Steam é extremamente cheia de bugs. Para começar a jogar, caso você tenha um monitor wide (todo mundo), é preciso instalar alguns mods, patches e até alterar linhas dentro de arquivos do sistema do jogo. Não é coisa simples. Então, não vale a pena. Comprei como parte do bundle de aniversário de Star Wars, por gostar da franquia e de RPGs, mas me arrependeria muito se tivesse comprado só este jogo.			"

												I played KOTOR 2 when it first came out and I remember not liking it at all compared to KOTOR 1. Now, about 10 years later, I wanted to give it another chance - I still do not like it at all. I remember playing through KOTOR 1 at least three times, going through the Light Side, Dark Side, and then as neutral as possible. In KOTOR 2, I could only stomach playing through the Light Side and then gave up on playing through again. In short, pass on this game. A few of the problems I had: The philosophy of one of the main characters was not interesting at all - her motivation and the conclusion to her storyline was unsatisfying. I could not empathize with her in any way and I dreaded having to include her when choosing party members. The two main villains are far too mysterious and uninteresting. You're given minimal background on them, which is fine, but you really learn nothing about them except that they're bad and they want to destroy everything. They aren't even fun to fight.There are too many times when you lose control of your character. There are instances in the game where your character is taken out of your control and you have to use your secondary characters to play through huge chunks of story. These instances were a slog to get through and had me wondering why I was even continuing the game. The pathfinding sucks. I had to reload the game repeatedly because the character I was controlling had killed an enemy and would then be frozen in place. The camera was adjustable, but the character would not move. Other times, I would be stuck running against an invisible barrier after a door opened or be running at a storage container but stuck behind an object watching the running animation loop forever and nothing else happening.The amount of cut content is too much to ignore. This was a huge deal back when this game came out and it's still an issue now. Without downloading the Restoration mod, gigantic chunks of the game are just completely missing. This is extremely evident in the final scene of the game. It just ends after defeating the final boss. Did your character escape? How is the Ebon Hawk suddenly free? What is going on? No explanation, just unsatisfaction.Again, pass on this game.It's a mess, it's uninteresting, and it doesn't even end well. I picked it up for $5 during this past winter sale (2016) and I regret spending even that small amount. Get KOTOR 1 instead. KOTOR 1 is still fun to play through, there are stories that you want to find out more about, and it comes to a satisfying conclusion.			"

However, having played it, I've never come to believe I was...mostly right. Gameplay-wise, this is the first game. Story-wise is where the game differs and it might not have been my cup of tea. I can see why others might prefer the sequel's tale, but it just never clicked for me.It also took forever to get moving, often threw endless waves of minions instead of interesting foes and sometimes seems to not like Star Wars so much. I don't know why, but my playthrough just left me feeling underwhelmed and negative about the whole experience. But again, I understand why people would like/love this one.

												This game frustrates me so much. Unfortunately, like its predecessor, KOTOR II's Steam version is incredibly broken. Like with the original game, to even get past the opening logos I had to disable the game's movies. The resolution problems the previous game has are here too. I managed to play the prologue and the first chapter, but attempting to travel to the next planet via the galaxy map caused the game to crash every time I tried. Even if there was a way to fix this issue I'm not sure I would bother, as my desire to play this game has been completely sapped thanks to the host of issues it has. What makes this even more annoying is that from what I've played it actually looks to be a very good game. The gameplay is very similar to the original, but with more polish. The animations are more numerous and better done, the UI and menus are much simpler, and the voice acting is considerably better. However, it doesn't matter how good this game is because you won't be able to get far enough to enjoy it. The old Star Wars games available on Steam seem to be broken more than often than not, and I'm afraid Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II is no exception.Steam version: 2/10.Don't buy the Steam version of this game. You would just be wasting your time.			"

												It's not that this isn't a good game. It's not quite to the level that the original KOTOR was, but it's certainly an excellent RPG it its own right. The problem with this game is that there is a persistent game breaking bug that has existed from its original release on PC all those years ago. I got the urge to play this game due to the upcoming release of the new Star Wars movie. Normally I wouldn't even bother attempting to review a game that is this old on steam, but I figure that I am not the only person who may get this urge to play an excellent Star Wars RPG. The problem occured for me about 10 hours in, and I consider myself lucky because it's usually discovered far later in many playthroughs. Once you reenter the Ebon Hawke (your star ship) on Dantooine, it is a very common occurance that you will never be able to reload Dantooine. This is unfortunate because it is required that you visit dantooine at least twice, once for its primary mission and again after you have completed all the other main missions when you are meant to reunite the characters that you meet. I reentered my ship before I actually finished the primary mission on Dantooine, so now I am unable to advance any farther in the game. If you are thinking about playing through this game again, just bewarned that this might happen to you.			"

The game feels empty 90% of the time, it's just empty walking until you meet enemy. And if you are escaping Peragus Mining station everything is empty, it's not like you are running away from enemy. When Kreia fights a sith, she tells you to run, and the door closes behind her. You don't have to run, and also the whole area you are in, is EMPTY. You can walk around, explore empty rooms, loot containers. When she gets injured and it's time for the sith to use his lightsaber on the door and break through and chase you. You still don't have to run, because that never happens. You can go all the way back, and stand beside that same door and look at it. Basically because it's a turn based game, and an ancient game, they never developed any sense of anything in real time. The story doesn't happen in real time. Your escapes don't happen in real time, cutscenes are set off by waypoints, reaching a spot on the map, and even then you don't have to do anything, you can stand there... effectively eliminating any chance for adrenaline, being in the moment, and suspension of disbelief. I never liked the KOTOR series. KOTOR one is just boring, and even though I tried to play and finish it three times, I couldn't, I got bored in the middle each time. If you want a good starwars game, play Republic Commando.			"

												'Knights of the Old Republic' is my favourite 'Star Wars' game to date in part due to its epic scope. Plus, since it came out after 'Attack of the Clones', 'KOTOR' pretty much turned into the prequel that many of us wished we got instead. I remember playing the game for 48 hours straight this one time instead of studying for my finals. (It was this 48-hour gaming marathon that made me swear off epic gaming sessions for good.) That was more than a decade ago, and those good times still mean a lot to me.Despite being a big fan of 'KOTOR', I never played 'KOTOR II: The Sith Lords'. I strongly believed it then that Bioware should have made the sequel, and I refused to pay full price for a game that was buggy at launch, especially when they should have learned from 'KOTOR''s buggy launch that got fans upset. Learning that some game content were also cut in order for the developers to meet the release date made me even less interested in giving 'KOTOR II' a try.Thanks to Aspyr and the hardworking modding community, 'KOTOR II' was patched up and had its cut content restored recently. Given that, I decided to finally give 'KOTOR II' a try. The game that I played was modded with the Restored Content Modification v.1.8.4. So how did 'KOTOR II' measure up over a decade later?What I enjoyed most about 'KOTOR II' is that some in-game and Force alignment decisions are neither clearly Light nor clearly Dark, resulting in more challenging decision making and requiring more self relfection. Furthermore, your character has the ability to influence other party members, leading to different ways characters can develop. Plus, the conversations that you can have with your party members, such as Kreia, Visas and Brianna, are some of the best bits of writing in 'Star Wars' lore I have seen to date.Unfortunately, the patched and modded version of 'KOTOR II' that I played was still very buggy. The game camera occasionally stuttered or spun around non-stop, pathfinding issues persisted, and an achievement was awarded even when I did not earn it (thanks though!). For some reason, the game's graphics looked more dated than that of 'KOTOR', and some character models looked weird with their bug-eyed appearance. Plus, I had issues with the game's pacing as it took an unnecessarily long time for it to get interesting. Why do I again need to play a Jedi who has to relearn the Force, and wait so long to pick up a lightsaber? I played 'KOTOR' already, just let me get to the good stuff!Datedness aside, I cannot wholeheartedly recommend 'KOTOR II' given how unpolished it is. Given how one needs to devote much time to truly take in all the rich content the game has to offer, I cannot even recommend curious gamers to give it a quick go to see if they'd like it, especially when it takes many hours before the game starts to get somewhat interesting. Fans of 'Star Wars' Legends (formerly Expanded Universe) may be able to overlook the unresolved bugs and antiquated graphics to enjoy 'KOTOR II'; sadly, I could not.			"

												The game in itself is actually rather good. The issue here is that the game is just full of bug's that keep you from fully enjoying the experience.. some even prevent you from playing the game at all. I just gave up half through the game because new bugs just kept appearing. I recommend you buy KOTOR1, don't waste your money on this one unless you are willing to spend time modding/patching the game to a playable state.			"

The game opens, opening sequence finishes, and then it just force crashes LITERALLY 5 secs after the title screen appears, regardless of whether I leave it, click new game, load game etc. I would recommend this game to anyone, anywhere OTHER than Steam.

												well i loved the game when i had it previously however, the game requires some serious fixes. for examplei could not start the game beyond the obsidian introduction video, thanks to searching on many forums i found a way to get past that issue only to find that once the ship docks at the perugian fuel station after only about half an hour of playing the game the game will crash... i have still not found a way to succesffully get round this BUT i do actually think that whoever decided to re-release this game did so prematurely without checking full functionality when it clearly says "" minimum system requirements- windows 7 or newer"" i would seriously hope that they are able to fix these issues so i can continue to enjoy the game else i would quite like my money back...

												I can't bring myself to recommend this game, even though parts of it were enjoyable. KOTOR 1 by Bioware far, far outshines this game and credit for the enjoyable bits has to go (mostly) to Bioware. It's been many years since I've played the first game, but it's one of the most memorable RPG experiences I've had. The only reason I picked up a copy was because it was on sale. I'm glad I never bought the original at full price, for after my first playthrough, I'm pretty sure I'm just going to delete this game. First of all, everyone should know that this is a turn-based game-although screenshots might lead you to believe otherwise. The gameplay, game mechanics and combat is as  deep and rich as you'd expect to be from a turn-based RPG. My problem though is that Obsidian seems to have done very little in terms of improving or updating KOTOR 1, whether that's the game mechanics, characters, story, or even graphics.Somehow it always feels like an expansion pack to the first game, and one that has been poorly put-together at that. Yeah, it runs fine and the quests and story progression are fine, but it somehow lacks the savoriness of the first game. While I can't say that the story's 'bad', it didn't exactly enthrall me like the first game did.I did like the characters and their individual back-stories, and the voice acting is top-notch. But on several occasions there'd be a cutscene and I'd be like ""WTF is going on!? Who the hell is that, the hell are they on about?"" Personally, I thought several cutscenes were either unnecessary or left me with a ""Whatever"" kind of feeling. I found some to be downright irritating. The villains and antagonists also leave much to be desired. One of them is described as this huge bad♥♥♥♥♥by every game character, and he literally features twice in the game. Then you easily dispatch him and it's on to the next bit of the story. What gives? The worst bit, I thought, was the end. I mean there's this big fight as expected, but then the moment you're done  it just cuts away to you flying off into the sunset. Like, BAM end of story, thanks for playing. Roll credits. Ugh. Anyway, I don't know if I'm being excessively harsh. If this were an independent game that had nothing to do with a much better predecessor, I might have recommended it. But as it stands, save some money and get KOTOR 1 instead. Skip this one and pick up Mass Effect. Pros: 1. Good voice acting2. LIght Sabres. Whee!3. Deep and rich turn-based RPGCons: 1. Poorly written script. Nowhere close to the ""Whoa!"" moments that Bioware makes you experience.2. Really abrupt ending. 3. The cutscenes are downright WEIRD. Poorly directed, and often jarring.4. The story really leaves a lot to be desired. It was hard to be emotionally invested in my character.5. More like KOTOR 1: expansion pack by new developer! than KOTOR 2.			"

												It's ridiculous that this game still has the ""Can't move after combat"" bug after all these years. I loved KOTOR, so I decided to start playing the Linux port of KOTOR2 last night and ran into the movement issue right away. I've tried everything everyone in the discussion forums have suggested:  vsync (which was already on), modifying the INI (which already had most of the suggested modifications set correctly), installing TSLRCM, and even using taskset to lock the task to one CPU core. Nothing helps. At first I believed it just didn't work just because my main monitor is 2560x1080 and the sync can only be set to 59 from the menu (setting it to 60hz in the INI throws the game into a low resolution). People indicated the game just doesn't work right unless the refresh is 60hz. But, now I've also tried running it at 1920x1080 (windowed and fullscreen) @60hz with vsync enabled, and still have the same problem. :\Uninstalling and reinstalling it also did nothing but waste my time and 4+ GB of my monthly data cap.My system's completely up to date with the latest nVidia drivers, and I'm out of ideas. I think I'm just going to quit playing for now and check again if I ever see an update (I went beyond the two our refund period by leaving the game running while I researched and tried to fix the problem). Pressing F4/F5 after every single fight (it happens consistently on my system) has gotten old fast - and just pressing F4 with both mouse buttons held as suggested elsewhere does not fix the movment.

												I played KOTOR2, with the ""restoration mod"".As a huge fan of KOTOR1, I was really on the fence with this one, almost throughout, but I overall would not recommend it to most people.Where the first kotor felt complete, polished, this one just feels lacking and when you see the backstory to this game (obsidian was rushed to release it before it was finished) you see why it falls short.The story is definitely a bit 'darker', with more 'grey' situations (i.e. unlike the first kotor where there is a lot of good/evil)... however, I can't really give it all of that credit.When I remember kotor1, there are plenty of grey situations, such as the kolto planet where you need to investigate the jedi on trial, who isn't as innocent as he seems.The problem here for me really boils down to the story, it feels so scattered and sparse. While I see the ambition, and potential this game had, it just really needed more time in development by its own developers.The first mission opens up, and almost feels like a survival horror game -- everything very empty, a sense of loneliness. And I question whether or not this is intentional, as the level drags on forever.This game seems to follow the main points of kotor1. Opening level -> main planet -> find ship -> go to some jedi council place to rediscover force -> 4 planets -> etc. But like I said, everything feels unfinished. While I applaud the game for trying to take the story in a different direction, they needed more time. Each of the planets feel empty by comparison, and the amount of ""things"" you can do at each location where there is something meaningful to do is lacking.For example, you go to korriban in this game too. However here, you are dropped into the valley of the sith first. Except, all of the temples are blockd off. You just fight some enemies. Then you can go into the sith academy. Deserted, with some guys to fight. Very few story elements, then you do 1-2 things for the main story to progress the plot, and leave the planet.While everything feels unpolished, it all came down to this for me: Was the story good and compelling?Which is why you would want to play a kotor game this far after development, as KOTOR1 does hold up and I would recommend it.I really do appreciate the various things they had in mind: good cast of characters, some good ideas with the story ... just nothing came out as finished, and as a result, the game feels empty, and unpolished... even with the restoration mod.I would only recommend this if you have a lot of spare time, and recently finished kotor1 and really want more -- otherwise, just play kotor1 again.

At times like this, I wish steam had a more fine-grained rating system.  I would give it a 3 out of 5 given the choice.  However, I don't think it deserves a recomendation because it feels rushed and outright broken at times.If you don't mind a buggy 10 year old game, go for it - you'll have a great time.  Just be aware that you'll HAVE to spend time on forums & googling to find work-arounds for some bugs.  It's also possible (although less likely after recent patches) that you will have to abondon a game half way through due to bugs.			"

												As a fan of the original KOTOR this left a sour taste in my mouth as the ending was quite frankly, upsetting.This game was good, maybe even great until I reached the last planet. (Trying to avoid spoilers) The final battle was rushed and far too easy but before that walking around the planet alone feels wrong in an AI co-operative RPG. All in all this game could have been amazing if the ending didn't make me feel so utterly disappointed.4/10			"

												I've deleted my old review and am writing a new one now that I have started playing this game again. The last time I played this was on the original Xbox and I remember playing it to death.Quite frankly this game is brilliant. The storyline is brilliant, the characters are voice acted and there are loads of cut scenes. Admittedly they are very low resolution for HD screens we have today but don't let that put you off.You can make choices that influence whether you gravitate towards the light side or the dark side. Your force powers are also affected by this, it even changes the appearence of your character. You can upgrade your weapons and equipment and of course there is the standard levelling up that you get in RPGs.I've started a Jedi Guardian character this time. Already knowing that at the end of this playthrough which will take me ages I will be making a dark side character who primarily uses the force afterwards.Multiple ways to play the game, you can influence followers to get more dialog options. You can use force powers to maniplulate people. The game is massively.Gonna add the only down side here. There are a lot of crashes to desktop. Not enough to stop you playing this game, well not on my pc anyway but you do need to remember to save often. Also force powers are so much better than lightsaber combat. You can literally walk into a room full of people are force storm them all to death, whereas with a lightsaber it would take you a while to kill everyone individually.8/10			"

												First off, I want to say I really love this game. But it is infuriating how I keep having so many problems. First, it was just cutscenes not showing up. Then it was the Restored Content Mod not working even though i subscribed to it. Now it just won't open at all. It will do the first two logos for Lucasarts and Obsidian, then it just stops working. I can understand this game being broken and unfixable back in 2005, but its 2015. This is just sad.			"

												I'm disappointed with this.When the game just came out -- I thought: ""Oh yes, finally I can play KOTOR on my Ubuntu laptop."" Then I realized this wasn't KOTOR but the sequel. OK -- I made a mistake. Put a lot of time into anyways. But I found the overall experience disappointing.Pros:1. KOTOR turn-base combat system is fun.2. Dialogue is interesting.3. It's fun to see how my story plays out.4. Story driven content!Cons:1. Nar Sadarr is full of wasted space and bugs glore despite the fixes. A lot of times I asked myself: ""Seriously? That's the answer."" Or I say, ""Why aren't you attacking me? . . . OK -- NOW you attack me.""2. Combat is becomes boring once you level up too high.3. The main character becomes god-like on the normal level.4. Because good item drops aren't very common, you have to buy new equipment to fight with other party members. It seems almost like the game punishes you for choosing to adventure with different characters. They don't really interact well with the world. Even during events where you'd expect them to say something, they say nothing.5. Does not have enough story driven content to keep my interest.			"

												I played and completed this game loooong ago when I was very young and decided to try this again. I could not remember why I loved and remembered KOTOR 1 so fondly and not the sequel. But after having dumped, wasted 12 hours into KOTOR 2 its painfully obvious why that is. I will keep this brief because its been a toxic, cancerous adventure into the maw of purgatory to play this game. 1. Its broken. Mouse will frequently fail if you click it during cinematics of which there are many. Skipping opening cinematics can also cause your game to minimize permanently. This will happen everytime you start it. 2. The quests have bugs after sooo many years still. This confuses you as to whether or not you missed out of story progression or left something behind. 3. The big one. Its so god damn boring. The writing is atrocious compared to Biowares. The opening level is so dreadfully long and boring that it kills any form of replay value ever which helps illuminate why I haven't replayed it till now. It just wont end. and it keeps giving you the promise of more, interesting content over...and over...and over. And you push through it because STAR WARS...but it just never hits a high note...ever... Just keeps recycling the same god damn mission design on every planet basically and you get to start over again...and again...and again, when all you wanna do is to get a lightsaber, your robe and be a cool jedi. Tough♥♥♥♥♥♥  Ain't gonna happen. You just get to be everyone delivery boy and you'll get bored to death unless you're a haaaaaardcore star wars fan with low expectations. Is it that bad you might ask. yes it absolutely is. It doesn't matter if its star wars. It doesn't matter if it has a long, detailed story to tell and content thats luring us fans in. And thats because the content... is♥♥♥♥♥♥ Im sorry...but it is and we gotta be aware of this and call it like we see it. Not apologise for it because its star wars because Obsidian...absolutely screwed this up so badly I dont ever wanna play this game ever again. I felt sick playing. Drained and tired. Stressed and angry because it just never ceased being pointless, boring, lackluster and cheap feeling. It has great potential, premise and good elements, in depth characters, BUT... the execution makes it so stupidly hard to enjoy for me personally.This is a prime example of a messed up sequel and why most sequels suck. I wish bioware had been in charge of this. I hope Bioware will make the 3rd one because this game is atrocious.Play KOTOR 1. Love what good content we have there. Seeing something new and fresh... in KOTOR 2... is simply not worth it because its content is no where NEAR....remotely NEAR:...the quality Bioware gave us. The characters, progression, planets, missions and feeling of star wars. Nostalgic music too. Combine that with wanting to become a jedi again, get the cool stuff like in KOTOR 1... Hah. Forget it. You ain't getting it. Just endless waves of garbage that could be so good but fails  (To this very day) team of developers who have a bad rep for making broken, buggy games. jesus christ Im so glad I replayed it so I know I never have to EVER think about this again. Mother of god. Stay away from KOTOR 2. Dont let it lure you in with its Star Wars premise. Its lying to you and will hurt you. Its absolutely nothing like KOTOR 1. Too much fanboyism is protecting this game and franchise.  This game does not deserve the score it has and people thinking this is better than Kotor 1 are out of their minds or have not taken a close look at what this game REALLY offers in comparison to the first one. Jesus. Quitting this game made me feel like Ryan Reynolds in that haunting movie where he exited the haunted house and began feeling less possessed to go on a killing spree and murder his family. Thats what this game will do to you. Drive you insane with its endless baiting whilst never giving you what you need as a fan. 1 word to describe this game due to its progression design: Cancer. Not...an overstatement. Damn shame too.Edit: I came back because I have been thinking and Ill say this. I enjoy the characters. Traya is great, though her speeches can get really boring due to the rest of the game not incentivising talking to her. Its a shame  because shes cool. Mira is awesome as well. Rebellious and Handmaiden is someone you want to explore. Problem is the game restricts your access to them to Lightside Darkside or Male/Female. Which...is quite annoying. Very...annoying. I wish I could like this but as it stands, the bad outweigh the good. I can see the good, enjoy it. I'd love to read a book about this story, but not play a game with this game design. And thats without getting into the fact that in my opinion... Meetra Surik... just isn't that interesting at all. And that just made it worse, following a character that even the game keeps telling you was in and will forever be in Revans shadow. Practically beats you over the head with it. And all it did was made me want to play as Revan. ""sigh""If you play with the restored Content Mod then its playable and very different in some ways. It contains a powerful story regarding Kreia. But without that mod... no. Absolutely not.			"

												All bugs aside this game is a complete mess. Compared to the original KOTOR it falls short in every aspect. In attempting to deal with darker themes it offers promises of truly morally interesting stories, but fails to deliver. Worst of all, playing the game feels like a chore. The level design is some of the worst I have ever witnessed, they are designed to be labyrinthine and confusing which breaks immersion and quickly makes you stop giving a♥♥♥♥♥♥ The enemies are repetitive and far too numerous, a problem which existed in the first game but was expounded upon in the sequal to an absurd degree. The companions are all one dimensional and cliche, so much so that I found myself skipping all of the dialouge with them as opposed to the first game in which I was actually interested in what they had to say. Rather than enhancing the aspects that made the first game so wonderful, the developers saw fit to strip away all of the charm and replace it with confusing level design, poorly written characters, boring plots, and an ugly UI. There is nothing redeeming about this game, even if it was fun on some level, the bugs would prevent it from being enjoyed. Stay away from this. It is garbage.			"

Quests with destinations I have no clue where they are, or even how to begin to get there. Run here, nope that is not it. Run there, dead end. Run around some more, maybe I missed something, so run back. Maybe the story gets better, but I cannot stand it so far, and do not care to find out.

												Absolutely atrocious game. Tutorial level too long (3 hours), boring, meandering and unfairly challenging. Instead of level design the developers opted for the classic ""throw more waves of dumbass enemies at the player.""I'm just about to get to the Ebon Hawk and leave this soul-destroying mining facility behind only to find the hangar packed with up to 20 enemies spamming grenades, freeze rays and flamethrowers at me.Tried to get past the wall that is common to all Bioware games, that initial prologue/tutorial section, but I just couldn't give a toss really. Even with the restored content mod, ""Rushed to market"" is written all over every aspect, from graphics, sound, level design, gameplay mechanics etc, of the game.			"

												TL;DR: It's boring and stupid, give it a miss.Pretty garbage. Not made by the same studio as the first and you can tell, corners are cut everywhere. The story is terrible, and the words are lazy and unfinished. The game is unneccisary long, and there are many times where all you are doing is walking from one place to another through a boring and generic landscape. Would not go play the first one.			"

												I'm not going to talk about this game.  I thought KotOR was one of the best Star War games of all time, and it made me think that this is probably the most exciting time period in the Star Wars universe.  And KotOR II by Obsidian didn't screw it up.  They didn't really play with any of the original formula.  It's basically just a different plot pasted on top of the 1st installment.  Sometimes, that's all you need.  It delivered, and if you liked KotOR, you'll like this one all the same.Now the reason I decided to write this review;  any chance this game gets to freeze up, it does it.  I have a game dedicated tower.  When this game freezes on me, I start up Bioshock: Infinite and Battlefield 4 on Ultra and play without a problem.  And when I say Steam has an excellent track record with me, I mean that the 100+ games we've played over the years have never done this.  I create a character and press play; freezes.  I walk into a different part of the map and it hits a load screen; freezes.  I press pause; freezes.  I don't understand.  I've uninstalled and reinstalled it.  I've reset my PC, I've given it a few days.  I don't know what to say, other than I am dissapointed that I would have to buy the original XBOX disc to be able to enjoy this game again.  So sad			"

												I have played it for 13 hours. At first I was very into it, felt like a deeper Mass Effect, but the problem is the story is very weak - Jedi have been almost wiped out by Sith - that is all I gotten so far. The dialogues have many options but I have to force myself to concentrate on them. They are often about past events and characters that I simply cannot care about. Malak balak raven vaven macalanian wars. I am at point where I have several options which planet to travel to, I chose one that I thought was mentioned in dialogues but as I arrive the welcoming character starts extremely boring dialogue that branches into even more boring options that makes me simply give up on this game. I know that I can skip most dialogue if I wanted but what's the point playing then? because the gameplay let's be honest is clunky hack and slash or pew fest. I am very disappoint, after hearing from some that this is the best game they ever played, this could easily be one of the WORST games I ever played and I'm not even exaggerating.			"

												KotOR 2 is without a doubt a half baked piece of garbage compared to the first game.  The story is highly intriguing, but man, this game is eternally buggy and incomplete.  Character conversations are out of pace with the progession of the plot.  Action sequences (such as when you fight Visas Marr) can be awkwardly left and returned to later (I was able to walk around the Ebon Hawk like it was business as usual despite there being a Sith on the ship).  Voice acting is sloppier and of generally of lower quality than the first game (aside from Kriea, who is the only reason that I might consider still playing this game).  The first level, Peragus, is one of the most boring maps I've ever played and lasts way too long.  Side quests are uninspired (feel more like chores than adventures of importance) and are obviously used as filler rather than a way to embellish the planets you visit (especially Nar Shaadda); some are actually unfinishable.  Cut material is still apparent in this ""final product"" (e.g. in the Old Military Base on Telos, the Sub Basement area is never accessible).  Level design is lazy and unremarkable, with the same hallway patterns (grids) used across levels.  I could go on.I know that this game was released on a tight deadline but this is unacceptible, especially with the amount of praise this game receives.  I've read reviews comparing KotOR 2 and KotOR 1 to The Empire Strikes Back and A New Hope respectively in terms of complexity and quality.  They could not be further from the truth. KotOR 2 had promise and ultimately could have been a superior game to the first KotOR.  LucasArts and Obsidian squandered this opportunity years ago, however.  No amount of apologism can change the fact that this game is a crappy, unfinished mess.			"

Posted: August 7, 2015
												I hope everyone takes the time to read this review as much as I took to write it.This wasn't the sequel that fans of the original Knights of the Old Republic were hoping for. I, especially, was surprised to hear that too when i heard that the sequel to the compelling game series was ruined by lazy development. Yet, here i am, typing a bad review of a game series that I loved so much. Lots of opinions of this game start off by saying the graphics had.. become lacking in the polish the original had, leaving a lot to ask if they had recycled the game engine. I believe that the shift in development to Obsidian Entertainment had contributed to the poor resolution of graphics compared to the careful, meticulous details of the first from Bioware and Aspyr. They had defintiely improved the animations of character expression (which to be fair is difficult as it is from an animator's perspective) but Obsidian seemed more obsessed over making all the combat look ""cool"" and ""immersive"" that they had forgotten to write a story with the same qualities. Bioware and Aspyr understood that a story has to be compelling to really convince people that they are there in the universe of Star Wars. They took a lesson from ol' Lucas himself when writing the first game's story... they had conflict in the beginning, a mission to save a damsel, a wookie, an asthmatic cyborg villain, visiting different planets, a revelation of immense proportions and finally a gigantic space battle. This was the formula, and it didn't matter if the graphics looked subpar from 2003, you just knew that when an NPC in the game talked about their homeworld of Corellia in the Outer Rim of the galaxy, that they were a part of a living world, they added to the immersion and they didn't even have to show you, they just had to say it. Somehow, saying that the Jedi Enclave on Dantooine being decimated by Malak's armada was more of an impact than showing it. That's what made KOTOR so amazing for it's time.Obsidian Entertainment tried their best, however, they gave a story that followed the formula of how to make a Knights of the Old Republic game, not how to make an amazing Star Wars game. I liked where they were coming from when it came to writing and character development, especially the villains representing aspects of the Exile (Darth Nihilus to represent the abandonment of moral principle and belief, Darth Sion to represent the idea of pain from the past keeping yourself stronger and Darth Traya representing betrayal to the people you swore you'd fight for) however, these only served as snippets of what the developers could have done.Then comes the infamous ending that so many fans hate about this game. Originally, your companions were supposed to serve as a compelling part of the ending on Malachor V. However, back in 2004 when the game was originally supposed to be released, Obsidian Entertainment was going through some setbacks and had to rush their deadline to release the game. Many have criticized it as being an incomplete game, especially towards the end. I feel like we've come this far as a gaming community to understand that rushing a deadline for a game is probably a good indicator that it's not going to live up to expectations. So to wrap it up, I felt like this game was definitely more unique in some ways and lacking in others, but to condemn this game as sacrilegious to the KOTOR series would be going a little to far. I invite newer gamers to give the first game a try, however this was definitely not the sequel that i was hoping for, and unless you're a diehard Star Wars fan as well as a diehard KOTOR fan, then i wouldn't recommend this game to you, even if asked to play it.

												Bought this game together with KOTOR 1 on a sale. KOTOR 1 was amazing, its graphic was ahead of it's time, there aren't many mundane fetch quests, each planet has its own theme and it is so interesting to visit a new planet and explore. Sure it is a bit too slow sometimes, but it was pretty (love the desert with that broken sand cruiser).KOTOR 2 is incredibly boring right from the start. I mean it is unbelievably, utterly, mind-numbingly dull right from the get ♥♥♥♥ing go. I am 6 hours into this game because I'm told that it is gonna get better eventually, but it is just as bad on Telos as it is on Taris. Boring design in terms of gameplay as well as graphic. Another incredibly annoying issue is the sheer amount of bug and crashes that appear throughout the game. Unless a series of super fun fetch quests is to your taste, then do not get this game. It is nothing like KOTOR. All you fanboys that praised this game like it is a blessing from god, you can all go ♥♥♥♥ yourself.P/s: How many more times must your character rush through an entire mine field to get to a droid, mere seconds after you specifically tell him not to?

I am 6 hours into this game because I'm told that it is gonna get better eventually, but it is just as bad on Telos as it is on Taris. Boring design in terms of gameplay as well as graphic. Another incredibly annoying issue is the sheer amount of bug and crashes that appear throughout the game. Unless a series of super fun fetch quests is to your taste, then do not get this game. It is nothing like KOTOR. All you fanboys that praised this game like it is a blessing from god, you can all go ♥♥♥♥ yourself.P/s: How many more times must your character rush through an entire mine field to get to a droid, mere seconds after you specifically tell him not to?

												Even with all the bad reviews it's given, this is my favorite Star Wars- scratch that, ALL TIME favorite game. Yes, even over the first one, and all its praise, and without mods. Go ahead and give me crap about it, shoot me, hurt me, because I don't care, but I keep coming back to this game, and I keep loving it every time I play it.First off, the story. It has this deep, sinister plot that I really like in videogames. I love that there's ""so much to do, so much to see...""  Didn't want to make a reference, but it's true. A lot of characters have stories that connect with the main character, which is a.... coincedence... It always seems like you're holding the fate of the galaxy in your hands, no mater what path or what actions you take, which is a good feeling in a game.The music is still awesome, but I will admit, I prefer TWO of the previous game's tracks more than any of the new ones. The new animations were a nice edition, as the previous game didn't have as many, and they were getting old. The new powers are awesome to say the least.That's pretty much all I have to say. If I did have anything else to say, I forgot about it. If you want to try this game, go for it. I'm not one to judge if you'll join the bandwagon, or you'll join what's probably 1% of this game's community. You'll likely change your opinion after you download The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod version 1.8.3. It's the closest to what the game was going to be we're going to get for quite a while.Good luck, and may the Force be with you.			"

												Kotor II is a mixed bag. The mechanics feel pretty good for the most part, but the plot and character development leave a lot to be desired.     There are numerous improvements made to the power/feat selection, compared to what was available in Kotor I. Blaster-wielding characters are more viable, classes can spend feats to remove cross-class skill penalties, and the upgrade/crafting system has been greatly expanded. In this respect, this game is better than its predecessor.     The story, on the other hand, feels like a step back, at least in my opinion. There are some iteresting characters with interesting perspectives and goals, but the plot itself seems... absent for much of the game (especially for the first 10 or so hours).     ""Rough"" is the word that best describes Kotor II. It isn't a bad game, but It has enough blemishes to make it difficult to recommend.(EDIT: Tried to make the whole thing less ranty.)			"

												I absolutly love this game, but find another way to play it. The new update either works great for you or made the game COMPLETELY unplayable. and from my experience, before teh update, there were fan made bug fixes, so the game was actually very playable, now they patched it and it has become unplayable. the time I have on record over the last two weeks, was mostly from before the patch and trying to troubleshoot. Don't buy this game as they seem to think the bugs are the players problems, not their fix. Considering the stuff they said was my problem made no sense, but I did their troubleshooting steps anyway and it actually made it worse, I would not buy this game until they patch it again, if they patch it again. Don't belive me? Goto the forums and look at the bug reports since the patch. If they patch this again and it actually fixes things, then I will change my review, but until then, don't waste your money on a game that you only have a 50/50 shot of being able to play at all.

Huge disappointment after playing the first one.EDIT: got past the point I mentioned earlier and it continues to be a bore.

												Disjointed and unfinished.  This game was a disappointment for those who had played the original Knights of the Old Republic and was looking for a similar experience.  I found myself falling asleep to this game often enough while playing it on my labtop in bed (which accounts for my extremely high hours played on one playthrough).The engine was recycled but game balance, storyline and game mechanics were left unpolished and left much to be desired.  The horrid sudden cliche ending left a strange taste that the game was shipped as it was when a deadline was missed rather than finishing the product first.			"

												Some games just don't appeal, or have a few nagging issues that bog down an otherwise passable experience. And then there's games that make a person angry just by thinking about them. For me, KOTOR II is in the last category.While initially I thought of it as an improvement over the original KOTOR with its more interesting characters, its improved character models, its expanded game mechanics, its awesome Sith Lord concepts (a rage-fueld zombie and a human-shaped hole in the Force) and its admittedly very well done opening level. The ENTIRE REST OF THE GAME proceeds to♥♥♥♥♥♥all over these expectations.It creeps in slow, with only a few nagging concerns. Telos is basically Taris only smaller, darker, and with even less personal motive to get involved with the plot. But at least there you know exactly what you need to do to get back on track to your actual goals (even if it means playing toadie to a completely irrelevant power play between two factions).  Then you realize that the overarching goal is vague at best. The Sith are trying to kill you, and you've developed an inconvenient Force bond with the most unapologetic author avatar in the history of videogames. Somehow, hunting down the survivng members of the Jedi Council and either gathering them or murdering them will somehow resolve one or both of those issues.On two of the four planets you visit (discounting Telos), this is simple enough. There's a big fat Force user landmark on both of them. On the other two, not  so much. One, you just sort of know where the Jedi is without explanation (unless your character somehow saw the expository cutscenes too), and the other you have no choice but to wander around prodding side quests with a stick until the game decides that its ready for you.It's the latter that finally pushed me from ""ambivalent"" to ""hate."" Nar Shadda is the ♥♥♥♥♥iest ♥♥♥♥ing place I have ever been in an RPG. It's worse than Taris. It's worse than the ♥♥♥♥ing Catalyst, because at least the Catalyst is mercifully direct. Rather than being given any sort of obvious plotline to follow (even the other planet where your goal isn't obvious in-character, Onderon, the plot at least directs you down the right path), you're left to just wander around the city, with completely uninteresting side quests dangled in your face that have nothing whatsoever to do with your to main goals of ""talk to the Exchange to get rid of the bounty on your head"" and ""find the hidden Jedi master"" until you've tripped over enough cutscenes playing a sped up bounty hunter drama between a smug redhead and a psychotic Wookiee that the game is willing to let you in on the plot too.Unfortunately, when that happens it's the single stupidest ♥♥♥♥ing part of the plot. You're sent a message asking you to come alone to a lowlife bar with a poisonous-for-humans (why only humans? I've always been confused with KOTOR's weird humans-and-every-other-species seperation that is in no way hinted in the actual films apart from the Empire being 99% human, which seems to mostly be because their leader is a card-carrying evil overlord who felt racism would round out his ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ resume) atmosphere, and to come alone. Obviously it's a trap and everyone knows it, so of course you have no choice but to go alone.You can visit this bar beforehand with a gas mask and be totally fine, mind. But, because the game has some character schilling to do, you're accousted by the smug redhead and knocked out with poison gas (even if you happen to be wearing an air filter while the smug redhead explains that anyone not wearing an air filter will be knocked out), and she promptly goes and gets herself captured. The Jedi you were looking for turns up and says he's going to get involved and runs off, so you have no choice but to run into the bar after him. And now, again, EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE WEARING A GAS MASK and EVEN THOUGH YOU WERE FINE BREATHING THIS EXACT SAME AIR EARLIER, you get poisoned. Because Kreia decided she wants to come to the rescue and nobody steals her spotlight, damn it. So she teaches you a way less effecient method of being immune to poison and you're allowed to continue.If you don't like the smug redhead, I hope you kicked enough puppies before this point because once you go in there you can't leave until the dungeon's finished, and if you're not strongly Dark Side aligned you get stuck with her in your party, forcing you to play her for a section while you duel the psycho Wookiee you could've had to the death. This is around the point where I closed the game and began to write a lengthy rant of why this game pisses me off in many, many ways.Of course, no criticism of this game can come without bringing up Kreia. Where to start? She's been openly admitted to be Chris Avellone's author avatar and vehicle for him to complain about everything that rubs him wrong about Star Wars. And of course this means that she is invariably proven right about everything that comes out of her ♥♥♥♥ing mouth and characters who would never take her verbal abuse from anyone else in a thousand years are miraculously cowed by her audacious and scathing remarks. And of course she's the main villain, and is really, really ♥♥♥♥ing obvious about being up to something from minute one and you still can't do a damn thing about it. It wouldn't bother me so much if she wasn't praised as a brilliantly written character and not acknowledged for the self-assured Mary Sue she is.I'm not going to complain about the ending here, because I recognize that its bare-bones status and confusing continuity is the result of executive meddling and not a design choice by the devs. But that doesn't excuse the author avatar nailed to your ankle, or the laughably thin illusion of choice whenever forwarding the plot requires you do something incredibly stupid or out of character, or the complete lack of narrative direction, or the convenient lapses of competency whenever you're scheduled to fall into a trap, or anything else this game does atrociously.In summation, the first hour or so of this game is great fun, with an atmosphere that sets the mood nicely, a nice little conspiracy, and varied gamplay, but the game does its absolute best to♥♥♥♥♥♥all over those positive first impressions over the next 20-odd hours by being as determinedly obnoxious as possible before running out of breath and collapsing into its own mess at the end. Don't bother.			"

												Playing on a 2013 Macbook with Yosemite. What an amazing set of games KOTOR 1 and 2 are. I decided to buy KOTOR 2 after seeing it had a new patch for mac support. Already owning both games on XBOX and PC. I thought I would support the devs hoping they would maybe do the same for KOTOR 1. Alas it seems they have not even bothered with KOTOR 2. Upon departing Telos and viewing the cutscene my screen goes black and I am unable to do anything. I was able to save. So I saved reloaded the game and was able to see again. But this time I had turned into a woman and had none of my feats or items. Where is my dark sith lord I had been corrupting so far?! A light side woman? I think not....I have read this is a conflict with mods that change the graphics. I was not using any mods that did so. So far I have not found a fix for this. Such a shame. Great games.			"

												I love Star Wars and it's universe-I even loved this game when it first came out on the original Xbox. But I do not recommend buying the Steam version (obviously). Not only did the game crash repeatedly after it got past the ""Lucasarts"" and ""Obsidian Entertainment"" logos when you first run the game, but the support of the game was not helpful what so ever. I did the second installer, rebooted my computer, and even unistalled and reinstalled the game onto my computer (which was what the support page told me to do)-but none of these made it any better. I feel cheated out of my money, even if it wasn't a lot, but I expected to play a game-not to have memory on my hard disk taken up by a program that, not only can I get from the Xbox Arcade and play instead, but will not function properly and be a useless waste of my money. I do not recommend buying.			"

												Much maligned for its many infamous bugs, Star Wars: KOTOR II is a greek tragedy of a video game. I've logged many hours on both this game and its vastly superior predecessor. The key difference between the two games is the weightlessness of the characters inhabiting this installment. What's truly regretfull is that, beneath all of its flaws, there's still a story worthy of telling here. If you've got the patience to navigate the many snags you'll hit along the way, seeing this game through does bear fruit. It's rare that I find myself unable to recommend a game with this much to offer, but large portions of this product border on unplayable. You'll be frustrated. 4.5/10			"

												Despite the new mod, you run the risk of a game-ending glitch. Devastating beyond belief. I'm furious. I lost SO many hours lost. For those who know the game, it happened toward the end of the Nar-Shaddaa mission. Playing as the wrong character (Atton), the mission skipped backward to an earlier point such that I can't progress without the game crashing. I'm hoping there'll be some kind of patch, though I don't know if I'll ever want to risk playing KOTOR II again. The same sort of game-ending glitch rendered KOTOR I unplayable as well after about 20-something hours of gameplay.			"

												NOTE: this review was written with the latest Restored Content Mod installed, with no other Mods to introduce new flaws into the system. KOTOR II is yet another one of those games where trying to evaluate the merits and flaws of its story and gameplay seems like a futile exercise; namely, the sort of game so ♥♥♥♥ing bug-riddled that you can't enjoy the story or the gameplay for any length of time before it crashes on you. If nothing else, it provides a variety of game-breaking bugs to match the variety of (enjoyable, so long as the game remains functional) characters- inability to accept mouse input, inexplicable minimized window, outright freezing after transitions between game areas, and many others I haven't yet had the privilege of personally experiencing (look up the forums if you're curious). The upshot being that you have an uncertain number of hours to actually play before something brings your enjoyment to a screeching halt. (Reviewer gazes off into middle distance, hazily remembers far-off past when game software performed as advertised right out of the box, returns to present feeling old and suspecting rose-tinted nostalgia at work.)So, yeah, Sith Lords would have been a Chris Avellone classic had it been released complete and reliable in the first place and/or been properly supported by the publisher when it was released at Steam. Blame the suits at LucasArts. I do.Addendum: apparently LucasArts no longer publishes, as of being absorbed by Disney in 2013			"

There are many known places where the game will crash, or where the main questline will get stuck. Moving through this game ends up frustrating, as I'm midway through the game and I've already been blocked by bugs 2-3 times, requiring reloading old saves and doing weird work-arounds to be able to continue.

												Playing Kotor2 felt less about playing through an epic space-opera with you as the protagonist, and more a case of counting down how long until the next bug crashes my game to desktop with no prior warning, explination or error message.At the time of writing I have 60 hours played on the game, and not once have I managed to finish the thing due game breaking-crashes, all of which happened at different times strangely.The Restored Content Mod for this is almost as well known as the game itself, but felt to not improve my experience at all: getting rid of some old points of crashing to desktop, but at the same time adding NEW points to crash to desktop.For the times when you're actually playing the game, it's a lot of fun: combat is better than Kotor1, but still feels a bit like a numbers game...if you don't know what kind of build is best for a character in the beginning, you're going to have some difficulty with the multiple sections where you are forced to play a character that isn't the protagonist.Kotor2 is a great game; if you can get the dam thing to work, which I could not. If you do decide to buy it; all the best in trying to get it functional.			"

												I played this game for a few hours, but had to give up because it was so boring.  You feel like a spectator, rather than a participant, when playing this game.  The combat system is just 'point and click on the enemy, wait until combat resolved'.  I found the conversation trees were much too long to follow, making me just click through them.  And the graphics in the cut scenes don't stand up too well - they seem not to have been updated from the original 2004 material.  So unfortunately I can't recommend this game.			"

												Don't get me wrong, this game is really fun and I had a blast (mostly) for the time I played it - until I got into a bug game breaking enough for me not to be able to continue the game. This wasn't even the first one, but for every one I managed to find a fix or patch that eventually solved my issue. This added unecessary and extremely boring work and wasted time to what should've been fun game time and when I finally got to a point where the option was starting over completely or not play any more, I threw in the towel.Here are the two biggest bugs I encountered, because all the smaller ones I can't remember:- Choosing the ""wrong"" dialogue option when talking to a certain character made it so that another character didn't spawn: Had to reload an old save and replay 30 min to choose the right option.- Event not initiating, but getting stuck mid cut-scene with the characters just staring at me. At this point I didn't know if restarting the game would even fix the issue and didn't want to risk several hours of gameplay into nothing again, so I stopped playing.This game should never have been released the way it is and asking for money for it is just wrong. I tried mods and just about anything people on the internets said would make the game better, but I shouldn't have to do that just to get the game to work! I was so disappointed because I really liked this game and I definitely wanted to be able to finish it. Maybe I was just very unlucky, but from my experiences I can not recommend this game the way it is.			"

												I'm 93 hours in to this game and I'm finding so many bugs. I know that they're bugs because I've looked up walkthroughs online and there just aren't conversation prompts or character appearances where there should be. Also swoop bike racing is a no go. Everytime I finish a race it registers that I didn't complete the course.I'm sure this was all working but in attempts to make this game compatible with modern PC's, a lot of bugs have been introduced and I don't want to finish the game.LOVED Kotor 1 though			"

												It has the same feel as the first game, but... the story... it's so BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD. Or maybe it would be better with the restored content mod, but I played through without it and I hate this game.Don't get me wrong it's fairly entertaining... until the last mission where it falls into the proverbial ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of shrooms. Whoever designed the last mission did not try to make it make sense, and I'm still confused. Once again maybe better with restored content, but at base...Pros:Same feel as the first gameYou still have the freedom to choose where to goA variety of ways to build your characterHk-47Cons:Inventory management is hecticStory makes little sense to meCharacter's were unlikeable and the devolpment I felt was lackingThe entierity of Kreia and her speechesThe ending doesn't make sense (I know I have said it before, but it's.... just.... horrible)A lot of the characters feel forcedIt takes a lot of work to get to know all the characters and in some cases multiple playthroughsThe storyI had hopes that this game would follow up on Dath Reven, but it didn't... well not really. It alluded towards it.The levels often times are confusing with little direction and everytime you are nice you get a lecture from Kreia.Backtracking, because of said confusion.the story (it bears mentioning again)Like the first on the combat is not very fun, but in my opinion what the first one lacked in combat it made up for in story. This one did not.It also takes a long♥♥♥♥♥time to get Hk-47All in all it has a very similar feel to the first one, but the story telling and the story are flawed. This game uses scenes of other characters that your character cannot see or hear to advance the story. That technique works to an extent, but after a certain point it gets repetative. Also the story is totally terrible. Rating: 5/10 (They have HK-47 the one brightspot of this awful game).Judging from others reviews I have an unpopular opinion, but I'm still confused, and I will not dedicate my time to play it with the restored content mod to allow this game to have a chance to redeem itself.

												*POTENTIAL SPOILERS*Not even the restored content mod could save this game.The first half was great, but the story and character progression fizzled toward the end into disappointing mush.I have to say, the best way to experience this game would be to play up until the point where you reconvene with the Jedi Masters on Dantooine, then uninstall and imagine a pleasant ending for yourself.Please play the first one if you haven't; that one suffered from last-half-being-worse-than-the-first-itis, but it was a lesser drop in quality and overall was a better game.

												I have to say I like the RPG idea. But I quit playing because it was just SO repetitive! I wanted to make it until I got a lightsabre, but I just can't waste my time doing the SAME THING over and over with a different background. There is just mind numbing repitition.First I am on a ship as a droid doing different tasks. (Not bad stuff there)Then I am on a space station as a person. Click , attack, click atrtack, click attack. Then I am on a planet. . . click attack, click attack, click attack. Then I am on another planet.. .  clic attack, click attack, click attack.Then I am on ANOTHER planet. . .click attack, click attack.Then I am in a cave on that planet. . . click attack, click attack.Then I am on ANOTHER planet. . .click attack, click attack.Then I am in a building on that planet. . . click attack, click attack.After wasting so much time I just decided it isn't worth ny time.Story is ok. But man, the action is so boring after a bit.I put it on easy to get the battles over faster just so I could get more of the story.Wanted to like it, but secretely hate it now.			"

												Don't even bother buying this. The game itself is good from what I hear but not once have I actually been able to play it. The game simply doesn't work. It crashes every single time once you create a character. I have spent countless hours trying the many different fixes online but not a single one has worked. A quick search shows that this problem happens to almost every single person. The game is actually incompatible with modern systems and Steam should be ashamed of themselves for still selling it when it doesn't work on a majority of devices.If you want to play it. Pirate it. The pirated versions actually work and have support while everyone who actually bought this game, gets completely shafted.			"

												Its just not that good.  The story is so random and unfinished I had no idea what wass going on most of the time without checking out the wiki (wookie) page.  Yeah its got way more customisation, but honestly it ends so abruptly without tying up any loose ends its like they had a deadline and just released a half finished game.  Yes, I know there's a mod to restore some more of the story but I didn't even bother since the story is so utterly boring in the first place.*Spoilers-Starts the same as the first.-Meet old lady that speaks like a sith, acts like a sith, fights like a sith, smells like a sith... but isn't cos thats a secret.-Go to space station and run for hours from end to end for hours, something to do with banking? or something?-Go to planet and meet the most boring ancestor of Darth Maul who has a really weird accent.-From here it gets weird... something happens with some blind Sith and some hiding Jedi and you protect a...farm?-A bad wookie... something to do with bounty hunters or something, and a club thats full of smelly gas.-You go to a planet and your party splits up for no reason, you fight gradually harder bosses all in a row and then the old lady who's not a sith tells you she's a sith and you're like whoooooaaaaa and it ends.Yeah, i just saved you so many hours...

The writing especially is a a complete and utter embarrassement in comparison. Oddly enough, the geekiest among the geeks seem to have a liking for it.

												Buggy and it shows. This game loses whatever immersion it had by being a general mess with its graphical issues and the the gameplay. Cutscenes will end due to the characters speaking at lightspeed missing whatever discussion there was. Frame rate drops immensely or it gone entirely on minigames. Game will crash without a moment's notice, and with this game's almost non-existant autosave system you will be rage quitting more than you should have to. The difficulty curve is raised sharpely with just the removal of your party members and the exponential rise in the number of enemies you have to deal with. Voice acting I will say is impeccable and the characters are interesting but you will only be interested in your circle of best characters. I was told it the game is fixable through all manner of game modification but it did not help. I suppose for just 10 dollars it was alright. But it was headache inducing so I cannot recommend for health's sake.			"

												I have to say, this is one of the WORST movies I have ever seen.If you like Star Trek, this spin off will make you make you mad.I'll start by saying the character development is horrible.  It feels as if I was watching someone play World of War craft.  It is slow, dull, and nothing happens.  The characters are bland and forgetable, the enviroment has tons of errors relating to the old Star Trek series.  Also, this show is really bad as the Vulcans show emotion.  This is a stain to the legacy that Gene Roddenberry created.Don't bother with this hellish thing.  It is not worth your time, rather go and play Star Trek:  Battlefront II.  That game has a better storyline, better character development then this movie.'EDIT:I know it says I have only watched a bit of it, but I have seen it all on a different account			"

												I am a big fan of this series but was very dissappointed by this download, the game was very glitchy and ultimately after about a few hours, unplayable. The cut scenes did not work which ruined the story arc and finally the game glitched out to the point where you could no longer progress and I gave up. The Steam fix download function did not work and ultimately the money i spent here was wasted. I wouldnt recommend downloading this version.			"

Also i had to kill one of the best characters from the first game. :/EDIT: Friend told me to continue playing - at 10h mark now, not really better, shame			"

												Unfortunately, I made the mistake of playing the Mass Effect trilogy before getting to KOTOR 2, making its flaws and shortcomings twice as noticeable.The Bad: The main problem I have with the game is its difficulty. It's all over the place. It goes from being too easy to borderline impossible in a heartbeat, not surprising coming from Obsidian (Pillars of Eternity). The game forces you to play as different characters and takes control away from the player constantly, which completely screws up its pacing. Structurally, most missions are completely unninspired, having you go from point A to point B, clear out a few rooms and that's pretty much it. Same goes for the ""puzzles"" in the game, which are incredibly shallow and predictible.The Good: The characters are well written and the dialogue options are interesting and varied. The writing overall is superb. I didn't get to the end of the game, but the plot was intriguing and quite frankly was the only thing that kept me going. Also, the game recently received a MASSIVE patch, adding 4K, Windows 10 and Controller support, which is always a plus in my book.All in all, there are better RPG's out there. I'd personally Recommend the Mass Effect Trilogy, Dragon Age Origins and Dragon Age Inquisition.			"

												PLEASE READ: STEAM VERSION DOES NOT WORKI love this game 100/100 one of my favorites and would more than recommend it, it is just really buggy and a huge pain in the you know what. The fact that they would make us pay for it and thengo through the trouble of modding it and installing junk is beyond me..  ive been tweaking and looking up forums for the past 2 weeks and all ive been able to play is 5 mins before it crashes.. which is an improvement from not starting at all. I have a new comp which is capable of running games exceptionally well so that's not the issue. try it out but be ready to go somewhere else to purchase the game. other than that steam has worked great for every other gamejust this one unfortunately is bugged			"

												Abandoned it halfway once, tried again, abandoned it again.It implements a lot of complexity into the relationships between the (interesting) characters, plus a ""remember/define your forgotten past"" dynamic for the main character. Add to that the ""neither light nor dark"" teachings of Kreia, and it all sounds very interesting and clever, but it just didn't work. Most of the time, I was between indifferent and annoyed.It is definitely more compley than KOTOR I, but that in itself doesn't make it any better.			"

												When Mrs. Tawny Huxton opened her son Timmy's bedroom door, she was shocked to see his innocent white hiney nestled into the new 7ft Jar Jar Binks doll she had bought him for his birthday. Lately, many Americans have suffered similar incidents. Young children are being seduced by the character of George Lucas' latest Star Wars Movie. Jar Jar's soothing voice, and timid childlike manners, seem to lure young teens into a world of lustful abandon. Unsuspecting parents purchase the popular life-size doll, only to find out later that it is being used by the child as a masturbation toy.Under the guise of family entertainment, Lucas' ""Star Wars"" prequel has contaminated America's youth with subliminal sexual innuendo. Pastor Deacon Fred of the Landover Baptist Church commented, ""The demonic characteristics of the Jar Jar binks creature become obvious when one pays close attention. His forked tongue, his lapping, his malignant features, are all too noticeable to the Christ centered man."" Experts who have examined the life-sized doll that has become the favorite 'toy' of 12-14 year old children, say that the evidence is overwhelming. The doll was created for the sole purpose of masturbation. It has four openings, and three extrusions, making it compatible for male or female pleasure.Members of The Landover Baptist Church are outraged at the Satanic subtlety in which marketing geniuses have moved this horrific abomination into the homes of America's youth. ""One Mother was concerned that her young daughter was not interested in boys,"" a Pastor noted, ""she asked her little girl, 'why don't you talk about the cute boys at school?' Her daughter replied, 'oh momma, nobody I know is cuter than Jar Jar Binks.' The mother was horrified.""Landover Baptist Church finds that the only way to resolve this problem is to ban not only life sized Jar Jar Binks dolls from American homes, but to ban any life sized doll. ""Any child that has seen this movie is finding that their natural attraction to members of the opposite sex is being replaced with an attraction to a 7ft devil with elephant feet, a 25 inch tongue, polka dot skin, a fish snout, and two phallic eyes that jut out like hard erotic pokers. For the Love of God! If you've got this devil in your house, remove it as soon as possible!			"

												I absolutely loved this game when I was younger.I literally just bought it off steam and was so excited to play. I downloaded the content mod and everything hoping it would work completely fine. Well I was wrong. It is super buggy. First, I open up the game and I couldn't operate the menu and looked on google to find a way to fix that and there really wasn't much to say.Second, when I finally do get into the game, there is a sound bug where there is this 1 little annoying sound that plays over and over. (Like have you ever played a game where everything just freezes and it has that annoying sound that won't stop unless you forcefully turn off your system? Well it's like that.)Third, well the same thing is happening when I first opened it. I cannot interact with the menu at all. I can't even play the game. I mean come on, you'd think you would have a better time playing on a PC than a system, but again, I guess I was waaaaay wrong.			"

												I do not recommend this game to anyone for me it was a complete waste of money, played the first one and absolutely loved it, easily one of my favourite rpgs of all time. I started up kotor 2 and had fun with but ran into not 1 but 2 game ruining glitches, one being I am not able to load any of my save files after about 6 hours of playing. I start a new game and get about another 10 hours in before I reach another glitch where I cannot proceed in the story on Nar Shaddaa. I refuse to restart this game a 3rd time, this makes me sad and angry because up until these points I was having fun playing this game, maybe a day will come when my anger has subsided, but it is not this day, this day i find a working game that is just as or more fun. Good day KOTOR and go F?ck yourself			"

												This review is about the vanilla version of the game (without mods). I was a huge fan of the first game and I also like other Obsidian games, but I was rather disappointed by this one. The first few hours of the game are pretty repetitive as you lose your ship two times and have to recover it. After that the game opens up - you can choose what to do next and your goal becomes clearer. Some of the planets you will get to see are quite interesting (Dxun, Dantooine, Korriban) others I found rather boring (Nar Shadaa, Onderon). The lowlight for me were the arena and the maze on Nar Shadaa where you hunt down Visquis. The  characters which will join you are interesting for the most part, especially HK-47 who you can reactivate by the end of the game. A wasted potential  are the two main antagonists Darth Sion and Darth Nihilus. Their design is really interesting, but you do not learn much about their motivations and also the battles against them are not really a highlight. All in all the game is not a complete waste of time, but it could have been so much more. The potential was there, but in the end the good ideas combine only to an ok game experience. A final word regarding bugs and glitches: I had no problems playing the game on my rig (Windows 7, Intel Core i7 870, Nvidia GTX460).			"

												I'm very disappointed. Absolutely loved this game on the Xbox. However it seems to have some serious compatibility issues on PC. Played for about an hour and saved. Tried to load my save and the game crashed. Tried to load a new game and the game crashed. Looked online for hours to fix it. Tried several diffrent things and nothing worked. I give up. Pretty bummed.Edit: I rolled back to my old video card drivers and it seems to be working. Still a few bugs but it's playable.			"

												Okay... I own a ton of steam games and I never review them.  That being said, I decided to break my motis operandi and write a quick review of this game.  I played it years ago before the mods and also before the most recent patch.  I suffered through all the game crashes and the terrible ending but still enjoyed the game but not at much as KOTOR 1.Well, I just tried to play through again and guess what?  I must be getting old because I pretty much threw in the towel due to all the crashes when flying to different planets, the audio skips and other various bugs I encountered. I must not have the fortitude I once had to put up with forced to publish games that I once had.. which says a lot given that I've been gaming since the DOS era and still wake up screaming at night due to nightmares of hardware driver conflicts from back then.Anyway, if you can fight through constantly reloading or pulling up task manager to kill the game when it locks, you may enjoy the game.  I, on the otherhand, have better things to do such as checking out new games I snagged on sale or... er... well other stuff.In the end, I can recommend this game because its still a bit of a buggy mess and life is better spent playing less buggy messes.  Just my opinion			"

												Honestly?  The game is really dated.However, this review is going to be chocked full of opinions, but I'm going to keep it simple too.Do you dislike RPGs that force you to either be good or evil?  Then this isn't the game for you.It has a lot of empty space and the side quests lack a lot of depth.  There is no exploration, this game is purely linear.  Plainly put, its boring and slow.  No skill required.  If I wanted this, I'd just play a TRPG.  Dated and bad.Might I mension the dialogue is atrocious for a AAA title.All in all, these games don't even hold a candle to the Mass Effect games, but if you like Star Wars and old, dated games that require absolutely no skill, have a LOT of time on your hands, etc, then you'll probably enjoy this.At the end of the day though, this game is dated and just has too many quirks that I can't live with.  However, if you resonate with my feelings here, I do not recommend you play this game.			"

												It starts out great; the game seems like a flawless port... until you get to ""Certain areas"" where specific dialogie will literally cause a distortion in the game, it can cause the whole story progression to hault and lock you in an area. Dialogue can, at times, just blink past and you'll miss a portion of the story or facts you need to know to help you. Making whole sections of the story just blur past and you can only read when you have to give a response. other bugs are humorous, but its gotten to the point where I cannot bring myself to finish this game. I don't mind a few glitches,since it is a really old port, but these bugs are game breaking... so i recommend not getting this, unless you dont mind a plethora of bugs.			"

												As a die-hard fan of the first KOTOR, having pumped countless hours into it across two platforms, it  saddens me that my hopes that the Restored Content Mod would've given me a better experience replaying the sequel after so many years, originally. To be frank, I pretty much got this game for that sole reason: I hoped that this patch would somewhat remedy the problems I had when playing this way back in '05 on the Xbox. I didn't like it then because of its apparent rushed nature; it was glitchy, some storylines didn't follow through, lots of unanswered questions/quests, and plenty of other elements missing. While many kudos go to the guys who worked on the RCM, making it the tape to the pile of shredded documents that the original release was, despite their efforts that went into the mod, the major flaw is still apparent: it just isn't a worthy sequel and decent, bordering mediocre, as a stand alone.It's hard not to hold this to the first game; you honestly can't do it. It has a lot of elements in the first game, both story and gameplay-wise, incorporated into it. The problem was that both elements just weren't up to par and as well polished as its predecessor. I completely understand it was trying to build on top of what the previous had done, but in doing so, the mechanics and, again, narrative buckle under its weight.Example, you have two star villians: one feeds on death of stars and worlds, and another is held together by sheer will of the Force. In terms to the story, these two are immensily powerful; one can't die and the other can kill everything by himself. In terms of the game, your character can be overpowered to the point where you can kill either them with the greatest of ease. For me, I always play as a Force-user in these games over lightsaber combat (supposedly, making the game harder). By the end, I was the accumulative level of 29 when I killed Darth Sion with nothing but Force Wave and a handful of life support packs. With Darth Nihilus, I buffed myself so I was immune to his Force powers and my team and I just beat him death. To top that all off, all that meant nothing when you get to the end and you fight the final Sith Lord, easily the toughest boss fight in-game, but she was the one who was easily punched to near death in a cutscene in the beginning. Ludonarrative dissonance, if I ever heard it.In the end, I can't recommend this game to anyone who was a fan of the first. It's just so flawed on so many dissapointing levels, that there is nothing but heart-ache to be had. If you were curious, like I was back in 2005 to see how this game was to the first and on it's own, then you'll probably check this out on that sentiment alone. However, level-design, gameplay, narrative; all is flawed. Much respect to those who worked on the RCM, but you can only polish a turd so much when you realize, that in the end, it's still a turd.

Posted: July 15, 2016
												This is almost a good game.  When I first played this game, back when it first came out, it was plagued with bugs and it was very easy to say this game wasn't worth playing.  There are a lot of fan made fixes these days, even a lot of restored content and so my decision to not recommend this game is much harder.What makes me hesitate is the story, there are great characters in this, great back stories, but sadly there are aspects of the  story that fail badly and they are partly to blame for me not recommending this.  This is a long epic game, you'll get a lot of game time out of this, but the endings are . . . well, the pay off just insn't there IMO.  KotoR had a great pay off with an epic fight with a villain you'd grown to hate, KotoR 2 has multiple bosses, including one that nears Darth Malak, but they pay off just isn't there.  I didn't feel any satisfaction from defeating this foe.  If anything I felt annoyed at my lack of choices.Another terrible aspect of the game is that it forces you to play NPC characters.  The first hour of the game, which I'm including the tutorial, you'll be playing as a T3 droid more than your own character.  I made a character that's supposed to represent me.  That's who I should play.  That's who I want to play. Sadly, not only are you repeatedly forced to play NPCs, made to include them in your group for certain sections (something KotoR did, but I liked all of those NPCs so it never seemed a pain), and that leads to another flaw in the game: the narrative isn't being told from your character's perspective.  Because you're playing as NPCs, getting cut scenes with NPCs talking amongst themselves, you've given this disjointed narrative that makes the story far far less immersive.   I'll give an example:Fairly early in the story there's a light side quest that has you breaking into the mainframe of an evil cooperation, and there's an option to use a protocol droid to do it.  Naturally the game makes you play as the protocol droid.  However this mission intersects with a side mission where you're hunting bounties on two escaped criminals, and somehow this droid, who's only been in your group for this mission, who wasn't party to any of the bounty hunter mission, instantly recognises the two criminals and you're forced to choose between two dialogue options where you recognise the two and demand that they stop.  Both flee instantly.  Then you go on with the rest of your mission.  How does the droid know they were wanted criminals?  How do you learn they escaped to the planet surface?  None of these questions have an in game answer and so you're forced to think about it out of the game which is not good for the whole immersion thing.However, those problems have nothing on the biggest most terrible flaw in the game: the influence system.  Let me just say that if this system had worked it would have been amazing, the ability to make good characters bad, make evil characters good, it would be a player's dream, but ultimately the way it works is that your player is the one who has to change to gain influence with the NPCs.  You have to act how the NPC wants, choose dialogue that they like so that you can gain influence with them.  It's a backwards system.  It's more like they're influencing you to appease them.  You want to play a good character?  Well there are NPCs that you simply can't bring with you.  Want to be evil?  Well don't bring any good NPCs on missions with you or you're going to lose influence.One last point on NPCs: I really liked most, we had some return from the first game, the two droids, and one other who I won't spoil, but most of the new ones were pretty fun.  Bao-Dur, on the other hand, is one of the most horribly voiced NPCs I've ever had forced on me in any RPG game I've ever played.  You end up with this grating monotone NPC fairly early and even though I was a light side character I instantly wanted to force choke him to death.  Sadly we're forced to play this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ a number of times throughout the game.  Another problem with the NPCs is that two of the NPCs join based on the gender of the PC you pick, if you're male you get the awesome Handmaiden of Atris, a kick♥♥♥♥♥character who has tons of fan art and pages of information on, if you're female you get some dude called ""the Disciple"" . . . a character so bland that even wookipedia could barely write three pages on.  Darth Vader's glove, a Mandalorian Crushgaunt has more information on it.  Speaking of wookipedia, the gender, name, and appearance of the PC was added (because wookipedia needs pages and pages of pointless information) and the exile, your character, is supposed to be female.  Which means the Handmaiden should accompany you, but the game has very ridged romance story lines written into the game and same sex romances were strictly forbidden.And one final note: there are a ton of powers added to the game.  The original KotOR had a lot of power selection, but this game has tons more!  The only problem though is that at the higher levels I found a power I liked, force push, and found that it was more than effective for nearly every encounter afterwards.  Having a lot of choice isn't that useful when you only need one answer.KotOR is my favorite Star Wars game ever.  This game is likely being unfairly compared to that classic, and admittedly if this were a standalone game I might even have given it a reluctant recommendation but the fact that it bares the KotOR name forces me to not recommend this game, the first one was so much better, and two is too much of a mess for me to recommend.  However, I will say that it's far from the worst Star Wars game I've ever played and if you're a rabid fan you really can't go wrong at the price the game is currently selling at.  Even bad games might be worth playing at that price, and, it's worth noting that there is a moding community and there have been changes and restored content add via fan made mods.  The choice added back into the game from these mods would allow me to recommend the game if they were part of the initial release so with that in mind, and if you don't have any fears of modifying your game, it's worth picking up if you like RPGs or Star Wars.  I can't justify giving a thumbs up to a game that I needed to modify to enjoy however, so while I can't recommend the game as is, there is a relatively decent game once modified to something playable.

												While KOTOR II is a good game at heart, its horrendously buggy first 2 acts are just unforgivable for me. At some point in act 2 I was too proactive with exploration and ended up bugging my save file so that I couldn't progress any further. I'm a big Star Wars fan and it hurt me to see that this game was so bugged out (don't even get me started on the broken textures).However you can still have fun in the game, just keep hoping that your saves don't get bugged and with a little luck you'll be able to enjoy the game for what it is.

												#BROKENWILL NOT RUNforum suggestions/ guides do not work either.Lucas Arts no longer exists. Walt Disney shut them down, so this game WILL NEVER receive a real Patch.THIS TITLE SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM STEAM/Let me explain what happens when Valve removes a title from Steam, if you don't already know what this means: If you own a title that is removed from Steam, you will not lose the game, and can still download and install whenever you choose, however; it would be removed from the store, eliminating future sales.System specs:I7 4790k @ 4.4GHz8Gb ddr3 1886R9 270xz97 chipset moboSamsung 850 pro SSD boot4TB storage (1TB, 3TB WD Black)Windows 7 Professional 64 Bit24"" 144Hz 1080p LG gaming monitorThe game loads fine to main menu, however when I launch from character building, the game freezes and crashes to desktop.I attempted to remedy this by applying the following:I have manually edited the ini cfg file to run windowed @ 1024x768. (It was suggested that running the game @ 1920x1080p breaks the game if full screen. Still broken after switching to windowed 768p)I have reduced all settings to minimal. (the game is old enough that it looks like crap with the settings maxed out...)I have run the program in Compatibility mode: disabled desktop composition and disabled visual themes in  XP SP2, 2000, even tried 98.It is suggested in a guide and a few people point to a 3rd party site hosting a modded .exe I will NOT download a modded .exe from a 3rd party site, I would like to keep my item inventory thank you.Maybe this title will run on potatos, but not a gaming PC.I played the original KOTOR a long time ago, in a galaxy far far away, and it was great.I am a SW fan, but not a fan of broken software.Uninstalled.

												For Those of you thinking of buying this game because of the new update. DONT! The new update has made the game completely unplayable and until they patch it to make it work again it is just a waste of money! Make sure they patch it first before you buy it, Cause if we end up having to wait another 10 years (unlikely) for them to patch it, even the 7-10 dollars (depending on your currency) isnt worth it. Before the patch the game was good and only required some minor tweaking for newer systems. Now it is unplayable. Please patch the Game Dev's!Edit: So recently they released another official patch that fixed some of the original issues. Sadly they seem to have only been partially successful with some of the more game breaking ones. roughly half the time I start the game, after the initial developer credit cuts, the game will alt tab itself to the task bar and refuse to reload. forcing you to terminate the program through task manager. I dread Cut scenes of any type since probably 2/3 of the time after a cut scene my mouse no longer works in the game and I once again have to terminate the program through Task Manager. You have to save very often in this game not because of difficulty, but because of how broken it still is.			"

												This is an honest review not tainted by nostalgia. This is an example of one of those games that are fun IF you can get them to run (Vampires the Masquerade: Bloodlines and Far Cry fall into this category). In order to even get the game to run on Vista/7/8, you have to install the Restored Content Mod. After that it's a trial and error for hours to get the game to work. I still can't play this in any resolution beyond 800x600 without the game crashing and me ending up having to restore the .ini file. If you don't patch it, it's a giant buggy mess that was rushed. Even the ending hardly makes sense AFTER the content mod. As far as combat goes, don't expect and action/adventure game. This runs off the same Star War d20 system that KOTOR used. It's boring pseudo turn-based where half of your hits won't connect and you'll reload out of frustration time and time again. It's false difficulty by a company who couldn't program combat correctly. The characters are copy paste from KOTOR 1, there's little to no difference in the story, and most of the dialog is infantile ""WHITE KNIGHT SAVES UNIVERSE"" or ""OMG I'M DARK SIDE EVIL MANIACAL LAUGHTER"". I still find it enjoyable, but your mileage will vary greatly. That's why I'm not recommending it.			"

												I would love to recommend it, but the game is broken, even with the Restoration Project mod installed. I don't know what it is the game doesn't work with, but there's plenty of people who struggle with crashes and freezes, during zoning, conversations or just regular gameplay. And though many have found solutions, these solutions don't work for everyone. The game is unplayable for me, as it crashes every two minutes (not exaggerated). So buy this otherwise amazing game at your own risk. Or get an older PC that will run the game without compatibility issues.			"

												This game is bizzare and very awful. It has a painfully slow buildup with absolutely no reward. It leaves tons of qustions and massive plot holes unaswered. Yet, it has an air about it like the developers were trying REALLY hard, perhaps TOO hard, to make an intellectual story. However, they failed. Really, the story is incoherent garbage. The characters speak in vague riddles, conflicting terminolgies, and subtle nuances. For example, one character is a ""wound in the force"" while the other is ""absent of the force."" Pretty confusing, huh? The biggest problem is the lack of climax. There is no epic conclusion, no final confrontation, no sense of urgency. Instead of a powerful, main villian that the game keeps on building up, we get some anti-climatic, easy fights. I suppose it builds up pretty well in the begining, but during the middle and end the story and villians plateau and just sort of fizzle out, losing all sense of importance and urgency. The developers tried to go with a more subtle, mysterious type of narrative but it just doesn't work for an RPG.It even fails on gameplay. This game is the easiest game I have ever played. It was a cake-walk on the hardest difficulty. The supposedly god-like bosses can be killed with a few lightsaber hits. Seriously, by the end of the game your character will be completely unstopable. I've even tried to make it harder for myself by using poor equiptment and tactics, and even then it is still a joke. This lack of challenge left me so bored that I wanted to stop playing. For example, there is a boss, Darth Nihlus, who we are told is a super-badass who can drain entire planets of all life just with his presence. Yet, you can walk to up to him and kill him in 10 seconds. At least it runs smoothly, right? No. Everything glitches, requiring you to fiddle with settings, reload, or close and exit the game repeatedly. Characters sometimes run off and do random things that you didn't tell them to do (even if you're controling them.) And apparently the company that made the game, Obsidian, was forced to rush the game out before it was completed (an excuse that has become cliche for Obsidian.) That means that you need fan-created mods to get the full content.So basically, KOTOR 2 fails in every aspect a game can fail: gameplay, story, non-glitchyness, and satisfying ending. If you loved KOTOR 1, just replay it because you'll hate KOTOR 2. This game won't live up to the orginal. Not even by a longshot. In fact, it's easily one of the 5 worst games I've ever played.			"

												Best RPG ever? Not even f**king close! Best Star wars game ever? Equally far off! Broken Game? Most CertainlyAbout two weeks ago I decided to purchase both KOTOR 1 and 2 as everyone who had heard or played either game had told me they were absolutely excellent. So I bought them, played through the first game with great difficulty as there were multiple game breaking bugs/glitches, not to mention playing it on Windows 7 is nearly impossible. To add to that, the story of it was complete garbage. I thought ""You know what? Maybe they fixed it with the sequal"". AND GUESS WHAT! It's even worse than the first game! I dont even know how thats possible! You start the game off, and instantly recognize the situation your character is in...because its just slightly different than the first game. Mysterious companion to start who happens to be force sensitive, you somehow are force sensitive too and dont know it, your objective is to stop a sith lord from taking over the galaxy by going to planets 1, 2 and 3 to collect item/person A, B and C. Both games follow the exact same god damn formula and it just doesnt work. This game is just a disgrace to all RPG fans and Star Wars fans.You'd expect from studios like Bioware and Obsidian would have been better at producing games back in the day, as their RPG's now are critically acclaimed. But I guess all things start with harsh beginnings. You would also think if you pumped out a massive pile of dog♥♥♥♥♥♥and slipped in it youd learn how to not do it again. However, this is not so, they've slipped and fallen in the dog♥♥♥♥♥♥once again.Recommend this game? Absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing not, never, everSeriously if you want a good RPG go play Bioware's Mass Effect and be amazed			"

Where that game neatly captured the spirit of Star Wars and presented rollicking fun action and a fight between good and evil, this one suddenly takes a left turn into being Serious and Weighty and Shades of Grey.  Except that's not what Star Wars is good at.  Just go play the first game again, trust me.  The only thing better here is the implementation of Pazaak.			"

												Knights of The Old Republic 2 is an excellent RPG and a worthy succesor to original Knights of the Old Republic any RPG fan should buy this excellent if somewhat unfinished game. Which is what I would say if I could even play the game, immediatley after buying the game and starting it up it crashed on me. Not a great start to my playthrough, but once I searched the web for a fix I got it started. Then it crashed a SECOND time, which required me to search the web for a fix which I again luckily found. THen later it crashed a THIRD time on a extremely plot critical moment not allowing me to continue forward, is it possible that there is a fix for that last glitch that I don't know about? Possibly, but the sad truth is that this game is frankly very old and such will not work on most if not all modern computers. If you're willing to risk wasting your money on a unplayable game then sure go ahead and try, but I would not reccomend that you risk it. To summarise it would be a great game worthy of anyone's purchase if it wasn't practically unplayable.			"

												So I played through the first one about a week ago, then bought it on the May 4th sale.. Wasted 3 dollars. I'd like to make a comparison to how buggy this game is.. It is worse than Dragonborn for Skyrim. Let me elaborate.     The story, first of all, is pathetic compared to the first one. The first game is probably my favorite star wars game of ALL TIME, because of its great playing style and story. This one plays exactly the same, and I like that actually. Usually in game sequels you can get frustrated with how they compare to the first game (if the first game was good enough), because they don't play the same. However, with how well the first game plays, it is nice to see it get expanded on in this one. So, it has that going for it. But getting back to the story... It is interesting at first, but as you go on, it loses you. The planets are bland as all hell for starters. Dantooine in the first one was pretty boring, but in this one, it was probably my favorite planet. You get to do some cool stuff on it, I had fun. Right about as I was leaving I started losing interest. The story just gets so bland. Korriban is just crap, I'll leave it at that. Dxun is actually fun, so there's some enjoyment there. Onderon drags on for the pretty short amount of time you're there, and Nar Shaddaa... Where shall I begin? This is usually an interesting planet in other Star Wars games (Force Unleashed, SWTOR, etc.), but it's a cluster♥♥♥♥ in this game. Talk about Onderon dragging on? Holy crap, I needed this planet to END, but it just kept going, and going, and GOING. It constantly has you switching to different companions after a certain point, which is awful, because you get used to playing as your created character, who, if you leveled them like me and such, kicks complete♥♥♥♥♥ But the companions are awful.      Since I was talking about Nar Shaddaa, let's continue on about the bugs I was talking about in the intro of this. You are supposed to escape it after a certain point, but my game glitched out. It went to the cutscene of the ship taking off and leaving, only to put me back on the planet and be stuck there after it ended. I could literally do nothing to fix it. I tried, and nothing happened. So I didn't even get to finish the game because of this game-breaking glitch. I even had the Restoration Mod installed, which is supposed to fix a lot of the bugs and glitches, but it failed at a huge one.PROS:Your created character kicks♥♥♥♥♥more than in the first gameSame great gameplay type as the first oneJedi Robes/Armor Gets an upgrade from the first oneUpgrading items/craftingCONS:Most companions are awful. (Handmaiden, T3, and Bao are exceptions)Companions are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥sBland PlanetsBland StoryBugs and Glitches out the wazooEverything drags onIn the end, I'd say the game had potential, but since its development was rushed, I'm gonna go ahead and call Star Wars KOTOR 2: The Sith Lords...A Dogshit gaming experience.

												Can I just vote ""Mixed""? Well, this game is good and bad. It's more nostalgia for the KOTOR than any of the game's own merits that made me play it. Ending definitely felt rushed, as if the budget ran out. Too many unresolved threads, too much introduction of new and inconsistent lore and powers. It just got hard to care about the characters after a while, and the gameplay was painful too.I know some people think this is an improvement over KOTOR I, but I think the slightly higher graphical production value is the only positive difference.

												Heyy it actually works now.Too bad the combat system is the same strange turn-based, real-time hybrid as Dragon Age: Origins. Which means klicking on an enemy and then waiting while your character flails around with his/her sword or blaster missing by a country mile. No hit impact whatsoever and boring as sin.AI behaviour has been improved but companions are still dumb as bricks. You basically have to micro manage everything and they tend to do whatever they want anyways. Including running headlong into mines.Item management is.. clunky to say the least. More micro management and not very intuitive.The story is... alright, I guess? The game doesnt't explain a lot of the background and your character is going ""yep that was how that happened"" a lot. Choices are a bit weird, on par with old bioware titles. Usually you can choose between ""reasonable being"" and ""psychopath"".I know people love this game but....Overall still a big ""meh"" for me.			"

												I wasn't able to enjoy this game as much i was hoping to. I know a lot of people consider this to be one of the best RPG's ever made but for me it was far from it. The major problem with it it's the pace. Damn! The way the story progresses is so slow and you're just going from way to another doing meaningless quests. You talk to a NPC and for some reason it seems that he tells you the whole story of the Star Wars universe: ""So you want me to help you? Let me tell you a story that happened 300 years ago about a character that has nothing to do with this game and you're gonna sit there and take it because this is a Star Wars Encyclopedia.""Even with this problem the game presents you some great characters with fascinating backgrounds (Visas Marr, Kreia, Handmaiden, Nihilus), but they weren't able to keep me interested to see the end. If only Obsidian could invest less in dialogues and put more effort in good level design which is something that their games seem to lack.""Do. Or do not. There is no try."" But i tried Yoda...i tried...			"

												The sequel to the classic Knights of the Old Republic, this crude, notoriously rushed title fails to measure up to its predecessor. The development of this game was passed on from Bioware to Obsidian, king of inferior sequels, and it shows in the finished product. Obsidian added virtually nothing in terms of gameplay, instead opting to focus purely on a new story. The result is a trite experience that necessitates suffering through the same rather dull combat system found in the original. While the excellent plot of that game justified dealing with its combat mechanics, you might find it shockingly tedious to play through another game under exactly the same circumstances. More, the quality of KOTOR II's plot pales in comparison to that of the original.Buy this game if you're starved for Star Wars RPG gameplay; but don't expect it to live up to the standard set by its predecessor.

												Buying this game and expecting it to be like the first one was a huge mistake. I opened it up for the first time to be bored within the first 30 minutes. A few months later I then fought past it and played it for longer than I'd thought. To me, it feels like  the developers didn't care, the storyline was annoying as it felt like there was too much crap going on, the graphics and items were exactly the same and I just got to the point where I didn't want to play it anymore due to the fact that it had the same structure as the first Knights of the Old Republic. Your character is stuck on a planet, once done you go to other planets to get an item to help you in your quest, then you'll find out a twist to the storyline once that's completed. A lot of people tell me how great of a game it was but I just can't agree. I do however, love choosing to be good or evil, which in most cases I choose evil to see how the scenario plays out. It's an alright game, but I was just disappointed and was expecting more. 4/10			"

												If you like Kotor, there's an outside chance you'll like Kotor 2 even though it does literally everything wrong (what do you expect from Obsidian).The story is pretty awful, ill-explained, and boring. ALL the jedi? ALL the jedi died in the civil war? Come on. That's not what winning a war means. England got bombed into a Fallout setting during WWII and not EVERY SINGLE BRITISH PERSON died. But enough of its incredibly stupid premise, it also has a host of uninteresting characters with little to no development (including Darth Nihilus, whom you see exactly once before fighting) as well as issues out the♥♥♥♥♥ Nar Shadaa is pretty fun since the bounty hunters stayed permanently frozen in the city even after I had killed or recruited them. It was also funny to have them tell me a mask doesn't stop the bar's poison gas and then I wore a mask and stopped the poison gas. I need this force power to combat the deadly poison? No, nevermind, I guess I don't.Want to play an annoying, pointless, poorly written female bounty hunter in a host of boring fights instead of your character? Want to do it again at the end of the game for no reason?There's also the incredibly poorly designed dungeons, which have virtually no mechanics and are just an endless sea of bad guys in room after room. I know this was an early game, but Game Design was a thing - you still have to make an EFFORT at designing fun dungeons, Obsidian.I won't ruin the surprise, nonsense ending, but it wasn't worth the pain of the play-through either.The up side is they literally just took the first game and modded it, so it should feel comfortable at least. I mean, they reused all the same character models. I saw MY character from the first game as several generic NPCs (and here I thought I'd saved the galaxy...)I liked the first one enough to beat the second one, but that's like saying ""the pizza was free so I had some"". I'm not saying it was good pizza, it just happened to be there and I'm a glutton.			"

												Knights of the Old Republic has not aged well at all.  The environments are left empty and feel ""small.""  The menus are unintuitive and really show their age.  PC port-over seems fairly lazy and the game would be better played on a controller.  The dialogue detracts from any progress made from a good story so you're left annoyingly trotting around an unfamiliar world with little to detract from how old the game is.  Even for a die-hard Star Wars fan, it was hard to trudge through.The second installment did next to nothing to change the game.  A different story seems to be all it can boast.			"

												I honestly hate this game. I payed 4 bucks for this game and played it to the end and it was a complete waste of my time. The restored content mod does not help, there is a very good reason that contnent was taken out- IT WASN'T FINISHED. The restored content gameplay wise is complete garbage. Along with the ending and conclusions and bugs and rushed character interactions. This game straight up sucks. This is probably my least favorite game that I've played to completion. Some gameplay sections were so poorly thought out and to the point of almost being broken that they had to make the whole game ridicoulsly easy. The first level is BY FAR the most challenging.The end game bosses are defeated in a few turns. Stupid bugs exsist to this day. Let us all rejoice that lucasart no longer exsists. Would this game have been good if they finished the story? Probably but as the game is, it is the most unsatisfying game I've ever played.			"

Now that it has workshop support and plenty of other nice mods, it is even better.In comparison with KOTOR I, this one has some small but meaningful improvements to the mechanics. The story isn't as innovative but still really good. A solid game that holds its own really well many years later.			"

												Time has not been kind to this title. It sits in that awkward space of being too advanced to properly nestle in that retro space, but not advanced enough to cater to any level of modern standard. Mostly it has to do with control and interface. Just moving around is too awkard a task to make me want to fully revisit this title I had fond memories of. Were there an HD remake with a more modern control and conversation, I would jump on top of it in a moment. But this stands as proof of the idea that you can never go back again.			"

												While this game can be fixed rather easily, it doesn't excuse the extremely poor version of this game on steam. The fact you need to edit game files just to get your game working is unacceptable. Buy at your own riskBut the game it's self is one of the best rpg games I have ever played (note that I am using the cut content restoration mod). You can truly role play in this game. On my current playthrough, I'm playing as a sith that persuades people and decieves people to get his way, relying on combat only when required. The amount of dialog options is amazing, better then fallout 4 lol. The combat system is fine, I don't have any problems with it, it is a bit confusing at times though. There are many options for character building. This game is damn near flawless. Absolutely recommended!			"

												Superior in many ways to the Xbox version I fell in love with. New to PC gaming but this game got me into it. KOTOR2's infamous crashes are present with TSLRCM but the tradeoffs are worth it. Less present on medium settings anyway. Tip: if amyone is thinking of trying this game out, be sure to use both TSLRCM and enable cheats. Makes getting the good weapons quick and easy w/overpowered characters with the mod just making the whole game feel complete			"

												A must play for any star wars gamer. With so many differnent missions and paths you can take, you can play the game over and play it as a completely new and different game each time. The plot is great and the story could be a movie in and of itself.For some reason, the cutscenes do not work for me on the steam version. Another con is that most armors do not allow force powers, which is frustrating.			"

												The story line for these has so much substance. It's hard to find a game that has such a great storyline. The fact that it is Star Wars just brings out the raging nerd in me. Please to make a KOTOR trilogy...The restored content mod was great! It filled in a lot of the plot holes from when I first played.			"

												As a Star Wars movie fan, with very little knowledge of the expanded universe, I was surprised to find how much I enjoyed this game. I played it when I was a kid, non-stop, and seeing it on Steam again made me jump with joy. I meant to write this review sooner, but it completely slipped my mind.First off, the gameplay is turn-based action, which is nice, especially utilizing the pause feature. The story progression seems very nice, flowing very well together, in my opinion. There are moments where your choices drastically change the characters.If I recommend this game to a friend, I would tell them to invest themselves in the characters. Each character has a meaning, purpose. Talk to them frequently, bring them with you. They'll help you make your choices, and give you opinions on the choices you make.The only thing I complain about is that there is no non-jedi mode. Throughout the entirety of the game, you are a jedi, you get no choice. However, thanks to mods, the story can now be changed, and the character can be a non-jedi. The modding community is wonderful, and opens doors to this game, as well. However, the base game is still the best.			"

												Star Wars KOTORII Is a must play for anyone who enjoys sci-fi and story based games. Taking place after the events of the original KOTOR, KOTORII continues the story with new locations and a lengthy story with a ton of stuff to do. My only complaint is the combat hasn't aged as well as the story, as it takes a bit to get used to because of its pusedo-realtime feel. Often the player will get stuck on a table because other NPCs are blocking the way, or the character will want to run around the complete wrong way because they have to go around some stupid rock because its ""shorter"". If you haven't played either this or the original KOTOR, they are $10 each and totally worth the price, for a story that beats out more than a few modern games. (Plus if you're REALLY cheap wait for a sale they tend to go on sale for ~$3 dollars and are worth WAY more than that)The game was also updated in 2015 to include a ton of things that were not included in the original PC release or Xbox releases which brings the game almost to the realm of HD including widescreen.

Also, I must say, can someone go back in time and make the prequels based off the games?			"

												I played KOTOR1 when I was younger and loved it. I got a new computer recently and decided to try KOTOR 2 on windows 8.1. I can't say how it worked stock because the moment it installed I downloaded the The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod. I have now played through the entire game once and absolutely loved it. It looked great for being kind of old and it was just super fun. I will play through this again at some point for sure. I recommend this to any star wars lover and anyone who played KOTOR 1. I wouldn't bother with the stock game though. Download TSLRCM mod!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!edit: Just played through for the second time and it was even better than the first!!			"

												When combined with the restored content mod (http://www.moddb.com/mods/the-sith-lords-restored-content-mod-tslrcm) and the extra planet, this game truly reaches its amazing full potential that was dashed upon it being rushed out for Christmas a year after the original. None the less, this game improves upon all the enjoyable elements of the original whilst adding in several features (such as being able to create and more specifically modify items) that enhance the game greatly from the large shadow of its predecessor. The greatest aspect of the game, however, is its effective storytelling and grey ambiguous characters that may actually have you question your own morality as you find yourself at the centre of mysterious circumstances and the near extinction of both Jedi and Sith.
