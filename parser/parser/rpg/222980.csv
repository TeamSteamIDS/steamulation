												Dead Pixels is a side-scrolling survival/shooter with some lite-RPG elements set in a zombie apocalypse.  You take control of a human survivor making their way to safety through undead filled streets of a city.  The basic aim of the game depends on the game mode.  There are three game modes; The main mode is your standard Escape the hordes.  Survival is an arena mode where by you have to survive countless waves of hordes. Timed attack is a variant of Survival where by you must last as long as you can. You need to either; get from one side of the street to the other until you reach the end or kill as many zombies as you can.  The number of streets to traverse depends on the difficulty setting.   Gameplay is representative of the standard zombie survival genre.  Find guns.  Acquire ammo.  Destroy zombies.  Dont get killed.  In addition you can loot some deserted buildings grabbing medical supplies, explosives and other useful items.  Periodically shops appear where you can sell items that are not needed or cant be used.  Shops allow you to upgrade character stats such as: Running, Weaponskill, Bargaining and Melee which to help you get past the next few stages of the game. Game progress can also be saved while inside these locations.Gameplay consists of manoeuvring your character across streets full of zombies avoiding making contact with them or the vile bile they fling at you.  You can shoot, bash or throw explosives to destroy your opponents.   If you are low on ammo you can dodge and flee the nasty hordes, skills that become invaluable the further you progress.  There are number zombie types from slow moving zombies, to faster ones, soldier types, zombies that can attack at range by firing bile at you, and the uber-strong mutated  zombies which are hard to kill.  In addition every so often you must defeat a boss enemy with its special powers, in order to progress.There are many weapons to choose from, the most common being shotguns, rifles and handguns. There are also a good number of equipment items to use along your adventure such as medkits, grenades (explosive, incendiary, freeze, shock) fireworks to distract, adrenaline boosters to speed your movement and though the listings are in text form it can be  particularly satisfying when you pick-up and use a chainsaw, flamethrower or minigun.Graphics are in 2D and are basic if functional.  While the soundtrack and audio effects add to that overall retro feel.  Together they generate a wonderful ambience and give you an old skool feel providing some nice nostalgic overtones, if you played games in the eighties.  Though gameplay is repetitive in nature I found the experience to be as enjoyable as playing other zombie survival games such as State of Decay.  Real fun though be warned you need fast reflexes and nimble fingers (and luck) to complete the game on the Hardest difficulty setting.  Controls are really well coded and easy to use.Just note that only local coop is available unfortunately.  If anything bad can be said about the game its that the inventory is text based, the graphics arent for everyone and the game can run a little too fast in some places when you could really do with slowing down the action to think your next move through. Dead Pixels has to be one of the best made indie games Ive been fortunate to find.  Infact it could well be ""the game"" I would make if I could code.  I suggest you pick this one up now in the sale but if you miss it then its well worth the full price.  Note also that a sequel has already been announced for next year.			"

												Bought this game as i had a spare bit on funds in my steam wallet and didnt know what to buy so looked through the cheaper games and saw this and thought ""OK i will give it a go it doesnt cost that much"",and i am really glad that i did.As soon as i had downloaded and started to play i thought i was watching a pixelated grind house flick on my pc,then the game started and the simplicity of the game was plain to see,go from one side of the screen to the other collecting items and shooting zombies as you go.Then i got to a point where i realised i had made a mistake and then started again,sooner or later the zombies get tougher (boss enemies and the like) and thats when you realise that upgrading your guns and having a certain amount of health packs is of dire neccessity.Now the graphics are ok,sounds and music repeat too much and there is no story to speak of (just get to that damn helicopter and escape),but this is another game that shows that gameplay matters more than all these things and that all a game needs to be sometimes is just FUN.Fancy graphics,music,voice overs,script none of that matters if the gameplay mechanics are no good or broken and the games no fun.Well i think that this game has that one main element that lacks in even some big triple AAA titles in spades and for that i whole heartily reccommend this game to anyone who wants a good blast of fun.

												I've played this game before on Xbox Live, simply bought it out of respect I have for it.This is probably THE  best Indie game I played on Xbox Live (though their tags for that are shoveling all the ""indie"" into the crap little-no effort aisle). Otherwise I quite like this game, though I dislike they apparently made updated Melee to be weaker at some point, which seems unnecessary (especially since HP for Zombies weren't compensated it looks like).Thank you for those who found this ""helpful"" vague, unhelpful as it is, but I'm glad some people found it funny! It's a simple game that does its job well, and the desired experience of a zombie apolcaypse seems to be fully represented in all its mechanics.Anyway, its worth the $3.EDIT to the Steam Committee who wants to know this:It Fulfills the ""Test of Time"", as its simple nature allows for replayability, with it always a challenge on ""Hardest"", Achievements for some that tempt you to do things a little differently in a given run, as well as it's a decent casual game to play with a friend for Couch-Co-Op. So long as it exists, it won't really stop being fun, and can always go back to play again.			"

												A simple and entertaining game, Dead Pixels is a side scrolling shoot 'em up with a fairly strong RPG element for the genre.  Your goal in the game is to make it a specified number of blocks (levels) without dying so that you can escape the zombie-infested city.  Along the way you kill hundreds of zombies, scavenge for supplies, and trade for better gear and skill training.I recommend this as a game to jump into and play when the mood strikes especially if you have a friend to play with.  Though it's not in-depth zombie survival by any means, few games on that market can compete for the old-school local co-op experience that has earned this game a place in my library.			"

												A retro zombie shooter with easy mechanics and a fun story. You go street to street while not trying to get eaten by the hoards of the undead. You can go into buildings and loot whatever you need to live and you also a pretty wide selection of guns to choose from as well. But besides the story mode you have a second campaign you can play as well as a last stand game mode. It's a really fun and addictive game, and with a standard price tag of $2.99 it's hard to find a reason not to pick it up.			"

												honestly i got this game on sale for like 99 cents but it was easily the best 99 cents i ever spent. the gameplay is simple: move left/right and shoot zambies. you can find items and junk in houses and can sell that junk to stores for money to buy weapons or keep some of the stuff for yourself if it proves to be useful. survival mode is well executed. shame everything is local multiplayer only. other than that little thing, the game is great and i'm absolutely excited for DP2.

												Fun, intuitive and challenging. A fun little game to fire up when you just want to relax and blow zombies away. If you have a liking for retro NES -style arcade games. If you like ROgue-likes, If you Like Zombies... you'll enjoy this game.THE GOOD This is a real pick up and play sort of game. Basic controls, basic mechanics  just keep walking right. THe thing is, these a basic but the game makes use of these basic mechanics to create surprisingly deep and nuanced gameplay. The Rogue-like qualities make sure that you'll have a fair challenge every time you play. Well done Retro Artstyle.  Rivercity Ransom - ZOmbie Edition basically.THE BAD The retro art style is hit or miss.  Meaning, if you don't like 8-bit style graphics, this game will turn you off fast.. No network Multiplayer. THE AWESOME This game is simply littered with references to zombie franchioses, particularly Resident EVil. COnclusionGood game, Well executed and still lots of fun after 50+ playthroughs. Some might say the fact that I've played it through 50 times and more makes me biased.  This is true, but in my defense... I found this game fun and challenging enough to be worth playing through more than 50 times. That says a lot. I can solidly recommend this game,.			"

												The game itself is just okay, but I have to give this a thumbs up for being made by someone who clearly enjoys the genre when so many people are just slapping together zombie games for a quick buck. Worth picking up when it's on sale just to see how many of the numerous zombie movie/game related names and easter eggs you can catch.			"

												Dead Pixels is a 2D shooter survival horror game. Your main goal in the game is to make your way across a number of streets, shooting and smacking through zombies to survive. Dead zombies will drop cash. Along the way you'll find buildings to raid for useful items like guns, ammo, and valuables. There are also some traders stationed along the otherwise abandoned streets, looking for some good profit from the dire situation I suppose. You can buy all sort of items, weapons, ammo, and upgrades from traders, as well as sell some of your own things for cash. Basically, that's the entire game in a nutshell. Kill zombies, raid buildings, deal with traders, and try to make it to the end without dying. Pretty simple and fun.There IS strategy involved, though. You see, you have a weight limit on what you can carry, and everything outside of ammo will weigh you down. If you go over that capacity, you will become over encumbered, which will result in your movement being reduced. And what's really neat about this is that, the more extra weight you carry, the slower you become. You can even get completely immobilized if you have too much. But you never are forced to strickly carry only what will fit in your capacity, which give you some freedom in what you value: items or your speed. Some items may not be too useful, such as valuables and weaker or duplicate guns, but they can be sold later. So do you hold on to your money makers, or try to just carry the essentials? Also, when at the traders, what skills do you want to upgrade? What will benefit you the most? Do you want to have more powerful shots to use less ammo, or maybe you should work on bargaining so other things will be cheaper in the long run. Should you sell your item here or bring it back to the trader a few streets back that was offering a good sum for it? Is backtracking worth risking possible ammo and health supplies to get more money? There are a lot of tough calls to make and replayability allows you to experiment with different strategies.And let's not forget co op. In co op you have two people working together to survive, which can be helpful and harmful. You get twice the carrying capacity, twice the melee action, and you can do some distraction and splitting tactics with the clumps of zombies. However, you are forced to share all resources, as the shops only have limited amounts in stock. You also have to be careful not to trap another player on the edge of the screen from moving forward of backward. On the bright side, if one of you dies, the other can revive them at a trader... if they can make it there alone. Working together requires planning. You have to share resources. Who needs what more? What upgrades will compliment each other well? How will your playstyles affect each other's? Again, it's a lot to think about.This game does SEEM like each playthrough would be a unique experence. However, I don't think that's quite the case. There ARE a good number of different things as far as guns, valuables, throwable weapons, and items go I suppose. And with the randomization of traders, prices, drops, buildings, guns, ammo... and well... almost everything that's important... the thing is... this randomization hardly changes the gameplay. You still shoot zombies, raid buildings, and visit traders the same way basically every time. The only difference is what they have to offer, what you randomly find, and the exact locations of places. That's about it. There's a case for it being different each time with how you choose to upgrade your character, but since each skill only has a few levels of upgrades, you can easily get close to if not actually max all of your stats in a single playthrough. This all makes the variety a little lacking. Another complain I have is that, while there are a lot of different weapons, they all fit into categories based on their ammo type. This means that, at any given time, you'll probably only carry one gun of each type with you for the sake of convenience and weight management. It makes the game easier to navigate with less guns at a time, but really lacks in giving good variety. Although, there IS some variety in the extra couple of modes and different difficulty settings. So that's nice for slight change ups on essentially the same gameplay.My smallest complaint is that this is one of those games that doesn't really commit to the retro style. Sure, the graphics and some of the sound effects are 8 bit, but the music, other sound effects, and some visual effects are much more modern. Not to mention the controls. The aesthetic is neat, but I guess it feels a little more like a reference to old games rather than reflecting the style. Maybe I'm looking too far into it.I do like some of the music in the game. There's some decent humor in it too. A lot of people might complain about the co op only being local, but I can't blame the game for something it didn't do. The local co op is a blast and honestly, online co op would most likely be laggy and not as fun anyway. This game is a great sleepover game. You and a buddy can just play it over and over for a night and it's tons of simple fun. The controls are a bit awkward at first, not being very retro styled at all. After a bit a play you'll start to get the hand of it and realize how helpful they are. I was assuming there'd be one fire button and one button for grenades, and that they would be used in the direction I was facing. However, instead you use the left and right shoulder buttons to attack left and right. Sounds confusing at first, but it becomes very helpful. Sometmes you'll be running away from zombies but you'll still want to shoot them. Well you can't do both if you have to turn around to face them. This setup let's you more efficiently run and gun. Be careful though, as your melee attack only goes the way you are facing. Overall, I think the controls are pretty intuitive for this kind of game.So, what's the verdict? Well, this game is a lot of simple, good fun. I'd say it's easily worth $5 on here. However, the asking price is only $3. That's a pretty sweet deal already. But if you're still not sure, wait for a sale. I got it on sale for $1 and look how much playtime I got out of it already? Plus, I've seen it go as low as 74 cents. It's definitely a great title to keep in mind when you have leftover Steam wallet funds from card sales or after you bought some other game you really wanted. It's a nice way to not let that extra cash go to waste just sitting there in your Steam wallet. I'd recommend this is you like simple shooters, 8 bit graphics, or zombie survival games. Dead Pixels is pretty cool.			"

												One of my favourite local co-op games, fantasic fun with a friend. With a cool grindhouse theme and cute pixel art, this game is a must for all couch co-op fans, especially when it can be found really cheap on sale. a fantastic retro sidescrolling take on the zombie shooter genre.Pros:+ Fantasic couch co-op. + Extra difficulty options. It definitely tests your survivability skills on hardest mode when you have to cross over 10 streets with only a single shop and a ton of zombies.+ The Solution gives a new scenario and a relatively easy way of trying out all the funky weapons as you mow down thousands of zombies.+ Procedurally generated maps for a different experience each time you play.+ Cute pixel art, especially when the zombie's eyes go squinty when they notice you.+ A large selection of cool weapons and upgrades.+ Grindhouse style and music fits very nicely.+ Steam Achievements.Cons:- Partial controller supported only; have to use a mouse to start up the game initially.- The Solution game mode is fairly easy, and doesn't change when difficulty increases, only more zombies to kill, which means more money to spend on a supply of infinite ammo, grenades and guns.- Grenades not that powerful.- May be waiting around a while if you poke a zombie off the bottom of the screen for him to come back on. Only problematic on Survival and Time Attack modes and when fighting bosses on the Original game mode. May last forever if they are also frozen. Can be easily avoided though.My Score: 9/10			"

												Dead Pixels is a ""Grindhouse"" side-scrolling zombie shooter with some survival elements planted in it, as well as RNG. Dead pixels is your typical zombie survival shooter, but does it VERY well for the price.DP has you running from one end of the street to the other, killing zombies, looting some houses for items/weapons/ammo, trading with merchants, and trying not to die. The number of streets you must traverse all depends on what difficulty you choose or what gamemode. You have 3 different gamemodes. You have a ""Story"" mode that consists of you getting to the end to escape the city and win, a survival mode, and a time attack mode. All will pit you against the hoards of zombies which vary from the common slow moving zombs, to acid spitting, to commando zombs, to mutant zombs, and the rare chance of ""Boss"" zombies.Don't fret though, as you also get a large arsenal to help you. The most common weapons you will find are shotguns, rifles, and pistols. The farther you get in the game (and the harder difficulties,) you will find more powerful weaponry, such as flamethrowers, mini guns, plasma rifles, freeze rays, and even chainsaws. You will also get an assortment of throwing items, like frag grenades, pipe bombs, molotovs, flairs, TNT, and much more. Don't forget about the med kits!Aside from the items, you can also upgrade your character with the money the zombies drop. You can upgrade your max health, run speed, gun skills, melee skills, carrying capacity, bargaining skill, and luck. This adds in the slight RPG aspect to the game which is nice. In the ""Original"" story mode your character starts with nothing for stats, but in ""The Solution"" story, it has all pre-set characters that have different stats and different starting gear.This game presents it's self like an old retro ""Grindhouse"" movie game, and using old pixel style graphics to give it the old school look. All the graphics look great and all feel like they belong in the game, and fit in very well. Each type of zombie all have their own look, the backgrounds look good, and the blood all looks good.There is a few glaring issues though with this game. The biggest one being it has Coop, but it's local coop only. As someone that doesn't have friends, I didn't have anyone to try and complete the game in coop with. I tried to do it myself, but I wasn't very coordinated to do it. The other big problem is Melee. I found once you maxed out the melee skill, you can cake walk the entire game without having to shoot one bullet. I beat the hardest difficulty with no effort because of this.Pros:- Lots of content for the price.- Easy to pick up and play.- Simple Pixel art.- Good music/sounds.- Not much story, but doesn't really need it.- Lots of items/weapons to pick up.- Lots of different zombies and bosses.- Cheap price.- Achievements.Cons:- Can be very repetitive.- Some may not like the old pixel style graphics.- All menus are text based and don't have any graphics/images with them.- Music may get repetitive.- Melee is stupid OP.- Local Coop only.- No Steam Cards.For a $3 game it's a hell of a deal! Lots of bang for you $. If you are just looking for a fun Indi game look no further! I will always recommend this game to everyone.			"

												8-bit isometric 2d-shooter with rpg-like grading. It costs very little, and can be a reasonable buy if you are looking to enlarge your games-in-possession number. It can even be fun to play - for an hour or two (if you're still not sick of zombies and 8-bit games). The game even have coop-mode, for extra-fun with friend...I've finished it, get all achievements and overcome all ""challenges"" there. Yet I dislike it much more than ""Deadly 30"" or any other little game I've played recently. Why? Because it's not really hard, it's just very grind-based. It takes helluva time spent on mindless and boring process of collecting cash, to buy more ""upgrades""!And even if one really fell with that game, mastered it by every means... hi-scores chart flooded with cheaters! No point to go hard on it, nobody will ever notice your effort.You know what? It's almost the same principle as with Payday - only hundred times cheaper in any way! I usually prefer indie stuff to the overhyped AAA-projects... not in this case.In short: that game isn't totally bad, its just overestimated itself. Like fingerprint lock, which opens only if you click it over 9000 times.6/10 mark. Playable, but not really fun and very grindy in the long run. Can't recommend it to anyone.			"

												When I first saw Dead Pixels here on Steam I thought that it looked remotely interesting so when I found it on sale one day I bought it. Now let me start by saying that I prefer RPG games, preferable with turn based combat, and lots of story. Since Dead Pixels seemed to be far from my preferences, I was interested in finding out if I would find this game good or bad. Well as you properly guessed from the amount of hours, I have put into this game I found it fun.Dead Pixels is basically a simple game. You walk from left to right avoiding or killing hords of zombies. The zombies drop cash when killed, and occasionally during you run through the city you will come across empty houses, which you can loot, and shops where you can buy better weapons, upgrades and sell needless items.The graphics fit the game, and the mood is set just right for some less than serious zombie slaying, and as a casual game that you just start when you have 20 min you feel like killing Dead Pixels is great fun.Short review I know but didn’t see the need to make it longer. I could have kept it shorter by just saying: It’s a fun addictive game I like it "

												An 8-Bit stratergy side scrolling shootem up game you say. Downloaded this not expecting much, But damn, This is actually Quite fun. Like Really fun, Choosing which Zombies you want to kill and which ones to leave by, Workign out what to horde and what not to, Learnign news guns and  ""should i be ripped off by a shop keeper buy buying shopkeeper bargening skills from them"" hmmmOver all I'm going to Rate this game a Solid 7/10Where i feel it Lacks is:No Bouncing Arrow for the Shop keepers building (would help identify them in heat of battle)Needs more ways the character and NPC's dieWhen horde inbound a flashing WARNING WARNING WARNING would add atmosphere to game (liek omg nooooo)Lack of Online Multiplayer (for co op with Friends)Lacks Depth of StoryNeeds some Inspiration from METAL SLUG and BRO FORCE to make it a winning Game worth $5 or more. (paid 74cents)Would I reccomend the game. Sure. for $3 you cant go wrong for a few hours worth of play time. "

												This game is awesome, just buy it, just let it take your money. If you have 3$ and have to decide between this and a snickers bar, then pick this.But being serious, what makes this game awesome:Rockin' music for an indie game, from the menu to the beating drums as your deep in zombie territoryBalanced play of weapons, you can run with only rifles or only shotguns and not regret your choice of weaponryGood difficulty balance! Hardest setting is a test of managing your money, should you upgrade? Should you buy that new weapon, or risk looting the buildings in hopes of finding that kickass weapon?Getting to wave 10 in the survival setting is a blast, and is a nice touch to preview weapons before making the hardest setting challenge.Visually nice, good theme, the flow of controls to fighting is smooth with braindead easy controls to use.This indie game is a diamond in the rough.

												7.2/10 - Great 8bit. Exceeded my expectationsFrom the start, this 8bit game blew me away. Cheap and well done! From the start it detected my graphics and controller. I didn't expect that. The opening cut-scenes were good. The story is not original at all but the game is. You loot shops, kill zombies and progress the 10 streets to salvation. Completed 2/10 streets. I will finish for sure!Worth $5! A must buy if cheaper. Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more. Free Keys and Reviews weekly!

												Personal Rating: 8/10What's not to love about this game? A 2D Zombie Sidescroller that features so much stuff it's amazing and I don't know where to begin. I think I should make special mention of the fact that the game is controller compatible, so if you do have a controller then I'd use that. Makes the game a lot easier to play through because some of the keyboard binds are a bit, well, naff.So, there are three sort of gamemodes in this game. There's the original campaign entitled ""Dead Pixels"" where you need to make it through 10 Streets to get to the chopper. This gamemode is extremely fun and I've spent many hours on my Xbox 360 playing the hell out of this game. The controls are tight, there's a large variety of weapons and items to use and there's a very good selection of different zombie types and as you make your way through the streets, which of course increase in difficulty every time. You find a variety of items in different houses that you can then sell to people who have opened up shops. Which is where my two biggest problems are.1. Why would you open a shop in a city that is about to be nuked?You're making money in a zombie infested city, it's like the bloke who runs the store on Dead Rising 2, the name escapes me but he'd sell you stuff for money. Money will have lost all value during a zombie apocalypse, we'll be buying and selling things in bottlecaps, bodyparts and Barry Scott's Cillit Bang seeing as there's that damn much of the ♥♥♥♥. But it just doesn't make sense that people would open up stores in a zombie infested city that's going to blow up.2. If you're going to give us items, give them some purpose.I honestly have no clue why you're loading me up with Teddy Bears, Lighters and pieces of spaghetti but I don't need them. The only thing you can do with them is sell them, which feels pretty cheap because I don't really know what these people are doing with 50 Teddy Bears and the fact that they're worth so much. You can get a good $100 for a battery, which is pretty ridiculous.Other than those two points ""Dead Pixels"" is great.There's two other gamemodes, which is ""The Solution"", which is actually quite interesting and is a sequel to the first campaign. You pick one of six characters to go back into the city, recover a can of baked beans or something and get out of there. But whats the point in that? Where's my motivation? Well, if you do survive and make it back, your crimes will be forgiven. You play a convicted criminal, and this is a way you can clear your name, it's a really nice motive and it's pretty original. There aren't any merchants about this time, you have to call in airdrops from your radio and collect them at the next street. Really adds a sense of conservation to the scenario.The final gamemode is a survival thing and the name escapes me because it's just the usual ""Survive as long as you can"" which every zombie game must include by law right now. Left 4 Dead, Call of Duty World at War had the best Zombie Survival mode out of all the Call of Duty games and of course No More Room in Hell provides us with the realistic, sophisticated zombie game we've always wanted.Dead Pixels is definitely fun and it's a bargain even when it's not on sale, I got this game for 50p and feel like I robbed the developers. But still, an extremely fun zombie game and a nice break from the first/third person zombie shooter games we're always playing nowadays.			"

												Dead Pixels looks and sounds great. There is a wide range of zombie models, along with loads of different types of zombies from spitters to guys who run at you. Dead Pixels really does feel like an entire city, with its vast range of people, has turned on you. While the shops and houses are repeated level after level, I personally feel this adds to the feeling that the road out of the city is never-ending. Dead Pixels soundtrack compliments the game perfectly. It has a great rock/metal soundtrack with some brilliant guitaring throughout. I always think a game with a cleverly built and executed soundtrack is far more enjoyable to play because of it. This is a soundtrack I would buy and listen to separately from the game.Dead Pixels has two additional game modes on top of the standard escape the city mode. The Solution allows you to choose a character from a list of convicted criminals who each have their own specific stats. The objective for this game mode is to trigger a catastrophic overload in the cities power plant and escape so you get pardoned of whatever crime you committed. With no shops or other survivors to interact with you are simply intent on your target of the power plant and escaping in one piece.  However, you do have the ability to spend the money earned from zombie kills still by using one of the 4 radios given to you at the start of the game. So you can really save up and buy some of the game’s biggest and most devastating guns to smash your way to the power plant and back out again. The other game mode is called The Last Stand and it is your run of the mill survival and time trail mode. No great leap from this mode, but it is a nice addition to two already great game modes.This is a zombie game to be remembered. It is loads of fun, with plenty of weapons, upgrades and zombies, local co-op, 3 different game modes and 5 difficulties to test you on. Dead Pixel is something I will definitely come back to again and again.  Score:Gameplay – 5/5Graphics – 4/5Enjoyability – 5/5Soundtrack - 5/5Story – 3/5Overall – 4/5			"

												I think zombies are boring, stupid, ugly, and bad-tippers. So why would I recommend Dead Pixels? It is a zombie-apocalypse 8-bit grindhouse shootemup with Survival RPG elements. Ugh..Gag me with a rusty spork. I'm surprised that there isn't any platforming, permadeath, and every other thing an indie game is required to have. But you know something? I don't mind it one bit. This is a game where every element works.Basically the goal is to escape the zombie-infested streets. You're told everything you need to know in the first 30 seconds: Press a button to shoot, another to melee, abandoned buildings have free stuff, and there are shops for all the necessities. After that you're on your own. Surviving is a simple enough task, provided you have the ammo. For the most part however you'll only be killing whatever is in your way. Even then, it's usually better to just move around everything. Zombies are (aside from a few exceptions) as dumb & slow as ever. You stick, you move, you juke a little, and conserve that precious ammo. But you need money too right? Abandoned buildings are always good for weapons and valuables, but that stuff gets heavy. Also, depending on the difficulty, shopkeepers can become very scarce. This results in more decision-making, because you can't carry everything. To add to the ""fun"", once you reach a new street, you can't go back to the previous one. Yeah it's some BS about ""Oh No it's too zombie-infested!"" It doesn't really matter though. The undead spawn at a constant rate, so all you should do is move forward. Along with being all-around terrible people, zombies only get worse as you progress. New varieties start appearing, and they've got all sorts of nasty tricks. The worst are the huge shirtless guys. They move quickly and take so much punishment. Usually I just try and move around so the big ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s get stuck behing the slower zombies. The brain-chomping idiots tend to crowd together. It's nice because it makes them easier to manipulate, but if you're surrounded, then a Game Over is assured. Don't forget about the fireworks and adrenaline you have stowed in your backpack! They're easy to forget about on easy & normal, but the harder settings practically require that you take advantage of every possible resource. Along with the main game, the ""Solution"" and ""Last Stand"" modes are nice additions. In the first mode, you select a prison in-mate. In order to earn a pardon, you have to set off an explosive. This is basically an arranged mode. You can order everything direct from the military, but your goods always arrive a couple streets away. There's no use holding onto junk, because there's no way to sell it. Also at the half-way point, you have to head back. So all those buildings you looted, probably won't replenish their stock, when you make your way back. Secondly there's the obligatory wave-based survival mode. Kill zombies, buy stuff, repeat until dead. The mechanics of zombie killin' and dodgin' are pretty solid. The melee is pretty awful though. Even fully upgraded, it can still take several hits to put down one creature. Maybe if the survivors actually put some effort into their melee attacks, they'd be a little more effective. You can see it in-game. Their strikes are so weak-looking, they might as well be murmuring ""ehh"" and ""weh"" and ""uh"" instead of yelling ""HAH!"" ""KIYAA!"" and ""RARRRRGHGHGHZZZ"". Otherwise this game gets the fundamentals right, which makes the more intricate aspects (resource-management) all the more rewarding.Aside from that minor annoyance, this game is really good. The difficulties and modes are nicely balanced, and the weapons are pretty satisfying to use. Plus it makes survival aspects appealing, even to someone like myself. Usually I write a game off as soon as soon as I see the word ""conserve"", but I like how it's handled here. For once it's fun to cross several zombie-filled streets and not fire a single bullet. The easier difficulties are fun in their own way, because it's much easier to load up on ammo and obliterate everything in sight. As good as Dead Pixels is, it's making the wait for the sequel absolutely brutal. I expect that Dead Pixels 2: Straight to Video will be the smash hit co-op sensation of 1991, or whenever it actually releases.			"

												It's a fun game to play for a few minutes. However, the chalenge quickly ramps. The gameplay is always the same. It's not bad for a side scrolling, 8-bit, Zombie killing game.The  mouse cursor doesn't aim your gun, just points your character in which way he should face. Everything seems overly expensive, even on easy. There isn't enough ammo even if you spend all your money on it. So you end up just running past everything. I got half way through the game on easy, just running past everything when it decided to crash.If you stand and fight you will quickly find ourself low on ammo. THe game could easily run two players LAN or Internet, but refuses to do so. Local Co-op only. Which is better then nothing. It might be fun to grab a friend and hook up a controler for him, keyboard for you, and see how far you can get. If you can pick this game up on sale, it will give you an hour or two of fun. But I'd avoid this game otherwise.			"

												Dead Pixels, makes you walk your 8bit character to salvation though hordes of zombies. Graphics are simple as they come, but with a twist of a 70s movie reel -there is even an intermission halfway through your game. Controls are easy and comfortable with both a controller or with a mouse and keyboard. While it is not a particularly difficult game, scarce ammunition might cause you to die early on, so save often and use your bullets carefully to avoid a frustrating experience. Lastly, extra missions and local co-op provide some extra fun to the base game. If you want a simple zombie bashing experience with a dip of nostalgia this game is for you.			"

												There's no shortage of ways to kill zombies on Steam. 2D, 3D, low-res, high-res, first-person, third-person, there's something for every would-be hunter of the undead. Dead Pixels is an attempt to capitalize on the retro 2D zombie market, giving you no end of shambling husks to gun down. But while it has some bells and whistles that elevate it beyond a mindless shooter, it also has some problems that run right to its core.Dead Pixels sets you as a lone survivor in a city of the chemically-reanimated dead. There's an evacuation underway on the other side of town, and if you want to get out with all your limbs attached you'll have to power through plenty of zombies. Along the way you'll find houses and shops to loot, traders to exchange goods with, and all manner of undead standing in your path. Your survivor comes with upgradable stats and a full inventory to manage as well, if blasting zombies wasn't enough.And it's not. The core gameplay of Dead Pixels has you navigating streets, tunnels, and shopping malls, dodging or gunning down zombies as you travel from left to right. The levels are featureless, save for doors to static scenes at the top of the screen. That means every part of your journey is going to be the same, with just the number of doors and zombies changing things up. Every 10 levels has a unique zombie to gun down, but that's the only thing to look forward to once the undead grind wears out its welcome.This might not be so terrible if levels were short or there were significant random elements, but you're out of luck here, too. Each section of street takes a couple minutes to traverse, even if you plow straight through. You move painfully slowly (as do most zombies), and while the combat breaks things up a bit it's not even necessary most of the time. You'll want to avoid fights for the most part to save ammo and potential scrapes. Repeat this 20 or more times (depending on the difficulty) and you'll be aching to break up the monotony with something, anything more. But it's all the same.There are two additional game modes to mention, though one is the same as the base but with no shops and set stats and the other is just a horde mode. You might come across some more creative weapons like freeze rays and lightning guns, but only on higher difficulties. And they're not very well balanced, either... you can become functionally immortal with just the chainsaw. Speaking of balance, the money flows like water so it's not much of a challenge to max out your speed and weapon power and trivialize large portions of the game.There are plenty of things Dead Pixels does wrong, but still a few it does right. The presentation is a clever pastiche of film-grain B-movies and 8-bit retro aesthetics, if you didn't notice the Mega Man thousand-yard-stare protagonist. The sound design is fine as well, and splattering zombies everywhere is pleasantly messy. If the core gameplay just had a little something else, something to spice up the endless eastward run, Dead Pixels could be a recommendation. As it stands, it's sure to wear out its welcome after just an hour or two.			"

As a casual game, for a bit of great fun or just if you have little time (or if you just want to blow up some 8-bit zombie heads) this is exactly what it needs to be. It goes on sale all the time, and even when it isn't, it's only $3, so please, please give this a play.			"

												This is a mash up of soooo much stuff its ridiculous.  It has RPG elements for upgrading stats for Mr. Survivor (my nickname for your little pixelated 'hero').  Its got side-scrolling for, what else, blasting zombies into oblivion.  It even has some element of survival because of a limit on the weight of stuff you can carry (which if you exceed you go slower than some sort of turtle-snail hybrid) and limited supplies even from shops.  The music makes you feel like a zombie-massacering bada$$.  The references (Such as R.I.P. Bill which forced me to laugh uncontrolably and indirectly caused me to be eaten alive. Ironic, isn't it?) seem to never end.  Plenty of zombie variety. (Old lady zombie, John Travolta wanna-be zombie, blind bruiser zombie, etc.)  Three game modes with extremely different mechanics in each (Regular escape the city, some kind of seek-and-destroy in which you can only enter the shop four times and have to retrive your goods, and survival mode).  AAND amazingly fun weapons. (Such as a PLASMA RIFLE [ in the 1970s. LOGIC!], a rapid fire shotgun, miniguns, flamethrowers... need I say more?)			"

												4/5 A fun little zombie side-scroller. In this game you shoot zombies, loot abandond buildings, and try to run to safety. This game is very arcade-y, offers a few game modes, and keeps you entertained for its money's worth, and more. Wide selection of guns and zombies, surprisingly for such a simple-looking game. The boss fights are pretty fun, but once you ""get the hang of it"" the game kinda becomes boring and less enjoyable. There's not too much replayability and the local-only co-op isn't too convenient. But nonetheless, it was a really fun little game while it lasted and I definitely enjoyed my time playing it.			"

You have to make your way through the world killing zombies and buying upgrades and weapons. There is a good deal of replayability as well. Multiple game modes spice up the fun even more! I am not usually a fan of zombie survival games as of late (it feels like there are a lot of them now) but I like this one. Also it reminds me a little of binding of Issac, so thats something.

												I originally purchased Dead Pixels on my Xbox 360 back in 2011. After playing it for a countless number of hours on that platform, I've come to the conclusion that this game is great, to say the very least. It's a side scrolling throwback that's campy, but not cheesy in its presentation. It also has one of the best soundtracks from an indie game. Do I suggest you buy this game? Yes! If you don't, you'd lose a splendid title with B-movie, 80's horror films, and retro game influences.			"

What I did find difficuilt was the hud... I couldn't see the lower bar, at all in fact. After reasigning it in the options menu the game got a lot more interesting.One tip: No matter the ammount of ammo you have, always go to a trader and stock up on ammo, sell all your valuables so you can take as much as you can carry. This will save you from a lot of frustrations and anxiety when you run out of bullets in between that rock and a hard place!9/10			"

												First of all, I think I got this game for free by using a coupon on green man gaming. But not too sure about that since it has been 4 or 5 years from then on.Ok, here is the review. Dead Pixels is based on a very simple concept or storyline. You get cought in a zombie infection situation and you need to push through hordes to get to evac point. Here the simplicity of concept works well as it is self explanatory and straight forward. It is a side scrolling shooting game and it is retro.I am a big fan of 8-bit(also 16-bit) pixelated art style, and this game, I really love it, I can say it is well polished. Some games are trying to be retro, but from artistic aspect, their art resources don't have consistency so some games look like cheap flash games. However, this game, is not on of those. From every aspect, it's retro.In the main game which you play as a survivor trying to get to evac point and you can upgrade your abilities and buy or sell  some stuffs. Also, you need to buy different types of ammunition for different types of weapons. Along the way to your desination, you can find some trading room to do those things and you can search rooms for supplies or weapons. You also get some money from killing zombies, I guess it is loot maybe.The level are procedurally generated so every time you play, the level will not be the same but the difficulty is gradually increasing. This is a fun part. I remember when this games was released, it didn't include ""the solution"" mode which you are supposed to find your way to a power facility and overload it and fall back to your drop zone. It is suprised to see developer add more to it although this game is cheap. I should say the developer of this game is generous and responsible. With new mode, you actually have 3 types of games: the story mode, the special ops and survival mode. This game is a real gem and really worth the price.			"

												A pixel shoot-em-up, Dead Pixels looked like one of those games that come and go. However, when I first played it, I saw that it had Split Screen mode and I could not resist playing it.The survival mode, which is split screen co-op, can be played solo which makes for twice the fun.It begins like a normal survival mode, and periodically, the enemies grow stronger and more tough to kill.You can buy upgrades on your own weapons and purchase better equipment like grenades, medkits, new weapons, and more.The campaign is based on a group of survivors trying to escape the zombie-infested city.It plays exactly like the survival except you must keep up with the screen as it moves.Overall, you should get this game if you like a quick shoot-em-up game and Split Screen action (2 Players for this game)!

												This game is absolutely great. What a blast~ It's quite simple and has very simple rpg elements such as buying and sellings goods as well as getting more money for selling something to a merchant that they really wanted. I have yet to try the local co-op unfortunately but the single player is simple blast your way through zombies goodness. It has a retro feel of course because of the graphics but I also felt nostalgia playing this game.UPDATE: I finally played local co-op with a buddy of mine and it makes the game much more intense and fun. For the simplicity of the game it really is quite strategic. If a merchant only has 2 boxes of handgun rounds and 1 box of shells and one player buys it all, there is no ammo left for the other player to buy. You can enter the menu and discard items; however it wont discard them, it will give your partner the oppourtunity to take it. So if you want to lighten your load by all means discard. But if your partner has a more powerful shotgun and you a stronger pistol but you each have the opposite ammo, you can trade and the great thing about it is you can select the exact amount of bullets to give, or just give all with the push of one button. This really added depth that I didn't even know the game had because you won't experience that in single player. This also goes for items such as medipacks and throwable items such as grenades and flares. This game is retro in every way, even in the sense of game like Double Dragon and more modern Super Smash Bros in the sense that they're amazing games made 10X better with a partner. I recommend this game absolutely. Especially if you're a fan of pick up and play and/or retro style games. It may become tedious in single player if you don't really use all it has to offer but in multiplayer it is non-stop fun. I cannot wait for Dead Pixels 2 as it promises 4 player online co-op but it's been so long and no news. For a price of $3.99 you honestly can't go wrong and it supports developers like this who create great content for a reasonable price. It has great achievments as well such as 1968 which you get when you kill that many zombies. A reference to Night of The Living Dead.It has tons of zombie media references including tons of Resident Evil references. From the Burton Magnum to the Redfield Carbine Rifle and the Valentine Bold Action. There is also a Weker somthing but I can't quite remember it. The premise is also similar to Day of The Dead in which they have to get to a helicopter and escapre. Although in the movie it's not much to get to the chopper. In the game however you have 30 blocks to go through and keep an eye out for any doors on the upper part of the screen as you can enter them for loot and weapons. Also be mindful you can go into garages which many people may not realize unless by chance. When you clear a building out it'll have a red painted X over it so you know. Also traders tend to have a green arrow pointing towards their door. Okay, ennough rambling about the game. Buy it and have a blast. I recommend using a gamepad however it isn't necessary. That will just be personal preference but it seems much better in my opinion with the gamepad. Right trigger shoot right. Left trigger, shoot left. Top 10 Indie game for sure.			"

												In my opinion what lies at the heart of the zombie apocalypse genre is the nerve-wrecking paranoid survivalism. How well does this game pull it off? Not exactly great but definitely better than most zombie games I'm aware of.The major flaw of this game is its backward difficulty curve. In the beginning I had only a crappy shotgun, a handful of bullets and a death wish. And that was great because when I inevitably run out of ammo, I had to run from building to building, praying that inside I'll find at least a couple of bullets before the horde of working class gentlemen chasing after me proceed to chew off my face. It was tense, stressful and absolutely awesome, just the way a true zombie game should feel like. Unfortunately, by the time I reached the last streets (a.k.a levels) I had so much money, ammo and medkits, I was practically immortal and all the challenge was lost. In short, the game is rather unbalanced. Besides the few times when the game crashed and cheered me up immensely, there isn't really anything to complain about from the technical side. The music is pretty decent but definitely not memorable. Criticizing the graphics feels a bit awkward considering the fact it's written in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ title what you are supposed to expect. Desperate lack of resources hiding underneath pretentious retro banner.However, despite my rambling, I enjoyed this game a lot. It's in no way deep, is a bit clunky, but it has a sense of style and what it does, it does well. It's definitely worth checking out.			"

												I'm not sure about this game, if its okay or if its bad. Or if it is badass. But I know one thing : if you're looking for something Retro, this is for you.  The co-op modes on Dead Pixels is not a bad idea, in fact a great idea. The single player mode does get lonely. The catch is, after you play all 3 compaigns, this game is boring. All you do is play the same thing over again. One thing I do like is the reality of the comment on hard mode : ""and the AI director hates you."" , because that is true. 10 spitters, and a zombie hoarde, on both sides of me.... yeah.Overall, id give this game a 7/10 "

												Dead Pixels is a zombie shooter with an 8 bit graphical style, which means alot of gamers will automatically ignore it. We must see at least one of these every week. But wait! This one is actually worth your time. The story and core gameplay are simple. Survive the zombie outbreak by running through several side scrolling streets, shooting or avoiding zombies. However, look a little closer and you'll find a surprising amount of depth. Killed zombies drop money, and buildings can be searched to find better guns, ammo, medkits, buffs and loot. Traders will buy and sell items, as well as permanent stat increases for things like health, movement speed, carry weight and weapon damage. This opens up several playing styles. I haven't encountered any bugs, and there's nothing major to complain about. Dead Pixels will only last a few hours, and it won't make any GOTY lists, but for £2 this is excellent value for money and definitely worth checking out.			"

												The only thing that I don't like is pixelated char.Tho the main gameplay is simple, run from left to right, right to left point, try avoid all enemy attack and kill anything that move. you can loot abandoned house which will give you a random items like weapons and sellable items. You used money to buy new weapon, medpack, buff potion, or any other item that help you to escape from or kill enemy much more easier. "

												Get ready gang its time for another zombie apocalypse and this time, Dead Pixels brings guns and strategy to a belt scrolling beat em up that has you alone or with a friend for some local cooperative action. You walk through through the streets, gunning down randomized waves of zombies and using currency they drop to purchase weapons, upgrades and ammunition. The ammunition is life, because each street crescendos with thicker waves of zombies so they can overwhelm you.On the surface, Dead Pixels looks like a blend between a pixelated throw back to the late 80s and a grind house cinema with its intentional film grain. It even starts like an old movie complete with the countdown of 4, 3, 2, 1 and now for our feature presentation. Both of which alienate it from its 8-bit style. In the game it looks like a cross between old school retro themed charm and cheap with its red lines painted on walls.The objective is to make your way through dozens of streets to the end in three campaigns. There are unimpressive boss fights here and there. They tend to feel like standard enemies that look special. The issue with the bosses is that they take damage and draw in other zombies to attack you. Every so often you get a change of scenery, but its a long wait before you see something different.Your character moves a tad bit faster than zombies and you can still dodge them in even great numbers, but the screen can fill with the green undead. Even after you've cleared an area, if you backtrack, there will always be more zombies waiting for you so you need to pick a direction and stick with it.Shooting zombies in the face looks good, but its a step down from the diversity of beating people up with punches, kicks and fancy moves. That's why this game fits in more with strategy than a cold beat'em up. The brawler genre wears thin on me after a short while and that's why so many of them are short. Dead Pixels with its three campaigns is a good long game.Even with guns, its a tough game, but any game that requires you to grind for more cash in order to upgrade will always be an uphill battle. You need to use strategy to determine if a zombie is worth the ammunition spent killing it. Weapons have penetration, damage, firing speed and range. They come in three types: rifles, shotguns and short range that fire quick, but do small damage.The controls are set up beautiful and it recommends to use a controller. Left trigger and bumper to shoot or throw a projectile to the left and the right trigger and bumper to do the same thing to the right. This allows you to run left while shooting right. The left stick controls, the directional pad switches between weapons, items and throwables. Otherwise, you can hop in the menu to select something.As you go through the game, you'll encounter a lot of doors, most of which have been spray painted over to mark that there's nothing inside. Other doors you can enter to collect random loot. Searching these areas is like looting a treasure chest. With everything that you collect, it increases your weight and in some rare cases, you can become over encumbered and move slower. To counteract this, you need to go into the menu and start dropping things and its always guns that have the most weight. Once something is dropped, its gone for good. Its always good to have only the best weapon for each type of bullet. Otherwise you can quick change to something weak and suffer wasted ammunition.For everything extra that you have, there are shops about one per street that you can sell to. These shops have a lot of depth. They offer things for you to buy, sell you upgrades, save your game and they even want specific things that they're willing to pay big money for. If you have something they want, sell it to them. If you find it later, it will only cost more ammunition to go back and sell it to them.So why is ammunition so valuable? You can find it in rooms, but other than that, you need to buy it and the problem is that once you buy it, then its gone. You need to keep pushing forward to find more ammunition and stores that sell it. That's why its best to have a weapon for each of the three types of ammunition. Sure you can melee enemies, but you can die trying too. Its best to keep zombies as far away as possible.If you have big money, buy upgrades. They come in the form of more maximum health, more weapon damage, more melee damage, more luck, more speed, better bargaining at shops and more strength to carry more. I recommend better bargaining over everything else. Then more weapons to keep enemies at bay. After you've upgraded yourself into a supreme being, you can take out eight zombies with a single shotgun blast and become all powerful, yet still succumb to a lack of ammunition.The game offers a diverse array of zombies with different characteristics. Standard zombies will get alert and give quicker pace. Elderly zombies that are slower. Smaller zombies that spot you from far away and charge at you. These are the ones that you'll need to shoot rather than dodge. Spitters launch a stream of green glowing goo. Soldiers can take a lot of damage and so on. They're all divvied out slow so you need to wade through a lot of streets before the game starts to ramp up the diversity.In terms of cash and fun, you can get a kill combo going. The problem is you still need to collect the cash... before it disappears. So taking down a flood of enemies becomes meaningless if you never charge in risking your health for the coin. If you're at the top or bottom of the screen zombies can pin you, and they wait for others to hurt you.  There's no way to shoot them, because you can only shoot left and right rather than north or south.There are plenty of med kits to restore your health. Some zombies drop antidotes to poison. Adrenaline makes you go faster. You'll get grenades and incendiaries to light a pack of zombies on fire. Fire crackers can be thrown to distract the enemies if you ever need to, but its just easier to walk around the undead.Dying kicks you back to the main menu where you can either load a save for an auto save of the street you were on. It would have streamlined things just to have you chose rather than kicking you back to a menu. With a game that can box you in, its good to have a save in addition to your auto save. Since enemies are randomized there's always still a chance you'll make it through no matter how the odds are stacked.Dead Pixels is well worth its dirt cheap price, even if you take a risk on a game that's a grind. There's a lot here, but its slow progress.			"

												I wanted to play this once I found it on Steam, but the screenshots didn't seem like the game was worth the $3 price tag...and it isn't, but during the Steam Summer Sale, it got marked down to $0.75, so I had to pick it up. I wasn't expecting to put as many hours into it as I have since most of the people that reviewed it didn't even play the game for more than an hour, but it has some pretty cool features. There's a variation of weapons from pistols, shotguns, bolt rifles, grenades, fireworks to distract your enemies and so on, about 10-15 different zombies, an upgrade system for your character, and a few game modes. Dead Pixels is basically a wave based campaign mode that gets harder and longer as you raise the difficulty and ends once you reach the extraction point. The Solution gives you the choice of a few characters to choose from with already upgraded attributes and your goal is to make it to the nuclear facility to trigger an explosion that will wipe out the city. This mode was my favorite because you have to make it all the way there, without traders to buy goods from, (you get ammo and guns from looting and calling in drop boxes from your commander), and then run back before the nuclear reactor explodes. It sounds annoying, but it's the best mode in my opinion. And survival. Would it really be a zombie game without survival?I only have a few problems with this game. The hardest difficulty mode is ridiculous. It should be called impossible mode. Yes, you can beat it, but when you switch from hard mode to hardest mode, you rarely get any weapons or ammo and traders really only appear at the beginning of the game and at the end. May as well just get rid of the traders and force the player to bash his way through. Hardest difficulty isn't bad because it's hard, it's bad because it's extremely cheap and significantly unbalanced. My other complaint is really a recommendation. Just add bosses and it will vary the feeling of the game instead of running constantly down streets shooting the same zombies. Also, the achievements seem buggy, so you could be looking at a few extra hours just to find ways of unlocking them, even when you already did what they said.If you see this game on sale and you like zombies, pick it up. Otherwise, wait for Dead Pixels 2 or just let the game be.			"

												This game is such a simple concept, but still entertains me when I return to it. Being an arcade style game, the story is nothing special, the character is bland, but it still has it's charms. The artwork is simple, but so appealing. The weapons are satisfying and conserving ammo is entirely necessary. The melee seems odd, and a bit too weak. Melee weapons could be an appreciated addition, if made right. The gameplay is what makes this game great. The weapons feel like they have impact, and you can choose to run and gun, take out the enemies in front of you, or save time and ammo by running through the mobs awaiting you. Looting houses is fun, sorting out the things you need and the things you dont need, but why not be able to explore the house? It could be a bit boring if it wasn't done right, but it would be more entertaining than a blank menu, and all the zombies stopping dead in their tracks until you get out. It's a good game, but a flawed one. I like it, especially the fact that there is 2 player local co-op. I give it a 6/10. It's worth a try, especially if you feel like a good arcade game.			"

												Dead Pixels is a very simple game, but an enjoyable one. It's a much less polished and much more shallow zombie take on River City Ransom. You go around the city earning money from killed zombies and entering shops to buy weapons, items, and upgrades for your character. There are two different story modes, and one wave/time attack mode with Steam leaderboards. The gameplay itself is fun even though it tends to get repetitive about halfway through each of the story modes. This is not due to a lack of weapons and items. It's because once you learn how to approach the game, it becomes very easy to cheese your way through both campaigns without too much of a challenge. There is also the option of playing co-op, but it is only available locally, which is always a wasted opportunity. Overall, Dead Pixels is well done and offers a lot of content for its extremely low asking price.Dead Pixels is good.			"

												This is a run and gun shooter with a retro feel to it. The object is to make it through each level by getting to the end. On the way there you can kill the zombies, or avoid them. You can also raid the stores, houses, and buildings along the way. In these building you'll find ammo, guns, and items such as water that you can use or sell to traders that you find throughout the levels.  There's three different mods to play. Two campaign type, and one survival type. I flew through the first campaign in under an hour, and the second in even less time. Keep this in mind, as it is a very short game. The controls with a gamepad, such as the 360 controller, work flawlessly. I personally didn't use the mouse and keyboard with this one so I can't rate the control factor on that end. For $2.99 it's not a bad game, it offers local co-op, achievements and all that. If you can get in during a sale for like 66% off, as I did, then it's a steal. I had fun playing through the campaigns, but didn't much care for the survival mode only because that's not really my thing. All in all I enjoyed it, and think you will too.

												The game isn't necessarily bad, but it's not very good either.  It's basically another game riding on the barely living 8-bit trend, and the completely passed tense zombie trend.  The gameplay is repetitve and pretty dull.  It is not particularly challenging.   Avoid the slow zombies, loot boring random rooms for generic ""treasure"" that has no in game use.  Sell the treasure at other random shop rooms to upgrade and get ammo.  Conserve ammo by not killing anythign and running through the level.Most importantly, Dead Pixels is not in any way a simulation.  I was kind of fooled into purchasing due to the very positive review status and the descript ""Zombie Sim.""  I thought inventory and stat management, possibly exploring pathways and some stealth would be inolved.  Afraid not.Take this review from a guy who collects and plays a lot of games, and has a library of actual retro carts.  This game is kind of like advanced River City Ransom, which some people may enjoy.   "

Playing this game is easy with a keyboard and mouse and just as easy with a controller, so regardless of your gaming preferences you can still play this with your friends. I'm looking forward to their next game that is supposedly 1-4 players which will make the gaming experience that much better. If you wanna kill a few hours, and a few zombies...

												Buy? Maybe. It's a zombie survival action game where the goal is to get to the final street in the chapter. There are unlimited zombies and you have limited resources to deal with them. This can make the game intentionally tense, as you figure out if it's better to shoot or run. You do have a melee attack, but it's literally no more than 2 pixels large and I have yet to see any melee weapons, so you're stuck with slapping zombies or pushing your gun. (Melee does become more effective when leveled up, but is expensive and using melee is very boring). I like this game for its retro appeareance, rocking soundtrack, and resource managment. I hate this game because i'm always getting caught on zombie groups, melee is underwhelming. the streets are nearly all the same (RUN RIGHT! Same streets, different buildings), money drops from enemies disappear after a few seconds (which SUCKS when dealing with large groups of enemies and you need money for ammo or upgrades), and vendors that are willing to pay top dollar for a specific item always want something you just sold or won't get until you way past them. Nearly anything in the game that has a name is a reference to other zombie fiction, particularly Resident Evil and Left 4 Dead.  I like some of the core mechanics of this game, and somebody looking for geniuine action/survival/ammo management will like this, but it started to bother me after a good while.			"

												Dead Pixels is a great game to just pick up and play. It has really good controller and local co-op support that was a ton of fun for my friend and I to play (Him on a PS3 controller and me on a 360 controller). Dead Pixels has a good amount of content with a story and survival mode, that is fairly challenging and is surprisingly addictive. For a $1.01 it is surprisingly polished and has a pretty hilarious storyline. There is a large variety of zombies that all have different amounts of health and abilities. Also throughout the game you'll find many buildings to loot and traders to buy weapons and ammo, and sell valuables.There are simple RPG elements throughout the game that allow you to upgrade your player with enhancments such as; Run Speed, Weapon Damage, Health, Melee and Strength. These upgrades all cost a pretty penny though, and I guarentee you'll be running low on money the first couple hours you play, just because of the mass amount of junk there is to buy. I find myself overencumbered all the time just because I feel like I'll use some items eventually, even though I usually don't.The wide variety of weapons is also a really interesting mechanic especially since there limit to how much you can carry, also there isn't one dominate weapon for there is a down side to every weapons strengths. For example, the Chainsaw can shred zombies up but you need to get close and there is a limited amount of gasoline you can carry. The Burton assault rifle has really good range and damage, but blows through ammo ridiculously fast. In the end Dead Pixels deserves a 9/10, It's a solid Indie game with no real downside except for the lack of online Co-Op. There is also no way to change options unless you quit to the launcher which got pretty annoying while setting up a keyboard and mouse, which most people won't have to do.			"

												The balancing in this game is seriously geared against you. Ammo is very scarce, which means you'll be poking a TON of zombies. Now this wouldn't be a problem if the keys were rebindable, so that you could melee with a mouse button. But sadly this is not the case, it's really obvious that this game is only meant for a console. If you have a controller for your PC, then you still might want to consider getting this game.

												I.. need.. better.. graphics.. :> And that's sad from someone who plays 2-4 hours of ascii games every day, haha ;) Other reviews here say that the graphics are appealing, but I say they need salt (or garlic, or pepper, or something..)I just read some pretty hard-hitting stuff at PuppyGames.com about how indie devs don't need to waste time caring about customers because each game sale ends up earning them about ten cents, which sounds pretty true to me.. They also said they spend eons of time troubleshooting customer's broken PC (and rarely fixing their own game)..In light of that, all I can say is that if the devs are happy with the art style then its perfect :> Not for me, but for them, and that's cool :) I guess I'd personally call the game ""under-fed"".. Its a great base, and it'd be one I'd play often if the art were more gritty and gory.. A lot of nice pixel-explosions (of fire or gore!) or things like lighting and muzzle flash, could be added, and more variants of the current zombies.. Also more scenery (blown up/burning cars, dead bodies, more general damage and blood splashes..), maybe some random-gen ambush situations (doors, cars or garages that can release or hide zombies).. Some character customization, even a utility for editing and recoloring the player character and zombies..A game is worth its content, and regardless of business-related ups and downs, one fact that'll never change is: You can't stop a good game from selling.Can't. Can not :> Terraria goes for ten bucks when not on sale, and I don't think its a game that should even go on sale :| I would have paid 30 bucks for it, easy, because its had more time and care given to it than the grand majority of my Steam games, even among AAA titles.. Tales of Maj'Eyal is another great one and its a non-animated tile-graphics game.. But those graphics have soul, and the game represented by those tiles has a blasphemous wealth of content..Love your game, and add more love! There is such a thing as a game that never stops selling, believe it!			"

												I bought this game a good, 6, 7 maybe even 8 months before writing this review here. I never thought it would be much of a game, it was on sale for 99 cents and I bought it just on the off chance it would be good, and because it was so cheap.Recently I was talking about one of my favorite old NES games, River City Ransom, and had asked a friend if he knew of anything similar that is on the PC. This is the game he mentioned.And while I do not think this game is better than River City Ransom, or even close to as good. It definitely scratches that itch I had for a similar game. The controls are nice and responsive, the movement is fluid, and the gameplay is challenging enough. You can loot abandoned buildings, then turn around and sell the items you find to traders that have storefronts randomly throughout the game and use those funds ot buy weapons/ammo/health kits form them. The traders also have a 'wanted' option to click when in their store, and they name an item that they want and they offer high amounts of money in exchange.The game also has level progression and slight RPG elements, skill upgrades, a nice assortment of weapons. Weapons which have stats that you can compare. Overall I'm pleased with the game so far, and although i havent put in a whole lot of time with it yet, i can see im going to enjoy it a lot. But i also see that it's going to get quite repetitive, which may or may not be a bad thing.I definitely would reccomend this to anyone whos into retro gameplay. at ANY price, the $2.99 price tag when it's not on sale is nothing, it's well worth that.7.5/10			"

												Over long time I did a right decision and bought a cheap, but nice looking indie game.. I've been looking for an indie game that makes me forget that I have to wake up tomorrow for months! I like indie games, but most of the games are too expensive for their content, but for this game I would've been ready to pay little bit more, because I like it so much!Pros:- shout over your room ""F*CK OFF YOU PUNCH OF ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S!"" and then you'll ♥♥♥♥ off because huge horde wants to eat you, but you ran out of bullets.- Escape to abandoned houses/garages/businesses from zombies, collect all the stuff and then run out and hope zombies don't kill you infront of the door.- Sell any kind of crap to stores and buy yourself new loud friends that you can use to blow or destroy zombies :)Cons:- I can't find one.

												Dead Pixels is one of the best retro game out there. Not only that but its definately one of the greatest zombie survival games. GAMEPLAY: One of my least favorite parts about zombie games these day is how unnecessarily complicated they are. And I understand why they do this for the most part (i.e. more content, lacking in interesting features, etc), but things like that in a zombie game tarnishes the zombie formula that i enjoy. For lack of a better example, look at Left 4 Dead in its most basic form its just a stareotypical zombie game with a good gib system, but if you add an element like coop for example and build apon that you have yourself one of (if not) the best zombie games ever. I believe Dead Pixel excels in the element that it adds to this otherwise average zombie game, that element being survival. Also its gameplay has the charm of an old arcade game.Music:The sound track fits the overall tone of the game. Its also not very repeative, nor boring to listen to.Visuals:To me this game is very visually appealing, but art is valued by the eye of the beholder. "

												Do not be deceived, this game is more than it looks.  While it appears to be a simple 8-bit shooter (and it is), there is more to Dead Pixels than meats the eye.  This is a sidescroller and a shooter, but like in a 'real"" zombie apocalypse you are bound by physical limitation.  This is not Contra, you don't just spam fire and dodge monsters.  You have ammo, guns all work differently, you can melee, you can run out of supplies.  You need to think your way though this game.  Different shops have different prices and may be willing to pay you handsomely for items they need.  Its a simple game, but its addictive and really fun.			"

												I don't know how he can say that there's over a hundred weapons, because there isn't. That's a flat out lie.There's 7 weapon types, and each weapon has maybe...3-4 varients in NAME and attack damage, but essentially do the same thing. For example, Redfield Handgun, Chamber Handgun, Burton Magnum, Valentine Handgun, all use the same ammo and have the same sprite, and shoot the exact same way. Some just do more damage.Essentially, in the main game, you'll generally find your way up to having a valentine rifle, shotgun and machine gun, and that's literally all you need to beat the game every run except hardest.That's not to say that the game is bad, but let's be honest, this game is no Left 4 Dead.I got it on sale for like $0.75, so I can't complain considering I've played it for 24 hours already in the few days I've owned it, but that's because I needed something for a livestream, and it worked like a charm. The demo for DPII makes this game look WAY worse in comparison, and you should definantly preorder that so that you get Dead Pixel + Dead Pixel 2 for a cheaper price. Buy from his website and you get this game + 2 for $10 total, and Dead pixel 2 has custom characters, online co-op and 4 player modes. tl;drDead Pixel II is going to be way better so just pre-order that so you get this free.

That's it-Guns Are horrible to use, I miss a good 90% of shots-It's only fun in co-opI guess that I would rate this game around a 4/10.

												This could be perfect co-op game to play with a friend instead of plying 8-pool on miniclip at that boring evening. But....there is no co-op and for me, Dead Pixels has no sence of existence at all. It's like made to be played in co-op specifically but has no multiplayer option. There are trailers for the Dead Pixels 2 with the co-op mode and for sure it will be one of my favourite ""light"" games. I have big expectations about that title. Dead Pixels is like a demo to something which is coming. There is no sense of talking about the graphics or game mechanics. It meant to be simple and it is. For now on I give it 3/10 but I'll buy the seond part with co-op for sure ! And I hope it'll meet my expectations.3/10			"

												So I was playing this game after a hard day of getting run over and thought to myself:""This game is quite epic. I can explode zombies heads with my Swag Rifle and use drugs to be Hella awesome.""And then I played the game as a soap-dropping black man from prison who f*cked Hella b*tches back in highschool and killed Hella zombies to get out of prison.Seemed legit.So I used my Swag Rifle to kill Hella zombies and save the world.(Even though it blew up anyway...)And I went to Speedway for my morning brew and saw that Happy Smurf was prohibited in their facility.SO!I injected Happy Smurf into my Swag Liver and this 8-bit game became an HD zombie-killing swagfest of Hella proportions.And everything else about this game is freaking awesome as well,you just don't get to know about it until you buy it.(Which I recommend.)One problem:YOU CAN'T EVEN 360 NOSCOPE BRUH!

												Очень интересная игра, про мой любимый Зомби Апокалипсис, только вот на английском языке, а русификатора нету, поэтому интерфейс, да и сам геймплей, очень затрудняется. Ещё одна “непонятка” с патронами, как и где их добывать неизвестно, а они кончаются ОЧЕНЬ быстро. Много режимов, в который можно играть с друзьями, только вот с одного компьютера, это интересно, но в тоже время и нет, это индии игра, и в ней просто ОЧЕНЬ не хватает мультиплеера, будь в игре он можно было бы играть и играть… Что насчет графики, мне графика нравится, и сюжет тоже интересен, все портит мое плохое знание английского языка, а так, игра превосходна, 8,5/10.

												I've been dragging ♥♥♥ on my plan to write reviews for every game in my library but this one I can do quickly: This game is stupid. Awesomely stupid. It's that kind of run and gun deal that you'd see in an arcade. So refreshing from what people have been trying to do with zombies lately. They're not made for drama, they're animate dead bodies that do nothing but consume and need to be pumped with lead and that's what you do in Dead Pixels.It gets its rogue-like categorization from being what I like to call run-based wherein you go through a randomly generated map from beginning to end and get increasingly stronger new items. I like it. It's good all the way down to the price. I just wish there was a little more variety to everything and classes to pick from (which is kind of what you can do in the second game mode). It appears that Dead Pixels II will improve on these things.I finished all 3 modes on all 3 difficulties within a few hours but like I said this is priced right for what it is. Simple run and gunning. It's also one of the few games I can tolerate playing with my gamepad's joystick.			"

												I think this is the first ever 8-bit (or 16-bit) game that ever get me hooked. The course of the game is simple, you went right to left, street to street, until the end. Along the way, you'll find houses to loot, merchants that sells you supplies and opportunity to upgrade your character (Not all offer the same prices though). Best played with a friend using 2 controllers. Makes the game worth so much more than it cost. I got mine during the last Halloween Sale for a buck. Don't hesitate on getting it now.

Yes, it DOES have some funny hommages, lovely created little jokes, the style is great but several modes don´t help if the main gameplay is nothing else than brainless running from the left to the right, buying stuff and shooting hordes of zombies, if it´s done so boringly and mindless like it´s the case in this ""game"". For a free flashgame this would´ve been ok, but don´t waste money on it, seriously!I´m a huge zombie fan and I love ""different"" games, but this one is as brainless as programmed by one of ""them"" and the mixture of too boring and too hard is deadly for a game like this.

												Dead Pixels Review - Raymond KTSummary: A toxic waste spill finds its way into the water supply, causing the recently deceased to rise from their graves. Now it's up to you to blast your way through the hordes of undead if you're going to escape the city. On the way to your rescue, you'll search stores and houses for supplies, and trade with other survivors. With three game modes, hundreds of items, weapons and grenades, and a city that is never the same twice, there is always something new hiding round the corner in Dead Pixels. When the Dead Start Walking, It's Time to Run.The controls were pretty clunky as was the store interface and looting aspects of the game. Combat just didn't feel very fun. I found myself just racing to the end after getting about halfway through it. Once you've played it for 4 hours and it starts to get repetitive I don't see you wanting to come back for a second helping. I've finished it, get all achievements and overcome all ""challenges"" there. Yet I dislike it much more than ""Deadly 30"" or any other little game I've played recently. Why? Because it's not really hard, it's just very grind-based. It takes helluva time spent on mindless and boring process of collecting cash, to buy more ""upgrades""! And even if one really fell with that game, mastered it by every means... hi-scores chart flooded with cheaters! No point to go hard on it, nobody will ever notice your effort. You know what? It's almost the same principle as with Payday - only hundred times cheaper in any way! I usually prefer indie stuff to the overhyped AAA-projects... not in this case. "

												This game is a bunch of nothing. The combat is tedious and slow. The ""sim"" part is shallow. The survival, on hard, is not difficult. You stay along the top, going in building after building mindlessly collecting stuff to sell at the next trader; To then upgrade a few things, all while killing a zombie or two that walks into your path. This is also a great example of a ""pixel"" or ""retro"" looking game that needs more to the graphics and aesthetics (than the few filters they cram everywhere). All of the movement is just bland, and uninspired.Generic sound is generic.I spent $1 to play this for 25 minutes and be completely dissapointed in my mistake.			"

												The BGMs are sucking. Money System and Skill System are bad. In the hardest difficulty, you just collected a few coins after you killed a large number of zombies(coins will be vanished after a while, I don't think you would risk your life to collect coins). In later period, coins were useless because the commodities were limited. Also your skill (the highest level is 5) and guns became useless too. Those things which can let you pass through the block quickly were the most important tools. A shoot game unexpectedly becomes a shun zombie game.游戏的背景音乐非常烂（就几首歌一直在那循环播放），金钱和人物升级系统做得很不好。在最高难度下，前期你杀了一大波僵尸才捡到几个金币（金币会自动消失，你不可能冒着生命危险去捡钱吧？）。而到了后期，金钱却一点用也没有（商店能买的东西都是有限的）。人物技能最高只能升到5级，到了后期简直就不够用。后期枪支成为摆设，能够快速通过街道的道具才是王道，一款横版射击游戏到了后期竟然变成了躲避向游戏。			"

												It seems like fashion is making zombies/survival games, and i'm fine with that as long they are good - give props to L4D2 and DayZ - but then we get games like Dead Pixels. The concept is good non less, is a side scrolling retro style zombies, and i'm a sucker for side scrolls, but the game is really bad! The gameplay can get a bit repetitive and boring, sure it has some nice parts where you can kills all the zombies and escape but is all that. It has 3 games modes - Dead Pixels, The Solution e Last Stand - but they are all pretty much the same. Dead Pixels is the main game mode, it contains a story although is a very weak. I really love the old school graphics and also the OST fits with the game. If you have a spare change to spend pick this game when is on sale, if not, don't bother getting it.~ 5/10			"

												Dead Pixels is mediocre and uninspired. It is a roguelike (or roguelite for the ♥♥♥♥♥ that care) where you have to get from Point A to Point B, which is separated into several levels with incremental difficulty.

The regular game mode is dumb because you don't get enough ammo and have to run past most zombies and don't get to do much but run.

												While not some high profile release with an impressive story and hundreds of hours of gameplay, I enjoyed my time with this game.StoryThe game has three scenarios, each with a different story. Dead Pixels is the first one, this is rather basic. The dead are returning from the grave, you must reach the airport to escape the town. The second is The Solution in which you are a convict sent to the town to attempt to do something about the zombies. The final one is Last Stand where you are a survivor who was unable to reach the airport, and must survive for as long as possible.PresentationThis is pretty good. Some basic blocky graphics, similar to the kind of images you would expect from a Sega Genesis / Mega Drive or Super Nintendo. They certainly work, you won't have any trouble noticing a zombie against the background. Each zombie type is different enough that you know what to expect from them when you get close.As for music and sound effects, these are good enough. The music isn't memorable, but at least gets you in the mode for dealing with zombies. As for the groans, gun shots and other effects, they are fine.ControlsI played this with a wired XBox 360 gamepad, as the game was originally released for the XBox Live Indie library and had the controller in mind when released. Because of this, I can't confirm how good other control methods may be. What I can confirm is that it works great with the gamepad, using the triggers and bumpers to fire you current weapon and throw grenades in either direction. The left analog stick will move your character and the face buttons will perform actions like a basic melee attack and using doors.GameplayNow for the important part of the review. In this game, you will play a character who will keep going right past groups of zombies, traveling several blocks in order to reach his goal and escape, unless you are playing the Last Stand scenario, where you simply try to survive as long as you can. Obviously, the rotting corpses will do their best to prevent you from doing this, by attacking you using any method they can, some even spitting at you. Now, you do start with a weapon and some ammo, but firing madly into the groups will expend your limited bullets quickly. However, by entering buildings along the way, you will find various items left behind by the previous inhabitants. You can take weapons, ammo and other items from these buildings, but be sure to not overload yourself if you wish to continue escaping. In two of the scenarios, Dead Pixels and Last Stand, some buildings will also contain survivors willing to purchase items from you, as well as selling some of their own. They will also allow you to exchange cash in order to upgrade skills, like weapon damage, inventory size and movement speed. When playing The Solution, these survivors are no longer around, but you do have a choice of characters, each with their own skills already for you to survive.LifespanProvided you enjoy the game enough to continue playing, there is a good amount to do. The game has 4 difficulty settings, each of which extends the number of blocks you must travel to escape. It also supports co-op if you have a friend willing to play with you. It also has 30 achievements to earn if you are interested in collecting those.In the end, while I admit this game isn't perfect, at the price of $3, you easily get what you paid for in terms of fun.

												This game appears simple, but it's really not. And you have to play it to find that out. In the first of three games, you have to survive and manage resources along the way. In the second you have to do a mission to help your government. And the third...I won't say. But, along every step, you have to intelligently manage your resources and survive. This game appears simple, but its not - its great! 4/5 Stars.			"

												Any game that costs only a couple dollars and can keep a gamer occupied for 25+ hours is a steal. I know that the whole zombie media obsession can be annoying, and if that's a real problem for you, don't buy this game. It is comedic, it is entertaining, but at its heart, Dead Pixels is a zombie game. The retro-style action is engaging, and the wide range of difficulties keep it interesting after the four or so campagins have been completed. Buy the game: support a good indie develpoer while enjoying a fun casual game.			"

												Nice, simple game. It's no Left 4 Dead but the gameplay is very well done. There are two campaigns, both of which have randomly generated enemies providing more replayability. There is also a ""wave"" mode where you survive for as long as possible. Pretty good for a $3 game.It's a lot more fun with an Xbox controller, because mouse aiming is kind of odd.			"

												Virtually done with the game after 4 hours of playing. The lack of mini-bosses/bosses turns the entire experience into one ""samey"" morass. There's really zero incentive to actually kill zombies with the limits of ammo, and instead you're encouraged to focus on moving right while avoiding as many zombies as possible.It's OKay but the content is not varied enough. The price is definitely right if you're looking for something brainless and simple to kill a few hours.			"

												This game is so damn frustrating, but I love it! The save system is great; except when you save in the wrong spot! I got myself trapped about 10 streets in with no more ammo and nowhere to buy it. Starting over is not the worst thing in the world, as the game is not terribly long. You should take note; CONSERVE YOUR AMMO! I cannot stress this enough, as ammo comes few and far between. I found myself running around and dodging the horde many times in an attempt to save what precious ammo I had. Also, while concentrating on avoiding enemies you will likely miss quite a few unpainted doors; these signify an establishment that you can search for items. Make sure you hit these whenever you can, they come in many forms including standard doors, double doors, and roll-up garage style doors. And when you come out, the enemies will be right where you left them. Take heed!			"

												Any game that costs only a couple dollars and can keep a gamer occupied for 25+ hours is a steal. I know that the whole zombie media obsession can be annoying, and if that's a real problem for you, don't buy this game. It is comedic, it is entertaining, but at its heart, Dead Pixels is a zombie game. The retro-style action is engaging, and the wide range of difficulties keep it interesting after the four or so campagins have been completed. Buy the game: support a good indie develpoer while enjoying a fun casual game.			"

												Yet another zombie game but this one looks like an old 8-bit Nintendo game. There are some slight RPG elements too like upgradable stats, weapons, and items to distract/destroy the zombies. There's only 3 stories to play (and one of them is just an endurance mode) so there isn't much depth but there is some mild replay value. Don't bother playing on anything above easy or normal though because the difficulty curve is not a curve but a brick wall upon selecting anything above normal. On hard it's impossible to upgrade your weapons because you won't have any money and you won't have any money because you spent it all buying ammo and you spent it all buying ammo because it takes upwards of 5 shots to kill even the starting enemies and it takes upwards of 5 shots to kill even the starting enemies because it's impossible upgrade your weapons. Notice the circle there. Not to mention that if you try to loot too much stuff to sell later you will get weighted down and can't move fast and mobility is a crucial part of strategy in this game.For all it's faults though, there is some joy to be had here. So, get a buddy to play with and keep the game on easy and the two of you can blast the day away in massive spurts of pixilated blood. It's a decent game for the price.			"

												I know, I know, pixels and pixelart are way overused nowadays, letalone zombies, but trust me on this one, dead pixels is a very fun game (with a different kind of mechanics) in the action/survival genre, it gets pretty exciting as you play, and it can even get frustrating, but it's still pretty amazing. As any horror/survival game, you have to plan very carefully what to have in your inventory and when to use it, it has a limit of objects you can have, you can exceed that limit, but you'll walk slowly and eventually die because of the zombies. Not a very known game, but still really good, and with its price, you should give it a try anyways.			"

												This game is really  fun. There is 3 modes for you to choose from. Each mode is a different type of playing the first mode. The first mode is Dead Pixels where you are a survivor and you loot stores. The second mode is the Solution where you can be your favorite zombie writers such as Robert Kirkman (creator of the Walking Dead) and you can be Max Brooks (creator of The Zombie Survival Guide and World War Z). In the second mode you play it the exact same way you play the first mode but your connected to the goverment and if you press a button the goverment pops up and you can buy and sell stuff. In the third mode you do a survival round. They have waves of zombies and you only get about 10 seconds to go into the stores. You can also do Time Attack which gives you a limited time to complete one wave. The third mode is just a fun way to see if your ready to play story mode. I hope you have as much fun as I did playing this game because I highly recommend it.			"

												After a toxic waste spill the dead soon rise , the city is overun with the undead and you are a survivor . You soon hear word of a way out of the city and decide it is your only option . However you must get past the zombie packed streets . Dead Pixel is a side scrolling shooter , it provides random generated shops and buildings you can loot with random encounters with large waves of undead . The game is addicting and you will find your self wanting more and more . Various guns , throwables ,and upgrades keep you constantly entertained along with the various zombies that you can never get tired of killing . The game as of yet also includes 2 other modes besides the original . the provide a survival mode to see how long you can last as waves of zombies come , and a twist on the original that lets you start with a pre upgraded character but no shops or buildings to loot you call in for supplies to be dropped . This game is amazing in everything it brings to the table , however what it does not is what i am most dissapointed about . It does not have any online co-op. Local co-op is fun and great but the more buddys i can play with the more hours i can get into this game and have a blast , if this game had online play it would be one of the best purchases i made this year but it doesnt . Still its up there providing tons of hours in gameplay and fun .			"

												Dead Pixels is a side scrolling (Double Dragon style) zombie action/survival game. I really enjoyed this one! The game is fast paced and satisfying to play, there is a good level of progression and decent customization. As you move through the levels, you can enter buildings to loot them as well as find others to trade with. Money is spent on either guns/ammo/grenades etc, or on character upgrades (HP, speed, carry weight, etc). There is a good level of challenge in the game as I did find myself dead a number of times, and most of the time it seemed fair :) There were minor clipping issues at times where I seemed to get ""stuck"" in the environment, but I would say only a few times over an entire playthrough. Overall, I had of fun and would recommend it!			"

												The game has a pretty good replaybility and it is a 8-bit styled arcade game.STORY (8/10):There are multiple stories that lies within this game and it really doesn't have one clear storyline that defines Dead Pixels. Although it has the same old story that you normally would see within a zombie movie. ART/MUSIC (8/10):The art is a simple 8-bit style. The art gives this game a vintage or retro feel to it. Not only that, the developers also added some effects and styles that you'll remember from a 1980's horror movie. The music is pretty good. My favorite tune is the one that plays in the title screen before entering the main menu. The song was a great rock song.GAMEPLAY (9/10):The game is really simple and easy to pick up as well. I played it on my keyboard and it was pretty easy to play. There are different difficulties and it will define your experience when you choose the difficulty. Plus, the game has multiple game modes which makes each experiences different. The main game mode has this economic system and an upgrade system that makes the game fun in exploration and powering up. As for ""The Solution"", it limits players on their items and such.TOTAL SCORE - (8.5/10)My Let's Play of the Game -

It's an easy left to right (and right to left) shooter, with RPG elements such as experience points and buyable stock like weapons, medi kits and all kind of loot. I didn't have the chance yet to play the co-op mode, but if it's as fun as the single player modes, I don't have a doubt that it's killing. For that price - I have to mention that - actually not even worth THINKING about it, just buy it!			"

												Tough game but a lot of fun to play co-op. The game consists of shooting & running from zombies, looting vacant buildings, and visiting shops. Shop prices vary, so you never know if the next one will have a good deal. Ammo is always scarce so I was forced to buy up as much as possible early on. Occasionally a vacant building will have an alarm which summons a horde of zombies, it's a quick way to end your game accidentally unless you're prepared. I would pay full price for this, but it's always best to wait for a sale.			"

												This game is really a blast to play. It definitely has that trendy old school feel to it, but it just doesn't seem to be so self absorbed in its trendiness as a lot of indie games these days do. It is just straight up fun and challenging. You are basically running down a street shooting, bashing or setting fire to zombies. Killing the zombies gives you cash which you can use to upgrade abilities such as weapons, strength or melee. This increases your ability to defeat the monsters. You can also use your cash to get better weapons, health, ammo, etc... The game also has challenge modes which pit you against waves of zombies. For three bucks it's definitely worth the price. Highly recommended.			"

												Like video games that involve any kind of combat? GET THIS GAME! This is one of the few games in a long time that has had zombies that ive enjoyed, and that is saying a lot. You can tell the devs really loved zombie movies and poured thier heart and souls into it. Why do i say that the devs loved zombie movies? there are so many references to zombie and horror culture in general, its astounding! (not to mention, BOOMSTICK!!!!) There have been so many games that try and feel high grade even with a shoestring budget, and this is one of the few that genuinely got it right.Just be warned, the game is extremely difficult and ammo is sometimes scarce when you need it most. Other than that and a few instances where the AI seemed th become superhuman and block me in, I have nearly no complaints!I rate 1968/BOOMSTICK!!!

												Dead Pixels is the kind of game you would have played over and over again at the arcades 'back in the day'... at least if you're of a certain age. It doesn't pretend to be anything other than a side scrolling SHUMP, but it does it so well.The feeling of panic as the horde swarm down on you, as you run out of bullets, as the heartbeat thumps over the audio as your health goes down works so well. The desperate search for a Trader to sell your unwanted junk so you can buy more ammo or the the life saving fireworks. Yes, fireworks.The premise is simple - survivor 20 streets to make it to the potential helicopter to safety. Loot/raid what you can along the way and find whatever you can to survive. Shoot zombies and steal their wallets, and find the trader to buy upgrades. Easy.Only, it can become challenging as various zombies start to appear, some with different abilities... and some that are incredibly hard to kill. By themself they're nothing, but when you get by that Zombie Wave containing various Zombie types... well you know you're in trouble. All I can say is watch out for the rats, they're not bad.You will finish this game in ~1 hour, however there has been an update that has included several different modes since it's release - such as survival mode (waves). All-in-all it's a well presented, cheeky tribute to the games of old with a somewhat modern twist.			"

												Admittedly this is a reluctant Recommendation, if only because it costs next to nothing usually, especially when on sale.Dead Pixels embraces the campiness I love, but mostly in its presentation and music choice, the game itself balances a line between zombie sim and arcade shooter. The sim aspect is simplified but can feel heavy starting out while the arcade shooter aspect kick in late game if you play your cards right. But that's really what this game has going against it. It's a slow crawl to the point where you have enough ammuntion that you can go wild and actually actively fight your zombie foes, otherwise you're conserving ammuntion and running away from loads of fights. Oh, and going hog wild at the beginning is the quickest way to screw you over for later. Choose your fights.It's just not interesting, unique, or terribly fun until you sit down and spend some time with it. After that, as if you're filling some sort of play time quota, the game becomes quite hectic and entertaining. So if you're interested, I'd wait until it goes on sale. If the sequel plays up the arcade shooter elements more (because it's looking a lot better so far) and plays with the difficulty to match it, you might have a fun retro-esque game on your hands. Right now it's just... not.			"

												This is a game that is worth less than $1.00, sure its fun bt its one of those gamees that made for moblie devices ( a game that you play if you have nothing else to do) the only problem it has is the fact that you cant play online multiplayer but you can play local with a controler. overall its a simple arcade shooter which you play if you have nothing else to do			"

												I must admit I am tiring of the retrospective eighties-style 8 bit games. They were niche when introduced, but are becoming quite stale. Dead Pixels for some reason is not stale, and in fact ties in the 'retro' feeling quite well. There are many hours of gameplay here with various weapons, enemies, levels and game modes to justify the purchasing price. The game plays fairly well (I used an Xbox 360 controller) and is good for long and short plays. I'm looking foraward to the sequel.7/10			"

												Solid 8 bit fun here.This is an 8 bit style zombie/survival game. As you progress through the streets towards your salvation/rescue you will encounter different types of zombies with different abilities. Makes for challenging and exciting game play. Game offers multiple difficulty levels, but the difficulty seems to affect the distance you have to run to get to the target, didn't seem to affect zombie density or zombie difficulty.If you're a bibi-kun like I am, this is a zombie game you can enjoy because there's less emphasis on horror.I play on windows 8 with a microsoft controller and did not have any issues installing or running the game.

												Like video games that involve any kind of combat? GET THIS GAME! This is one of the few games in a long time that has had zombies that ive enjoyed, and that is saying a lot. You can tell the devs really loved zombie movies and poured thier heart and souls into it. Why do i say that the devs loved zombie movies? there are so many references to zombie and horror culture in general, its astounding! (not to mention, BOOMSTICK!!!!) There have been so many games that try and feel high grade even with a shoestring budget, and this is one of the few that genuinely got it right.Just be warned, the game is extremely difficult and ammo is sometimes scarce when you need it most. Other than that and a few instances where the AI seemed th become superhuman and block me in, I have nearly no complaints!I rate 1968/BOOMSTICK!!! Great game and i would definitely pick up no matter if its on sale or not!			"

												A really simple, but highly addictive Zombie shoot-em-up with some nice RPG elements. I just beat the game on normal mode for the standard story mode and I loved every moment of it (2.7hrs). It was nice to be able to invest in health and speed among other things instead of just equipment and it made a huge difference in the gameplay. There are a few different types of weapons, but I would have liked to see more. The zombies start off basic and you are gradually introduced to harder and harder types. I melee'd the crap out of most of them just to save ammo and money, but ended the game with way too much of both. I guess that's just the hoarder in me. I found that I didn't use a lot of the throwable weapons, but I did enjoy their effects when I did. I highly recommend this game for a few hours of fun if you have that itch to annhilate zombies. I wish I had someone to coop with!9/10 - Wonderful in nearly every way, especially for the price. Several game modes will have me coming back. The addtion of coop is great! Must play for any zombie lover!			"

												Player review 9/10I bought this game awhile back, when searching for a couch co op game to play with my wife. I downloaded it and booted it up. It is based on the ""GRIND HOUSE"" movies theme, and has awsome style and soundtrack. If you love old school games this game has done an amazing job at pulling off the feel. GREAT JOB, for making such an awsome game, the reason why it didnt get a 10/10 :) it left me wanting MORE, MORE, MORE, lol It has 3 awsome play modes, and they are great in their own way! but with such an awsome game i wish it had DLC or something. More chapters and expantions. I am so looking forward to dead pixels 2!!!! Wonderfull game			"

												Dead Pixels is a side scrolling (Double Dragon style) zombie action/survival game. I really enjoyed this one! The game is fast paced and satisfying to play, there is a good level of progression and decent customization. As you move through the levels, you can enter buildings to loot them as well as find others to trade with. Money is spent on either guns/ammo/grenades etc, or on character upgrades (HP, speed, carry weight, etc). There is a good level of challenge in the game as I did find myself dead a number of times, and most of the time it seemed fair :) There were minor clipping issues at times where I seemed to get ""stuck"" in the environment, but I would say only a few times over an entire playthrough. Overall, I had of fun and would recommend it!			"

												This game just makes me laugh honestly, I've only played it solo so far and I must say it is quite fun. It's a nice time killer game. However, it takes time to complete...soooo you usually lose track of time...and possibly burn your pizza.... anywho, the game has catchy music and also really prompts you to beat it in different ways. At first you play it ""normally"", whatever that may be. But I later tried spending all my money to increase my speed, bargaining and strength skills so that I can collect a bunch, sell it for more, increase my running to insane levels, then try to beat the whole game by out running all the zombies. I'm going to try and hook up with some friends on this one, but so far I enjoy it a lot.			"

												Virtually done with the game after 4 hours of playing. The lack of mini-bosses/bosses turns the entire experience into one ""samey"" morass. There's really zero incentive to actually kill zombies with the limits of ammo, and instead you're encouraged to focus on moving right while avoiding as many zombies as possible.It's OKay but the content is not varied enough. The price is definitely right if you're looking for something brainless and simple to kill a few hours.			"

												Dead Pixels is a well made 8-Bit shooter that involves classic side scrolling action in a zombie survival setting. You'll find yourself bartering with survivors as you battle hordes of various zombies and make your way through a ruined city. If you enjoy casual action games, that involve some strategy, you'll be sure to like this game.			"

YouTube™ Video: Cheap PC Games: Dead Pixels Review

			http://deadpixelsthegame.com/ - here you can find the soundtrack http://store.steampowered.com/app/222980/ http://www.greenmangaming.com/s/bg/en/pc/games/indie/dead-pixels/ Follow me on Twitter:...		

Dead Pixels is side-scroller shooter, with basic rpg system, where you are killing a lot of zombies and you have to get through 20 levels to get to safety. A simple and fun game, where you don't have a ton of different mechanics, just run and gun.It a 2D game with pixel graphics, so you wont't too many video options. But what surprise me here is the sheer number of controllers you can use – xbox 360, ps3 or whatever you have and also you can rebind all the keys. This feature have to be in every game. And also you can play with mouse and keyboard.Next is gameplay. Basically you go from left to right, through 20 streets (levels) in the city, finding or buying new gear and blasting zombies. No complicated story, no crafting, just pure fun. I like simple games like this. You have standard weapon arsenal – pistols, shotguns, rifles,assault rifles and flamethrower. Visually they are the same, but there stas are different. The good news is, when you look up a weapon you immediately see if it's better from what you have. One stat catches the eye – Penetration. This shows if the bullet will pass through enemy and hit the standing one behind him. Larger the stat more zombies will be hit. It is awesome to gather a group of enemies and blast them. While walking through the streets you will search abandon buildings for bullets, weapons and other usefull and useless stuff. Everything you don't need you will sell it in the shops. There also you can save your game, buy upgrades, weapons, bullets and other items (i'll be writing about them  later). The upgrades are standard – health, melee, luck, bargain, running speed, strength and weapon damage. And money is need it in the shops. How do you acquire them? By collecting coins from dead zombies and from selling useless stuff. I mentioned other items above and they are several types of granades, flares, molotov, anti-tank mine and others. There are also some passive things like jar of ooze (zombies can't detect you, until the shooting start), adrenaline (you move fast), my favourite fireworks – use the and all zombies freeze and you have a chance to kill them. There are few other items, but you will see them yourself. Two things to keep in mind. The first is you can overweight, you can carry everything. This mean you will be very slow and this could be disastrous. The second is zombies respawn and the ammo is never enough, so don't waste too much time in a level. And when you are out of bullets you have two options – poke the zombies to death or run past them. Sometimes when searching empty building, alarm will go off and it will attract a lot of zombies and heated up the scene. The zenemies you face are generic. Slow zombie, fast zombie, spitting zombie, some are easy to kill, others take few shots more. My biggest disappointment is the lack of boss battles. Come on, how could you not include at least final boss? Such a shame.The sound design is good. Zombies are making zombie noises, guns sound different, but the biggest star here is the music – it's amazing and it's free !!! Outstanding metal soundtrack, that never get old during my hole time with the game.There are two modes beside the main campain – The Last Stand: stay alive as long as you can and Solution. Here you choose between several premade characters with different stats and you can't upgrade them. You can acquire weapons, ammo and others by finding them or by calling for support on a radio. When you use the radio you are buying from the military and they drop supply crate when you are ready. But you have limited calls, so choose wisely. I played The Last Stand and Solution just to get impressions of them. All three modes have co-op, but it's local only.Sometimes you just need light and fun game. Dead Pixels is that and it have a lot of content for the price. Even if you play only the campaign, it's still worth buying. So the game offers a lot of content, amazing music, nice variety of weapons and items, nice pixel graphics, but it's lacking of online co-op and boss battles. I definitely recommend it.			"

												This is an interesting specimen. Sure, zombie games are dime-a-dozen at this point and at first glance this'd seem like a side-scrolling ripoff of any other modern zombie survival game like DayZ or Left 4 Dead. It's rather different. It blends certain RPG elements with a myriad of weapons and a beat-em-up map layout.The object of the game is to cross several streets littered with the walking dead in order to reach the survivors after a zombie epidemic plagues the city. Along the way you can loot buildings, trade supplies and save at shops, and, of course, kill the undead. The enemy variety is neat too. You get several different classes of zombies with different amounts of health, damage outputs, and attack styles. For the most part you get ones that walk towards you and attack. Eventually you reach spitter-like enemies that fire green globs. Considering each direct hit takes away 20 hitpoints (You start out with 200), I'd suggest dodging those. You also have a couple zombie bosses.Overall it's a fun game to burn time on. You have different gamemodes and if you have friends around you can join up on LAN and fight zombies together. Although online capability would really be the best over anything. So, if you have a few dollars to spend, I'd recommend picking this little gem up.			"

												Reminds me of an 8-bit version of Left 4 Dead if it were to have existed when I was a kid. Good fun! You soon realize you can't go around killing everything in sight and require a bit of planning. Most importantly, remember to SAVE. Don't know how many times I've died and had to respawn to a farther point.  Still brings back memories of a time when games were comprised of simple pixels that can steal plenty of free time.

												Any game that costs only a couple dollars and can keep a gamer occupied for 25+ hours is a steal. I know that the whole zombie media obsession can be annoying, and if that's a real problem for you, don't buy this game. It is comedic, it is entertaining, but at its heart, Dead Pixels is a zombie game. The retro-style action is engaging, and the wide range of difficulties keep it interesting after the four or so campagins have been completed. Buy the game: support a good indie develpoer while enjoying a fun casual game.			"

The addition to two more modes, brings in great replay value for the recurring gamer. A chiptune, metal soundtrack drives you to the streets in multiple level difficulties and local co-op. Many things to achieve and unlock to push you to the limits to completionist status. A very nice addition to the 8-bit indie genre with lots to see, do and kill.

												Rating: 4/10Summary:  Forget-able.  One of the few games I've ever regretted having in my steam library.  Game play: The overall game concept isn't terrible.  However, it's nothing new.  Pixelated style combined with a side scrolling shooter in a zombie apocalypse.  The resources are relatively scarce and the replayability seems to largely come from the fact that the odds are VERY stacked against you.  Completing this game would be an accomplishment both on Steam and as a testament to your patience. Setting: If you saw the store page you're more than aware that the game setting is not novel.  However,  I was hoping for the game to take itself less seriously as the game play implied that this would be a pixelated grindhouse film.  I don't know about you, but I can't take a pixelated grindhouse game seriously. The style: The grindhouse style ""cinematography"" takes about 10 minutes to get old.  The wandering line on the screen in the cut scenes is also in the game play along with some other fabricated anomalies meant to reflect the grindhouse film references.  The inclusion of an obscure copy of ""Romanza"" in EVERY shop seeks to destroy an otherwise elegant piece of music by placing it in a completely non-sensical setting.  At the exact same time, anyone without a knowledge of this classical piece of music will question the inclusion of a heavily Spanish-themed song in a zombie apocalypse.  The overworld music is redundant and aggressive but that's expected and honestly, it's about the only thing that refreshingly reflected the generic nostalgia that the imagery promises.			"

												To be truthful Dead Pixels is a time killer... but a bloody good one at that!!! Blow zombies brains out with up to 4 people on one system (Gamepads required for co-op). The game is quick, zappy and has a great 8 bit arcade system feel with hordes and hordes of zombies and an arsenal of guns theres no way not to have fun.

												As an indie game fan AND as a fan of zombie based games, this title is a must. You can't go wrong either way! With it's low price and the title's unlimited replayability, this was well invested. With it's grindhouse-esque intro and visuals, it's simplistic controls, it's open playability, a 8-bit retro-ness, it's simulation structure and the possible hours of fun you could have, this title gets a solid 10/10 for the Zindie (zombie indie haha) genre. Good job guys! Looking forward to ""Dead Pixels II: Straight to Video"" in 2014!			"

												Every game needs zombies, apparently.  Even a 8-bit two dollar game.  I give credit where it's due though, this game is possibly the best investment i've made in a while.  With a virtually unbeatable price, local co-op, different game modes, unlockables, achievements, tons of different classic guns, various items, different kinds of zombies, and upgradeable attributes, this game is a must try.  Admit it, the price is too good to ignore.			"

												Dead Pixels is a well made 8-Bit shooter that involves classic side scrolling action in a zombie survival setting. You'll find yourself bartering with survivors as you battle hordes of various zombies and make your way through a ruined city.

												+ Many types of zombies and occasional bosses+ Many types of weapons with different mechanics, different ammo types, and different effects+ Many types of grenades with various effects+ Many types of items with interesting uses, like fireworks which gets the zombies looking up at the sky drooling+ Looting system which finances your ""war effort""+/- I played this game solely single-player, so I can't comment on co-op and how fun it is+/- I played both scenarios on ""Normal"" difficulty but ""Normal"" is too easy. I'd recommend choosing Hard or Hardest.+/- The game is quite short (just a couple of hours) but when you consider the availability of co-op, survival modes, and (most importantly) the price, it's quite worth it.- The sound effects are a little bit lacking, there is not much diversity. Also, there is a big jump in volume when a horde spawns, so be prepared. "

It reminds you heavily of Tarantino's movies (Planet Terror) mixed with some old school graphics. Pretty basic, complete the set amount of streets while fighting zombies along the way looting stores to buy ammo, guns, upgrades etc. Fight some bosses and kill zombies to some great tunes.

												The game has a pretty good replaybility and it is a 8-bit styled arcade game.STORY (8/10):There are multiple stories that lies within this game and it really doesn't have one clear storyline that defines Dead Pixels. Although it has the same old story that you normally would see within a zombie movie. ART/MUSIC (8/10):The art is a simple 8-bit style. The art gives this game a vintage or retro feel to it. Not only that, the developers also added some effects and styles that you'll remember from a 1980's horror movie. The music is pretty good. My favorite tune is the one that plays in the title screen before entering the main menu. The song was a great rock song.GAMEPLAY (9/10):The game is really simple and easy to pick up as well. I played it on my keyboard and it was pretty easy to play. There are different difficulties and it will define your experience when you choose the difficulty. Plus, the game has multiple game modes which makes each experiences different. The main game mode has this economic system and an upgrade system that makes the game fun in exploration and powering up. As for ""The Solution"", it limits players on their items and such.TOTAL SCORE - (8.5/10)My Let's Play of the Game -

												Dead Pixels is a fun, yet short experience. As a solo game you can probably crank it out in about 4-5 hours but the fun I found in it was replaying it repeatedly with friends. It's a unique side scrolling shooter with a great managment system and a large variety of weapons and items. The harder levels really are determined by your skill and prefered weapon types and every death feels very fair. You won't find yourself dying an incredibly amount especially with friends. As a bonus, there is an alturnative ""Survival"" mode that allows you and your friends to survive in a mall for as many rounds as possible. Dead Pixels is totally worth the price and I would reccommend this title to anyone.			"

Dead Pixels is side-scroller shooter, with basic rpg system, where you are killing a lot of zombies and you have to get through 20 levels to get to safety. A simple and fun game, where you don't have a ton of different mechanics, just run and gun.It a 2D game with pixel graphics, so you wont't too many video options. But what surprise me here is the sheer number of controllers you can use – xbox 360, ps3 or whatever you have and also you can rebind all the keys. This feature have to be in every game. And also you can play with mouse and keyboard.Next is gameplay. Basically you go from left to right, through 20 streets (levels) in the city, finding or buying new gear and blasting zombies. No complicated story, no crafting, just pure fun. I like simple games like this. You have standard weapon arsenal – pistols, shotguns, rifles,assault rifles and flamethrower. Visually they are the same, but there stas are different. The good news is, when you look up a weapon you immediately see if it's better from what you have. One stat catches the eye – Penetration. This shows if the bullet will pass through enemy and hit the standing one behind him. Larger the stat more zombies will be hit. It is awesome to gather a group of enemies and blast them. While walking through the streets you will search abandon buildings for bullets, weapons and other usefull and useless stuff. Everything you don't need you will sell it in the shops. There also you can save your game, buy upgrades, weapons, bullets and other items (i'll be writing about them  later). The upgrades are standard – health, melee, luck, bargain, running speed, strength and weapon damage. And money is need it in the shops. How do you acquire them? By collecting coins from dead zombies and from selling useless stuff. I mentioned other items above and they are several types of granades, flares, molotov, anti-tank mine and others. There are also some passive things like jar of ooze (zombies can't detect you, until the shooting start), adrenaline (you move fast), my favourite fireworks – use the and all zombies freeze and you have a chance to kill them. There are few other items, but you will see them yourself. Two things to keep in mind. The first is you can overweight, you can carry everything. This mean you will be very slow and this could be disastrous. The second is zombies respawn and the ammo is never enough, so don't waste too much time in a level. And when you are out of bullets you have two options – poke the zombies to death or run past them. Sometimes when searching empty building, alarm will go off and it will attract a lot of zombies and heated up the scene. The zenemies you face are generic. Slow zombie, fast zombie, spitting zombie, some are easy to kill, others take few shots more. My biggest disappointment is the lack of boss battles. Come on, how could you not include at least final boss? Such a shame.The sound design is good. Zombies are making zombie noises, guns sound different, but the biggest star here is the music – it's amazing and it's free !!! Outstanding metal soundtrack, that never get old during my hole time with the game.There are two modes beside the main campain – The Last Stand: stay alive as long as you can and Solution. Here you choose between several premade characters with different stats and you can't upgrade them. You can acquire weapons, ammo and others by finding them or by calling for support on a radio. When you use the radio you are buying from the military and they drop supply crate when you are ready. But you have limited calls, so choose wisely. I played The Last Stand and Solution just to get impressions of them. All three modes have co-op, but it's local only.Sometimes you just need light and fun game. Dead Pixels is that and it have a lot of content for the price. Even if you play only the campaign, it's still worth buying. So the game offers a lot of content, amazing music, nice variety of weapons and items, nice pixel graphics, but it's lacking of online co-op and boss battles. I definitely recommend it.			"

												I may be enjoying this a bit too much. This game is simple, tons of fun, and addictive. Everything seems to be a reference to a prominent survival/horror title, or zombie flick. Only gotten through the first two scenarios so far, but It's fairly quick paced, zombie slaying, run like hell fun. It's inexpensive, and worth more than the cost of admission. Thumbs up here.			"

												Don't let the price or the graphics put you down on this one.  If you like retro look (and frankly, if you are in your 30-40s, then you are likely to dig that stuff, like I do), zombies, and survival sims, then you are in for a nice surprise.The soundtrack is also very nice.The menu and launcher have a bit more attention than your usual game in that price range.I won't waste any more of my time or yours, just go buy it.  In any case, its worth barely more than a coffee, and there is so much more to like than a cup of coffee :)  Highly recommended.			"

												I got this on a great deal (less than a dollar) and it was certainly worth it. I didn't understand the game at first, but once I picked it up it was a fun challenge. It's by no means elegant or deep, but it is fun. At first I thought I had to kill all the zombies, but then I realized that the real strategy to the game was much more complex. The supplies are scarce, including weapons, ammo, and medkits. You have to search through houses, buy and sell stuff to merchants, upgrade your stats, and strategically move through each section of the levels while conserving as much of your supplies as you can before reaching the next merchant. Once you run out of ammo it's pretty difficult in the later levels, so build up ammo as soon as possible and avoid wasting it all to kill only a few zombies. In the later levels there are waayyy more zombies than you can possibly hope to kill, so the real strategy becomes maneuvering between waves while shooting down hordes with your machine gun or shotgun, killing many at once in order to get lots of money without using up too much ammo. It's a super fun game! Pick it up when it's on sale!			"

You soon realize you can't go around killing everything in sight and require a bit of planning. Most importantly, remember to SAVE. Don't know how many times I've died and had to respawn to a farther point.  Still brings back memories of a time when games were comprised of simple pixels that can steal plenty of free time.

												It's fun when you're bored and want to just shoot zombies. The game is an arcade side scrolling zombies survival game... You only have a few bullets at your disposal, and you don't want to end up having to use the melee to kill zombies. I found myself picking my shots throughout the adventure into zombie territory, watching out for special zombie types that would warrant a bullet to the head vs running away(as I comonly did). There is a lot of strategy involved in such a simplistic game, probably because much of the gameplay is left to the player's discretion. I think the best way to enjoy this game is to pick an achievement and go after it, especially if you have a friend who can enjoy a co-op game with you. I totally recommend this game as it isn't too expensive, and offers a decent amount of content.			"

												+ Many types of zombies and occasional bosses+ Many types of weapons with different mechanics, different ammo types, and different effects+ Many types of grenades with various effects+ Many types of items with interesting uses, like fireworks which gets the zombies looking up at the sky drooling+ Looting system which finances your ""war effort""+/- I played this game solely single-player, so I can't comment on co-op and how fun it is+/- I played both scenarios on ""Normal"" difficulty but ""Normal"" is too easy. I'd recommend choosing Hard or Hardest.+/- The game is quite short (just a couple of hours) but when you consider the availability of co-op, survival modes, and (most importantly) the price, it's quite worth it.- The sound effects are a little bit lacking, there is not much diversity. Also, there is a big jump in volume when a horde spawns, so be prepared. "

												A 2D-shoot-em-up involving zombies in a desolate city you say?Honestly, for how crude the graphics may seem, this is actually a decent coop game for the PC. Sure it isn't very advanced looking, but the gameplay is relatively decent for what it's worth, and the coop system is actually quite awesome considering the simplicity of the game. I can only recommend this game if you have people to play with, otherwise it gets a little stale going solo, it gets absolutely crazy towards the end with multiple players and I had a lot of fun with it.

												The premise of Dead Pixels is simple. Your pixel hero runs across the screen killing zombies until he clears all the screens. Graphics and Sound are basic but fit the games style as a homage to the 8/16-bit eras. It's also full of of great references, mostly to Resident Evil but there a few other horror references tucked away (such as Ash's boomstick from Evil Dead). In between all the zombie shooting and side scrolling there is the opportunity to visit shops (With bizzarely calm shop keepers in them. There are hundreds of zombies outside guys, runaway!) In these shops you can upgrade abilities, weapons or ammunition. This does add some much needed depth and replay value to the game as it lets you change the way you play. In my case I stocked up on med packs, upgraded my health and speed and killed zombies only when necessarily. When I first started I was trying to kill everything but I soon realised what a drain on ammo this was! Judging from other playthroughs I've seen other people didn't let that put them off, buying loads of weapons and ammo and upgrading their combat abilities in order to massacre hundreds of zombies.Definitely worth a buy considering its regularly available for about the price of a Freddo, and you're guaranteed at least 20 minutes more fun out of Dead Pixels.http://jamesvssteam.blogspot.co.uk/ "

												Rating: 4/10Summary:  Forget-able.  One of the few games I've ever regretted having in my steam library.  Game play: The overall game concept isn't terrible.  However, it's nothing new.  Pixelated style combined with a side scrolling shooter in a zombie apocalypse.  The resources are relatively scarce and the replayability seems to largely come from the fact that the odds are VERY stacked against you.  Completing this game would be an accomplishment both on Steam and as a testament to your patience. Setting: If you saw the store page you're more than aware that the game setting is not novel.  However,  I was hoping for the game to take itself less seriously as the game play implied that this would be a pixelated grindhouse film.  I don't know about you, but I can't take a pixelated grindhouse game seriously. The style: The grindhouse style ""cinematography"" takes about 10 minutes to get old.  The wandering line on the screen in the cut scenes is also in the game play along with some other fabricated anomalies meant to reflect the grindhouse film references.  The inclusion of an obscure copy of ""Romanza"" in EVERY shop seeks to destroy an otherwise elegant piece of music by placing it in a completely non-sensical setting.  At the exact same time, anyone without a knowledge of this classical piece of music will question the inclusion of a heavily Spanish-themed song in a zombie apocalypse.  The overworld music is redundant and aggressive but that's expected and honestly, it's about the only thing that refreshingly reflected the generic nostalgia that the imagery promises.			"

												Don't let its deceptive graphics and limited game aspects bore you, THIS GAME IS ADDICTIVE. I love playing it, and it has 3 (maybe 4, I forgot :P) campaigns in it. Diffrent types of zombies, the weapons are fun to use (and named after resident evil protagonist ;3) and not to mention the aspect of survival, pick it up when you get the chance.			"

												It's a lot of fun, but a little more variety would be nice. I do like the fact that you have to hoard ammo, instead of mindlessly shoot like a typical oldschool shooting game. It lacks any sort of real melee weapons, so if you run out of bullets, you're screwed. You can kinda punch zombies, but it doesn't really do much. Reminds me of River City Randsom.			"

												I must say, ""Dead Pixels"" is an incredibly fun and addicting game.  It's a game I can jump into for a few minutes if I don't have a lot of time, though I usually find myself being sucked into longer sessions anyway.  The game features over a hundred weapons, grenades, and items, so you'll always have something new to look forward to.  The city randomly generates as well with every new game, bumping up the game's replayability quite a bit.  The $2.99 price tag is probably what appealed to me the most, and I can safely say that you're getting a good deal if you decide to purchase this game.  If you're looking for some mindless, 8-bit zombie slaying fun, then look no further than ""Dead Pixels.""

												Great way to get your zombie killing fix. This game is what get if you mixed the street-brawling world of River City Ransom (NES) and the apocalypic zombie-infested world of Left 4 Dead.Game play is smooth and simple. Loot stores, kill zombies in the streets, and visit the trader. Over time new zombie types will appear and the difficulty of the game increases as you get closer and closer to your final destination. Awesome game and can't wait for the sequel.			"
