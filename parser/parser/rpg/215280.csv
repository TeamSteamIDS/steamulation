												It's not a game for everyone. Maybe you'll like it, maybe you won't. That depends on what makes a game good for you.It has quite some flaws. The UI is made with flash, runs badly and doesn't give you all the features you'd want. The shaders aren't very optimized. There are bugs. If you're used to have the whole story presented to you, you'll find the story slow and boring.So why would you like this game, like I do?If you're ready to spend some time in its world. And by that, I don't mean ""to play"", I mean ""to look around, read the lore, and let the immersion build around you"". This game doesn't do everything for you. It expects you to take a certain part in exploring it and make your own conclusions. If you're ready to take that part, by reading, researching, learning, and maybe continuing to think about it when not playing, you will get an immersive experience in a world filled with horror stories, spooky places, interesting people and secrets like few other games have. Sometimes, it's just more like reading a good book than playing a good game.In addition, the character development system is or is not going to make you happy. If you think that wow has what gets you there, you maybe won't become friends with tsw's system. It has no classes, almost no levels and wants you to rethink your whole build and gear every now and then.But that just fits to the whole concept of a story-rich world. Your character won't develop on a given line, you can, at any time, choose the next direction your character goes. This, and the fact that the look of your character is in no way connected to your play stlyle (or class, since there are none), gives you the possibilty to use your toon as a good roleplaying character. Something that Funcom supports in multiple ways, including places in the world that have no use for quests, but for roleplaying only.So when people tell you about the rich story, they don't mean your character's personal story that is told to you, they mean a world filled with lore, tiny details and story pieces that you can explore bit by bit in order to find out more about it.So yes, if you want a story directly thrown at you, an mmo with excellently balanced classes or a completely bugfree AAA experience, you probably won't like this game.But if you sometimes enjoy a good book, have an imagination that you can use, or like a progression system that sometimes takes roleplaying over balancing, you have found a gem here. One that allows you to immerse in an amazing, spooky world - if you are ready to take exploring the story into your own hands.			"

												As a player of this game for almost two years, I feel I should weigh in with a review for any new players looking at TSW as an MMO to jump into. While I highly recommend it, an MMO can be incredibly polarising, and TSW has it's share of polarising features both for better and worse.The game boasts a unique world, you literally will not find another game brimming with the story beats and character that this game has. It's in the environment, incidental dialogue and monsters you come across. It boasts an interesting story about 3 factions, and how each faction is working in their own ways to guard and prepare for the coming filth (and that which is already here). All the while playing off against each other because after all, they have their own agendas.The gameplay is fun an interesting, run and cast system so that you are usually always moving. The range of skills and weaponry means that you can cultivate a character to your whim and the unlimited level cap (none, in theory) means you can essentially have a character that can do whatever you'd like it to do. An area calls for you to be a bit tankier? Done. A dungeon requires you to fulfil a healer role? Done. This hammers home the end-game need to build specialised builds that are constantly trying to improve through either signets, augments, or raid tier upgrades (if that's your thing).If end game content isn't your thing, and you want to see the rich story through the Solomon Islands, to Egypt and then lastly Transylvania. You don't need to grind any end game gear at all. You can enjoy the story alone, or with friends and can decide at any point if you'd like to engage in a dungeon. Thankfully, the tier levelled dungeons means that there are different difficulty levels of each dungeon.The game has a number of well thought out systems that sound brilliant on paper, that sadly are implemented poorly. Which is to be expected of Funcom (Ever the dreamers, never the achievers). The party finder system usually leads to more confusion that it does active parties opting for the tried and true ""LFG"" posts in general chat.The development cycle is notoriously slow, as they are running on a small staff the updates or ""issues"" as they name them, usually take longer than anticipated. Originally, they had a 1 issue a month plan, after falling behind that on numerous occasions, they have abandoned that for a more vague ""when it's ready"". Usually coinciding with a ""State-of-the-game"" update from Joel Bylos (Game Director).The game recently has started to receive a huge boost in player base (no doubt the steam sales having a hand in this). New players I hadn't seen before are now reaching the end-game content, which always helps an MMO to remain fresh and current. The community is, for the most part; friendly, vibrant and willing to assist new players. Whether that's communicating answers for questions, or helping with dungeons so that you learn. Bare in mind though: Like most things, if you want to be carried through the game, expect more stick than carrot with players.Overall, I would suggest this game to players disenfranchised by your typical high fantasy setting we've come to expect from the MMO scene. It a fresh and deserved game in the MMO scene and one that is highly worth trying, who knows, you may just find yourself enjoying it just as much as the rest of us.			"

												Two things I barely ever do: 1.) Play M.M.O. R.P.G.'s.2.) Write reviews on steam.This game has forced me to try both :D. Let's start with pros/cons.----PROS:Storyline-Vast universe filled with dozens of worlds, and thousands of replayable quests.-Constent flow of new players, that way no one world feels too desolate/over-populated. -Quests. Are.. EVERYWHERE. Everything from a NPC's handing them out at your local city to stumbling across a corpse with a treasure-map in the middle of the road. Very non-linear.-H.P. Lovecraft approved, atleast fan-approved :D (To see Kingsmouth in-game made my day)-Bits of scattered ""lore"" throughout the game clue you in about the history of certain landmarks and events that happen through-out The Secret World.-Has a LOT of pop-culture refrences. Eveything for popular movies to new video-games.-Cutscenes actually put your custom character into them!!! Badass. Real badass, bro.-There are plenty of cutscenes compared to MMOs like Guild Wars or World of Warcraft.Gameplay-You can either play the classic mouse-clicking way, or switch to over-the-shoulder 3rd-person aiming-view, OOOOOR zoom your camera all the way in and play in makeshift 1st-person :D.-Doesn't feel like any other RPG out there. Very fast-paced, doesn't have that 'grinding' feel.-Gameplay feels like a upgraded MMO version of ""Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines"".-Not typical lvling system. In fact, no ""levels"" what-so-ever, mearly distribution of skill points.-Hack-and-slash, killing hoards of monsters hasn't been this fun since Diablo.-Creatures vary from location to location, this game doesn't just color a creature a different color and make him harder, it's like they went through the entire Necronomicon in this game. -Great crafting system, strongest weapons/armor/items are crafted.-Great character customization, seemingly unlimited choices.-Playable alone if the servers ever die. (You'll have to be a high lvl to take on some missions.)-Not completely abandoned by devs.Funcom Points -NOT pay2win, not much stuff to buy with REAL money that you can't get in-game for free.-If for some reason you're lookin' to spend cash, they've got some great vanity stuff -If you want the vanity stuff, but don't have cash, there are promotions that might help.. ;)-If cash is not a issue for you, then take solace in knowing their prices are really cheap c:Performance-While the game IS old, the graphics are pretty decent, and are still being patched.-I has a: Radeon R9 280x GPU. And it runs like warm butter on ultra settings.Misc-Cool cartoony colors.-Friendly community.----CONS:Storyline-Sometimes you get a quest that is impossible to beat alone or at your current level (despite the quest claiming to be ""normal"" difficulty), bit of a buzz kill when you make it half-way then figure that out the hard way... by dying brutally and seriously out level'd :P.-Compared to other MMO games, it doesn't have as many active players as other titles.Gamplay-PVP seriously unbalanced. Like... whacky unbalanced......I would spend atleast 50 hours playing co-op or alone before ever stepping in the PVP zones. (I've got 40 hours under my belt and still haven't even reached the PVP zones lol. Big game.)-Steep-ish learning curve. (Steep because so different from other games.)-Combat animation with some low-rank weapons can be repetative.-Defualt short-cut and keyboard layout can feel a bit cluncky.-Each issue past 8 is expensive... I reached Tokyo and now I need 29.99 to keep playing :/Funcom Points-They should have made their item market on steam. Would have been much easier transaction-wise. Then again, who can blaim them for not wanting to cut steam in? -The Item shop doesn't have good descriptions on some things. They don't mention stuff like: Uniforms don't show stuff like necklaces or gloves, est. Or anything labeled ""effects"" is used to the London Theatrics Company, yet that info is no-where to be found.Performance-40+ GB download.-This game will eat all your free time up. YUMYUMYUMYUM..... gone. XD (This may be a pro.)Misc-No steam achievements? But it has it owe achievements -_-...-At times, the voice acting can be a little corny :P....ONLY AT TIMES! And It fades away with the awesome story.-OVERALL FIRST IMPRESSION:The storyline strokes your ego enough to make you feel individually important in a world with so many players, while at the same moment stressing the importance of teamwork, breaking the ice for interactions between new-comers and vets.Even though you can do the lone-wolf thing and beat the majority of missions alone, it's easier and more fun putting a group together to quest with, even if it's a random passer-by who just happens to be on the same page as you. Many vet players are kind enough to let you tag along on quests if they've got a free space, and you'll always find someone willing to help you whether it be directions, healing, or back-up. -LONG TERM IMPRESSIONWill update the more I play, but in all honesty, not seeing much negative aspects. So, if you're torn between the fence, buy in confidence, tis' a great game :D.P.S. To all new players! Don't forget to renew the free stuff they give you at thesecretworld.com, and check out the promotions they do such as; finish 30 missions get 1200 funcom points free.Recommended Guides for Starters.-http://www.tswdb.com/miscellaneous/the-secret-world-beginner-guide/-http://yokaiblog.wikidot.com/guides:craft-patterns#toc23 "

												When you play this MMO, as you most assuredly should do, it will serve you to remember it is not World of Warcraft. It is not Rift, or Champions Online, neither Age of Conan, nor Star Wars: The Old Republic. It is not for end-gamers or raiders, grinders or power-levelers, PVPers or dungeon runners.Rather, it is The Longest Journey and Dreamfall, Broken Sword and Syberia, Gabriel Knight and I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream. It is for seekers and journeymen, detectives and discoverers; it is for explorers, and it is for adventurers.So is The Secret World a game you will enjoy? Familiar MMORPG trappings are apparent; there are definite systems and mechanics at play that one could use to thusly label this game, but close examination quickly reveals this style of MMO is not one that will appeal to a mass market.Beyond the limited character customisation options, the somewhat hasty justification of your avatar’s situation and subsequent induction to their chosen faction, lies an entire parallel universe to be explored. The scene set is present day, with the twist that here in The Secret World, all conspiracies, myths, and legends are true.The Secret World delivers a definite sensation that there is nothing here that does not exist through explicit design, be it the name of a town or the colour of the flowers planted in someone’s front yard. It feels as though every constituent is grounded and has a weighty history attached, as though understanding the lore is but an Internet-search away.The mission structure is unlike any you will have encountered before. There are several types of mission, and a small limit on the number of each that can be active at any time. The translation of this is that one cannot race wantonly through hub areas, collecting missions with abandon, to turn-in simultaneously for experience rewards broaching hedonistic quantities.Neither can missions be discarded once acquired, and though it is possible to pause them to resume later, it’s not an efficient method of churning through content. Of course Funcom doesn’t actually want you to be churning at all, but to be instead involved in your actions, and to see missions through their multiple tiers and increasing difficulties to their satisfying conclusions.Some missions require a rethink of your entire MMO approach to date, and this time I can provide an example. An escort mission of sorts mandated the continued living status of my accompanying NPC. After failing twice, I resolved to level a bit and come back later, until I remembered there are, in fact, no levels.Experience does still accumulate, but its effect is to unlock more skills and abilities. True, some of these are more powerful, but it doesn’t have the same impact as levelling in other games.Tactical skill-based combat is what's important.The skill wheel takes a while to get your head around, but basically you can choose from melee weapons (sword, hammers, and fists), firearms (pistol, shotgun, and assault rifles) and magic (chaos, blood, and elemental). Each skill has subsequent layers to unlock. You are not tied to any one skill; in fact, you can effectively have two skill ""trees"" selected at one time - a Blood Mage wielding a Shotgun, for instance. You can go heavy on one skill and unlock deeper and more complex skills or you can choose to pick a scattering of each.Visual information in The Secret World is more important than it would be in other MMOs. Clues for quests are scattered about everywhere. Being able to read your environment, not just your powers bar, is a skill to be mastered in this game.Beyond the informational side of things, the general art style and attention to detail just completely suck you in.  Sweeping vistas are easy to find if you go high enough, but it's on the ground that you feel the setting.  Mist-shrouded woods, caves illuminated by phosphorescent mushrooms or the occasional lantern, burning deserts, and seashores all have a heft to them visually, even when they're overrun by nightmarish creatures that by turns are fascinating and repulsive at the same time.As with the visual, so with the audio. Sound cues are always important, particularly if you've drawn aggro from a mob, but it's the use of sound in quests and puzzles that make it a step above the norm for MMOs.  Finding the signal in static, the right tones to unlock a door, even tracing a siren's song back to its origin point, there's all manner of clever uses for sound in this game and some of them will get you killed in short order if you're not on the bounce. Equally impressive is the voice acting in the game. The storyline and main quests all have voice-overs for their introductions.There are a couple things I didn’t get into, such as the dungeons, but I never had the chance to go through a multi-person dungeon.However, I did hit a few single player dungeons and they weren’t all that bad solo.It's a blast to see an massively multiplayer online (MMO) role-playing game that doesn't go straight for the high heroic fantasy genre. Funcom has done an excellent job creating a world that is both relatable and mysterious for players to explore. The Secret World delivers an MMO experience that's distinctly different from its competitors, and it's likely going to remain the standard for future games in the horror/supernatural genre.			"

												This post is far too long. I'm very sorry. But I can't keep it short when I'm talking about something I like. And this game I do like definitly. First off: Almost all the negative review statements I read concerning this game are true. Period. This Game is insofar as it concerns the UI, graphical glitches, the inherent logic of development systematics you need to know to advance your character correctly or the combat mechanic in general highly unpolished.It falls very often short in giving you a wholehearted experience of a well thought out contemporary horror story. It is quite cheesy actually. Sometimes it's cheesy, sometimes just boring. Sometimes so confusing and overcomplex that you may sigh and just leave it alone.What are all the different stats for? I mean really for. As an advancing player I read through the forums. I do what veterans say is the best option but I just don't understand the mechanical processes of numbergenerating during combat until now. On the surface the stats are not only overly complicated but behind this not so complicated scenery lies no truely understandable mechanism which would show up after a few hours and let's you fine tune your characterbuild. At least I never got a comprehensive insight in the numerical processes which lead to the different combat outcomes.But: I'm not really into MMO's. Perhaps players who are used to this genre have a much better Intuition for the Interaction of stats in the Secret World. I can't judge this game in terms of being a good or not so good MMO.Because this is the only one I play. And I play it a lot.And I will tell you why:Two main reasons exist for me that make this game standout between a whole bunch of games I played in the last years and MMO's I tried to get into.The first one:A sometimes just amazingly cool feel ambiancewise. I said that the quests often are cheesy. Cheesy like some bad horrorstorypaperback from the trainstation's bookshop. Or sometimes worse actually.But on some ocassions I was really immersed in the dark, a bit - not disturbing - but confusing tone of the narrative which unfold. I could name a few quests I play over and over again. And I am absolutely not bored by playing them again. Somme MMO-Player's could say I am grinding... but if I'm grinding I can't say it feels like grinding. I'm looking forward to the nice cutscene I know to start after this boss battle, the beautifully arranged scenery of the abandoned Fair, or the appearance of a not so cliché character.The fascinating, gritty or disturbing atmosphere this games sometimes - only on rare ocassions - is able to create reminds me of the self forgetting process of reading contemporary psychoanalytical writings.Mark my words: It's definitely not the same, it shares only some strange layer of significance which is hidden behind the structure of the narrative form.There are few games in which I find such a thing. But the ending of the vanishing of Tyler Freeborn quest is such a moment. I'm not quite sure what's it all about, but it's coherent feel makes it worth my time.After I found this feeling in some quests even the shadow of this structural phenomenon reminds me of the cool moments I had in some other quests and makes the less well thought out and arranged levels of this game worthwhile for me.Second one:The Dungeons.I read in one review that this games dungeons have some classic feel to it. Like the old WoW Dungeons.I cannot say if this is true for I never played WoW. But I must admit that after I did my first (very newby stupid and surely - for my patrners - annoying) dungeon run I finally understood what this MMO stuff is all about. The groups which I was joining in this first period of getting known to playing an online game with foreign persons was such a remarkably stressful, chaotic and foremost optimistic experience for me that I instantly got hooked of playing a healer. These persons with which I was running - absolutely unexperienced in building and manouevering the quite responsible position of a healer - were just great, respect- and helpful individuals. I had the feeling they were about my age. Didn't take my constant failing too personally. Let me practice my skills and even gave me helpful advice and comments on how to become a better part of the TSW community. I liked this a lot.And I like it today. Everytime I play this game I look forward to doing a few dungeons with nice and relaxed people from all over the globe, and enjoying a few of my favorit quests. That's just a really good way for me to sometimes relax after work. I like this game and I hope you will like it too and I'm really sorry that I couldn't help and wrote such an enormous blah-blah post but it seems as if it had to be said.Thx for reading.			"

												UPDATE: I would Recommend getting Ultimate Edition from the store, which is significantly cheaper for the amount of DLC included. The DLC is just as great if not better than the main game.  I have also updated my Tips.Don't buy this game IF:Your gaming computer is more than a few years oldYou don't have over 40GB to spare for a single gameYou dislike MMOs that stray a bit far from World of Warcraft's now standardized blueprintYou prefer a more traditional fantasy setting (or to a lesser extent sci-fi) settingYou hate not having access to all of your skills simultaneouslyYou hate the idea of an MMO that doesn't constantly require player cooperationYou hate sitting through cutscenesYou love open world PvPDo buy this game IF: You want an MMO with a genuinely unique settingYou want an MMO with a wide variety of gameplay in its missionsYou want a deep skill building system (think closer to Guild Wars 1)You love to dive into the lore and backstory of a gameYou want an MMO with a cohesive, well-executed storylineYou want a solo-friendly MMOYou want a game that doesn't pressure you to play itYou don't want to pay a subscription feeBeginner TipsChoose a pair of weapons early and stick to it, preferably working towards a faction specific deckWhen talking to characters, keep clicking on a dialogue selection until it has a green checkmarkKeep an eye on the mission difficulty; you will want to avoid things marked Very Hard or DevastatingDon't pick fights with mobs in Lair areas by yourself, they are meant for experienced groups to tackleUPDATE:  Use the Group Finder (Shift+C) to help find people to do dungeons withUPDATE:  The custom chat communities Sanctuary and Noobmares can be helpful for learning the game and finding people to do group content with (use /chat join <channel> to join)UPDATE: Join the Event custom chat to keep an eye out for people starting world bosses and also holiday events.  ConclusionLooking for a game that would properly scratch the same itch that GW1 did (but its sequel did not), I took a chance on this game when it was on sale, and am glad that I did.  This is a game that shows a great deal of thoughtfulness, even if it was overshadowed by the three big MMOs that came out the same year.  If this is a game that sounds at all like something you would like to try, take the chance.			"

												I am going try to avoid saying what has already been said about the game and just share my experience.  Currently, I am undecided on whether I love the game or hate it.  There is so much potential and so many problems.  If the price is right for you, do try the game.  I suggest holding back on purchasing DLC (issues) and spending real-world money in the store until you have played in Transylvania and complete at least 10 matches in the PvP mini games.  If you still enjoy the game at the end of Transylvania then you will likely continue to enjoy it.On live chat, most players are polite and helpful.  Be aware, however, that The Secret World game can be very stressful and frustrating: even nice players are going to rant and rage on occasion.  There is a filter to keep the bad words at bay if one chooses.  A few nice words to someone having a bad day might help them feel less nasty.Simple graphic issues:  The recommended System Requirements are not set high enough.  One can play the game while meeting the requirements but there will be system lag that will make some missions difficult to complete.  Platforming within missions can challenge low graphic systems.  The graphics are beautifully done but they are demanding.Nearly all the missions, story missions, and side missions are good.  If you get stuck there is usually someone on the live chat that will help you out.  The greatest issue I discovered with missions is that some involve platforming or jumping from object to object.  This can be a problem if one has system lag or just isn’t good at jumping.  Sabotage missions have a greater instance of platforming and also involve jumping over traps.  The investigative missions have issues of their own if you want to just play a game.  There is an in-game browser for a reason.  One could spend hours researching for answers to puzzles on the internet rather than just playing the game.  (This can be resolved by asking for help or researching walkthroughs for the answers.)  The lock-out time for missions in Transylvania is about 60 hours, which leaves a player looking for something to do until the missions are cooled down.  There are issues (DLC) to keep end-gamers busy for a time.Issues 1 – 4 are included in the purchase.Issue 5 is a mystery story, someone went suspiciously missing.  Issue 6 is an adventure story, like Indiana Jones movies in a fashion.Issue 7 is a horror story where children are the victims.  This is not for everyone.Issue 8 is a grind…no real story.  In this issue one gains Augments that improves abilities. (AP costs are very high)Issue 9 is a back to where it all started story.  The AEGIS system is introduced and a story of chaos in Tokyo has begun. PvP has a few issues that make it difficult to enjoy every time.  There will be lag even on the best of hardware.  Sometimes the lag is show-stopping; sometimes it is more like an unexpected hiccough.  Sometimes the teams are not full; a faction can start with only one or two players rather than the total allowed.  If your faction does not have a full team at the start, winning a match is more difficult.  The PvP mini-games are often unbalanced: a team of high-end players can be matched against teams of new/lower level players.  There is an issue where players stand AFK in a match and don’t fight at all.  If you are a tolerant, even-tempered soul, PvP is still playable as even the losing team is rewarded for playing.  Funcom is working to resolve the issues in PvP but we might have to be tolerant for a time before it materializes.  Maybe a very long time.The concept of playing the way you want to play falls into the dirt on the second map (Egypt) and dies on the third map (Transylvania).  Some missions and dungeons, if you do not have the right build, cannot be completed.  Away from the dungeons and PvP, one can play with whatever build suits them in most PvE missions.  Even though most days I find something to dislike, I recommend trying this game.  Just hold back on spending too much real-world money until you get more past Egypt.			"

												Hands down THE most unique MMO on the market.  Once out of the starter area, the game grabs you and takes you on a wild ride thru the mysterious ""Secret World"".  With a terrifying atmosphere, this game pushes your brain to the limits with the quests and offers different ways to complete them.  (ie. Hacking computers, searching for solutions on the Internet, etc.)  With no levels to worry about and access to every facet of the power system to create your own playstyle, The Secret World offers a gaming experience that truely breaks the traditional mold.

												The Secret World is an anagram for Elect Herd Worst, a message about the false populism of democratic elections, but when you turn that into binary it's ""01100101011011000110010101100011011101000010000001101000011001010111001001100100001000000111011101101111011100100111001101110100"" which when you realize is actually a secret QR code scans out to a PO box in Indianapolis that contains the name of a monk who lives at the highest peak in Latveria and when you finally go to him and ask what the deep, dark secret of The Secret World is he says ""it's an MMORPG""			"

												If Morrowind and WoW had a baby, and then if an Epic Lovecraftian horror story had a baby with conspiracy theory, and then those two babies met and banged and shot out a Horror MMO with amazing playability, that would be this game. Simply put, it's brilliant. I'm disappointed that it took so long for me to get it.  The only thing that could possibly be better are the controls on a keyboard, other than that every single part is so NOT anything you would get in any other MMO. The Community is GREAT! There's always some one willing to help you out, and the population seems steady and dedicated. You'll either love it or hate it, but you'll FEEL something and that's always great! Either way you can get a 72 hour trial to try this game out, if you go and ask anyone in the discussion board. Then you can decide if you really like it, and that's pretty cool!			"

												there should be a complete edition soon including everything up to issue 15 - its already avail on Funcom site-not yet  on steam howeveri wouldnt recommend vanlla at this point unless one only wants to solo main quest -- which is several hundred hours btw. it lacks most of the current endgame,and upgrading  is not a cost effective option, so most end up rebuying the big version after a while.all in all game surely has some issues but overall content is huge and of great quality.I could easily say its one of  the best RPGs ever made.I won't go into a detailed review.I think the game is at least good enough to give the 10 day trial a go and shape your own opinion about TSW---see forums how to get it.Only thing i ll say about tsw content,is that before buying I was very sceptical about the setting - i mean illuminati, templars, starsigns and mumbo jumbo....seriously? not my cup of tea.But after playing, i realized the fact that TSW doesnt take that stuff  entirely seriously either and actually it balances satire with seriousness really really well.Anyway long story short and after playing for a while, I can now safely say its  my favorite RPG setting by far and away.

												Ate a bee. Became magical. Said ""screw magic."" Grabbed a shotgun. Went to hell. Got a hell shotgun. Found a boss, thought I killed it. Found out I didn't. It killed me. Turned into a ghost, and discovered a couple secrets. Fought octo-nipples. Fought Chtulu. Died fighting Chtulu. A lot. Fought my mother in law. Fought your mother in law. Got tired of my shotgun, and tried magic. Learned how to shoot fireballs. Become a fire weilding maniac. As a DPS, tanked through a dungeon. Got loot. Broke it, and made better loot. Got cussed out by some old Seoul lady. Spit on a Templar. Went to hell. (Again.) Found out the Illuminati is super powerful because it has a robot that learns from the internet. Had all powerful being ask for a high five, before realizing it had no hands, and then threatened to kill me like a 12 year playing COD. And I haven't even gotten to the good parts.			"

												It's the only MMO I've ever played, so I can't speak to its mechanics in comparison to genre standards. But, it's also the only MMO I've ever wanted to play. I'm mostly a solitary single-player game type of girl and TSW is real good for that.			"

												The Secret World so far has been an amazing immersive experiance, As you may have seen in other reviews this MMORPG isnt about combat or becoming the strongest character you can be. The games best features come from storytelling and immersion in a dark twisted modern-day world while letting the player go at their own pace and play how they want to.Combat: The combat itself is pretty generic tab-target, but using cone attacks (aka shotgun blasts) free this up a bit and make it more about kiting and dodging.Levelling/skills: As advertised the game has no character levels or class restrictions but you can only have up to 7 active and 7 passive skills set at any one time, aswell as a max of 2 weapons.Questing/Missions: The game only lets you hold up to 6 missions at any one given time, 1 story mission, 1 dungeon mission, 1 main mission and 3 side missions but these arent the old ""go kill x monster or gather x thing"" quests which take under a minute to accomplish, Every quest be it side quest, story or main mission i've picked up and finished has provied pieces of information towards the events happening in the area, making everything alot more immersive and larger in scale. (Note:  Investigation missions are quite tricky puzzle solvers that will make you pull your hair out trying to complete!)Storytelling: As stated above this game is more focused on immersion and storytelling, but how good of a job does it do? Overall the voice acting from each new npc character you meet is extreemly well done and sets the mood, Quite like watching a dramatic horror/thriller film, This also adds depth to the areas you explore and try to pass through bit by bit.Overall: If you're looking for a game thats big on action, easy questing, quick levelling or combat focused this game wont be for you, If however you want a game that racks your brain, makes you think, pulls you into its world and does a damn good job at keeping you there, Then i'd suggest picking up The Secret World.

												When we hear the term ‘MMORPG’ we tend to think of Elves, Dragons, and grinding out levels. The Secret World seeks to subvert this trend by not being set in a high fantasy world and doing away with levels, skill trees and the class system entirely. Set in the present day and in this universe, The Secret World has players assume the role of a regular person who has been granted fantastic abilities, and uses them to do battle against dark forces on behalf of The Illuminati, The Templar or the mysterious and chaotic Dragon.The biggest thing that sets The Secret World apart from other MMOs is its setting. Events take place in our present day world, and reference real world culture. For instance, the Templar make a point of telling the player that they are nothing like what one might see in a Dan Brown novel. Early locations pay homage to the likes of HP Lovecraft and Stephen King, and mission-giving NPCs feel like they’ve stepped out of film and literature as they go off on their pre-quest monologues. Enemies are taken from myth and legend, and include the likes of Draugh, Wendigo, Zombies, Vampires, Demons and The Bogeyman. I’ve even seen a tribe of Sasquatch.Zones are large and varied. In the early stages of the game, players explore haunted carnivals, sleepy towns plagued by the undead, occult institutions, and forests inhabited by vicious beasts. I’ve been putting many hours into the game since I got it, and still haven’t left the early zones as there is plenty to do in each of the game’s large, open areas.Most of the time, like in other MMOs, I’m doing missions for NPCs. Upon accepting a mission, the player is treated to a cutscene where the quest-giver tells you (sometimes in a rambling, roundabout way) what they need done. I really like these cutscenes. Despite the player’s character not having any dialogue, the quest-giver monologues are entertaining, as the NPCs have a lot of character and the voice talent has done a good job of bringing them to life.While still maintaining the “Kill 10 X” style of quest, The Secret World expands on the formula by introducing a couple of new quest types. Investigation missions are probably the most enjoyable of these new types, as they deviate most from the standard MMO fare. In investigations, players have to employ detective skills, along with logic, problem solving, and perhaps a little research (made easier by the games handy built in web browser) to uncover clues that lead to other clues, that eventually lead to uncovering some important knowledge. Some of the investigations are absolutely devilish, requiring a substantial degree of effort on the part of the player. One such mission presents the player with a message encrypted in Morse Code. To advance to the next stage of the investigation, the player must decipher the coded message (or give in to temptation and google up a guide using the games handy built in web browser). Investigations may also task players with cracking a computer password or following a series of cryptic clues in a treasure hunt across the zone. The investigation missions are a lot of fun, provided you’re the kind of person who is into cracking clues and codes, otherwise they can just be infuriating and force the player to follow a walkthrough to get it over with.The other main type of mission introduced in The Secret World is Sabotage. These involve sneaking into an area, avoiding laser tripwires, security cameras and enemies who are capable of quickly dismembering the player if their attention is accidentally attracted. Sabotage quests are not as common as investigations or “Kill X” quests, possibly because they can be a little repetitive. Most Sabotage missions require the player to navigate an area where the price for failure is almost instant death.This wouldn’t be a problem, but at times, jumping over a low tripwire is complicated by sloppy jumping mechanics, often ending in something exploding and severely damaging your character, if not killing it outright and forcing you to attempt the section again.Another interesting aspect of The Secret World is the way in which it does away with the traditional class and levelling systems that appear in other MMOs. The Secret World employs a system that allows the player to create their own class, or ‘deck’ as it is called, by equipping two weapons, and up to seven active and seven passive abilities. Decks are built by spending a combination of Action Points (AP) and Skill Points (SP), which are gained through accumulation of experience. Abilities are split into categories based on the weapon a character a character needs to use them. Currently, the weapons available consist of Swords, Hammers, Fists, Blood Magic, Elementalism, Chaos Magic, Pistols, Shotguns, and Assault Rifles.If one were to play the game for long enough, one could obtain all the available abilities, as there is no limit to the amount of experience a character can accrue. For this reason there is no way to refund spent Ability Points, nor does there need to be.If someone was to do what I did, and create a character build they weren’t happy with, remedying the situation simply requires picking up a new weapon and buying some new abilities to go along with it. I was genuinely surprised with how easy it was to alter the developmental direction of my character. I just stopped, equipped a hammer I had lying about, used my spare AP and SP to grab some abilities and weapon skill, and off I went.The limitations imposed on the number of abilities a character can equip may be jarring to MMO veterans who are used to loading up their half a dozen action bars with dozens of abilities. I too felt somewhat strategically hindered at first. Eventually I came to see the restrictions as a deeper level of character customisation, intended to force the player to design their deck of abilities around the situation at hand. There’s still times where I really, really want an eighth ability slot, just so I can squeeze in one more attack or passive ability, but I’ve come to appreciate the strategy behind customising my build within the constraints of the system.Combat is probably where The Secret World is closest to other MMOs. The player still has an ability bar, and the abilities on that bar still have cooldowns. Resources like mana have been done away with however, and each of the two weapons a player is carrying uses its own resource pool. During combat, players use abilities to build weapon resources, then spend those resources to unleash their more powerful abilities, then resources are built up again and the cycle continues. The Secret World seeks to break up the repetition of combat by letting the player perform a dodge roll, which allows the character to get out of the way of incoming area of effect attacks some enemy types like to use.Engaging enemies must be done with some degree of strategy, as for each unintended enemy entering combat, the player’s chances of survival decrease quite a bit. The enemies that inhabit the outside environments tend to boast roughly the same, if not a larger, amount of health as the player and are capable of taking a bit of punishment, so engaging with too many enemies at once is not in the players best interests. There is no PVP, as each faction has called a truce in order to fight the dark forces.No MMO is without bugs, and The Secret World is no exception to this. During my time with the game, I have encountered a few bugged quests, and have even fallen through the world on one occasion. The GMs were amazingly helpful with the bugged quests, rectifying the situation within 15 minutes of me sending off a petition. Other than these isolated incidents, my time in The Secret World has been essentially bug free.AbstractStory 9Gameplay 9Graphics 9.5Sound 9.5Replayability 9Controls 9Overall Score9.25/10			"

												I've been playing MMOs since everquest in 1999, and MUDs on BBSs before that.  I've beta tested and played more MMOs then I can count without sitting down and taking the time to think about it, but at least a few dozen.  So take it as a massive compliment for TSW when I tell you that this game has some of the greatest features in any MMO I've ever played.  Is TSW a perfect game?  No, the game play can get a little rough at times, and the character builder feels quite flat.  But it has by far the best story of any MMO I've ever played, rivaling many triple A solo games stories.  The atmosphere of modern horror is perfect without resorting to cheap scares, but instead weaving a tale of Lovecraftian horror and survival, all with the backdrop of major political forces moving in the background.  The 'leveling' system is by far one of the best and most original that I've ever seen in an MMO, eschewing traditional 'levels' and 'classes' in favor of a more free form system of upgrading skills and items to build a unique character.  In addition this is one of the most beautiful games I've ever played, and by far the best looking MMO of anything I've ever seen.  Top all of this off with the fact that you buy the game once and play it for free, no subscription fee, and this game is a no brainer.I'd reccomend springing for the ultimate edition for the extra few bucks, you'll get a TON more content, and odds are once you start playing, you'll fall in love with it the same way I did.

												So, this game is good, its really good. I have never played a MMO before where such care has been taken into the writing of the game, all quests are fully dialoged and cut sceaned and this greatly helps with immersion and makes you actually start to care about the world around you. The quests range from your standard MMO grind collect fest to some of the MOST FUN and CHALLANGING puzzle quests i have played. EVER, Yes in any game. These ""Investigation"" quests will have you searching google, wiki pages, local town info boards, forums, and sometimes real world peripherals. It requires some extreame thinking outside the box. THERE AMAZING more games should do things like this.The combat is ok, you have the choice between tab targetting and action targetting, the real fun comes in the form of the combat wheel where you will use points to purchase abilitys and passives to experiment with endless possible builds. There is no lvling in the secret world, instead you upgrade weapons and gear which is either dropped by mobs or crafted, the crafting is very simaliar to minecraft where you make the item shape to produse the gear you want.The atmosphere in this game is incredible, alot of this has to do with some really nice art and sound design, It trully makes you feel alone in this game, Only seeing a fellow person on occasion going about there business really adds to the helplesness that this world has fallen into.This isnt your standard MMO. You wont find hundreds of players rushing from mob to mob with there flashy mounts, What you will find tho is a amazing story and some really intresting quests that i have never seen done before, So if youre looking for something a little bit different, You owe it to yourself to TRY this game!

												90% of people who like MMORPGs shouldnt play this game. For the rest of us, this is the best MMORPG on the market, hands down, no questions, end of story. Would you like an MMO to have a serious story and real, actually challenging missions that don't constantly mean you have to ""kill X of Y"" or ""collect X of Z""? Then you play this. In this game, you actually solve real problems. It is above and beyond what MMORPG means to me. It's like a single player adventure/rpg with multiplayer elements strongly included. My only complaint is the store is filled with ludicrously priced items. They aren't neccessary, but after already paying for the game itself, the prices are outrageous.			"

												Played nearly 200 hours, don't think I've been in an actual party the entire time. That said, this is easily the best MMO on Steam if you're interested in a solo experience. I'm a huge fan of the insane build flexibility the game allows, as well. There are no set classes. Instead you pick two weapons and grab skills as you see fit, with the ability to switch at basically any time. You can also grab passives from weapons you don't even use to make your build better. The quest system is also a little different. You can only have 5 quests at a time: the main story quest, which will tell the overarching story in the long term as you traverse the different zones; a normal quest, which will usually have voice acted cutscenes and multiple stages to go through; and up to three side quests, which are more like the shorter quests you're used to from other MMOs.  It sounds odd, but it works very well with the way the game world is set up, with normal quests leading you to sidequests which lead you to new areas, etc. There are also investigation quests which give you very little to go on, often requiring you to solve puzzles or research outside of the game in order to progress.Highly recommended.

												Funny that I've been playing this game for a long time now, and I'm only now getting around to write the review. But, well, I've been distracted. By this game.The Secret World is an MMORPG set in modern times. Your character awakens with magic powers in a world where all of the conspiracy theories are true, and you're quickly recruited into one of the ancient secret societies. They send you to several supernatural hotspots arouns the world in order to protect your society's interests and stop the impending end of days.You get to channel your magic through two different weapons, and you have three guns, three magic focuses, and three melee weapons to choose from (not to mention auxiliary weapons you'll find later on, such as the Rocket Launcher or Whip). Most of the chocies are viable for a player simply looking to do damage. If you want to tank or heal, you'll need to include one of the ""tank weapons"" or ""healer weapons"".I enjoy playing this genre of game, but I could never get into World of Warcraft or its many clones. This game really is something special. The first reason is that the story and mission dialogue is not only worth reading, but it's compelling at times. Some of the characters really are very lovable, and there are some really fun mysteries to unravel. The second reason is that the quest structure is really good. Sure, there are a few ""kill 10 wolves"" quests, but there's also an ""unlock the Illuminati vault by solving a riddle"" quest, and a ""sneak around the laser system"" quest. Each quest really felt like I was doing something meaningful. The third is that, in this game, you're never locked out of certain paths. You spend points to upgrade certain weapons or get new weapon skills, but you can always level up other weapons in the future in case you want to fill a different role.I should also clear up one thing about this game: no subscription. You pay once, and you get access to the vast majority of the game's content. You can choose to pay a little more for content packs... most of them are worth spending some money on.I got this on sale, and it's some fo the best money I've ever spent on Steam. If you enjoy playing MMOs, then this game is absolutely worth trying. If not, it's probably worth trying anyway.			"

												This game comes highly recommended by yours-truly. If you're into MMO's, then this game has it all. Modern RPG-style MMO where you play the role of one of the 3 secret societies across the world - the Illuminati is an example of one.The cutscenes are worth watching.Every piece of literature is worth reading. Every NPC is worth talking to.The puzzles are VERY HARD to the point the game includes a built-in browser so you can Google up a walk-through. For example; some missions have you looking up old books on Amazon and decyphering a code from the ISBN. The voice-acting is hit-or-miss. Some of the actors are very recognizable (Tim Russ!) with outstanding delivery, inside jokes, actor allusions and Memes everywhere!Hundreds of class combinations that you can switch on-the-fly. You're not limited to anything. What weapon combinations you want to use, your skills; all of them become open to you and you can mix/match whatever you like to create your own unique build that works for you. There is no one true build for any particular role.The maps are huge without any big chunks of nothing in between. There's something to find everywhere. A good chunk of the game is solo, but the best loot is found in the multi-player dungeons.No level system. Your gear is your level and you decide what your character is best at first, then branch out from there.PVP is available and successful PVP ventures unlock buffs for everyone in the region! Keep at it, because it's not something that locks in for a week. One minute your secret society may control everything and it can be taken away the next!There's something for everyone in The Secret World, so pick up a copy and join Onyx Gaming on the Arcaida Server!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I just read a post from someone named Zakennayo and I got a little angry and came back here to revise my review because I didn't want my rant to get buried.  People need hear this.Some people have played WoW for SO LONG it's forever colored their perspective of MMO's.  World of Warcraft revolutionized the MMORP gaming genre back when all they had to compete with was Everquest and Ultima Online.  Now WoW is boring, dated and severely lacking in concepts and when anyone from WoW sees an MMO they instantly try to compare it to WoW and only disappoint themselves.You'll never recapture the magic of the early days of that game and I don't know why these 30-somethings still try.  Just like Call of War 9: Modern Duty Ops 4 will never recapture the magic of Quake or the first Halo.The genre won't change until technology changes and technology may seem like it's leaping forward with every new iPhone # or Samsung Galaxy #, but it's not.  This year, the phone has 3.5Gigs of Ram instead of 3 and can both make AND receive calls for $200 more than the previous generation!  We also shrunk the chassis (or made it bigger) and made the screen bigger (or made it smaller).We're doing the same with video games because we've actually hit a technological ceiling.  It's not that we CAN'T go further, it's just we've limited ourselves with artificial barriers like ""currency"" and ""political correctness"".  It's either too expensive or too offensive.To add onto that.  Does anyone even remember what video games like Legend of Zelda and Super Mario Bros. cost back in 1985?  I do.  The original NES sold in the US for $299 and Legend of Zelda was $59.95.  Legend of Zelda was scripted, coded, compiled, packaged and ready for release in 3 months and cost approximately $5000 to produce.  The latest console is around $399 and games are STILL $59.95 with the most expensive game to date being Destiny at a !!rumored!! TEN MILLION DOLLARS in development costs (that's just for the first game released, not including DLC and future expansions) and a FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR ad campaign spread out over the lifecycle of the title (rumored to be about 10 years).This game, with all of it's expansions up to issue 11 is $60.  The same price as the first Legend of Zelda game, with fully-voiced characters, non-intrusive cinematics, an expansive world, a unique story; I could go on and on.  Even if you don't like this game for personal reasons, there shouldn't be any reason to down-vote it.  It's a good game.  It's playable.  It doesn't pull any punches and it works.  On the off chance it doesn't work, they have Omni-GM's (GM's with root console access, not just a Kick/Ban button for jerks) on hand to fix any kerfunk that may occur....Didn't mean to get philosophical on everyone; but that's just my two cents.

												Creepy MMO - A brief but honest review. The Secret World is by no means a stand-out title. It certainly doesn't re-invent the wheel at any point and the movement and combat feels a little floaty. It's yout typical action-bar-pickup-quests-kill-mobs sort of game. At least that's what you think when you start playing. However; the game developers have managed to capture this really thick atmosphere through a combination of great story-telling, awesome voice-acting and a brilliant soundtrack. When you start playing the game you really start to get sucked in and the experience becomes increasingly immersing as you follow along with the story. You start yearning to find out the secrets behind the mystery. I really get this 'Diablo 2 but set in the modern world.' sort of vibe while playing it. And really it is that which drives me on. The game has a fairly steep learning curve. A complex crafting system, a massive selection of weapons, skills, abilities, stats -- and none of it is really formally explained. But with a bit of surfing you will quickly find answers to those questions. (using the in-game browser is a nice touch.)I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone playing for end-game content or raiding for epic loot. However; if you're looking to immerse yourself in a really well voice-acted horror story that generates an atmosphere so thick you could cut it with a knife, this could well be for you.			"

New material is being added, and there are special events from time to time.  Also, the game is pretty.The community tends to be very helpful and not at all like the communities of other games I have played that made me stop playing them. If you've been thinking about a new MMO, you should consider this one.			"

Short verdict: you will like this MMO, even if you don't like MMOs in general.PROS+ Fantastic lore with a lot of inspiration from H.P. Lovecraft, folklore and mythology. No shortage of pop-culture references either+ Overwhelming amount of content. The Ultimate Edition on sale with a 75% discount is a fantastic deal. Even with the Standard Edition you get plenty of gameplay hours for the buck.+ No subscription, no slots to unlock, all the things that matter are unlockable either with skill/ability points or in-game currency/tokens+ You can solo most of the missions (except for dungeons, lairs and raids)+ Very friendly and helpful community, which is still quite active+ Atmospheric+ Modern day setting, which is a relatively rare thing for MMOs+ No fixed classes, it's all about skills and equipment in this game, which you can easily change+ Seasonal events+ Free membership for 2 months with the Ultimate Edition. The membership offers considerable loot and XP boosts and free travelling+ When buying the Ultimate Edition, you also get one free key of the Standard Version to share with a friend+ Abundancy of outfits and cosmetic items. Many of them are free+ You don't feel the grindiness in the early game period, because everything feels quite exciting for about first 50-80 hours (for me at least) and there's always another achievement, another item, another skill deck to get within your reach+ Adjustable camera distanceCONS- This game is not super-grindy, but it's still grindy, especially in terms of combat. - Tedious combat. Enemies have too much HP, even the easy ones. Unless, you're doing missions with friends, killing takes a long time.- Camera issues - big enemies don't fit the screen very nicely- Even though the enemies change, what changes is their looks, not how they act and feel. Basically, there are just a few enemy types: big, slow golem-like enemies with a lot of HP;  grouped small weak enemies that can overwhelm you with numbers; small to medium size ungrouped strong enemies; spectres with magic abilities and minor bosses.- It's hard to sneak past enemies without triggering a combat. Usually you can outrun them, but you need to be careful of not triggering too many enemies at the same time, which happens quite often- Agartha is a sort of transport hub in this game and its convoluted design makes the travelling a little bit cumbersome. Also, in some maps, the fast travelling points (anima wells) are scarcely distributed.- Although, there is a unique story for every mission, after a while, the gameplay does start to feel repetitive. And that is the main reason, why I'm taking a break from this game. The gameplay starts to feel like a repetitive cycle of clearing the areas, missions and gathering lore and skills.- Too narrow opportunity windows in sabotage missions.- There are quite a few bugs and I needed to switch from DX11 to DX9 to avoid frequent crashes.- The Ultimate Edition does not include all the DLCs, you still need to buy Issues 12-14 additionally.In the end, I'd like to say that I don't like MMOs and the reason, why I picked up this game, was because of the Lovecraftian lore and the fact that you can complete most of the missions alone. So, if you are into a good story and enjoy some modern day mystery, this game is not bad at all, not at all.My overall rating: 8/10 "

												I've never written a review on Steam before.   Many people have already posted about the story line, the atmosphere, etc.  All of that is great.  This is what really makes the game great for me though.   There are no character classes.  You unlock every skill and then you can build your own deck (basically role) for many different types of game modes.  There are your classic holy trinity roles of Tank, DPS, and heals.  However, there are many different hybrid roles as well.  Some examples are a heal tank, melee dps, DPS tank, leech healer (healer that heals with an assault rifle DPS), and then the mixing and matching of many skills/weapons that add more to your build as well.    I have a few hours on this game and my toon can do every role for all the content in the game (sans some brand new content since I haven't learned every role yet in the new content), and that is what makes this game great for me.   Typically in any other MMO you must roll another class to try or play another role.  Not in this game.  You get complete control of what weapons you want to slot, and you craft all your own custom gear.Many MMOs have advertised the ""Play it your way,"" model of character progression and design.   While, you cannot 100% just make up whatever you want in this game, it is the only game that comes close.   You are never locked into a specific class or build, and with their crafting system you can completely customize all your gear.   It really is the closest thing to the ""play it your way,"" I have ever experienced in a MMO.I'd recommend this game to anyone where this is appealing.  To be honest this game has sort of ruined me, as I will probably never want to play a class-based MMO video game again.    I now want my character to be able to perform any role.			"

												I probably should start by stating the fact that I generally hate MMOs but this... This is different.It got guns. It got zombies. What more could you wish for?No, but seriously. The game has a modern day setting and brings every myth you ever heard of to reality in said world.Think of it as Supernatural being made into a MMO. You even solve cases and there's puzzles on top of the usual mass killing of your favorite creatures. And did I say it got guns? As in firearms - pistols, shotguns, assault rifles beside the magic and melee weapons.RIGHT NOW IT IS ON SALE!! A one time payment like with any other normal game, so no subscription fees.			"

												Enjoyable MMO that does away with leveling and your basic class system and instead focuses on player freedom and customization. Initially a bit challenging after playing some of the ""Press button to kill things"" games, The Secret World requires you to know your build well enough to utilize it during combat. It can feel a bit unforgiving at times if you haven't balanced out your gear and stats, but everything is customizable and can be broken down to make new items so it shouldn't take long to get the hang of playing.I would suggest the Massive Edition for anoyone completely new to the game. The starter weapons are good through the entire first zone (until you hit about 3 million XP) and you also get an XP booster you can use once every 16 hours (lasts 1 hour).Another big draw to the game is the overall look of your character and how much you can customize their wardrobe. Your stats are based off smaller items, not your shirt, hat and boots. You can acquire clothing items in game by doing various missions or achievements but you can also purchase them through the Item Store, which allows you to preview the item on your character before purchase. Sure, clothing doesn't affect the game, but being able to come up with your own look is a nice touch. What's more, you get your faction outfit as you progress through the game and you can unlock other outfits as you complete ""Decks"" (the closest thing to spec/builds in The Secret World). I would suggest looking over the starter decks early and figuing out what weapon combo you want to play, then spend you AP and SP to unlock that starter deck. Once you have completed it, you can claim the outfit for that deck. (Considering you can obtain every skill and ability in the game on one character, everyone is able to complete every deck and play every style.)One drawback I've found with The Secret World is that it's a bit of a time sink. What felt like an hour of play time was actually about 4 hours of real time. It's easy to get caught up in the world, I guess.			"

												As far as MMOs go, I'm REALLY enjoying this game immensely.First, to be clear: It's not going to be for everybody. If you dislike MMO-style gameplay, then look elsewhere: this game includes a (somewhat) typical (though unique in some aspects) quest system, the usual grind from time to time, and tinkering with character stats.It also does not give you the full experience if all you're interested in is jumping into a game and mindlessly blowing everything up (which, hey, who doesn't love that, too?). Finally, the graphics aren't going to blow your mind (that's not to say they're bad. It's just...they're MMO graphics. What do you want?)But with all that said and out of the way, I love the effort this game goes through to create such an amazing atmosphere. The story is intricate and intriguing, the main quests include well-crafted cutscenes with quality voice acting. And the quests! The quests took me by surprise!The quests will range from your typical ""go here and kill 10 zombies,"" to an intricate series of puzzles and riddles, leading you through town and exploring secret areas, and finally giving you incredibly challenging riddles that require you to do research (with a pretty cool in-game browser window) to seek out a solution. Never before have I been challenged by an MMO like I have with TSW.And it's also the first MMO like this I've played that has no classes and no levels, pushing you to really invent unique ""deck"" combinations suited to your gameplay, picking and choosing which two weapons you want to use and which abilities for each. I found I was realllly left in the dark about how this all worked, but after I did some research into everything online, everything started to click into place quickly. Which I suppose is just fine for a game that urges you to research and learn, anyway.The subject and genre are unique and interesting, and it's a good experience to turn off the lights, and immerse yourself in the game, reading the clues and lore, learning new things, and exploring this creepy world. I'm hopeful for even more customization of character, and I think the gameplay system could be made more clear somehow, but overall, this game is a definite new favorite in my library. Solo-friendly. Group-friendly. Helpful and nice community.Overall, you only get out of this game what you're willing to put in. If you explore and involve yourself with the story, TSW is a rewarding experience. It was a refreshing change from my years of WoW addiction, and made me brush the dust off my brain. I'm hooked.			"

												Engaging storytelling with film like cutscenes for every main and story mission, NON-generic NPC's, mystical, creepy, even frightening sometimes, yet an addictive atmosphere and mood, the best soundtrack I've ever heard in an MMO, fascinating learning curve, challenging character development, exciting game mechanics and a great player community!This is The Secret World to me.Definitely recommended.

												PART 1~~Short Introduction~~TSW is a modern horror/mystery MMORPG set in the modern world. You can choose between three secret societies (like factions in other games) to join the battle against nasty monsters or each other.There are no classes or levels but I will talk about that later.~~Payment model~~TSW is Buy-to-play, similar to Guild Wars 2. You don't need a subscription to play but new content is (partially) locked behind a DLC. When you buy the game you get the base game and the first four Issues (that's what content patches are called). You also get enough Bonus Points (after doing 30 missions) to buy one of the DLC.The item shop is mostly cosmetic and the few non-cosmetic items are far from Pay-to-win.The optional subscription gives you some points for the store, a 10% store discount, an item of the month (clothing or pet), veteran points and an item that gives you double XP for one hour (16 hours cooldown).~~Setting~~TSW is set in the modern world. The three faction hubs are London, New York and Seoul. There are three quest regions at the moment, each with 2-3 zones: Solomon Island (New England), Egypt and Transylvania. The next region will be Tokyo (probably late 2013/early 2014).There is a lot of horror and mystery influence from H.P. Lovecraft, X-Files, etc.~~PvE~~Most of the quests have cutscenes and the voice actors are great. This is the first MMORPG where I didn't skip any cutscenes and really got into the story.Every quest is repeatable which lets you correct mistakes you made with your build early on and gives you the chance to get enough AP to get every skill later (see ~~Progression~~).There are three types of quests: Action, Sabotage and Investigation.Action quests are your typical run/kill quests.Sabotage quests have you sneak around and avoid cameras and monsters.Investigation quests have you solve puzzles, use real life knowledge etc. (One example (SPOILERS): In one of the quests you have to figure out that the hint you just got points to a specific bible verse which gives you another hint for the next quest step)The dungeons are some of the best I've ever seen in an MMORPG and can be pretty challenging if you don't get carried through. Each dungeon comes in three difficulties: Normal, Elite and Nightmare.The endgame is mostly running Nightmare dungeons and the two raids. With Issue 8 (released in Nov '13) there are also scenarios to run, which are basically instanced missions for solo, duo or groups with random elements.Unfortunately most of the content is the same regardless of faction and since you can get everything on one character you are not encouraged to make alts.~~PvP~~I don't play PvP myself but from what I hear some love it, some hate it. Better look for another review if you want to know more about PvP.			"

												I've spent around 32 hours with it, and in that time only made it through the first quest zone doing most of it by myself, and there were still quests to complete in the area when I decided to check out the next one. I think there are 8 or so zones in the base game, more available in expansions (one of which you can pick up for free with the Ultimate Edition since it gives you the free FunCom points used to buy such things). The zones themselves span from a New England town to Egypt, Transylvania, and Tokyo, as well as having hub cities like New York, London, and Seoul. The missions are pretty well done instead of the usual ""Kill X number of whatevers"" or ""Collect X number of whatevers,"" and some of what sets it apart from most other MMOs (or RPGs in general) is that it's a modern-day version of the world as we know it (but with a Call of Cthulhu kinda flair, so you run into crazy monsters along the way). You play as a member of a secret organization like the Illuminati doing all kinds of X-Files stuff away from the public eye. There is an in-game browser that you can use to look up fake websites, and there's investigative stuff to find passwords and clues to mysteries. And pretty much everything is voiced. I honestly can't think of any MMO that can compete with it in terms of missions. The biggest gripe most people have with the game is that the combat, like most MMOs in my experience, is kinda boring. It's slightly more nuanced than average, but still not super exciting. You get to pick two separate fighting styles based on the two weapons you have equipped, and you can change and upgrade any of them as you level up. So you can mix assault rifles with a sword and then over time you decide you like blood magic, you can equip a blood magic focus in place of your assault rifle or sword and totally mix up your play style. And yes, it is possible to unlock all of it and even save alternate loadouts so you can swap back and forth on the fly. Pretty much all of the content is solo friendly except for the dungeons, so you can enjoy 95% of the game without needing to suck your friends in or be social with strangers.			"

												Excellent game, pretty sure this is easily my second most-played MMO and I'm still very much enjoying it. Missions that will (most of the time) keep you interested, and a unique class system. I'll say, this game can be hard to get into. The story alone should keep you going for a bit, especially if you really give it a chance. I sometimes feel the dialouges are a bit drawn out but the story overall is interesting. That being said, questing areas are often not too populated and I imagine it can be hard to make friends, and the ability wheel at first glance can be overwhelming.One of the first thing you'll want to do is join Sanctuary by inputting ""/chat join sanctuary"" into your chat. This is a fairly active chat for new players with a lot of vets willing to help with builds, questing, and more. But as you get more comfortable with the world, your roles, the quests, the dungeons, it can become really fun. This is the only game I've ever played where I LOVE instances. I have no issue grinding every elite on repeat for hours. Each group poses new dynamics, challenges, and the boss fights are generally fun (to me).CLASSES AND FIGHTING:The ability to change out your roles and classes can be weird at first. Essentially in the beginning you will probably want to be guessing at builds online and hope they're effective until you learn the skills. But once you do, it can open up a  world of building your own builds, rotations, there is really no definitive way to play a class and a lot of the time later, you'll find yourself switching skills depending on the situation, or sometimes even roles, making you more and more valuable as a party member for your flexibility. It is amazingly valuable to be mid dungeon wiping and realizing you can't heal something, only to have a dps come up and say ""hey, we can switch"", and still be able to progress. QUESTING AND ENVIROMENT:Most reviews talk about this so I'm not gonna go into it too much. The story is interesting, with nice character variety and interesting side stories. There's some excellent attention to detail. There are actually for real sites they've made for this game connected to the story which can be clues and more, and I love little details like that. (i.e.: a character has a blog writing about something relevant to a quest, you can go to his blog: http://www.monstersofmaine.blogspot.ca/)Immersion is pretty good. Graphics, eh, pretty decent. Exploring and lore hunting is fun. Maps are fairly big, it'll take you some time to run around an entire one and see it all, often you'll find small side missions hidden if you're exploring. One criticism I have is the hitboxes for traps SUCK. I absolutely hate sneaking missions. You'll be feet away from a landmine and it will blow up on you. Absolutely hate those things.COMMUNITY:The community is often one of the better I have been in. If you are new to an instance there are usually people very willing to help out. I mainly heal in this game and I very very rarely get the whole ""omg noob healer!!!"" business (even when I can be that). It can be slow but there are some really cool people on this game. Late game players often even carry the easy difficulty dungeons for new players, there can be a very nice sense of community. Of course, there are the douches. It is an MMO. UI AND THE NEED FOR MODDING:The UI isn't great. It can be glitching and it's lacking as well. I'll tell you right now if you decide to get this game, mod the UI. You'll want better combat logs, resource counters, and... Well, just generally, look for the mods. ENDGAME:I'm not quite to full endgame yet so I feel a little weird writing about this specifically but endgame is grinding. Grinding nightmares, scenarios, signet missions. If you enjoy the gameplay, unlocking all your skills, making new builds, it's fun. But when you get there, that's definitely a thing. (To be expected in an mmo, but just saying.)Anyway... Been meaning to write a review for awhile. So... Off to run 24s. o/			"

												If every conspiracy theory and Lovecraftian mythos happened at the same time, you have the setting for The Secret World.Pros* Buy-to-play (ie. no subscription). The game plays fine without spending any more money.* Fully voice acted including multiple appearances from Jeffrey Combs.* No classes, any character can put points into any skill tree.* No levels, you earn skill points at a steady pace. Instead, advanced skills cost more.* No skill point cap. Try everything!* At times it's geniunely very creepy.* A truly unique MMO setting.* Crafting is Minecraft style.Cons* Like much of the source material it's drawing from, the story is gibberish.* PVE combat is easy and gets repetitive.If you're tired of WoW clones and fantasy settings, try this. It's just dripping with atmosphere. Grab it when it's on sale and see if you like it.			"

												This game is not the best MMO I've ever played. Blockbusters like WoW or SWTOR beat it by throwing sheer volumes of money at every problem. But this game doesn't try to compete in their arena, and in doing so became the most interesting MMO I've ever played.Ever standard complaint of the genre is, if not fixed, at least tweaked. Sick of boring Kill X, Gather Y quests? The Secret World has the most involved quest lines I've ever played. Even their most basic missions are steeped in enough lore to keep you engadged and their legendary Investigation missions earn every bit of praise they've aquired. Tired of spammers filling chat with goldfarming ads and racist tirades? The TSW community is only interested in sharing theories and, occasionally, bad puns. Heck, just don't like monthly subscription fees? Pay once, play forever! And don't worry, while there is an add-on store, it's used entirely for cosmetics, convenience, and story additions. No pay-to-win here.If you're a fan of contemporary fantasy or cosmic horror genres, this is an absolute must. Even if you're just a casual MMO player interested in seeing how the genre can work when it's trying desperately to make the Blizzard lightning strike twice, this is a game worth seeing.Come on... take a peek behind the curtain of reality.

												I have really enjoyed the Borderlands series and story - The characters made the difference. I wanted to try out my first MMO however I'm extremely picky about ""Fantasy"" - I usual don't like it. With TSW, it takes place in the Present. It has a ""grown-up"" story full of characters, etc. not found in most games. Plus, this game has as much playtime as the entire Borderlands series combined.There were some Sci Fi MMO's I considered, but I didn't want to level grind - TSW has linear growth and I can ""spend"" my Skill Points where ever to determine my Quality Level (1 - 10).With most of my gamer buddies on Xbox, I have to solo this a lot, and it's very doable - if balanced correctly. Other players are around and will assist occasionally to help you out.Here's my advice if you want to get started on The Secret World:Remember there are no monthly fees. You can play without every buying an In-app purchase. You will earn 1200 bonus credits to buy new side stories or in-game stuff after your 1st 30 missions. You can earn in game credit to buy things too. Spending real money might save you time though, get you time boosts, ""outfits"" - none of which is necessary. The Ultimate Edition on sale is the best buy with issues #1-#11, side stories, & more. Put The Secret World on your Steam Wish List. Install a copy from the Funcom.com site and ask for a 72 hr trial key from the Steam TSW Forums. Then if you enjoy it, get the Ultimate Edition when on sale ( at 60% off = $24 - WOW!! ). *IF you can get the basic Secret World for #1-#3 on sale that will give you time to play it until it's on sale again, but you'll basically spend $$$ to eval a game. Luckily, the Ultimate comes with a base game license key you are allowed to give away. NOTE: This is a FUNCOM key to give, not an extra Steam Key ! Do NOT create any character right away. You need to do research, preferable before you buy it. (Yes, you are already playing the game, not having bought it yet.) Read the Steam Community Guides on it. In particular: The Secret World 101 - has lots of great links at the bottom.

 http://wordpress.tswguides.com/category/tsw-guides/builds/level/my-first-60/ - this site is a must if your new and will be soloing Lastly, after completing 30 missions, Funcom (currently) gives you 1200 store credits which is worth $10. With that credit, you can buy anything you missed. If you own the Ultimate Edition, you're getting $10 back on your purchase for in-store credit for new chapters & packs. Awesome. Thanks Funcom.Character creation: Be patient creating a unique nickname. Without a login, use http://chronicle.thesecretworld.com to look up if nickname is taken. Note: there are also reserved names - First, Nick & Last . Not everyone can be Snoop Dog or Eva Longoria. If you goof up a Toon's appearance or name, (at the time of writing) you can delete you character & create a new one at no cost with the desired nick name (or even same nickname) so long as someone else doesn't grab the nickname -- I did. YMMV. But if you've been playing and want to re-spec - don't consider deleting it as you'll have many months of game play to get back to where you were. There's very rare reasons to delete to re-spec. Servers matter for solo adventurers - you want one to find folks for Dungeon runs, PvP gaming, or meet folks to co-op with. Unless you 'Meetup' with someone on another server or are co-op'ing, you will always PvP on your host. I've read I should have gone with Arcadia RP. Now, it's a Role Play host, that means stow (uncheck) your characters gear so it's not visible. And don't Run & Jump over every car & fence you see. I play that way already when I read the suggestion. FYI, It cost $20 to move an existing character to another server. So choose wisely. You can delete a character & create a new one (you have 3 slots) on your preferred server - but it'll be gone forever.I have my 2nd of three characters on Arcadia RP. Depending on the zone's or sub-zone's population, it can get occasionally very slightly jittery. If that's a problem, don't use Arcadia. My first character is on Daemon server and its really smooth. My third is on Cerberus. Now I have a character on each of the most populated (English) servers. Put every piece of clothing on your character you can when first making them. Jackets, glasses, etc. They will always have shirt, shorts/pants, shoes. However, glasses, hats, jackets, etc. can be removed at anytime. If you want them in-game, you have buy them with earned (or real) currency, achievements, etc. So, take them while their free. You will get bonus stuff from the Steam purchase. Use some of them. Press ',' comma to pull up the store,  select Claim Items, then *review first*. Do *not* claim any yet. Review all the store. Some are even more powerful than earned rings, etc in game but only work below 3mil Exp. Others [ like timed boosts] work for all levels. Consider saving your boosts for later so you level faster/steady on tougher minions/portions. Factions only matters for PvP really (capture the flag, territories, etc.). Everyone has the same story to complete, though your faction will alter some dialog. There are a few faction missions, but they are different perspectives or goals of the same event. Everyone can travel to the other cities: London (bank & large market), New York (body modification) & Seoul.Game Mods:Viper's TopBar Overload and Viper's Deck ManagerYou'll likely want the Mods: Viper's TopBar Overload so you can install Viper's Deck Manager. The site http://secretui.com has them. Some people use http://Curse.com. You can download them from there too. (I don't like having more clients so I don't run Curse on my rig.)VDM is the defacto ""stringifier"" of builds for importing & exporting your current loadout while making loadouts easier too. It's a maintained community Mod. Several Mods are must have but TopBar Overload & VDM are practically mandatory.These sites can share & compare your builds with others outside of TSW:(Note: if your chronicle.thesecretworld.com profile page is publicly visible, some of these sites will import using that too beside your exported VDM string) http://www.drakkashi.com/secretworld/ http://www.drakkashi.com/secretworld/Ability%20Wheel.swf (Just the tool) http://www.tsw-builder.com http://www.badomens.net/calculator http://joakibj.com/tswcalcThere's a few more build sites too.BTW, Viper's DontMakeMeWait is super helpful is speeding past all the startup junk.TSWRPAnother popular mod is for http://tswrp.co - it's allows for in-game role play character HTML rich profile sheets to be accessible on the toons. Being HTML, folks can embed photos, use different fonts & colors, etc. Even if you don't RP (role play) you can use it for conveying additional information about your toon or you. The thing is, you have to use the mod if you want to see that out-of-game ""meta-data"" in-game.Of course you could use the in-game browser and see if someone has a page at http://tswrp.co/character/TOONNICKNAME (provided you get any capitalization correct since not all nicks are Capitalized.)Ghost Tablethttp://www.secretui.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?id=85 OR http://www.curse.com/tsw-mods/tsw/ghosttablet makes the GHOST computer interface taller for practically no scrolling.

												Well what can I say about this game :P I love it soooooo much, I have put in over 1800 hours so far and not even close to finished yet, new content released all the time and I get to play with my friends. The maps are massive and filled with missions, also one of the best story line missions I have ever seen. For the most part the people are friendly and the GM's are fast to respond and they are friendly too. You dont have to pay to play this game but I recommend paying becasue you get access to a rance of content and store items that you cant buy anywhere els, there are super cute outfits and tons of accessories. One of the best things about this game is you can be any role you like, we have things called talismans and depending on the talismans you equip you can play the role of a tank, DPS or healer, you can also mix talismans and chop and change your spec on the fly, and combind your stats to make a heal-tank :P or a leech DPS or combind all 3 to make very powerful tanking healer dps build thingys (I call them survival builds) to kill the many monsters in the new nightmare level scenario issue packs found in game. Really its impossible to do a in depth review of this game becasue its simply too big and too much to do and too much to say... just take my word for it and buy the game you wont regret it. Sure its hard in the beginning but once you get some gear you can take on the world solo or as a group of upto 10 of your friends :P Make your own guilds and this isnt even mentioning the PVP aspect of the game... just buy it :P			"

												TL;DR Worth the cost for top-notch story, voice-acting, and characters - but the rest of the game is average at best.A modern-day MMO with guns, Lovecraftian horrors, and bare-naked demon lady boobs.Combat is a bit different to standard tab-target and hotkeys, with a smaller set of abilities and a dodge button. Groups and dungeons still boil down to tank/damage/heals though.Story, script, and voice-acting is where this game really shines compared to others in the genre. Focus on puzzle-solving and the modern-day setting I liked a lot, and are a refreshing change to all the dragons, orcs, elves etc. But while this game nails plot, character, and narrative in a way that no other developer does - especially in the field of MMOs - there are a lot of weaknesses.Character creation is very basic indeed. All characters are fashion-model slim (no options to add bulk in the form of muscle or fat), and although there is a slider to alter height, the variation is quite small. Facial options are limited to a handful of starting faces, with a small selection of features and skin colours. The end result is a game populated by characters of the same build, roughly the same height, who all move in exactly the same way. Superficially the faces look different, but underneath it's still easy to spot one of the small number of basic templates.Character and combat animations are also basic, with the same ones being used for a variety of similar skills (sword skills seem most memorable for this).Combat initially seems more innovative because of the small ability set and the dodge mechanic, but is just tab-target and hotkey with the aforementioned grafted on. Whilst not a bad thing on its own, combat in TSW lacks any sense of impact or meaningful feedback whilst fighting (e.g. when using an enormous black sledgehammer with veins of lava on it, I don't feel like it's connecting with enemies, and there is little to no reaction from them when they are hit aside from numbers appearing above their heads). Coupled with the re-used animations this makes battles slidey/floaty, repetitive affairs, even later in the game when more advanced abilities are unlocked.If you treat this game as single-player and buy it for the story, then you will get amazing value for money - there are hundreds of hours on offer here. It's just a shame that the MMO components and the combat (which there is a lot of) are usually mediocre.			"

												This game is one part mysticism and occult, one part urban legends, and one part the Matrix, all put into a blender and injected with steroids and served on an MMO platter. I'm really glad I gave this game a second chance. I followed the game's production which sadly was a mistake because I sort of painted this idea in my head of what the game was going to be like. When I finally got to jump in I was disappointed when ""The Secret World"" wasn't really all that secret, as my first few hours of playing were spent saving a town from a zombie apocalypse. Being sorely disappointed by this overused cliche, I shelved the game. Cut to several years later, I have gotten over my preconceived notions of what this game was going to be and allowed myself to get caught up in the Lovecraftian style horror and heavy occult themed storyline, and I'm loving every minute of it.There is lots of action right from the start, and while playing the newest addition to one of the three ancient factions (Illuminati, Dragon, or Templar) you find yourself instantly going from average joe to superhero. Yes its a little unrealistic and overdone, but don't let this turn you off. Once you overlook how over the top everything is you can allow yourself to really get caught up in the world that has been created for you to discover.You can pretty much play this game like a single player game with MMO elements. Some may be turned off by that, but actually the missions in this game are well thought out, delivered with cutscenes, full voice acting, and are far from your typical kill X mobs, collect X items, etc. that have plagued the MMO scene since WoW (some of this is still present, but usually in the form of optional side missions). The most intriguing thing about this game are the special investigation type missions. These missions don't hold your hand and, for example, will have you using the in game browser to pull up a website for an in game company in order to find clues that will lead you to the next mission objective, or you may need to use google to translate Latin scribbled on the wall that's a riddle leading you to the next objective. This really taps into the whole ""Secret World"" thing, and is very rewarding when you are finally able to figure out the mystery. One mission even had me follwing a clue that lead me to a video on youtube that was recorded by an occult fanatic trying to open a portal to hell (yes this video is really up on youtube). This type of interactive quest system that forces you to think outside the box is something I've never seen done by any other MMO.The class system is completely fluid, you build your own class by attaining ability points (AP) and spending them in one of the many skill trees tied to the different weapon types. You are able to have 2 weapons equipped at one time, limiting you to the active abilites associated with those two weapon types, but you can have passives from any of the other weapon types active regardless of what weapons you have equipped. This system allows for an incredible amount of customization. Also there is no limit to the amount of AP you can gain, so eventually you will have all skills unlocked, so there is no need to develop mutliple characters if you want to try different weapons and builds, it can all be changed on the fly on a single character. (I strongly suggest using some of the prebuilt ""decks"" in the ability window, these will help you learn how active and passive abilities across multiple weapon types can create synergies. This is very helpful to the new player - you also get cool costumes for unlocking all abilites in a ""deck"")As far as the combat and item system, its very similar to SWTOR (Star Wars the Old Republic), albeit the animations are not quite as smooth. Many enemies and dungeon/raid encounters will require you to dodge AoEs and areas you need to avoid will be highlighted, giving you time to run or dodge out of harms way, making positioning very important. This makes combat dynamic and much more engaging. You have 7 active abilities and 7 passive abilities. Items are geared towards either DPS, tanking, or healing, and if you plan on running dungeons and raids (this game has a great group/raid finder) you will need to specialize your gear and build accordingly (but as I said, gear and build loadouts can be saved and changed on the fly with the click of a button to fit whatever your group/raid needs).TL:DR All and all The Secret World has really surprised me. What I thought was going to be just another over the top forray into quest grinding wrapped in a Lovecraftian, occult, conspiracy theorist skin, turned out to actually be a very well created story driven MMO with lots of exciting mysteries to uncover and fun character progression. If you want to experience a game with a dark atmosphere and well written missions, give this game a try, you'll be glad you did!			"

												The best and perhaps only consistently good part of The Secret World is the world design; the environments are generally fantastic, the story can be pretty good, and the world overall is vibrant (if a bit shallow).The gameplay leaves a *lot* to be desired. The lack of traditional classes and level structure sounds interesting at first, but it's little more than a facade in reality. The ""classes"" of the game are your weapons, which each have two different ""roles"" that they're designed around -- Fist weapons heal, Blood magic provides shields, Swords deal DPS, etc -- and the result is ultimately a little more restrictive than Guild Wars (1), except very little in the game makes these equipment ""roles"" explicit, leaving all of that to discovery (by which I mean the wiki). The absence of proper ""levels"" in the game is just as fake -- you'll still be stomped flat if you wander too far ahead of your ""level"" (or encounter a higher-level player in PvP), and you'll trounce anything below your ""level"" -- the game just hides all of that information from you. The game doesn't ""unleash"" you in any way; it just trades your leash for a shock collar of painful trial-and-error.The controls and netcode are terrible. And yet, somehow, despite the fact that your player character controls like a fish flopping around on an ice rink, Funcom had the gall to include a significant emphasis on jumping puzzles in TSW. (Full disclosure: this review was the product of after two hours' rage, trying to glide my fish up *two jumps*, complete with skidding about, unregistered jump keys, jumps of inconsistent height and distance, and random rolling around.)Sadly, the puzzles in TSW are often painfully vague, or utterly tedious. You WILL need to look up many of them from a wiki, and you WILL want to after dealing with some of these quests. For examples: translating morse code for a pattern in a blinking light that you aren't directed towards; translating phrases into *broken* Latin for computer passwords; learning a demonic alphabet so you can type more broken Latin (thankfully provided) into runes on the floor. There's a few good puzzles interspersed, but unfortunately most of them completely miss the mark.Overall, the game just isn't worth playing as a primary MMO. If it goes on sale for $10, consider picking it up to play for a weekend or two; tour the game's environments, enjoy a few of the better puzzles, but don't pay so much that you'll feel obligated to play through the unending piles of awful that this game also offers.

												After buying and playing The Secret World, I knew getting Ultimate Edition was the absolutely right thing to do. It's story & lore beats most of the single player RPGs. All dialogues are voiced, graphics are great compared to other MMOs.Also, there are some crazy missions/puzzles. For example, a while ago I did the Red Handed quest.______________In first tier, there are sick people with some listed symptoms, you need to give them the right drugs.For the first patient, I googled *""spasm in jaw muscles, breathing problems""* it turned out to be tetanus. Then I checked for it's treatment on Wikipedia:http://i.imgur.com/26exBVI.jpgGived Diazepam to the patient.The first 3 patients were easy but the 4th had an untreatable disease (can't remember now, vampire bite or something); but the doctor's father had worked on it, so I checked his diary.http://i.imgur.com/FPNWAYm.jpgIt was obvious that they were elements, I tried to use first letters of English equivalents instead of Latin, but that didn't work.Then, http://i.imgur.com/TJFz66Z.jpgI wrote down the atom numbers of the elements; and then looked for the letter in the alphabet's n'th place.The message was this:“I Asked The Old Drinkers at the Tavern About My Father Some Recalled He Spent Nights With His Local Mistress There. “Good with a pitchfork and that is not all” This woman is long gone, but perhaps something remains.”Went to the tavern, checked the rooms and this was there:http://i.imgur.com/RFq8E6v.jpgIf you strip away the holiness from this message, the truth of my research will be revealedThere are holy places in the village. At the holy church there is a holy man. That holy man owns a holy book.

												An above average Buy to Play MMO, recommended if you are getting this on sale and are looking for a singleplayer experience in an MMO. Game has promising ideas, but implementation leaves much to be desired and Funcom suffered financially as a result. Graphics:Nice artstyle and atmosphere but overall graphics is not the game strong points. Animation and graphic quality are average at best while optimisation isn't very good (I have better frame rate and less stutter on Black Desert Online with many more player character onscreen compared to TSW not so populated first few zones). Cutscenes are abundant but due to not-so-good animation they are boring most of the time to watch. Gameplay:Interesting non-class based mechanic but still follow the traditional holy trinity which is good. Interesting puzzle approach to quests, but puzzles are not on par with say The Longest Journey and much of the time require you to surf the internet to find the answer. Apparently the game has an in-game web browser just for this purpose. Combo system is so-so, there are MMOs that handles combo much better. Overall gameplay is not mechanically complex as Anarchy Online. It's neither a sandbox nor a themepark MMO, probably somewhere between a sandpark (the like of ArcheAge and Black Desert Online) and themepark (of WoW or Final Fantasy XIV). Can't comment on group content yet as I have not touched it, but the singleplayer experience is meh if you are actually compare it to singleplayer game. I can't help but be disappointed this wasn't a singleplayer game from the beginning, cutting the wasted resource on MMO part to help refine and polish what could have been a great singleplayer action-RPG.Story:Interesting and well written, but nothing groundbreaking. Maybe I have played too many RPGs over the year so it's hard to impress. Too bad Ragnar Tornquist left much early on, but then again the new Dreamfall Chapters wasn't as well received as The Longest Journey and Dreamfall Chapter either. Is it because ""we've seen it all"" that we keep getting disappointed by further creations in the same veins?			"

												This is a real treasure!The game looks and plays like an mmorpg; mediocre (sorry, mmo-fans). The content and lore is of a level I have not seen in a lot of games. Through the latter I'm getting immersed in a world of fiction and one that borders our own conspiracy culture, history and beliefs. I highly recommend this game, especially if you don't mind solo-exploring (yes, it is a mmo, but it's as multiplayer as you want it to be; not necessary), if you're into conspiracy culture, myths, monsters, puzzles (please try solve them yourself, it feels so good to solve them) and don't mind closing the curtains and locking yourself in for a couple of days.It is totally worth it. Listen to all the conversations (exhaust all your options), read all the lore, do as much sidequests as you can, and this will be worth more to you than it costs. Also; a bottle of wine works well alongside.			"

												Ever heard of a single player MMO? No? Neither have I but if you were imagine something so obsurd you would soon imagine ""The Secret World"".The world is pretty big and open with plenty of quest givers strewn about. With this you can explore and kill with friends but the story missions are almost all singleplayer. These missions are what makes the game so great. Many are investigation missions with criptic clues and puzzles. They actually encourage you to leave the game and use the internet as a research tool trusting that you will return. I have never seen a game with so much confidence in its design as to let you leave and know you will be back.Also, no monthly fee is a huge bonus. It takes away the pressure to play play play just to get your moneys worth.			"

This game have many epic stories and puzzles i very enjoy watching every video in game. In my opinion this is how modern mmo need to look like these days. Would i recommend, yes 100%. From all listed above mmos i would give number 1 place for secret world. Yes its even better than wow for me. I played Wow about 1 year but i didnt like the story as much as Secret World. Wow quests more boring and less fun same as Dungeons and Raids, i dont want to judge Wow but if you looking for a new mmo try The Secret World.			"

												TRANSMIT - initiate Steam signal - RECEIVE - initiate review sequence - JOIN US - initiate purchase protocol - WITNESS - The Secret World.Initiate overview.The Secret World is a modern day setting MMO, which is already fairly unique, but isn't the game's only peculiarity. It has a heavy focus on story and atmosphere, the combat system deviates from the usual MMO formula, and many other preconceptions are either tweaked or totally changed from what people might be used to. The game also has a big focus on customization, allowing players to dress any way they like, and make any skill build they want for a very flexible experience.Initiate positive reinforcement.The game's best asset by far is the story. If you can get into it, it's REALLY good, specially the deeper you go, and the more you advance through the Issues of content. The cast of characters is also well developed and entertaining to listen to, really selling you on the setting and what's going on. The quest design is also very interesting: there's not only fetch quests or ""kill 10 of this enemy"" quests, there's also puzzle quests, or quests that require stealth, even quests that require you to investigate to find an answer, using resources such as Google or the Bible.Beware. The dark side.However, the game isn't without shortcomings. For some, the combat might feel a bit lackluster and simple. While I enjoy it the way it is, and as you play you unlock the more fun to use skills, some of the animation or skill effects are a bit underwhelming. The graphics of the game, while overall great looking, can feel a bit dated or have minor errors sometimes. Finally, the game is known to have plenty bugs, from visual errors, to getting stuck, or even failing a quest because of them, but most have easy solutions and workarounds.Dark days are coming.Overall, I love this game to bits, and is probably up there with Final Fantasy XIV for my favorite MMO. Its issues are many, and some quite obvious, but the good aspects surpass the bad ones by far. I encourage anyone remotely interested in the game to give the free 10 day trial a shot, you will probably be surprised.Our wisdom flows so sweet. Taste and see.			"

												______________________________________Updated/Revised @ 100 hours______________________________________WARNING: This'll likely be long.Firstly, I'd caution social MMO fans that TSW is not the kind of MMO to which you're probably accustomed. While there are many social features here (such as raid-only dungeons, a kind of ""buddy system"" designed to connect likeminded players, etc.), TSW feels a lot more like a single-player game with multiplayer options than the other way around. It's HIGHLY immersive and, in my humble opinion, best suited for roleplayers and hardcore ARPGers than casuals or social butterflies.As for immersion, one of the things I like most about TSW is that it truly makes you CARE about the characters and the stories it provides for you as a player. Cinematics accompany nearly every main or story quest-giving NPC and your quests are capped to better ensure that you take your time while exploring the regions available to you. The stories are very much alive in this game.It's also a true horror fan's wet dream, going far beyond cheap jump scares and the same old monster grinds over and over again. Sure, there are ""kill quests"" which require you to knock off a dozen of the same mob and you may get tired of seeing zombies around every corner by the time you've made your way through most of the Savage Coast, but you'll also be tracking down the pages of discarded horror novels and following in the characters' footsteps. You'll be battling haunted theme park rides and discovering hidden Illuminati archives. You'll be learning all about the woeful fate of Andy's kittens. It makes the monotony of creature killing so much less monotonous and (in some cases) gets a teensy bit difficult to play comfortably alone in the dark.  Key things to remember if you're just getting started:-The leveling system is less about the prestige of character level and more about your combat build, with an emphasis on faction rank and ability combinations. -The crafting system is a little (read:extremely) tough to master at first, but once you've gotten it down, it becomes a fun sort of mad science.-The dungeons are incredible and well worth the effort of LFGs. -You WILL change your mind a half a dozen times about which weapons you want to use. -You WILL get frustrated trying to figure out how to complete some of the investigative quests -You WILL break down and Google how to solve at least one of the aforementioned quests because the game isn't holding your hand.-You WILL die. A lot. -The community is there to help you. They're very kind as a whole and I've personally never seen anyone trolled for not knowing how to do something. Don't be scared to reach out if you need help.The most important thing to bear in mind about TSW, I think, is that it requires patience and a passion for discovery. If you're looking to barrel through a game that'll make you feel like a god from the word ""go,"" try a different MMO. If, however, you'd rather be elbow-deep in the lore of the old gods and feel like you're literally lost in a world of unending madness, play the Secret World.Masterfully written, beautifully executed. It's the best MMO I've ever played.			"

												I like the premise of this game, and to be honest I like many of the mechanics of the game, but sadly it fails as a MMO. While the missions are nice, with really quite unnecessary cutscenes that are just really nice bonus content, a lot of the game seems to be devoid of players who are below Q10; at least on the server I was playing. This means you don't really get to play dungeons and have to focus on missions to ""level"" and gear up. You can play the auction house, but there's too large a divide between those who can farm high-Q areas and those who can't; basically items are either pennies or gazillions, which translates to *not very good* and *completely unaffordable/above your Q-level until you've grinded away hours of your life*.If you ignore this, and focus on the game as a mission-based RPG, it's not bad. Problem is, it's a grindy RPG, and unless you're one of the dedicated few, there's better RPG's out there. While I wouldn't *discourage* anyone from buying it if they wanted to try it out, ultimately it means I wouldn't recommend it to a friend.			"

												Not your typical MMO this one.  It has a lot of the staple MMO tropes with quest based progression and the ""Holy Trinity"" of Tanks, DPS, and Healers...it does hold a special place in my heart.   The investigation aspects of this game are amazing and it's quite clear the writers took a lot of time to make sure that you would get involved in the lore of the store they're trying to tell.  Even in the first zone there are missions that require you to understand latin, know 16th Century composers, and be able to determine where to look off of very little info given. While the combat system is rather bland, and it once again follows the typical MMO tropes of follow a quest line through a zone...I can say it held my attention for the many hours I played (Even though it says I've played 14 I have much more then that due to their launcher being derpy.)  I would suggest picking this up full price if you're intrigued about the storyline and are looking for an MMO to try out...or wait till it goes on sale and pick it up for you and a couple of friends. I do however warn you, if you're looking for the typical WoW style gameplay, it's not here.  If you don't like reading, or using your head then the investigation missions might not be for you. (And yes you can look up the answers online...but whats the fun in that?)  "

Making character builds and running the fun dungeons are especially enjoyable.+ Fun dungeons with interesting bosses and only few trash mobs+ Many character customization and outfit options, with clothing stores, a barber, and a plastic surgeon+ Unique atmosphere for an MMORPG blending together horror, fantasy, conspiracy, and pop culture+ The mega server structure allows everyone to meet up and play together+ Full interface mod support, with tons of useful mods available- Performance can be demanding, there are quite often FPS issues, with the interface being a main culprit- PvP options are limited and the reward system is still not optimal			"

												Think 'Stranger Things', the MMO. It's got a great story, great storytelling, an immersive atmosphere unlike any other MMO out there, and is very flexible about your playstyle. You can solo your way through, gear up through PVP, run dungeons, all the good stuff. The developers actively push out new missions in content packs that you can buy (or get for free if you're subscribed), kind of like what Elder Scrolls Online does. It's definitely worth a try if you're curious.			"

												Somewhere in a desolate hotel room there's a guy starting to realize that eternal fate has turned his back on him.""It's 2 A.M., the fear has gone."" he says ""I'm sitting here waiting, the gun is still warm. Maybe my connection is tired of taking chances."" Taking a deep breath, he continues, ""Yeah, there's a storm on the loose, sirens in my head. I'm wrapped up in the silence, all circuits are dead. I can not decode, my whole life spins into a frenzy.""  Frustration is shown in his eyes, as he paces back and forth. Then it hits.""Help, I'm stepping into the twilight zone. This place is a madhouse, it feels like being cloned!"" screaming, banging his fist upon the wall of his empty room. ""My beacon's been moved under the moon and star. Where am I to go, now that I've gone to far?"" Soon you will come to know when the bullet hits the bone.""I'm falling down a spiral, destination unknown. A double-crossed messenger, all alone. I can't get any connection, I can't get through. Where are you?"" Well, the night weighs heavy on his guilty mind, this far from the borderline. When the hit man comes, he knows damn well he has been cheated.			"

												You'll have to excuse me because I like to write long reviews.In my opinion ""The Secret World"" is an MMO that does everything right. Solid gameplay with a fantastic questing system. This game doesn't disappoint. Every character you meet feels different from the rest, there's no running to npc's taking a quest and skipping through all the quest text. Each mission you take has its own little story and cutscene. Some quests require you to complete others first, in which certain characters will warm up to your character and tell you more of their backstory, making it feel like your actually making a difference. I can't say much about the story in MMO's as most tend to be okay at best but I actually enjoy this game for its story, it incredibly rich on lore and I feel as if I know more of what happens in The Secret World than I do in real life.Purchasing the expansions (labeled ""Issues"" in the game store) has added much more to this game. A new verity of weapons to choose from such as Chainsaws and Flamethrowers, to RPG's and Quantum magic. With the latest addition of Tokyo added AEGIS armor into the game, which is sort of like a rock, paper scissor combat in which you must match your damage type to the enemies armor type to do damage before you can physically harm them. The Combat system""The Secret World"" eases you slowly into its combat, allowing you to train on test dummies at the start of the game to decide on which starting weapon is best suited to you, then you'll quickly acquire a second weapon which allows you to mix and match up to 7 different skills on the hotbar from each of the skill trees from your weapons, many of which can be mixed together to create powerful skill combinations. At later stages of the game, the combat begins to climb in difficulty adding buffs to the mobs you fight, such as Spectres in graveyards phasing in and out of reality changing their physical and magical damage resistances. With the current addition being the AEGIS system.The StoryIts hard to explain the story without containing spoilers, the Story for ""The Secret World"" is incredibly well written and I have enjoyed every minute of it so far. It has a good mix of serious dialogue with a few jokes thrown in the lighten things up. The characters are written really well, there's a handful of characters that are written so that you can understand them emotionally and then there's a fair few characters that are written so that you will dislike them. Each character in the story is varies from each other and keeps the story fresh and entertainingContent (""Issues"")To a certain extent I feel as if this is where the game dropped the ball slightly. Issues 1 through 6 added a good chunk of extra story to the game and felt as if they were worth the money, considering the most you pay for an expansion is around 10 pounds I wasn't expecting a huge amount of content, but atleast something to keep the game fresh for a while longer. Issues 7-8 felt a bit lacking as apposed to its previous Issues. Issue 7 adds an extra bit of story to the Transylvania portion of the game and was fun to play, but as soon as I found myself having a good time with it, it was over. Issue 8 is where my main gripe is at. Issue 8 included the area, well I should say room ""Venice"". In Venice you can take part in scenarios, in which you must keep 2-3 groups of survivors alive through 3 waves of enemies, with a boss at the end of each wave. The amount of survivors alive at the end of the three waves determine how many ""Seals"" you will acquire at the end. The scenarios are a nice addition to the game, but are incredibly repetitive. Having Issue 8 allows you to take part in three different scenarios, not owning Issue 8 leaves you with 1 scenario to take part in. Scenarios can be completed by yourself, as a duo or as a full group. The maximum amount of seal you can acquire is determined by the difficulty of the scenario you undertake. The easiest difficulty will give you around 5 seals and each scenario has a 18 hour cooldown before you can attempt it, and a 45 minute cooldown if you fail it. In a recent patch the need for getting 80 seals to proceed to Tokyo has been removed to just completing the first training mission in Venice, which allows you to move straight onto the next part of the story. However you can still undertake missions in Venice to aquire powerful gear.All in all ""The Secret World"" is a very well created game with a lot of time and care spent in its creation. I would highly recommend this game to any MMO player and strongly suggest that they stick with it. As each issue adds even better things to the gameUpon the recent patch which changes both the combat, gear and story progression my final rating for this game has changed to     10/10			"

												Best singleplayer pc rpg questing game ever. Also it is online and has horriterrimegaultrabad group content. Play it like a singleplayer game, or duo with a friend and the quests will drop your jaw.There are no character levels in a sense, you get skill points and spend them accordingly to get a variaty of skills from the giantish skill wheel, and ability points to pump into your weapons and gear levels. It's a somewhat neat system, but it feels like it's only really there to overcomplicate the ""no character levels"" gimmick when in reality there are levels because you have to pump ability points into gear levels then you are rated by what level gear you are wearing. One of the main reasons why the group content is so bad, the dungeons have a recommended gear level but everyone at base gear level wants to go in asap and get carried / bring down the group.The multiplayer aspect isn't actually that bad, but the playerbase makes it horrible. There tends to be the elitist group that doesn't allow anyone to join or even try to learn the content, then the OMGLETSGO base level players who want to get carried through all the content. The dungeons are pretty well made, focusing more on movement and awareness then mindnumbing loldps.Now the quest system is a whole new monster. The quest system is built for replayability and actually makes you think and work for it the first time through. The quests are basically placed so when you finish one quest, you should be within earshot of another to pick up, and depending on which quests you choose, your route can change when replaying areas. The quests aren't the normal ""go here"" ""pick this up"" ""defend this person"" quests, these will actually make you think and make use of the in-game browser. The first area alone will make you translate latin, find secrets in paintings and artists, connect symbols to in-game items, decipher a nursery rhyme, and figure out meanings of cryptic messages. For examgle ""Time is the province of Kings and Gods. The hands of time point to truths written by Kings in the words of God.  The path is opened to the enlightened."" is just one of the clues during an investigation mission. All the quests in the game are also given a cooldown when finished so you can replay them and get the full xp again; so you can actually play through the same area as much as you want with no penalty, although higher level area will give better xp so you can get some of the higher tier skills easier.The game is a bit pricey but don't hesitate to pick it up on sale for a steal. Long as you treat it like an online singleplayer game, you won't be dissappointed. The investigation missions are definitely worth it.			"

												This was without a doubt, the most amazing MMO experience I ever had in my life. I started back in the good 'ol days when Cyberion City was around in 1993. Then the Diku, Merc, Circle MUDs came out. Then there was Ultima Online, then EverQuest and so on. I built and assaulted fortresses in DaoC and Lineage 2, I enjoyed WoW, was blown away by the storylines of SWTOR and ran through Neverwinter and so many others. None of that compares to The Secret World. The missions, the character progression, the amazing lore and storyline that bleeds into the real world and back. Playing the investigation missions (no cheating) and figuring them out has been more rewarding than many single-player games ever. I loved how the game created mass-instances so immersion was rarely broken seeing hundreds of players running around.  I loved how I could change my builds and change my roles on the fly. That my gear wasn't tied to how I looked at all and I could be whoever or whatever I wanted to be. I felt the pervasive fear of the unknown, the shock and rage at the atrocities of the Orochi Group, the love for Emma, the wild and awe-inspiring raids or dungeons. I was stunned, surprised, and dismayed, and overjoyed at the secrets to behold upon reaching the dark tower. I was there to help the residents of New England, breaking the curses, learning about its secrets and histories. I learned more about the majesty and wonder of Egypt than I had ever before. The brazen adventures of fun as I felt like James Bond or Indiana Jones thrilled me. I liked the weekly challenges, the combat (yes its far better than just waiting for silly things to proc with the slow beat of a ""normal"" mmo combat system) with its dashes and rolls and mixing magic and guns in all their glory.Yet I can't recommend the game anymore. Because instead of making new content, they've decided to kill the game. They're launching a new game with a graphics makeover, screwing over all the original players (you have to start all over again from freshstart), and this old, beautiful game is (as of today) now officially a dead world, a dead game. Its joins its brethern like Anarchy Online. Still running, but dead inside, never to see anything new again. Maybe you'll want to try the new game (SWL), but with a dumbed down combat system and streamlined gameplay, its going to be a sad, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ version of its former self.			"

												The quests in this game are mind blowingly awesome.  I've played dozens of MMOs and none of them can compare to TSW for questing and environment.  This game knocks atmosphere out of the park.The combat system, however, leaves quite a bit to be desired.  Although the skill tree itself is very interesting and allows for really fun and unique builds, the animations are wonky, combat feels slow and boring.Character generation is also not a strong point of the game, making a character that isn't fugly is quite a challenge.  Good thing there are tons of costumes available in game to help you cover up your ugly mug.Still, that quest system though.  Love it.			"

We see you looking at this game review. Your mind undecided on whether to commit to the purchase or not. Take your time, there is no need to rush, the sale will continue for a time and then leave only to return again at a later point. Like the flash of a firefly in the summer heat.You wonder, what does this game have to offer for you sweetling. Look above, there in lies the answer you seek. So many things to loosen your grip on your hard earned cash. What's more there is advice we can give, of places you can go to bond with others like yourself. To seek assistance with the things that go bump.Beware sweetling, this is not a battle of good vs evil, those are constructs of human design. No, the moral scope is far more gray than what you'd expect. You are not a paragon of heroics or the bringer of evil....you are merely a bee that is attempting to do what you can to hold Dark Days at bay....however....It's too late for everything is true and Dark Days are here. Good luck sweetling.			"

												I'll start by saying that so far, The Secret World is probably the best MMO that i've ever played.The storyline is solid, the missions are submersive and even the side missions tie into the main story somehow. It's one of these games where it feels worth doing every possible mission and exploring everything. Some of the missions are rather difficult and will require you to translate morse code, ancient hieroglyphics, binary and the like. There's no handholding involved here and will have you do some true detective work. You are given a In-Game browser to assist you in your investigation missions. The graphics engine works well with the game design and the music is very suiting to the Lovecraftian atmosphere you find yourself in. And as far as i have experienced, the community seems friendly and adult. I haven't run into many other players personally, but i think it suits the apocalyptic mood. It does have a good size player base so the wait for a group event or dungeon is never long.If you want to try out a MMO that is different and engaging? Then you should give this one a try! "

												I'm new to the game, but here are my first impressions.- Graphics are subpar. They aren't TOO bad, but yeah, they're pretty outdated.- Animations are wooden and somewhat awkward. The game isn't that old, so I'd expect slightly better combat animations and smoother character models.- Pretty generic combat. Tab-target, mash keys, watch them trade hits until one drops dead. It isn't that boring, but in this day and age MMOs are moving towards more action-style combat.+ Great setting and theme, with all the secret societies and Lovecraftian monsters. You get to be in the Illuminati and fight Cthulhus. How awesome is that!?+ Engaging and unique quests. Many of them don't hold your hand and direct you to some place to kill some monsters. You have to put on your detective cap and figure things out for yourself. Figure out the code to unlock a safe, hack into computer systems, etc. Or you can pull out the wiki, but that's no fun.+ A huge degree of freedom in the way of character building and progression. No levels, game doesn't pin you to a class, you're able to do whatever the hell you want as long as you work for it.+ A deep and engrossing narrative, which seems to be the main selling point of The Secret World. The voice acting and storytelling are top-notch, and that's saying something because I'm a freak for storyline in videogames. I daresay it's on par with many of the story-heavy singleplayer RPGs of today. It's well-crafted, immersive, and absolutely mesmerizing.So far I'm loving this game. MMOs like this are a real treat -- not a game, but a world to explore and interact with, much like Mabinogi and Guild Wars 2. At this rate, The Secret World may become my new favourite MMO. Its overall style and design is right up my alley.			"

												This is not a bad game, but certainly no masterpiece.It used to be a subscripton game ($15 per month), now it's buy to play, meaning you buy it and don't pay anything more to play. Well, that's the theory. The problem is that you won't be getting a lot of contents at max level, unless you fork up the money for the socalled Issues (content packs). As far as I know, you get the game with updates up to and including Issue #4, while the rest (currently up to #10) has to be paid for.About questing in this game: it has often been said that this game does not have quest hubs, quests are found when exploring. This is BS. There are certainly quest hubs, and the quest you're supposed to find while exploring, are mostly impossible to not find, since you'll either do other quests in such areas, or move though them while going somewhere else. Many quests counts as ""main quests"", and these have one extremely annoying issue: if you already have one, you can't get another unless you accept that the first one is cancelled.Funcom tried to make a combat system with an advanced skill-up system, but (imo) they failed miserably. Though it's not recommended, it's possible to to go through all the contents while never using more than 2 or 3 abilities/spells at any time. That why many jokes about describing the whole conbat system like this appeared: ""press 1,1,1,1,1,2 - repeat and never change"".So, is it worth it?Well, not the full price. This game if often on sale here or elsewhere. If you wanna try it, grab it then. Imo, the game isn't as innovative as Funcom tries to make it sound. To begin with, it feels new and fresh, but it quickly becomes repetitive and average. And that's when you realise that there are better options out there.			"

												I can dress like Indiana Jones and whip the f*** out of things. 10/10.       In all seriousness, this is hands down the best MMO I've ever played, and ironically it doesn't feel like one. I've poured every hour I have into this game alone, without friends. It feels like a singleplayer game of massive proportions, with elements of multiplayer. The great thing about the game is that you can play in a variety of ways. Want to solo the entire main game? (Which I did) You can. Want to play through with a group of friends? You can.  The game isn't like any other MMO, your quests don't consist of ""track this enemy, kill 10 of these and then collect  these etc"". You solve actual, real problems in quests called ""Investigation Missions"". The game comes with a built-in web browesr for a reason! The game WILL make you think long and hard, as well as outside of the box. (One mission has you learn morse code!) It's an absolute blast and I can't imagine how much more fun (and easier) it would be to solve missions and hunt down clues with friends. However, there are also your typical combat-based missions as well. The game also covers a vast array of themes and atmospheres- you can go from fighting a zombie outbreak to trekking through a scorching desert. If you're a lore-aholic then you'll be in heaven, the game rewards players for having a watchful eye and putting two and two together. There are also many cultural allusions in the game, too many to count- Although a memorable one is a mission chain in issue 6 that's obviously inspired by Indiana Jones (No joke, you can get the outfit and whip, which is pretty useful!). Graphics wise this is a really good looking game, better than most if not all other MMOS- however I do play at 1440p with max settings. Some areas may look a bit worse than others, but the game holds up fantastic. I reccomend to use DX11 with this game, because there are some truly clever uses of it.     Some people complain about the combat, and I didn't like it at first either- However, once I learned the fundamentals and played for a bit, I find it VERY enjoyable. There's a plethora of different weapons and abilities you can assign to your characters, perhaps the most I've seen in an MMO. There are dungeons and raids as well of course, but if you don't have friends (cough cough) it can be hard to find groups and complete them. This is a shame, because the few instances where I do find a group, it's such a blast to fight through the dungeons. The community is fairly small! I've been playing TSW for almost two years now, and always find myself coming back. The game does recieve updates and new content, however once you complete the main game you'll have to buy what's called ""Issues"" to further the story, which is basically end-game content. All in all, even if you don't like MMOS, I STRONGLY suggest you give this game a shot! TLDR; If your're looking for a good looking game to sustain your attention for a long time, and enjoy solving mysteries in a world that's oozing with lore- give this game a shot. It doesn't feel like a typical MMO!			"

												*this review was written for the original game The Secret World, changes made for SW: Legends changed none of the aspects mentioned*Let me just start by saying that this is by far the best MMO I have ever played and that this game completely destroyed my life - if you have anything important to do, like a deadline coming up, don't get into it. Now, on to the pros and cons. Pros: + Good graphics for an MMO + Extremely immersive, it's got a great story.+ Great voiceovers. + Well scripted, fully animated and detailed cutscenes for every mission (instead of just text and/or NPC voice that you normally see in online games). + TONS of content. + Your faction choice does not impact gameplay, you're not forced to choose a class and there are 500+ abilities to choose from, plus countless augments and effects, making characters really unique and flexible. You can do whatever you want, however you want, with whatever you want. + Very enjoyable multiplayer, the community isn't very large, but everyone is extremely polite, mature, respectful and helpful. No-one is going to call you a noob or any other name if you mess up, and no-one is going to make kitchen-jokes if you play as a female character. I promise you. If you let people know you're new or having difficulties with something, you'll find that a lot of players are willing to give you the equipment they have extra and they don't need, help you set up your build, give you tips or just come and save your ♥♥♥. + Missions are repeatable (with the exception of faction-leveling and some story missons). + Grouping makes the mission is truly a collective effort, meaning that not every single player in the group has to go through the tasks (compared to some MMOs where it feels like playing single player game a few feet away from eachother).  You still have to stay close together in order for completing the tasks to count for everyone. + Extensive DLC once you've finished the main game, and they're totally worth it. + Amazing investigative quests and puzzles that really make you think and depend on your overall knowledge or make you do actual reasearch online. + Tying in with the last +, the game has an in-game browser, so if you get stuck, you have a bug or you want to google for dungeon strategies, you can do it in-game. Cons: - The ""fast travel"" system Agartha is very inconvenient. - Many instances in the story mission are solo instances for no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ reason. Most of the content is playable in co-op (and is much more enjoyable that way), but there is no reason non-faction-specific missions should be solo player.  And yet they are. - In-game items, boosts and modifications are ridiculously expensive to buy with respect to the money you earn doing missions. - Due to the fact that there aren't many players, you might find it can take quite a while to find a group for a dungeon run. It's even worse for lairs, given that you usually need over 5 players to do a lair run succesfully and it's very hard to get people of the appropriate QL together to do them. Unless you're hosting a wicked TSW party at your place. - The game makes you dependent on itself, so expect to spend money on DLC. You'll try to fight it. You'll cry. But you'll also feel like you need it. Meh: +- Combat system is a little weird at first. However, once you get used to it, it's not bad, I've seen a lot worse. +- I'll stick to my point about the investigation missions being amazingly thought-out, however I do find that a lot of them are not completable without the help of a walkthrough. It's cool that they think of detail and challenge, but ask yourself this - how good is your Romanian? Knowledge of Egyptian mythology and American literature? Can you correctly find the Hebrew equivalent of an Arabic word? How are you with Morse and binary codes? What about hexadecimals? Good? Congratulations, you will be able to complete the challenges with your own head. Otherwise...It's still a great challenge to correctly identify the clues and do research. All 'n' all 11/10 would spend hours of my life on this game.			"

												This game has an Engaging storytelling that is unique to any MMO I have played with cinematic cutscenes for every main  story mission. The mystical, creepy, and even frightening enviornments keep things fresh, Each quest although there are some cookie cutter MMO quest layouts. The overall questing does not feel grindy each quest moves you foward to the next zone and ready to explore something the real thing that stands out from this game are the Investigation quest which force you to use your gray matter and think outside the box to solve AR riddles and puzzles. Combat is basic and is not mindblowing, but its fairly enjoyable. The player customization is fantastic it can feel like a cash grab somtimes, but its completely optional since all clothing is just for a cosmetic purpose.  Community is realy friendly and willing to help you out with many question especially if you join sanctuary chat room. Overall this feels like its own new brand of MMO. I would Definitely recommended.			"

												Others have posted highly detailed (and rather excellent) reviews of this great game, so I'll simply offer this anecdote instead:I was surrounded by a horde of monsters, with my health draining rapidly and my end looming closer.  Any hope of survival was fading alongside my depleting health, when out of the blue, some random dude in tighty whities and a lurid green octupus on his head came running through, blades slicing through layer upon layer of foul rotting flesh with frenzied delight.  And as quickly as he appeared, he was gone, leaving naught but a carnage of corpses in his wake.Ergo, I post this review simply to say ""10/10, and a huge thank you to the dude in tighty whities"".

												Bought it for the story and Lovecraft feeling, still playing it for the community and the very end game content, despite the fact that the game runs at 10 fps in some areas with a GTX 1080. Even as a single player the story itself is worth every penny.			"

												Absolutely fantastic.  Hands down the best MMO I've ever played.  It keeps getting better with smaller ""stories"" DLC and larger ""issues"" reminiscent of expansions.  Highly recommended for anyone who finds conspiracy, para/supernormal ideas, and the unknown beyond even the smallest bit interesting.			"

												Very immersive mmorpg.It's the only game in the genre so far that was as unique as it claimed to be.This game can be enjoyed either solo or in group, the quests are fun, the dungeons are fun and the investigation missions are something I've never seen before. These missions take up a huge amount of time when doing them without a guide, but they are so rewarding once completed. This game is definiately worth the try.			"

												Fun, takes a little getting used to. Many areas are genuinely creepy. Interesting ""leveling"" system, its gear/ability based not leveling up. Capping would be getting all the decks filled out and getting top gear items. Well written, cool characters, good player base especially for RP.			"

												IntroductionI purchased The Secret World (TSW) in 2012 when it went buy-to-play, and have been extremely impressed by it ever since. This is a game I strongly encourage you to play!Disclosures/About MeI've been an RPG fan ever since around 1994, when I received my first Final Fantasy game on the SNES (followed by Chrono Trigger). I've been interested in MMOs primarily for their story and gameplay components. I have a lifetime subscription to LOTRO and was active on there for 5 years. I've played bunches of other MMOS, as well. Of all of them I've played, I can say that this is the one worth getting behind.ValueFrom a value perspective, this is a great buy. The actual games comes with tons and tons of content-- I'm ~109 hours in as of writing this review and haven't even gotten to the content not covered in the base game. The item market sells cosmetics (which you can also easily get in-game) and sell story content. This is great! As consumers, we're not being bombarded to buy meaningless junk (a la Neverwinter and, eventually, LOTRO). If there's content restrictions from the item store, it's on actual story content, and it's well worth the purchase. The developers are rewarded for creating great story content (not system unlocks or gameplay advantages), and us consumers reap the benefit.GameplayTSW is a nice blend of traditional MMORPGss and newer, AMMORPGS (action MMORPGs). There's dodging, but it's very straightforward and doesn't require ridiculous motor skills. The ability to play with crosshairs is a lot of fun. The gameplay is fluid and fast, and is very hard. This is a challenging game-- you won't get bored, but you also won't get frustrated.SystemsThere aren't many systems, but the ones that are there are great. Think of your skills like cards in Magic: The Gathering. You want to build a ""deck"" that is as powerful as possible. There is no respect cost, and a single character can unlock every skill in the game (no classes, although you will probably end up playing the ""pseudo-class"" you want based on the skills you like). More like the Elder Scrolls than any other MMO I've played. Plus, each skill (there are 588, according to a source online!) can be ""augmented"" to change its effects. We're talking a ridiculous amount of customization, optimization, and progression. It's awesome. :-)Warning, though: the amount of depth and intricacy in the systems means it will take a long, LONG time to learn. That's okay. I'm still learning things, myself. You can't permanently mess yourself up, though (since you can unlock everything on a single character), and learning while you go is a part of the idea of the Secret World!StoryThis is not a game that you should play for the main story, although it is good. Rather, the stories of the world are amazing, from Stephen King-- sorry, ""Sam Krieg"" to HP Lovecraft-- sorry again, ""Hayden Montag"". This is a living, breathing universe, and the sidequests are really the main attraction. If you're looking to power through, skip this game. If you want to be a part of something awesome and really dig into the implications, with full voice acting and lots of strings to connect, this is a great game!GroupingI have no idea. Sorry. I'm playing this like a single player RPG, and it's a great game for it. No need to group at all, from my ~109 hours in. I do not know if there is much group content, and if it is good.Closing thoughtsIf you're looking for an excellent RPG to invest your time in, carve out your niche, and experience a great story, this is where you should be. Highly recommended!			"

												I'm going to preface this by saying, that I hate questing.  I enjoy mindlessly zerging dungeon content.I spent 40 hours QUESTING in the FIRST zone with 2 different characters, because I wanted to try a different build...story is AMAZING.  I can't wait to see what endgame content is like, but even if it sucks, the several hundred hours i'll spend playing through the other story content by myself is worth it.			"

												If you do not want to hear about the special experience of another player then skip this review. I'm saying that because, personally, I prefer to have my own immersion and discoveries. It's important, to me, to play the game the way the designers meant it to be played, ergo it isn't fun for me to hear about solutions to the quests or how cool some event happened before I see the event myself.SELF CENTERED REVIEW FOLLOWS:I've never seen such a game, even a single-play game. The quests are unique and roughly fall into the catagories: combat; stealth; puzzle. I find that I thinking about the game while I'm doing something else and the puzzles are frequently the last thing I think about before falling asleep.Attention to detail is high everywhere. One thing you'll notice early on is the lack of duplicate scenery. For example, duplicate trees or buildings or rocks or fences or boats are unlikely.I'll add some things about dialog later.It's bewildering to me that this game even exists. The design team should publish a paper on their creative-side business management tactics.Recommended.			"

												Playing this game for quite a while now. Must say, I love this game. I always keep coming back to this game.There are three factions. Though the story stays the same and the results won't really change, it's fun to see the story from a different faction's perspective. The story is amazing, it's very emersive and engaging. It's uses real myths and urban legends to fuel the story. It's good, play it.If you like bees and want to feel special, go play it.If you like to get dirty and love filth, go play it.If you like Ankh, clothing, werewolves, evil Tony Stark Tech, bad people, vampires, classless progression, cool story arcs, interesting plot twist or maybe bees? Go play this game.If none of the above appeal to you, go play this game. It's still good.Pro's:- Amazing storytelling- Myths and urban legends- Classless system (515 abilities)- Be what you need to be at any place and any time- Make amazing roles (Need to tank?? go dpstank, leechtank, mitigation tank, bufftank or healtank)- Clothing is not based on gear- Bees- Giant birds that try to kill you- Everything else also tries to kill youCon's:- Endgame can get boring if you don't play with friends- Sometimes a little grindy- No Tilty or Bob boss- Not enough beesAnyway, go play it.

												Finally an adult MMO that I can enjoy. Nothing is spoonfed to you as TSW constantly requires you to think. There are tidbits of puzzles and many of the tedious quests can be challenging as you will need to find clues/hints to progress (which are not indicated with highlighted items). Some of the mobs are challenging too as they have a specific pattern you have to adapt to (think boss fights in those oldschool Asian fighting games).Some quests even require you to Google answers to puzzles. The lore is a bit jumbled up as everything is mashed up together. You'll get zombies, mages, secret societies, guns and swords in the same game. There aren't necessarily any Sci-Fi lore in the game though (ie. no aliens/technology).The community is still bustling after a couple years which is a great sign. I had expected this game to be dead but it's far from it. I'm sure it'll keep going for at least a decade.I rate this game a solid 8/10. It's extremely enjoyable and refreshing but there are some bugs/kinks that need to be worked out. Some better aesthetic options would be nice (like being able to modify what my facial structure looks like).			"

												I've played WoW i've played Guild Wars I've played a-lot of MMO's and None of them have sufficed. I'd even say I thought I hated MMO's as a whole and would never buy another.Then this game sneaks into my life out of nowhere. First time I play it i sink 2 hours into it never touch it again until 2 weeks ago.  2 weeks ago I start streaming this game on twitch and I fall in love with it. i meet new people playing it. i discover I enjoy doing all the quests. I love the spookyness to it. This is one of the best MMO's i've ever played. -pros Great communityExtensive combatspooky atmosphere perfect for halloweengreat clothing options and unlockable gear through just playing the game.Great Dungeonsreferences real life things like left for dead, google, 80's pop music etc.Great Halloween Events.Has unlockable items you can get by playing their other games.lots to do. atleast 100+ hours of gameplay in standard edition though I recommend you get the ultimate edition.Top notch voice acting Decent graphics-consEnemies can be really OP and you'll be forced to take them on 1 at a time to avoid being killed or have a high level player help you.can be a bit overwhelming at first.Confusing puzzles that require you to research vague clues to solve (how ever this is really fun if you like that stuff)In Conclusion The Secret World Is Fantastic for those who hate MMOs or just don't think they'd enjoy them.

Leaving the old reviews is extremely misleading since THIS game has not even been released and the Old version will still be playable.

												Easily the Best Questing and Lore of any MMO to date, all of it is extremely well written and thought out. Dungeons are well done; and character customization is fairly extensive and unique.The only Major Complaint I ever had with the game is that when you reach the post-updates end-game you slam into an extra wall of grind that is very tedious.This game is still worth it's price twice over to just to play through the quests and see the Lore; it really puts into perspective what an MMO can be when the developers actually put the time in on the small details.

Grab it for 70% off RIGHT NOW.  It is an mmo, and the combat can be a turn off at times, but the story is way too good to ignore for such a price. P.S.

												The Secret World features some of the most interesting and immersive missions as compared to any other MMORPG. The missions are fully narrated and unique, so you won't get bored reading blocks of text and completing repetitive tasks like in your typical MMORPG. Combat could use improvement, however.Another plus, you don't have to pay a monthly fee to play, and you can purchase additional issues if you want to progress in the storyline further.			"

												A beautiful MMORPG.This game is as beautiful as it looks on pictures, but only having beautiful look doesn't make the game perfect, The Worlds are beautifully designed and they look stunning. Like every MMORPG, this one is also filled with items that are look nothing like each other. (I loved how you can use gun and melee together).The best thing about this game is that ""IMO"" it doesn't feel like other MMORPGs like WoW or SWTOR. It feels more like Dragon Age MMO, because unlike other MMOs, this one is story driven, an amazing story that will make you want to keep playing.The only downside of this game is that it got many classic MMORPG elements, which is obvious, but  because of that I believe only or mostly MMORPG fans would enjoy this game for long... non-MMORPG players should aware of the repetitive missions (in solo).9/10 ""Strongly recommended for hardcore MMORPG fans""			"

However, the atmosphere of this game is impeccable. The setting, the ambience and music make it all feel creepy and compelling.

												I'm not much of a fan of MMO's, while I like the co-op aspect, I find they tend to be too much grind, and not enough story. The Secret World is something else though. The setting is unique and intriguing, full of mystery. Main quests have fantastic cut scenes which bring the world to life. My favourite type of quests are the puzzle quests. They can be difficult to solve and frustrating at times but you get such a sense of achievement when you figure them out. I love that you have to actually investigate, looking up bible quotes, mythology, morse code etc.  "

												First off, I'm giving this game a thumbs down because I am unable to give it a thumbs sideways.  I'm really torn on the game as there are elements that I love and elements that I loathe with a passion.  However, the negative elements are so mind numbingly bad that I cannot reccomend the game.Let's start off with the good.  The setting:  The Secret World takes place in the contemporary real world, except all the crackpot conspiracy theory crackpot secret society stuff actually exists.  Add to that a generous helping of Cthulhu Mythos, and you have a wonderful, interesting setting that's a very welcome break from the awfully worn out standard Tolkien-esque fantasy setting.  The Secret World also features terrific writing and great voice acting, on par with, or even exceeding, many single player games, never mind just MMOs.  It;s all rally interesting and really well done.Also, while the game has its share of standard FedEx and Kill X monsters quests, at least they are dressed up quite well with interesting backstory and delivery.  Plus the game features some cool investigation missions where you are not guided by map markers clobbering you in the face or the game holing your hand and walking you through the steps.  Instead you need to do research, reading lore, looking up figures, checking history of places, and figure out what to do and where to go on your own. (Figuring stuff out on your own, imagine that!)So this all sounds great and it could, and should, be a fantastic game, right?  Well then how come I gave it a thumbs down, then?  Sadly this game features some of the worst mechanics I have ever encountered in my some 30 years of gaming.  I am searching for a word to adequately express just how bad the mechanics are...  I guess ""atrocious"" is the best I can come up with, but I'm not sure it;s strong enough.  I cannot wrap my head around how a game was possibly made with mechanics this awful and how it made it past playtesting.  I can only guess that the person who designed the mechanics had severe brain damage and that Funcom has no playtesting whatsoever.  The combat is awful and boring, and is further marred by controls so poor and unintuitive that it makes combat maneuvering an exercise in frustration.  With enough practice you can sort of get the hang of the controls, but they will never be good or even adequate with any amount of practice.  They are just that abysmal.It's a testament to how great the writing and setting is that I continue to play this game.  The story and writing keep me going.  I cannot reccomend the game, however, with a clear conscience, because the mechanics are just so unbelievably bad.			"

												I give TSW an overwhelmingly positive 5 outta 5The community is fantatsic. The support is wonderful. The payment modle is fantatsic.I like this game because there are no traditional levels and no classes. You are free to focus on building the character you enjoy. You pick two weapons to use out of 9 total and your 8 active skills revolve around those weapons. You also get to pick 8 passives. Later in the game you get access to a support weapon, of which there are 4, that has its own passive and active skill. And there are dozens of skills for each weapon type. Putting a build together like this is fun and makes you really think about how everything works together. The great thing is you can have dozens of builds all with different weapons and skills. Even different gear.To be able to swap out your build as you need to is a HUGE awesome feature. Go from a dedicated tank to a support buffer in seconds. That's cool.There's 2 sides to this game... one is combat and the other is missions. On the combat side there is normal PvE grinding (which I find VERY statisfying for some reason), as well as nightmare areas that have stupidly powerful enemies you should get in a good group for. There are also dungeons which are group instanced raids of various difficulty.Missions are a bit more complex. Sure there are some 'go kill things' or 'run to X and get Z' but they are done with intresting bachground. The Secret World is telling you a story in every mission you do. You get to an area and have no idea what's going on. By talking to people, doing missions, exploring the area, actually obersving the monsters behaviors, and things like this... well it all offers you a small piece to what is going on, how it came to happen, and maybe even what happened to lead up to this. But it never fills in all the gaps. And it never comes out to tell you this stuff. You as a player need to connect the dots and really pay attention.This same theme is how the famous investigation missions are. They are like riddles or mysteries you have to figure out by doing lots of crazy things: researching a biblical theologian's works; logging into fake websites (which are suposed to be real in game); using goggle to do actual real research... its insane! And so staisfying!!! Presently I am stuck on one of these missions now. Sometimes I put a 1/2 hour into mulling over it. Sometimes I go to the RP social meet-up spot and actually role-play trying to do work on it... showing people my notes and sharing my thoughts asking for loose tips. Sometimes I take my research ideas online and surf real life counterparts to get more understanding about what the mission is about. Sure I could go to a cheat site but that would totally defeat the reason for the game! I can put the mission down and go kill things or do other more casual missions.The other thing I adore about TSW is the cosmetics. You don't have armor. You have stuff like talismens, rings, and charms which are not shown. So every item you see someone in is just a vanity style. The game has a lot of slots for items: head, face, neck, back, chest, legs, etc... so you can buy clothing items in game and mix/ match them up.TSW is a very hardcore game and not for everyone. I am the type to role-play, take my time with things, and really enjoy a story. This lets me do that beyond my wildest expectations.Sure its not perfect and I would love to see certain things added, such as player owned apartments, but its amazing as it is. If my review made you wanna try this game please friend me and I'll give you a free 3-day trial. Of course I get a little perk if you do this and buy the game, which I would appricate. I'd be glad to play with you and help teach you the basics too.I liked this game so much I spent $200 on it to become a grandmaster (lifetime membership).... but please don't be confused! The game is buy to own. There's an optional membership thingie you can get to give you special perks. If you buy the game you never have to spend money on it ever again unless you want dlc. But dude you kvae no idea just how much content is included in the basic $30 game, let alone the $60 massive edition.This is one of my fav all time games!!! I don't play it constantly because a lot of it is very brain racking and hardcore.			"

												Ever since the succes of World Of Warcraft every game in the MMO genre has tried to copy it's fantasy style.The Secret World is the original thing the genre needed.To put it simple,If you are a fan of games like Bloodbore, Resident Evil and Devil May Cry... if you like movies like Van Helsing and Underworld...Or you like TV shows like SupernaturalThis game is the MMO for you. It mixes the supernatural genre with light horror and really draws the player in.The gaphics are simple but pretty.When you fight it actually feels like you are the one doing the fighting, and not just commanding it.The game give you these open area's where you can ignore your main questline and explore and go sidequesting.And clothes you wear don't affect stats. So you can fully decide how you look.Only negative I can think of is that there is no above character chat text. Making you have to check the chatwindow a lot.			"

												Been playing this game for years, and will continue to play it.At first, it was hard to get into (about 4 years ago) when I had no idea what I was doing and no clue where to go - but with any MMO if you need a little help this community comes together in an excellent fashion.There are bugs, there are some things to be fixed; but you know what? The developers are actively listening and fixing things. This is the only community where I have seen one on one face time with Developers, GMs, Community Managers and more. It's one of the reasons why I still play this game, aside from the RP community.If you're thinking of buying this game but unsure? Why not catch it on a sale when it proffers the Complete edition for 70-70% off? Pay only 20$ where I, paid hundreds to get the content when it came out! (i.e. = Issues are about 10.00$ when they come out for standard issue. C.E.s are about 15.00$ ) Type of game where it has no classes, no levels (only ranks - up to 13), where you will eventually unlock everything and will be able to do anything your heart desires. And of course the storyline is superior to boot. I've never been so invested in wanting to see a new expansion but man everytime it does it's better than the last - in my opinion.TL;DR - Maybe not a game for everyone, but it's a damn good game.It's not your typical MMO.It's the Secret World.

												This happens to be the only mmo I’ve played where I’m not screaming into a pillow while I mindlessly grind terribly boring quests (yes, better than SWTOR), in fact I love questing in this game. You’ll want to take your time leveling up and exploring areas, the game actually encourages this by limiting how many missions you can do at one time; one main mission and three side missions. If you’re a chronic min-maxer and feel you  must  race through the leveling as if your life depends on it, there’s nothing stopping you I suppose but you’re missing out on what TSW does best and that’s story, lore and unique characters. As a returning player who hasn’t played endgame content from issue 12, I can’t comment too much on it. Despising the aegis system myself, I might be a little biased since all content from issue 9 uses it. Community is small but great. While questing you probably won't run into a lot of people, bonus in my books really.TL;DR: If you want an incredibly immersive experience filled with lore and fantastic stories then try this game.Edit: Looking at their steam store page, you'll see they've only listed the collectors edition for some issues which are priced around $30 (cheeky). The standard version of Issues can be bought through the TSW store for roughly $10 (1200 funcom points), so fear not, it's not as insanely expensive as it looks.			"

												""Best money i've spent on a game since Morrowind""This game is unique to itself like no other mmo to date. The ""Leveling"" system is interesting, allowing every character the ability to acheive every role in time.There is no ""Pay to win"" play is free after after initial purchase, with option to subscribe. However, subsribing does not give you ""pay to win"" features or OP items.The cosmetic variety is increadible, rarely do you see two people who look the same.All said and done... this game rocks, dont miss out on it!!!

												From the outset after your initiation, you're chucked into the worst map in the game, no matter which faction you choose. Well I say worst because the rest of them are amazing, and Kingsmouth (or whatever it's called) isn't a friendly place, but once you know what you are doing, and that is 'the missions' you'll start to get the hang of how the game works. I struggled hard to push myself and my coop partner into liking this game at that stage. We did a lot of talking and kept turning down missions because they were all ranked as too hard (which they were not). At the time, pre-steam nearly 2 years ago, it was bugged too, zombies popped up next to you whereever you were, like in the middle of a conversation. But getting through the first map, is what it's all about, specialise in one or two skills (preferably from your faction deck), and you'll never regret it, just think of it as an initiation, like having to sleep covered in toothpaste with your new phrat krew. Gameplay, story, immersion, skill... Soon you'll be lording it up.This is the best story driven MMO out there. Hands down.I just bought it again, so I have it on my steam account. That's how good it is, and now it has so much more content, and scenarios etc... Don't think twice about this one. Oh and the voice acting is amazing, you'll want to hear every line of dialogue, so don't forget to keep speaking to people until the white writing goes grey.And the Music? Dinna nunna ninna nunna ninna nunna ninna nunna ninna nunna ninna nunna...Also, Wendigo Way, and the a'kabs (Which are basically Wendigo's in disguise!)BUY ! BUY ! BUY !			"

												I love this game, and I hate it even more because of that.The good:The idea is awesome. Secret societies battling secret evil in our modern world. The characters look cool and there is good customization. The locations are really cool and each quest is well written and interesting.Investigation missions are great.The neutral:The skill system is not that great. There is little help in finding a good build in game. There is little sense of progression.Crafting is mediocre at best.The bad:Stealth missions are really annoying.Combat animations are wooden and just look bad.Difficulty of monster varies wildly between push over and whoops, why am I dead?Balance between different skills is bad. Some are OP while other should just be avoided.The horrible:Mission design. This is an MMO. So I will play with a group. Why are there so many forces solo missions in this? It is incredibly annoying when you play together and frequently the game sends you into solo instances. You can't build a synergy team of characters since each one of them MUST be able to survive on their own. From a story point it makes even less sense - if our heroes have been working together on a case, why would they suddenly split up to tackle the big baddie at the end on their own?This is made even more aggravating by the fact that there are missions in the main story line that you MUST complete to progress to the next zone that are solo and incredibly hard. So if you can't complete them you can't get help from anyone, you can't outlevel them and come back and try when you are stronger, because you are stuck in the same old zone and can't progress. Basically you can try over and over again until you get lucky or it*s game over. I have no idea why any MMO dev would consider this design wise. Basically you're telling the player 'you suck, we don't want your money!'Yeah, I hate it, but I hate the game.			"

												This is the game I keep coming back too. Been playing on and off since 2014. Its nice because the skill system lets you never build your character wrong. Don't like your current weapons? You can train in others.The missions and story lines are amazing. For once, I don't want to just skip through everything and rush to the combat.Even the missions are different. You have some missions that require actual research. Luckily they give you an in game web browser so you can look up translations or references. Player population may look low on steam, but that is because many users have a stand-alone version, or are using origin.If you like playing dress up, there are hundreds of costume pieces. I'm currently running around with a glowing unicorn head.There is a 10 day trial you can find on funcom's website. Try it out, you will be hooked.			"

												I bought this game in July 2016 only, due to absence of other interesting MMORPG on market released in 2016 so far. It's like your are Sherlock Holmes in the Arkham killng Illuminati. As far as i see, this game breaks all standards in MMO games genre. There are no similar game to compare. Freaking Cool Environment, Encounters and its paradise for everyone who loves questing and puzzle stuff. I'm not saying that this game is better than game ""A"" or game ""B"" e.t.c, but definitely The Secret World deserve very high rating. And it's truly amaze me when people saying like ""TSW is like - blah blah blah"". Tell it to my mom, the TSW by far is - Not Like. The game is quite unique in terms of character progression and all stuff like crafting and tallent system with mote than 500 active/passive tallent points available to learn. As i said, there are No similar game(s). At least i don't know any. Resume: Cool Game.There are no subscription fee required now (actual on Jul 2016).			"

												First of all, it takes time to get use to this game because it's very different than the other mmorpgs at the moment.The Secret World is set in a modern-day real world under attack from occult forces.The story inspires a lot from H. P. Lovecraft's works, the Indiana Jones franchise, and Stephen King's novels, and the player's character joins one of three world-controlling secret societies which are the real life myths;  Templars, Illuminati, or Dragon. Like many other MMORPGs combat is move based.The character is totaly free to redevelop their abilities on the go because there is no class system,you can use every weapon, every skill on the game just by learning those skills from the abilities screen.And to gain that ability points you just need to play the game thats all! ; killing mobs,doing mission,dungeons,pvp everything gives you ability points to purchase skills.Therefore, a player can be a tank, a healer and a dps at the same time just by changing his skills on the action bar. You can only use 7 active skills.			"

												Unbelievable game. I've played RPGs all my life and I've never had as much fun as I have with this game. There's a huge amount of content, the areas are deep and interesting, and every NPC has a lovable quirk that makes interacting with them memorable. I can't stress enough how detailed the world is and how critically that supports the gameplay! Also of note, I've found the art to be a lot less sexist than in other games; rather than chainmail bikinis and hulking dudes in tinsuits, the avatars are a lot more realistic and understated.Outside of the artistic aspects, it plays similarly to any MMO that you're used to. The skill bars are short (something I prefer). Interestingly, only 7 of your skills are active, and 7 are passive skills that are hidden during normal play. I'm just beginning to understand how deep the level of character customization can be.A very unique feature is the investigation quest, of which there are many. These quests give very little information at the outset and ask you to solve a puzzle, follow a trail, dig up some old mystery, etc. They are very challenging, and each time I play a new one I'm surprised again at the ingenuity of the game developers.This is an absolute STEAL at $30. I have only two problems: first-time startup was rickety and required some setup tricks on my part, but that took about 20 min to fix. Second, the game world is low on players, so you'll spend most of your time questing alone if you don't play with a friend.			"

												I tried playing during beta, and at the time it just didn't hit the spot.  I'm not entirely sure why; much of it was the same, although not as polished, and less forgiving.  When the Ultimate Edition came out, with all the expansions, etc, at a discount, I figured this would be my second try.  I really have not been able to stop playing since I got it (except sleep and food, begrudgingly).  If you want a new MMO to be addicted to, this is absolutely it.  Pros: -Atmosphere (horror/arcane/Lovecraftian/gothic - whatever you want to call it) - it's genius-Combat - fast-paced, fluid, not tremendously punishing (although not a walk in the park either, which is nice).  a ton of variety-""level"" progression - it really is very flexible.  Do what you want.  -gear and aesthetics are completely separate.  I love that I can change clothes like I do in real life without affecting my ability to cast blood spray at zombies.  Fickle and vain.  <3-Story / Characters - this stuff is very well developed.  In some ways it may have worked better as a single player game, but there have been a lot of times where another person has come along to save my Dragon hide, and it was great.  -A LOT of variety in quests.  Obviously a lot of killing and a small amount of collecting.  BUT, the investigation and stealth missions really take it up a notch compared to most MMOs I've played.  You will almost certainly need to go online to solve stuff! (built in browser).  There's also creative use of crafting during quests.  Cons: TBD.  JK - I do have some cons.  My biggest thing is really just my general dislike of MMO enemies and story progression.  The constant respawning when you least expect it, the ""grinding"" if you have to backtrack through an area, the lack of change in an environment, even when you complete major quests.  These are not even remotely unique to TSW, but to me they are major detractors.  Remember that time you reinstalled a huge set of wards and destroyed the source of enemies in zone, progressing the plot and saving the entire institute?  No?  You can't tell because there are just as many enemies and none of the wards work after 2 minutes.  MMOs.  Womp.  Leaving MMO-general issues aside, I love this game.  I really highly recommend it if you think the atmosphere/story sound even remotely cool to you.  You (hopefully) won't be disappointed.			"

												The Secret World is basically two games that when mashed together create something incomplete and unpleasant.The story and writing are great, especially the writing. This is a game that if you take your time reading the quest fluff you'll be surprised. Okay, the story isn't THAT great afterall, but I think the setting really benefits the way things happen as you progress. Given the moment I got through the first ""world"" which took maybe 40 or so hours I felt great about it. The moment I went into the second ""world"" Egypt I felt things slipped almost immedately.This and the combat especially are where Secret World starts falling apart. For as much as you can solve quests with knowledge (or the internet) and figuring out what this Moorse Code is pointing you towards or what these crpytic clues mean, the combat is absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It's clunky and requires you to have up to date gear as well as skills that are inclined to the opposite of what you're doing. That is to say, the skill system is very large and freeform and it actively hinders you if you do not follow a guide. Trying to peacemeal skills you think you want makes things take longer and fights anywhere from teeth-scrapingly close to utterly impossible.These problems are exponential when trying to complete known ""faction"" quests where it expects you to have gear WELL beyond what you can conceivably have the moment they give them to you. It quite literally took me a week of off-and-on grinding to have the ""right"" skills and gear to even compete with the enemies I fought.When it hits it hits. When it misses you're sent straight up into space. Give it a try when it's cheap to experience the writing but don't expect a WoW killer when it comes to combat.			"

												Bar none, S.W. is the best M.M.O. ever produced. No, I'm not overstating things here. No other M.M.O. has quests that ask the player to use their brains. No other M.M.O. has such an engaging storyline. There's a reason that S.W. is still going strong. The only negative that I can think of is that it's only available for P.C.. If you want to mindless level a character then S.W. is not for you. If you want to actually enjoy yourself while you're leveling S.W. is amazing and easily worth the price.			"

												Please be aware that the reviews as of March 29, 2017 that are being posted on The Secret World: Legends are actually for The Secret World which is a separate game no longer available for purchase because Funcom is halting development of The Secret World to rededicate all development resources to the relaunch of The Secret World brand as The Secret World: Legends.With that in mind, I obviously can't provide feedback for a game that isn't even in closed beta yet.  What I can say is that the relauched version appears to carry over the lore and story line of the old The Secret World and that I would rate that lore and story line as excellent.  So take this recommendation with a grain of salt as that is all it is based on.  The game play, mechanics and quality could end up being exceptional or awful or anywhere in between once this is released as an open beta or full release.			"

												This game is just slightly different than any other MMORPG. It's nothing unusual from FunCom. They try to do different game mechanics for every title. And here it is. I love the idea of TSW (modern day, conspiracy, rising darkness,...). When I played it first time (in beta) I was excited. I just said ""I have to have it"". At first game had lot of bugs, but I think that is already ok. What impress me really much, was choice of weapons. You can choose between magic focus (blood, elementalism, chaos), melee weapons (hammer, sword, fists) or ranged weapons (pistols, shotgun, assault rifle).Dark days are coming. Three powerful organizations have to join forces againts rising darkness. People with special gen awake their hidden powers. They have to choose for who they will fight.What will be your choice? Templars? Illuminati? or Dragon?Advantages:+ No levels, no classes, no limitations (you can switch everything in one moment);+ graphics (visually amazing);+ impressive storyline;+ every character has it's own voice and every mission, which you get from them, has cinematic;+ puzzle solving missions;+ inspired by H. P. Lovecraft.Disadvantages:- Low number of players (when you want to go in dungeon, you have to wait longer time);- DLCs (but I understand, that maintenance need money).			"

												This game is huge, a ton of hours worth of game play in just the first two areas. But you're also send requests to go to other places while you're playing depending upon your level, where you are and if you are playing solo or with others.Exploring turns up new quests, rare items and even more instances to check out. Customize your avatar to how you want to look, update your wardrobe by getting more clothes and accessories. Update your gear and try out different builds.The point system allows you to customize your avatar to do spells, damage or AoE damage, ranged or up close damage - you choose your style. Play your way, choose your path!This is a really cool game, love the replay ability and the vast wheel of choices to build on. Plus they've got some really cool perks too. Free offers and brand name items, like a Steam brand clothing, TSW brand clothing and all sorts of cool vehicles, weapon styles, accessories, non-combat pets and more.My only wish is that the pets were combat not eye candy. Would love to see my wolf go after some poor target. It's nice to have a furry companion who'll watch your six. lolDefinitely recommend this game, even got a few others hooked on it. Makes for lots more fun too. I would highly recommend getting the Ultimate Edition due to all the special items included in it, but also because it has a lot of the content to play for a long time. Several dlc chapters are included in the UE so you won't have to look for them. Save some money and get it on sale! Excellent deal on how much you get for the price.			"

												I'm on the fence about this one, because there really is a lot to like, but also flops where it counts. Overall this is worth a shot on sale (I got the ultimate edition 50% off, sale seems to happen regularly). The bonuses are all right but nothing to write home about, you get a selection of free starter weapons that you'll replace within a couple hours, a couple costumes, and some ability earning bonuses, but the real reason to get ultimate is so you don't have to buy the chapters (up to 11) separately later. I'm not there yet, though, no where close. This is a game where you can sink a lot of time and always have something to do. There are side quests galore, plenty of lore to read, and even if you're just trying to charge through the main quests, you're in for a pretty long haul. That said, it can be a bit overwhelming, sometimes repetitive, but in fairness, there's minimal grind, it's more of a journey. Go into this game with that mindset and you'll have a great time.Note that I'll be changing or adding to this as I sink more time into it.PROS:* Extremely diverse ability system that you can change up on the fly. It's worth noting that you just keep on getting AP, there is no respeccing because it's not necessarily needed. Also worth noting that many abilities/passives from trees of weapons you aren't actively using can still be equipped--it'll tell you if it requires the equipped weapon (or related skill). There's lots of cool synergy and theorycrafting you can do, one could spend a very long time just sitting there making builds.* The bulk of your experience gain comes more from completing quests, rather than grinding mobs. On one hand, some players may dislike this approach, but it strongly encourages you to engage in quests rather than mindlessly grind, and I'm okay with that model (though quests could have been executed better--more on that below).* The atmosphere is delightfully spooky. The music, graphics and sounds come together very well; you feel like you're the star in an episode of some supernatural show. On that note, some of the enemy designs are very heeby-jeeby inducing, making it all the more satisfying when you kill them.* Voice acting is on point, and there's a TON of it, some voices you may even recognize either from movies or other video games. Seriously, check out the IMDB for this game and look at the list, it's baffling how much talent they got. Notably, they even got horror film legend Jeffrey Combs for a couple voices (who you'll hear very early on if you side with the Illuminati).Now, sadly, here's where I have to rip on it. I say sadly, because these points are pretty major, and detract from what is otherwise an enjoyable entry to the genre.CONS:* Combat. This needs several bullet points to fully explain, because it's a lot of little things that add up:-- No auto-attack. You pick an ability that builds your resources and have to spam that. Feels kinda clunky. This is especially hindering in situations where, say, you catch a nasty lag spike or somehow disconnect, when fighting something so easy an auto-attack would finish it while you're d/cing--nope, you reconnect dead. Fortunately lag spikes and graphic stutters aren't TOO common (and of course can always be blamed on client-side issues), but they do happen.-- Lack of variety in animations. Abilities only have one animation, and most of them are shared with other similar abilities.-- Unsatisfying and awkward sound effects. Sometimes they're on point, but most of the time it just doesn't seem to match the action. In general combat just doesn't feel... tight, I guess would be the word. Things are happening, health bars are going down, but the action all seems disjointed.-- Final note: While the combat does have its issues, it mostly just takes some getting used to. Despite all the disjointedness and repetition, it can be entertaining.* Graphical stutters even with lowered settings and a decent rig, an issue which I'm seeing echoed in other reviews. Apart from being annoying, this can be lethal in many encounters, especially since you can't rely on an auto-attack to save you by the skin of your teeth. Strange thing is, these stutters will happen at the weirdest times, even when there's not much action on-screen. Fortunately there's not really any penalty for dying.* Player characters all look very similar, outfits and hairstyles aside. Couple that with the repetitive animations and you really disconnect from that sense of uniqueness. * Some quest triggers are confusing, and oftentimes you're able to do things before you're supposed to, requiring you to trigger them again somehow. This has yet to break anything for me, but has left me scratching my head on occasion.* Key items specific to quests take up inventory space, and sometimes there are a lot of them; frequent trips to banks and vendors are highly recommended. This wouldn't be so bad, if...* ... you could actually delete quests! That's right, there's no abandoning a quest once you've got it. All you can do is put it on pause to ""make room"" for another active quest/mission, but those key items for that mission? They're not goin' anywhere, forever sitting in your inventory, taunting you to complete that quest. What's worse, I've even picked up key items for quests I don't even have and don't know where to get, and you can't delete those items either.NEUTRAL:* Quests and missions are a mixed bag as far as entertaiment value. Cinematically, they're often fantastic; animations, script, voice acting, the works. Some of the dialog is so convoluted though that you'll be fiddling the ESC key to skip if the guy says anything else blatantly obvious. Gameplay-wise they can be sort of underwhelming. Most side-quests are simply ""go here and kill X mobs,"" with some random stuff mixed in, pretty standard fare for an MMORPG, but they're usually pretty well executed. This is where the grind comes creeping in though, since some kill-quests are rather lengthy, and on top of most mobs having a b*tch-load of health, can be tedious. Missions aren't much different but always have at least one gimmicky element to spice things up. Investigation quests can be fun, but frustrating, and will often lead to you simply looking up the answer online after scratching your head over them.* Speaking of which, I'm not sure how I feel about practically *requiring* players to look things up online for clues to the answers when they can just as easily look up... the answers themselves, but at least they provide an in-game browser. Still, it's a pretty ancillary feature, considering it's probably faster to just, y'know, use your out-of-game browser. It's not like we're not already on a computer with internet. Whatever.OVERALL:This game reminds me of a hodgepodge of some of the best (and worst) elements of other MMORPGs. It's like a mix of SW:ToR (another EA title), City of Heroes (now discontinued), Guild Wars (skill system) and, well... not sure what else. The puzzles and overall secrecy are very unique to this title--a title which the game strongly holds up to. Cinematic production is fantastic and worth it for that alone, but gets shadowed by the awkward, repetitive, and often very formulaic combat (i.e. you will always be doing the same skills in the same order with your build until things die, occasionally using a defensive move). But at the end of the day, this doesn't stray much from the tried-and-true MMORPG formula, so it's hard to complain; I might be a bit jaded from years of this stuff. Customization nuts will have a blast, and the atmosphere is executed brilliantly. So, overall, the good outweighs the bad, and it's worth giving a shot when it's on sale.			"

												First of All ... the Story .. .Contrary to All other MMO's there is NO GOD complex here .. no ego tripping , you are not a hero , you are part of a story , you are part of a faction a group an army of defenders divided into factions that barely can keep up with the happennings and current events within the Storyline. Am i not the hero in there ? No you are not the hero barely a witness of the impending doom within the story line one of the many actors within the story . You are not the chosen one , nor are you the hero at all . This alone is rare feat in MMos and in terms or storytelling.In this game you are not the hero ; The story is the hero and it is a mighty engaging story , the lore of the story is complex and so are the missions , certainly some of the missions look simple enough , kill some monsters , send report , done and on to the next one . But investigations missions will make you research , think and whereas there is a deep rich amount of help the community will be glad to provide any new player , expect a game where the going can get tough at times without help. The setting goes from Myth of Cthulu to the most action oriented genre into a modern setting. You will explore and discover the conspiracies animating a long and complex history within the Secret World , Feuiding corporations vying for domination , Engineers of chaos willing to bring the coming of a new age and blindsided to the fact that their own stated goal may lead them to their own destrution , Discipined Army of soldiers , general and commanders , looking at the slightest bit of evil as a pausible cause to scorch the Earth to bring it into a new Eden of their making. And yet something much darker lurking in the corner of your eye and seeping through the reality of the story , the present players are in over their respective heads and even the Council has little grasp on the vastness of the events at hand.  Classes: THERE ARE NO CLASSES. There are no classes at all  within this game which make it a whole different ball game than any other MMO , your equipment has statictics and following those you will perform either grandly or poorly within your assigned role . The skill system is rich complex and deep , the fighting is hard and complex don't expect your tank to stand still in a fight facing a boss .. don't expect to stay immobile in a fight , expect to dance around the objectives , minding the telegraphs impairing the critical casts avoiding chain damaging your companions, Now the Community: As an Mmo TSW stands pretty much by its own , it is dedicated to a mature audience , most cabals (guilds) expect high repect from player to player and that is valid and enforced accross all cabals i came in touch while playing the game. Ok those are the positive points: Now for the so so part : Game optimization : While TSW is a great game the client-server relationship does need a lot of optimisation , PhysX support is close to nil for most of the modern Video Cards and there are some persistent issues concerning multi threading within the game.  This game will run fine on most settings but if you run at high resolution and like DX11 in its full glory. The game at the present time does not leverage multithreading and in complex event PhysX might revert back to CPU calculation rather than leveraging the full power of your graphic's cards PhysX capabilities. This will not interfere with gameplay but during raid and evnts but is still a concern time of this review. The GM's and Customer support at Funcom: Let me be clear the GMs will address every concern and question and will be helpful within a matter of minutes , they will not leave a stone unturned on the matter and will be nothing short of helpful within their powers. Development and content delivery : If you expect timely and regularly timed end game content you might want to be patient with the company, on the other hand a beginner within the game will have a LOT to go through before reaching the end potential of his / her own character , take your time , explore around and do not ever forget to help others , i was a simple noobie once and i still go in normal mode dungeons to help new players get geared up on a regular basis. Don't close yourself up in one branch of the skills , you can learn them all and lack of specialization is something you will appreciate as you go through the content. The bad part : Events . One word can sum them up ... LAGGGFEST .. the lack of optimization to modern multicore machines really hurts the performance of the game at the time of this writing this can be mitigated by turning off some of the effects and turning those back on when out the event zones.  There are specific channels within the community server to that extent. I hope you have enjoyed the reading and remember this is not about you being the hero this is about the story and YES it is a hugely complex intertwined storyline that will keep you at the edge of your chair at each custscene .

												This is my POV after 9 hours. I realize there's a lot I haven't seen yet. Overall I like this game but boy does it it come with a lot of annoyances.Pros:- there is no better game with a conspiracy theory plot- there is no better game using Lovecraft- if the writing is taken as such, it is very solid and enjoyable- while there are plenty of games with a lot of 'cool', the 'cool' in this game is pretty enjoyable- a whole lot of content from what I can tellCons:- everything is 'cool', so nothing stands out- everything is a conspiracy, so nothing is mundane- everything is Lovecraft-ish horror, so nothing is really horrible- the missions are very linear- the UI is clunky and confusing- the combat is boring -- while there are a lot of options, they all feel the same- the character jumps like in a platformer- the puzzles of the game require a lot of attention (this could be a plus, just not my thing)- the graphics engine is appalling, I would expect much better FPS for this graphics quality- I had to install an injector just to get halfway decent antialiasing, and getting it to work was a painI give it a 7/10 despite the long list of cons. I have the Ultimate Edition with all DLC, which I bought for 18 EUR. As of now, I consider it money well spent.			"

												Tl;dr at the bottomI've spent about 300ish hours in this game and I have to say it is one of the best MMO experiences I have ever had. I like the combat in this game and it was pretty easy to get used to...The only hard part was trying to figure out what skills work best with others and which passives you should equip to best compliment your build. If you're anything like me, this is very confusing but thankfully the community is nice enough to share builds that help in any stage of the game. Some of the builds work better in certain situations and you could possibly be switching builds depending on the fight ahead of you. I made it through most of the game without much help, as I am a bit hesitant to socialize with other players for fear of being classed as a noob. I just recently made it into Tokyo, however, and found out that none of my previous builds were working out for me. So I started experimenting with different builds that I found on the interwebs and still am having a hard time, especially with the boss-type enemies that have 2 different aegis shields...The Missions in this game are very engaging. From when you click the button to start the quest to the response you get from your faction leader after you finish it. The cinematics and voice-work are very nice and you miss out on a huge part of the game if you skip and don't read/watch them. Then there are investigation missions. Before you start this game, I would recommend you buy a notebook to take notes in as even the smallest bit of information in these mission-types is a potential clue. That is, if you want to solve them by yourself. If you need a bit of help with these, there are guides on the internet that can get you unstuck or if you just don't want to waste time, can get you through the entire mission. One of my favorite sites for this is Unfair.co (I believe is the address). This site actually explains, in detail, the steps they went through to solve the missions and what hints you should look for.Now onto the RP element. This is the most disappointing part of this game for me and it makes me really sad. I love this game and in many games that I love, I love to RP. They have a pretty big RP community with a website and everything to post events. I've gone to a few of these events, and have tried to involve myself in the group. With me being a very new player to these events, it is hard to find a place to fit in. I have walked up to random people that were RPing and led with a whisper asking if they wanted to RP, to which they would usually respond yes. We would then engage in the RP which would usually end up with me RPing by myself, getting 2 or 3 word responses from the other player. After a while, I noticed that the RP community is very closed off to newer people. People only seem to want to RP with people they know and it in turn leaves me standing by the bar, sipping on a drink and ♥♥♥♥ing around on my phone, hoping someone would come talk to me since me talking to them never seemed to work.Recently on Fridays, the developers have been doing streams on twitch, playing through the different issues and answering questions from the community. I went to the latest one, which they had giveaways going on to win either Funcom points or the new Franken Chopper. I actually won the Chopper and was so excited about it. I would love to see more of these events in the future of this game. It's always amazing to see the developers get in there and interact with the players and to see them play their own game.Tl;drI would recommend this game to every one of my friends. From the combat to the story-telling, this game is amazing. The community is usually very helpful and the developers and GMs are also quite helpful. I haven't done any PVP but I hope to change that in the near future, when I understand the mechanics a bit better.			"

												Out of the reviews I read, nearly all of them were short recommendations. To sum up the reviews I read from people ranging from 20-700 hours game time is ""its good. wow sucks. TSW is free. GG.""I would very much like to disagree to the popular trend of recommending this game. I have played 800+ Hours of this game. At first I was extrememly satisfied and excited to be playing. I LOVED IT! Then I just stopped loving it. I noticed quickly that if you are not playing with friends, you will likely not be playing with somebody other than yourself. The community seems so tight knit to the point of toxicity. If you do not know exactly what you are doing on your class/abilities/build you will be sorely paying for it. PVP seems to be plagued with the 2-3 players than know EXACTLY what they are doing and in result... 1 shot everyone and everything in their way. Making it nearly impossible to have fun while still riding that learning curve. It also seems to me that the Dragon faction will rule Stonehenge and El Dorado (whatever they are called) and the illuminati will rule the Fushang Province (however it is spelled) Leaving the Templars to scrap together a rare victory on occasion.The bag system seems to fail med game due to an increasing amount of lootables/rewards making it a 1-2 hour ordeal to clean your bags and make them viable once more.The PVE dungeon system is a tad bit out-dated, Leaving an old school WoW feel. You either need to walk to the dungeon or be summoned there. There seems to be endless trash mobs inbetween bosses. The bosses feel like they are immensly stronger than they should be for the level you can enter the dungeon. In conclusion, as a F2P MMORPG I would say it is a good time waster if that is all you plan on doing. I would only recommend this game to someone who wishes to waste their time.... I would NOT recommend this game to anyone looking for an enjoyable experience that lasts till the end.P.S. If you don't like my review, don't read it again?  "

												This is the MMORPG that gamers say they want. Deep story, total control over your character's appearance, interesting missions (quests), challenging, skill-based, etc.The only thing I have to say to newcomers is that you need to forget what the typical MMO has taught you about zone progression. TSW has you progress from area to area within a zone, extending the amount of time you spend in a place, and it really helps connect you to that part of the world. Each region is made up of 2-3 full zones, and each zone has 6-10 areas within it that you will progress through.Gamers have been complaining for years in other MMOs about throw-away zones that are forgettable. TSW addresses that, but the tradeoff is you're going to be spending more time in those zones.Now, let me save you the 5,000 word essay I could (and would) write on Investigation Missions. They're the single best thing I've ever seen in an MMO. It's like National Treasure and Da Vinci Code had Rosemary's Baby... and it's GLORIOUS.I can't believe a game this smart even got made.The dungeons are rich and story-driven, and look spectacular, no generic hallways filled with scaled versions of normal mobs. These are hand-crafted and very memorable. Raids/Nightmare mechanics give you a LOT to worry about, and will keep you on your toes. This is not Sinister Strike x3 > Eviscerate raiding here. The mechanics are not very forgiving, and if you screw up there's a good chance you'll just be a smear on the floor.TSW isn't afraid to remind you that while you have special abilities, you're not all-powerful :)11/10Note: Actual playtime is +200hrs or so, as I didn't initially own the game on Steam.

It not the greatest thing ever, but it's solid. Open character developement does leave the problem of how to advance, but it also gives you a fair bit of freedom to tool about with.

												I recommend this game principally based on two things: the ability to role play and the environments.If you are a vetern of mmos then you know that possibly the most important thing in an mmo is the ability to make a character which is an avatar of yourself and to be able to get into that character and role play it. If you can't do that then you are simply grinding quests into oblivion. If you can do that then ""you"" are grinding quests into oblivion but you don't care because it is fun.Now there is a relationship between your character and what you kill. The mobs in The Secret World are reasonable. You won't see any bizzare Korean mythical hybrid-fairy mobs which you could never possibly give a damn about. Or I haven't seen any yet anyways. The first mob you encounter are locals turned to zombies.I regards to roleplaying your character the game has clothing shops in one of the major cities (London) where you can play Mr Dressup and rig out your wardrobe for which ever environment you currently questing in.The environments of the game are present day environments. e.g. the first you get into after your starter city is a small town in Maine and the surrounding back woods. Running around the backwoods of Maine with a sledge hammer and pistols is in my opinion fun.Those two things in mind you should be able to get your character to the end of the game and if you do then your hours spent playing vs. cost ratio should be pretty good.Concerning combat: combat is pretty basic. You get seven slots to put abilities in. You can equip two main weapons. The game uses a combo point builder system similar to a rogue in other games. You build to five points and use a finisher (some finishers use less points). Of the seven combat slots you get it is most likely one will be used for a single target builder, two for single target finishers (one for each weapon), one for an aoe builder, and one for an aoe finisher. So of the seven comat slots you only really get two slots for whatever situational skills. It is likely one of them will be a healing skill. Consequently combat is pretty simple however if you roleplay your character it should be more than rather, rinse, repeat. You also get seven passives to compliment your seven combat abilities and these 14 together will constitute most of your theory crafting and the goal you set for the combination of skills you eventually want to achieve in your dream build. I would not recommend looking up a cookie cutter build in a forum while your are still doing the main quest but rather theory crafting your own otherwise it may become a mundane and anxious process.Concerning questing: quests come in a variety of types and the type of quest is indicated by a box symbol at the quest giver. There are your basic kill quests which never seem to get old. There are sort of covert ops quests where you have to try to infiltrate an area with minimal combat. These can get somewhat old but for the most part stay reasonably fresh. Same obstacles typically but spread out differently. Then there are investigation quests which are fun initially but eventually get very, very old. The investigation quests have two problems in general. The first is the are not necessarily solvable either through intuition or through a process of deduction. Often trying to solve them is trial and error or trying to discern the authors intent. The second problem is they can become quite laborious. Even if you know how to solve a particular part of a quest you can spend a good deal of time translating a piece of text from one language to another one letter at a time. These quests however typically give the most exp so if you want to put in the labor you can. Or you can simply look up the solution online which is very often what you will do which sort of spoils the quest because you are looking at what to do online and then doing it; often times again and again.This for the most part is the secret world: questing, roleplaying, theory crafting in modern environments. I haven't reached the endgame yet but I wouldn't expect much from it. I wouldn't consider this game a race to the end(there isn't really a level cap in this game in the traditional sense. I believe your gear has a level cap) but rather a journey where you try to milk what you can out of the content. Maybe the endgame is good I don't know I'm not there.			"

												This game is outstanding for those that love a challenging game with loads of story-enriched content, and lore-heavy environments. I have not played anything like it. One minute you're killing baddies, the next you're following a set of clues to solve the problem. I spent, literally, over an hour on one mission just deciphering riddles and going on a treasure hunt. 20/10			"

												It's like if The X-Files was written by Steven King and H.P. Lovecraft. It is amazeballs.But it is TOUGH. Not for people looking for a casual and laid-back playing experience.The lore and characters are brilliantly written, with fully animated and voiced cutscenes given out liberally for every major mission. They're HIGHLY entertaining, and worth sitting through. The NPC's come in a vareity of delightfully demented flavors, ranging from 'listen to the teddy bear, he knows what he's talking about' to 'we kill monsters, make them into sausages, and eat them'. This is not an exagerration. These characters literally exist in the game. It's a treasure trove of character personality.The world is a suffocatingly gloomy work of dystopian art. It LITERALLY OOZES with darkness and creepiness in places. You'll see. I lack sufficient words to describe it. You'll see.9/10 only because it's not an easy game for new players to get into. There's a helluva learning curve.But if you love the paranormal/supernatural/horror genre?Welcome home.			"

												It has good moments, it has bad moments. But this game's over all mood is better than most MMOs. Not to mention finishing stories actually effects the areas you save. Also one of the VERY few horror MMOs that actually make you feel nervious as you never know for sure if you can walk away from a monster fight, despite having supernatural powers yourself.			"

												""The Secret World"" is an MMO-RPG unlike every other.Besides clever quest-design, with nice dialogs and actual interesting informations, the game got intense dungeons in different difficulties, a universe of skill-possibilites, to choose the most effective playstyle for you - and REAL riddles, which you have to solve with help of your ingame-internet-browser.When you got bored of all the other MMO's gamedesigns, TSW might give you a fresh and exciting experience.

												I have in the past been too busy to review the Secret World , as I  have been spending  thousands of hours playing The Secret World, and if there was still a page for reviewing it, I  would give it a very positve review and recommend  it to any thinking gamer. I cannot review this new game, as it is not published yet. But I can give a resounding Not Recommended to the misleading practice (hopefully accidental) of  attributing hundreds of well deserved  positive  reviews for one game to another game not even released.Archive the old game's reviews, give people a chance to see and assess the new game, and THEN we can start seeing trends, but not before.Please, no 'Fake Reviews'!

												Best and most underrated MMORPG. Lovecraftian/dark fantasy/occult theme with RPG gameplay and NO subscription fee. Arguably strongest lore of any game, immersive with fantastic environments, tons of content, great community, compelling writing/characters/voice actors, fun for casual and hardcore MMORPG players. Fun single player missions as well as group raids, dungeons, and scenarios.One instance of customer support was very helpful. I am always delighted to buy content-rich expansions to the core game, which are numbered Issues (they're up to #10 now) and support the developers. One of my all time favorite games.			"

												The Secret World is an interesting title. It's very unique in it's own right while still feeling very much like a normal RPG would. TSW allows you to join under one of three different societies (Iluminati, Templar, and Dragon) and each come with their own set of story, characters, and game world hubs to explore. Outside of these faction-specific hub zones are regions. And boy, there's a lot here. The first place you'll come across is Solomon Island, which contains three distinct locations all ranging in size. The maps are massive, and there are tons and tons of sidequests, main missions, and story missions scattered about. From what I know, there are three or four different regions each containing two or three different areas to explore. Your quests all range in both gameplay style and type. So let's break them down one by one.Story Missions - This are quests that follow the main story of the game. How you play it is up to you.Action Missions - Displayed by a symbol of a man running, action missions are exactly what they sound like. This is where you get to do lots of murdering, defending against hordes, and getting into dangerous situations.Sabotage Missions - Marked with the symbol of a timer strapped to dynamite, these missions are a more stealth orientated. You'll have to do such things as sneaking around enemies, cameras, and even hacking.Investigation Missions - These missions are marked with a laptop. This, in my opinion, is the landmark mission type that sets TSW apart from the rest. Investigation missions utilize the game's world, as well as its assets, to deliver a rich detective experience. Problem solving and a keen eye for detail are a must. And, sometimes, they really push your brain to the limit. Don't look up online guides for these or you're going to ruin all the fun. Some of these quests type involve having to follow clues, or having hints dropped on you, figuring out passwords and stuff of the sort. Sometimes you actually need to hit up Google and start doing some research in order to find what you're looking for. It's that kind of immersion factor that makes you really feel like you're actually working towards something bigger and unraveling the mysteries of the world.Dungeon Missions - Marked with a purple icon with 3 figures standing. Dungeons are, as you'd expect, hard. I've only played through one dungeon, and from what I can tell you pretty much go through treacherous environments that can harm you fighting multiple bosses until you finally get to the last boss. Then rewards ahoy!Item Missions - Marked with a box. These sidequests are not given by NPCs. Rather, they are objects you find around the world (such as a postal van) that grant you the choice of a side quest. They usually tie together with the main story missions.There's another called Scenario missions. I haven't gotten a chance to play those yet, but it seems to go on a pass-fail basis depending how well you and your party performed.Despite the good, TSW has it's draw backs. For starters, don't expect a TPS experience if you choose to use guns. They play out exactly as they would in an RPG. Your skills under 1-7 are what makes your weapons work. Apart from that, the party system has two really lame issues. The first comes from a lot of quests taking place in solo instances. It renders the whole point of a party pointless when you can only advance a certain quest tier by going into a solo instance. Just as well, Funcom also decided to make a gathering loot a game of chance. Sometimes if you kill an enemy, an uncommon or rare item will appear. No one in your party is allowed to take it. Instead, a bar shows up with 3 button choices, ""Need, Greed, or Pass."" Choosing Greed or Need will cause you roll a di (the number goes to 100 I think). Whoever gets the highest number on their roll wins the item. It's a good system, in theory, but it's also a little annoying. I much prefer GW2's method of just having character bound drops for every member of your party. Although having this system gives off the feeling that working together with other members of different secret societies is more like a fragile alliance rather than friendship.Combat in TSW starts off really poorly. Melee weapons and Magic tend to be more offensive and do a lot of damage to enemies. And the abilities you get can really pack a punch. Guns, on the other hand, start off rather weak. And, alone, its incredibly hard to play with. It's hard to avoid getting hit because you have a very limited dodge function. You can only dodge once after, I think, a 15-20 second cooldown. This makes confrontations alone with guns rather annoying because you can never keep your distance. Once you gain new abilities you'll be a DPS machine. Of course, the way to do this is to level up and get crowd control abilities. But expect to die a lot and work your ♥♥♥ off.The story is nothing short of a miss. The concept sounds cool, and the world is excellent. The backstory and lore stuff is really interesting. I haven't gotten much into the story, but what really breaks it for me is the writing. Cutscenes, which happen at the start of every quest given by an NPC, drag on and on. And since your character is mute, sometimes you'll just be listening to one guy blabber on about something for over 2 minutes. This wouldn't be so bad if the writing wasn't so laughably awful. Characters tend to reference stuff that exists in real life, and make pop culture references left and right. Seriously, the head honcho of the Iluminati compares the organization to XBOX but ""more hardcore."" What does that even MEAN? There was a secret man who was well spoken but would occasionally drop meme bombs like, ""all your cameras are belong to us,"" and ""I am disappoint."" These quips don't get me immersed in the story. Rather, they suck me out of the immersive experience. I get that the game is set in modern times and in our world but referencing stuff that exists in real life causes players to think about real life and that breaks immersion.TSW originally started off as a subscription-based game. That was dropped once the sales were too low. Now you can just buy the game and play forever. However, the game does have an item store. This store contains various items like clothing, boosters, weapon moulds to give your weapons a cooler look, pets, accessories, etc. You will have to drop some cash if you wanna make your character look like a badass. Thankfully though everything is reasonably priced. Special outfits only cost a little under $10, and bits and pieces of clothing run you about 50 cents to 2 dollars a pop. There is a subscription system, though. This subscription model grants you 1200 funcom points a month, as well as veteran points for more exclusive items, a special item of the month, and other various bonuses. I don't know how much of an advantage it gives. But I've been playing without it and I seem to be doing okay. Even if I am dying quite a bit.In conclusion, TSW is a blast. And well worth it's asking price. I would also highly recommend the RP servers. Ya know, if you're into that sort of thing.			"

												While I Don't have many hours in, often games first impressions makes or breaks the game.  I have been intrigued by this game for years, but never really looked at it when it was first released.  Since it is F2P and the initial investment for the game is low I thought I should give it a try.  I knew from research that this was not a normal model of a MMORPG as the normal leveling model is not used.  But instead we get a Skills based game in which you control how you play and how you play it.  While I am no where near the end game I understand that synergies between skills are very important and how you build is important as you move through the Game.  The good news is if you screw up, go back do some more farming and tweak the build.  You are shown a interesting opening sequence that starts the story, it takes awhile to get through, but does set up what is going on nicely.  You are treated to a breakneck speed Tutorial that gives you some basics about the game.  But if you are familiar with most other MMO's and how they work you can get through it fine without much fuss.  Then you are dumped into London and told to go off and find your HQ, there you select your first weapons and skills and are sent out into the world.This all works well and the graphics are as good, if not better then more of your standard fair MMOs.  Game play is pretty intuitive in terms of movement and combat skills, The Complications set in when you try to figure out the Skills and abilities.  However, thanks to in-game help and a good community forum I was able to select a combination of skills that would give me some good DPS and Survivability for the opening area in New England.  If you love the walking dead, you are going to really like the opening quest line.  The traditional gearing up is not the same as most MMOs it uses talismans to adjust your stats, as well as your weapons, clothes are just costumes and only add cosmetic looks.  The only con is the learning curve, while a familiarity of MMOs helps, reading the forums and various guides also help, but maybe a stronger tutorial area where  you get to see things like crafting might help.  All and all, if I did not have to go to work I would be still playing.  Reviews were a bit mixed on release, but the game seems to have matured and many of the issues in the early reviews have been addressed.  So my advice looking for something a bit different give it a try.			"

												I simply fell in love with the whole universe. If I am not wrong, this is the single modern-day MMORPG around and the fact that they turned so many theories (like the existence of Illuminati) and mythology into something like this, is simply mind-blowing.

												I find this game a rare treat, where crusading and cross-dressing are both valid responses to the oncoming end times. Items and costuming are optionally separated, so you can fight werewolves in kink-wear and cyber-wear with equal efficiency.Two words of advice for the beginner players: in the Ability Tree are the starter decks, stick to them until you've finished the Inner Wheel. It'll give you insight into how  a deck should go. Also, don't specialize your Skill Trees too much. The game's designed to improve each weapon generally concurrently and you can sort of snooker yourself with not upping every skill.			"

												Describe The Secret World in a sectence? A refreshing take on the MMORPG genre.The Secret World is not an MMO for everyone, and you either love it or hate it. It features a very interesting classless, leveless system in which you truley can be whatever you want to be. With numerous weapon combinations and deep character customization in terms of abilities withing those weapons, TSW makes you feel unique in your character. But the true enjoyment of this game is not in the game mechanics, but rather the dark and beautifully crafted world in which you play in, and the deep story you are immersed in. TSW borrows elements of Lovecraftian story elements which is downright awesome as well as super mysterious. I was told when going into this game not to play it like a traditional MMO, which at first alarmed me, but after the first few missions, I saw how rich and vibrant the story was, and how I felt like a part of this fascinating world which I couldnt wait to rip apart and explore every secret and every detail. In terms of pricing I find it very generous, as many Subscriber-based MMO giants (I'm looking at your WoW) charge heavily for the base game, its expansions plus the monthly fee, whereas TSW is quite fairly priced as a base game, has very cheap DLC that in my honest opinion I would pay double for it and have no qualm, and has a subscriber system but is very different to MMO's with the same system such as SWTOR, as it merely adds cosmetics features and a shop currency allowance (Funcom Points). All in all, I give The Secret World a 9/10, and is by far one of the most enjoyable MMO's I have ever played, and I thoroughly look forward to continuing to play.TL;DR Thoroughly enjoyable MMO, evenly priced, lovely game world.

												A mediocre MMO, but a great single player game with social elements. You have to go into this game with a certain mindset to really appreciate it. Do you value well written quests, a well told story and an interesting setting with good characters? This would probably be right up your allyway, if you can deal with the clunky combat. If not it's best to look elsewhere.---MORE INFO---Dungeons are extremely fun and among the best I've played in any MMO game so far. Community is also among the best and is very welcoming and helpful to newcomers. Be sure to /chat join sanctuary when you log in. As I mentioned before, combat is a bit clunky and slow and it can be a bit easy to screw up your build. They added decks a while back that make it easier to follow a certain skill path that can fit what your looking for. Quests are spectacular and are not your typical MMO fare. Some of them are actually quite intellectually challenging and will have you solving puzzles and using the in-game browser to research information. The lore is also very deep and if your big on sinking yourself into a good story, there's lots to find here. End game unfortunately doesn't seem to be very big, it's more about the journey then the goal in this case.All in all, TSW is a niche title that will satisfy a certain subset of players. If what I said sounds good to you then it is definitely worth a shot. You may request a trial key over on the official forums (or here, on steam) just to try it out and see if it is for you. For a new player there is a lot to discover and do. Hope to see you in game!			"

												I normally hate MMO's (huge fan of the Elder Scrolls series, minus ESO, dissapointed with that) and this game had a fan of single player open world RPGs in awe!  Fills the void that's been needing to be filled with modern day setting meets magic & legend (which I had hoped World of Darkness MMO would have come out, oh well).  The game features unique approaches to everything, akin to first person shooter (w/real time combat), leveling through skills & equipment rather than an overall leveling system, and the quests!  OMG the quests! You acutally get to use your brain to try and figure them out, not just go here, kill/steal/plant this etc.  Puzzle solving based off real world things like chemical formulas, book passages & movie lines, historical events, etc. make for an incredible experience that really takes you into the game.  The only down side is the rig req.  If you are getting this game you will absolutely need the recommended (and really better off over rec.) rather than min. req. (I tried min initially and even with all graphics turned to 0 was getting 10-15 fps and super lag, and on just under rec. running 2.3 ghz quad rather than 3 ghz quad, w/ 6g ram & 1g video, still catch lag in multi like groups and pvp).  If your box isn't running quad 3ghz, 8g ram+ and 1g video+, upgrade before buying.  Aside from that, AMAZING GAME!			"

												I will admit. I was very surprised by this MMO and originally did not think I'd ever play it. Thanks to a Steam flash sale, I purchased the massive edition (with a few extras thrown in and some of the expansions.. called Issues, btw) for my brother and myself and tried it out. It's fascinating and unique. Edgy voiceover dialogue and discussions, pretty involved quest/story lines, class-less/level-less system, nicely rendered atmospheric environments all in a modern/urban setting. Funcom did well with this so far. There's a slight learning curve and might not be the easiest or the best game to start with for an MMO newcomer. For newcomers or vets alike, stick with it. The community seemed mature, decent and helpful (at least on the server we chose). And we saw our fair share of players running around in the starting areas, the travel nexus (called Agartha), and the first mission zone we were travelling in. There were default notifications about activity in the PVP territories too, so it seems like the game (at least on our server pick) has a decent amount of traffic and population.Graphics (8-9) - DX9/11 support, FXAA, tesselation, good graphics options for the workhorses and the slow ponies. Some character models are nice looking and some are just ugly (like SOME of the NPC's.. good lord, comb that hair)Fun (9) - Puzzles, engrossing questlines, decently fleshed out NPC's, class-less/level-less, fashion options.. wide variety of playstyles supportedSound (8-9) - Fully voiced NPC dialogue/cutscenes, Random NPC voice chatter, good atmospheric mood background music, appropriate sound effects, nothing fancy thoCommunity (8-9) - Decent population sampling for areas we've explored, specific chat channels set up for things like ""Mission Hints"", etc. and rather helpful, mature, decent chatter in the channelsPerformance (8) - I have settings turned up to Ultra on my semi-beast of a machine. I got the occassional lag in some areas, that I haven't quite isolated as graphics lag or connection lag. I'm leaning towards graphics lag due to the area I was inValue (8-9) - B2P (pay for the game, don't have to pay a monthly subscription fee). There's optional membership sub for added bonuses, there's an item shop you can buy things with cash (mainly cosmetic fluff and some value-added consumables), I got massive edition for a steal on a flash sale during the summer sale 2014, but overall the pricing is good with all that's included compared to other MMOsService (8) - The account management site is a little outdated and piggybacks off the old AO account management look and feel.. not very informative or user friendly and can be confusing at times. But you don't spend alot of time in there so I won't penalize the score too much.VERDICT: So.. to sum it up, I'd give this a 8-9 out of 10			"

												An awesome mmorpg that pushed the gameplay scope past what was usual for such games. I played quite a bit of world of warcraft and while it has a lot of end-game content, the questing was typically extremely boring because each quest played the same way. The secret world has a lot of variety in quests (Called missions), there are story missions, combat missions, sabotage missions and research missions. The game itself is based on real world myths and mythology and the research missions showcase this the best. You use an in-game internet browser often to research specific subjects. It can range from relatively simple puzzles to huge research undertakings. Story missions are specifically related to the overall story arch, combat missions are more like traditional quests that you'd expect in an mmo, sabotage missions revolve around usually stealing intel or destroying points of interest without being spotted.As far as combat goes, it's responsive and pretty fun to play. There are no classes, instead there is an ability wheel that you can unlock entirely. You are restricted by your hotbar, which you can equip a single set of passive/active abilities restricted further by the weapons you equip. My only real complaint is that typically if you want to do PVE dungeons as DPS, you will have a difficult time in the high end dungeons compared to ranged dps.The game has no subscription, it relies upon expansions (called issues) which add more areas and missions to the game, as well as lots of cosmetic options. And last but not least you can play as the Illuminati, Templar, or Dragon. While many mmorpgs have a 2 faction world, the secret world has 3, which all work together except in PVP scenarios.Even with a somewhat lacking/restrictive endgame PVE, I managed to spend 300 hours playing this game before reaching the end of the main storyline (not including any of the DLC). This is the only MMORPG that I could ever recommend at this time.			"

												It's definitely an interesting game. Not for everyone. I will not go into the details (there are tons of a very good reviews already), just add my own opinion.I like that I have to read/listen the quests and think. I like that I can select how much I have to think (investigation mission might be too much after a hard day in the office, for example, but I can skip those to the time when I feel like scratching my head in puzzle). I like the story, voice-overs and atmosphere in general. Combat system is not extraordinary, but fun enough to explore and combat itself is not boring.The system requirements for a decent performance are a bit tough, considering what you get in visuals. The price of the whole package (base game + all the DLCs) might be a bit steep. I am not sure how much fun is the ""end game"" - doesn't look to me as a lot right now.So, overall - worth to take a look if you want something different from ""most other MMOs"" and if you like story-driven gameplay. During the sales on the base game it becomes ""must try"" option in my eyes. :) Just be sure to check system reqs (should be no problem for a reasonable _gaming_ rig, but be careful if you have something more office-oriented or old. ""SWTOR runs on my machine fine"" doesn't mean TSW will).			"

												A very hard game to explain..... Imagine if every conspiracy theory was true (they all are anyways, so...) this game is an imagining of the innerworkings of the illuminati, dragons, and templars, with some of the best story cutscenes I've seen in any game, and I'm baffled at character customization as it's so indepth.

												A game where the story shines. The lore is indepth as any early Bioware game. In game graphics are great. Excellant voice acting. Cut scene CG, meh. I have spent over 350 hs in the game with only one character. Between SWTOR, Diablo III, Guide Wars 2 and the Secret World, I hardly have time for my console games.Character creation and skill/ability wheel is easy to use. By the end of the original issues (1,2 and 3) your 2 favourite weapon abilities will be maxed and you can use your further abilty points to invest in different weapons.Then you will get the use of an auxillary weapon and now with issue 9, you get the AEGIS system.Bottom line. If you like the X-files and supernatural themes, this is the game for you.			"

												OUR WISDOM TASTES SO SWEET. TASTE AND SEE.LISTEN TO THE VOICES. FOR THEY CORRUPT.Yeah, so this game is a bit odd to recommend. It's an MMO, and people don't tend to think good things when they think MMO. But it's got an oddly satisfying single player storyline that touches almost every major and minor conspiracy mankind has come up with, and brings it to life. As an MMO, it's kind of bad. But as a single player RPG? It's actually pretty damn fun, especially if you like seeing what humanity has come up with over the years.			"

												I'll admit, this game doesn't have a good first hour of gameplay. However, after you findout how in-depth the skill tree really is, it opens up ridiculous amounts of possibilities. They need to have respecing available though just incase you ♥♥♥♥ up bad on your skill tree. You feel rewarded after playing though unlike many other MMO's (After the first hour or so).There are two skill tree's in the game. One for Skill points (What level of weapons and armors you can use) and ability points (What abilities you can do). The amount of experiance to fill the experiance bar does not change through out the game, however, the number of skill points and ability points does for better abilities and stronger skills. You earn 1 skill point for each time you fill up the experiance bar. And as the experiance bar is divided into three sections, you also earn 1 ability point for filling up each section of the bar. Some people might ask why this would even make sense to do this. The reason is because they want to be innovative. A more rewarding system. Instead of getting 1 skill point for killing a billion enimies for doing 10 long ♥♥♥ quest's, you earn a bunch of ability points to spend along with skill points which makes the game feel much more rewarding.If you stick to the game and choose a weapon that you think you'll enjoy using, you're much more likely to enjoy the game. Let's say that you want to use the assult rifle as a weapon, but also you want to use blades and you're stuck between the two, why not choose both?? You can have two weapon that you use where you can mix their abilities together to kick some major ♥♥♥!I would reccomend this game, esspecially if it goes on sale again.			"

												The world is not what it seems. For every civilization that has existed there are people who work behind the scenes making it tick, or toil. Behind them is the mystery that reaches into places we've never been or even imagined. Danger lurking and the unknown beckoning you to investigate. Dig too far and you might end up buried and forgotten or you might learn what few do. Imagine a world where everything that you thought was not real existed, man and monster. All of those mystical places each with their own calling. Do you join or not and if you do, then who? Enter yourself into The Secret World.The Secret World is a mature themed MMO right out of a graphic novel. It involves mysteries of the kind that you'd not likely imagine and characters and worlds beyond. Its graphical features are truly amazing as are its cut scenes, dialog, script and voice talent, all of course mature rated. This is the MMO that I've been waiting for a long time and it fits the bill perfectly. I cannot give away much more than to say that if you've ever been curious and found that you had a unique calling, you need to experience it.- It is great as a multiplayer experience though it is not required to enjoy the quests as they scale to team member count.- The music, atmosphere, voice acting and cutscenes are all top notch and yes it does have them but they are part of the narrative to the rich story this game possesses. This adds to the overall experience so this is more than just a loot grab. This has a story and a background. Something that you can learn from if you pay attention. Like a good movie or book it is a testament to the artform of great story telling though you are the story as it develops.- This is not a money grab in terms of it being an online game with F2P aspects. You pay up front for the client and it comes with a great deal of adventures and experiences. You can play the whole game without buying a thing in the store but there is a point to the online store, that helps but it is not required to enjoy the game. You be be just as powerful without purchases as you can with, its just a matter of how quickly you progress and how cool you look (vanity). Vanity as we all know in online gaming is becoming its own artform and expressive language.- There are multiplayer quests and dungeons that benefit from team work, but they are optional quests that do not detract from the main story line. Optional.- The worlds to explore are huge and with so many quests that you will likely miss many along the way so the replay value is high as is the play style.- Decks are a system of building your character according to archetypes that benefit your character in different aspects plus providing a cool look for your character and other archetype specific gear. A great idea reminiscent of class kits in dungeons and dragons.- It benefits from team play for sure as you can level much faster as a team. When teaming as I've mentioned, the quests and scale in difficulty so the gameplay doesn't become easier but requires team work.Did I say atmosphere? This game is oozing with atmosphere in so many aspects it is incredible. If you are a fan of the X-Files or Coast 2 Coast, you want to play this though it is not really a conspiracy theory type game but delves into the mysteries of the unknown for certain.If you decide to open the door to investigate further, I highly suggest taking the time to look over the decks system involved in picking a predefined archetypal role for your character as there are benefits.

												This game is a joy to play.  Don't get me wrong, it is not without its flaws...  Poor optimisation (especially DX11) chiefly amongst them.  But the fact that I am a huge fan of Lovecraft alone bypasses that.But the game itself?  Very few games have been made where you don't 'have' to do much combat.  Especially MMO's...  In fact, the games combat is fairly bog standard tbh...  It uses the tried and tested formula (mostly, there are also area attacks that deviate from this) of clicking on a mob and pressing number keys to kill them.  But, active dodge and moving during charge attacks at least livens it up a bit.But the game comes into its own with the investigation missions.  I recall one in particular, quite early on, where you find a van with some ID in it and have to use an actual website to search for clues.  I'd never seen this in a video game before, so it kinda blew my mind a bit.  A game incorporating things outside of it's programming...  Not really seen it since either to be honest!But, some of the investigations take minutes or hours, by hearsay, I've also heard some people can spend days on some...  So, not always to be taken lightly.Another fantastic point is the 'class' system.  Or, lack of one at least.  Buying skills and making a usable skill set out of them means an amazing amount of diversity.The size of the game is impressive also.  I believe I paid £15 back when I got it in a sale and out of it, so far at least, I have gotten almost 100 hours.  That's not bad going really...  I've barely even made any headway, out of all that time, I am still on the first area, yet to explore the rest of the game...I can't comment on PvP however, as I have not tried it yet.All said and done though, it's a much slower pace than most modern MMO's, so if you're used to the likes of WoW (not meant to sound like a hit at the game as I do still play it), where you do a few quests, then move on to the next area after an hour or two, this may not be for you.  Like wise if you like structured classes that immediately declare what 'role' you will play.But on the whole, I would recommend this to anyone.  Especially those who are interested in games with deep, interesting lore and also any fan of H.P. Lovecraft.  For the latter, it really is a must.			"

												Pros: Well written and innovative; two things sorely lacking in the current MMO industry. TSW is blisfully free of ""gather X items"" and ""kill x NPC"" missions"" and instead focuses on puzzles that require research and logic instead of trial and error; even the missions that don't involve solving riddles manage to stay fresh and interesting.Cons: while new content comes at a dependable rate, that rate is kinda slow.

												This game is a true Gem. The puzzle investigation quests are made for more than the average smart guy. Zombie-fest, goverment conspiracies and just plain folk like in the Walking Dead trying to survive.Millions of ways to customize your character, as the talent trees are fully learnable by your character. which gives endless possibilities to the way you want to play. Story is deep and rich. Grabbing a quest, and not reading it could spell death to you. Or just get you plain stuck.I would recommend this game to anyone who loves RPGS and want like a elite challenge.It's good Solo, and Instance runs are great too.

												All right, so the game looked promising at first. $30 for a modern/Fantasy MMO? Awesome, sold. Now, I'm an lover of the Souls series. As anyone familiar with the series can tell you, multiple characters for different styles of gameplay are a must. TSW however? You can do anything. Top all the weapon and skill sets out, flip between as you see fit. Sweet. But still, that's end game, and we're just getting started.First run, Dragon (because who doesn't love a little chaos). Pistols and Rifles. Soldier style. Cleared up to Transylvania, including completeing the main story quest line. But hectic. Didn't know enough, character is strongish, but a complete mess with points and abilities all over the place. Oh, found this thing called a Deck. Helps you stay decently strong while giving you things to word towards. Sweet. Time to restart!Second Run. Templar. Deck deck deck, Exorxist? Healer based deck. Cool, reduced que times for dungeons. Soloing the main story was a bit problematic, but hey! I'm a healer, I don't die easy. Story cleared up to Transyl again. Like it, but I don't love it. Restart.Third run. Templar, Paladin Deck. LOVE it... Tankability if I want it, high single target damage if I want it. Decent Aoe and crowd control too, all I gotta do is switch some specs up. Absolutely best run, but got stopped when buddy wanted to run with me. Paladin for solo time... Time to make another character, we'll get back to the Paladin later.4th character. Eh... Dragon, screw it, let's check out the Matial Artist deck. Very gook tanking build. Easy control over the mobs, though in story, a bit lackluster in damage. All right, it takes me forever to kill them, but it takes them forever to kill me. I win, I have decent passive healing. Chaos Magic via close colse quarters crowd control is a blast, and the sword skills boosting my defensive rating by a chunk, love it. Story cleared past Trasnsyl, caught up to Paladin, switch back to continue with my buddy on the character I love.20 minutes back on paladin, and I'm content locked. I check out the content pack I need, $10. Okay. But for only a portion of the area I'm in? Wtf?I go to Steam, and everything Issue 9 and up is only available via Collectors Edition. $25. Funny, cause directly from the site, I can get the standard for $10. Any package deals? Not unless you paid $60 intitially for the Ultimate Edition. Anyway to just upgrade to Ultimate? Hell no, you get another base game key to give to a friend. I can't give someone that, I'd feel bad. Steams total price for DLC is $210! Okay, so 7 DLC packs are $15 over priced. So buying standard straight from the source? 210 - 105. Still $105. Already paid $30. So 135. Sorry, what? AAA games go for 60, and reduce their DLC prices after a year or two. This game is 4 years old... 4 Years...I love the game, I love the mechanics, but I can't justify that price tag... I can't. I really want to recommend this game, but if you aren't going staight for the $60 Ultimate, which still leaves 4 DLC packs locked, I can't. Was it a full game? I'm sure it was, at one point! But I've been hearing about Tokyo since the beggining of the game, and now you're telling me I can fight there, but I can't progress without buying something? Why even bring it up!? Lock me out of the whole area. Don't let me in then tell me, ""Money or you can't do anything besides kill trash mobs.""Gameplay 9/10.Story 9/10.Prices 2/10.It's been 4 years, and you want that much money. That's now how you increase a player base.			"

												All the urban legends and conspiracies are true! The Secret World pits players against horrors beyond belief, in scenarios inspired by classic film and fiction. The premise is exciting, but is it worth playing? Well...in a word, no. But that's a rating I need to clarify.It does have some interesting areas, enemies, stories, and especially the unique experience/ability/skill system. The voice acting is generally good. There's plenty of tongue-in-cheek, which helps it not to take itself too seriously when it shouldn't. And what music it has is very good.It's easier for me to talk about where I feel TSW failed. First and most importantly of all, the factions are all horrid packs of asslords that you will not like...how original. I understand they're going for 'realism' -- which, to clunky writers means 'unlikeable people' -- but it's been done to death, and here it just puts new players off. They're instantly confronted by people they have no real reason to do anything but work against, no matter who they pick. Given, after the introductory missions, you won't have to deal directly with your faction very much at all for long periods of time, but making it a pillar of the game itself was a mistake.I think it's a major problem of MMOs that so many have resorted to shoehorning characters into militaristic factions that not only don't make sense but aren't appealing, and it doesn't even matter the setting; they still do it regardless. If this really needed to be a part of the game, it should have been closer to endgame where a player chooses, based on interactions up to that point, which faction they will support. TSW's premise is one that would just work so much better if the player were an unaffiliated character, slowly figuring out the factions and figures behind the scenes, perhaps communicating with unknown parties...unknown until much later in the game. With how little part faction plays for quite some time, it really would have been much better to take that approach, as well as more suspenseful and engaging.As for writing, it's absolutely awful. The introductory missions are so abysmal they're often embarrassing, and some of them are offensively sophomoric or uncomfortable in clearly unintended ways. Characters are obnoxious 'just because', and they're not even believable or realistic in their presentation. It's pretty much a mass collection of people you are designed to dislike, which destroys any real willing suspension of disbelief.The character development systems are interesting and robust, but even though skills and abilities are given video tutorials, there are other systems in the game that players are left to sink or swim. Items accumulate in the inventory without explanation, and even though a shop presumably for kits to use them can be encountered, no effort is taken to explain. Similarly, certain gameplay mechanics go utterly unaddressed, such as dropping missions you don't want to complete (you can't, only replace them), or how the game expects you to approach the stealth-oriented missions (which it only informs you are stealth-oriented and gives you no real information on how they're different).And speaking of those stealth missions, avoid them like the plague. While the battle system and skills/abilities are actually refreshing and robust for the most part, the game is not nearly solid enough to even remotely allow for the kind of precision and demanding that they require. There are also a number of occasions where a player will find himself instantly blown up, with no explanation as to why or how it could be avoided. Nothing is explained about these overly picky missions, and they're frustrating and worthless. They don't fit in TSW anyway, but there's no effort to introduce them to the player, and as a result they just end up even less likeable.The tracker is okay, if a bit too approximate. It'll lead you to the area, but highlighting of key interactive objects is very poor, meaning you might pass by an essential item a few dozen times before happening to notice it. While I understand the need for not making the objects too incongruous, they end up being annoyingly hard to find and blend into the scenery. It would be nice to have an option to make the objects more noticeably highlighted.Speaking of options, it would also be nice to have the option for subtitles when people speak, for those of us who are hard of hearing or simply can't understand what some of the voice actors are saying. Sometimes there are subtitles, sometimes there aren't...There are no recovery items or boost items that are made clear initially either, so it can be a bit overwhelming for new players to become used to what's going on. The introduction to battle, a dream sequence common to each faction, doesn't really help much and, like the rest of the intro sequences, is incoherent and fairly useless except for raising questions it has no intention of answering.The game itself is something that can be enjoyed if you can tune out the poorer aspects of it. Battle is usually fun. Exploring the environments is enjoyable, and they're given a lot of personality. The player characters aren't super-customisable, but they're not bad. If you avoid the stealth missions, most of the others are fun. The stories of the locations -- what I'd really call 'modules' or 'regions' -- are pretty interesting, even if the overarching story is the opposite.TSW is one of those games that has such potential, but it doesn't actually manage to achieve much of it. It's frustrating perhaps most of all because if you can see that potential, it's terrible to see it fail again and again to actually get there. The result is a mediocre game that I can't really recommend to anyone without a lot of caveats and disclaimers. If you really want to try it, get it on sale and give it a try. I just can't guarantee you'll think much of it other than an occasional time-waster with pretensions it isn't able to back up, and that's a pity because it could have been something so much more special.

												I had bought this game on steam on sale this past holloween for $10...$10 well spent. Yes the combat can be a little bit annoying at first, but its definitely not the worst. The games combat feels clunky at first, especially if youre used to target ,right click, followed by hotkey presses here and there like WOW or GW2, but once you get the hang of it, its actually a lot better than some F2P MMO's or even payed ones too. The setting feels refreshing and new, the story is well played and the limit on the amount of quests you can have at a time allow that story to be noticed (til this day i can shamefully say i have no idea what the story is about in WOW). the fact that there is no leveling or even a class system is a very bold move for an MMO and kinda shows ESO how this system should've been implemented in some sort, as thats how Elder Scroll games are supposed to be, yes skyrim is the only one with absolutely no class system but even earlier elder scrolls titles gave you the option to create your own class to your liking, which is what TSW does very well. also one thing you either love or hate is the option to change and reassign set skills, to hardcore rpg or mmo players, having those choices engraved forever means you have to choose wisely and level your toon very carefully, that is the challenging factor that makes a good game, however the other end adds flexibility for newbies, and expands ever changing features where you wouldnt have to start a new toon to experience said features. The games graphics are rather poor for a post 2010 game, however this is where accessibility is brought into the picture. Realistically, not everyone has a top of the line computer, so with that said it can run on most PCs. Now since im fairly new to this game (but not to the MMO genre) i didnt experience that many bugs in the game, so its fairly polished at this point, but i did hear horror stories in the beginning.Overall this game is a great MMO, its combat is an ""either you love it or hate it"" situation, Graphics are poor but not terrible, its not perfect and to some it might be dull, but if youre tired of playing MMO's that desperately copy the WOW formula or are in a over-used J.R.R. Tolkien cookie-cutter fantasy, then give it a shot, if youre still not convinced, wait for it to go on sale			"

												(HEY! If you just bought this game in the sale, there's some noob tips at the end of this to help your experience!)If you want your 100% typical MMO experience, where you have to skedaddle your way through highly-obvious grinds and lock into a class and settle on things, don't play this game. The Secret World (TSW) is a game that obviously experimented in every field of MMO gameplay for the sake of standing out. And in my honest opinion, it worked out. The first thing you'll notice is the missions. They did a really, really good job on the missions. You're pretty much taken on a journey from the second you're forced to find your way to your chosen faction's HQ. By the way, Factions only affect main storyline, pre-made decks, where your HQ is, and PVP by the way. A lot of people use them for roleplaying purposes. You can do most non-faction quests regardless of faction. All main missions and ""storyline"" missions are fully voice-acted, and you'll fall in love (or hate) with many of the characters. Plus, they're all pretty well-written; the game really stands by its mantra of ""Everything is True,"" and it shows. In terms of objectives, the missions are always similar, but not the same. There are some ""investigation missions"" that are basically like a giant mystery, involving real-world research and thinking outside of the box. That's also paired with some ""stealth"" missions, plus your typical MMO missions; honestly, though, you'll only realize you're grinding if you pull yourself out of the immersion. Speaking of grinding, the class/role system, if you can even call it that, is unique but fun. Basically, you're only given a choice of weapons that accomplish different roles, and it's up to you to figure out the best way of building up your character. And everything depends on your weapon choices. Although it seems complex at first, once you figure out the role of each weapon - and they aren't always what you think - you can easily find a play style that suits you. I've seen other MMOs try the ""choose-your-path"" style of role-building, but none quite work as naturally as this. The fighting is something that you either absolutely love or despise. Paired with the weapon system, it can prove complex for newer players. There's a lot of kiting, which they honestly never really talk about; you just have to figure it out on your own. But with practice and the right set of character abilities, it's something you can get used to. The endgame stuff isn't as easily achievable as one may think. Here's the thing - the $30 set is the ""base game,"" and then for $10 each after, you can buy extensions to the game that give you more plot. The good news is that I hear nothing but good about these ""Issues,"" as they call them, like ""issues"" of a comic book or magazine. The developers clearly intend on putting out high-quality, entertaining content (with some good diversity, if I may add). The bad news is that there's a lot of this content, and without getting a hold of it, the endgame community may seem a little isolating. I do have to talk about the community and support. Two words: Absolutely unmatched. All of the veterans are really noob-friendly (as far as I've seen), and many come back for their ""nightmare mode"" (endgame difficulty) and extra missions, but stick around and will answer questions and even do dungeons. There's a sizeable roleplaying community that has a lot of great events and great people, and it may drag out your TSW experience (like it did for me) and keep you engaged. The developers are the icing on the cake. Sweet, rich buttermilk icing. Although they are largely hands-off, they lurk in the forums and roleplaying communities and keep an eye out for the players. (We're pretty sure they cracked a joke about one of our roleplaying characters at some point in the last week.) They have a ""monthly director letter"" where they chat about progress and upcoming events and content, as well as their intentions behind everything. And they're dorks. Complete and utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dorks. Their selection of cash-shop clothing, their absurd number of pop culture references, the Lovecraftian air of the starter section, and some of their missions. What a bunch of dorks. If you plan on starting TSW keep the following in mind:Join the Arcadia or Cerberus servers. The former is livelier and has a lot of great players, the latter has more people and... more great players. You WILL use two weapons. Embrace them. Decks! Do a deck. They guide you into a weapon role. Open up your ability screen and to the left you'll see ""decks."" Choose a starter deck unless you're feeling courageous. Don't just skip through the mission briefings. The quests are really well-done and roll into one another. Collect lore! They look like little yellow boxes with hexagons on them. They give you EXP, achievements, and items. And again, everything's very, very well-written. Don't be scared to ask questions in General Chat. Everyone's usually very nice and willing to ask questions or help. The only place spammed with trades is Agartha (where you go from place to place). PVP is not a place for noobs. Wait until you're at least done with Solomon Island. Conclusion: This is definitely worth $30, and it's a steal if it's on sale. You can use as much time playing it as any $60 new-release game. Actually, you can put more time into it. Why shouldn't you? The developers and community put a lot of love into the game, and it really shows.			"

												I don't often write game reviews, but The Secret World compels me to write one.First off, the virtual world is incredibly detailed and the atmosphere really does fit the theme of a creeping horror. Very Lovecraftian in most places. The cut scenes are always worth watching. It isn't a game for those with short attention spans, the missions are designed to be solved like a puzzle and the clues are often hard to spot if you aren't paying attention. Sure some seem like the standard kill x monsters, but the Lore and backround built into them does make it very different from the usual MMOs. The in-game community is very friendly too. There's never any awkwardness about asking for help - sometimes there'll be offers of aid in general chat, so even if you're shy about asking complete strangers, there's plenty of opportunity to voice your questions then. Chances are, someone else could be stuck on the very same mission and you'd be helping them out too.			"

												At first I was a bit cautious of the game. I bought it, played it for a little bit then left it to go do something else with some friends for a while. As time went on, I actually yearned to play the game and get invovled with the stories the game offers.. I would reccomend this game to anyone looking for something different in way of stories and lore.As for game mechanics... The ability wheel is nice. I really enjoy the fact I can mix and match abilities to get the exact build I want. Can't get better than that.  The fighting is typical of any mmo... point, click, etc etc... but what makes this one different in my eyes is the fact that there are the covert missons, the puzzle missions... you actually have to think and explore.

												This is, without a doubt, the coolest MMO I've ever played.  The Secret World, while unfortunately mechanically uninteresting most of the time, is the smartest, best-written MMO on the market today.  Investigation missions are a welcome (and much-needed) break from the standard ""kill 5 boars"" fare of the modern World of Warcraft clone.  This game makes you think to solve its puzzles, and it will make you feel like an idiot.  But that's a good thing, really, if you're looking for something different.  This is the first MMO where I didn't just mindlessly click through a million of the exact same kill/fetch quests  over and over and over again to grind to the level cap. I care about the characters and their stories.  The voice acting is great, and the writing is dark and witty.I love this game, and hope it sticks around.Just wish they'd make the combat as interesting and fun as the rest of the game. "

												The Secret World (TSW) is the first MMORPG that kept my attention long enough for me to actually reach the max level of the game. To a lot of people that's probably an easy task - but a lot of these styles of games are a grind. TSW, however, is not any ordinary game. It's smart, it's terrifying, and its action packed. The story is a unique blend of action, adventure, and horror, and I can promise you that you’ll never be bored if that’s your kind of thing. The gameplay is unique in the fact that you can play all the major roles on the same character. This means ideally that you only need one character in the game – but they still give you three slots if you want one character for each faction. You have to pick and choose your build, only having a select number of ability and passive skill slots at any given time. It makes you think, and you have to adapt to different situations.So far the game has a lot of replay value in the dungeon content, along with the ability to repeat any mission you’ve done. They also have some really cool season specific events around Halloween and Christmas which make the atmosphere even better.  As for end game content, I’m still working my way in getting there. I’ve just finished issue #8, and will be venturing into the new Tokyo issues very soon.  If you’re looking for a normal run of the mill MMORPG – this isn’t for you. If you’re looking for a challenge, and value story - pick this up. You won’t regret it.			"

												[I run the game outside of Steam so you may not see here that I have spent hundreds of hours playing it.]Where do I even begin describing it? The Secret World is a special game, a truly unique and rare beast. You will most probably either fall in love with it and become obsessed, or you will hate it and never want to think about it again. If I had to describe it in a single sentence I'd say that it's like an old shop hidden in an obcure part of town that is full of antique treasures as well as cheap forgeries. There is magic and beauty to be found, and there is the mundane and ugly.In a way it destroyed other MMOs for me completely. The lore and atmosphere are absolutely unmatched in the ""genre"" and have little competition in gaming as a whole. It is one of the few games which you can call ""mature"" and there are a few reasons for that. Gameplay mechanics and group content don't lend themselves to mindless smashing. Hardcore puzzles demand brain power of a seasoned adventurer and scholar. Dark subject matter and numerous popcultural references cannot be appretiated without familiarity with at least some classic books and movies, which usually comes with age. I have never encountered a childish behaviour from any of the players. Even young or less patient people seem a bit nicer than in your usual MMO and you can feel a sense of wonder emanating from them.How you react to what The Secret World has to offer depends very much on your gaming and... yes, I'm gonna say it... life experience. If you are seeking a virtual place you can inhabit and keep coming back to, that can be a catalyst for unique social interactions and gaming experiences no matter how much of the content you have cleared, The Secret World is very likely a game for you. If you are a kind of MMO player that values super-polished gameplay, meaningful loot drops and item progression with attractive, repeatable end-game content above all other components, you will be gravely disappointed.It's not to say that there's no good loot/grind to be found. I ran group ""dungeons"" countless times and for some weird reason I still want to do more of them, even though I never liked repeating the same content over and over in other MMOs. ""Dungeons"" are among the best you can find in online games today - locations are beautiful and atmospheric, enemy encounters are interesting and demanding. I aknowledge however that many people will find the amount of group content to be lacking.Your enjoyment also depends on how much are you willing to invest. Steep learning curve, importance of logical thinking and puzzle-solving skills coupled with an overwhelming collection of skills and gameplay that's never broken but only solid at best can scare many potential players. However you can make a really strong argument that those are the game's big strengths, keeping impatient people and ""kids"" out, while giving more demaning players meat they can sink their teeth into. I for one, though not much of a puzzle-solver, really appreciated ancient mysteries that had to be cracked and eventually became familiar with the complex skill system.The Secret World wants you to observe, listen and think. To let go of the real life and immerse yourself in its dreamlike vision. Yes, it will frustrate you many, many times, but its shortcomings always stem from its desire to engage more than just your fingers on the keyboard, but also your mind, personality and imagination.

												Yes. This was everything I wanted it to be.An MMORPG in the modern world. With every possible myth, legend, lore, and tale in the hidden, Secret World view.No levels, but as you gain experience you choose to unlock more abilities themed around weapon types. Choosing your abilities and maximizing synergies with effects feels like TCG's deck building.  I love combining dual-wield pistols with lightning attacks.Quests are more than ""Kill x# of y"" and some are full-on puzzles worthy of classic Adventure Games or Myst in their diabolical obscurity, many requiring intentionally looking up information in the real world; bridging the game's themes of conspiracy into IRL.Great game for RP.This is maybe the only online multiplayer type game where I'm not rushing to get to max level, because I feel everything on the road there is worth experiencing. I never feel like I'm grinding.The only negative IMO is that the engine doesn't feel optimized; only a very good PC is going to run it smoothly, even with all of the settings turn pretty far down.

												""It's an MMO for the intelligent gamer.""The Secret World had a lot of hype when it first began circling the web and thankfully it delivered.  The repetitive quests age is over and you will not find a lack of things to kill or puzzles to solve. And when I say puzzles, I don't mean ""light the pillars in the correct order"", I mean translate “Clavis Aurea” from Latin which means ""Golden Key"", go back to City Hall you wandered through on that other mission, grab the giant key on the wall, bring it back, and see if it opens the door. In simpler terms, you will never have to worry about having to go kill 10 monsters for this NPC and then 15 for the next.The Secret World is also a classless game, you aren't stuck playing the fighter or rogue. However, you must be careful what abilities you invest in, because there isn't a reset potion. Which means if you invest 500pts in swords and then decide you want to wield a gun instead, you can't relocate those points and will be weaker with the guns against tougher monsters unless you go back to a easier area. That's not to say you'll get bored with the sword, but it does make you question where to put each and every point you gain.All and all, it’s a good MMO and well worth the onetime payment. If MMOs are your thing (and you like the World of Darkness/Cthulhu feel) I would recommend giving The Secret World a shot.			"

												The Secret World is pretty cool.I think the best thing about the game is the writing - the quests, characters, stories & locations are clearly a labour of love.The game itself is actually quite fun to play, too.It gives you the freedom to develop in any area you like, and there's really no reason not to experiment.  If I had to choose a favourite style of character progression in an MMO, I'd go with the old school 'Ultima Online' approach, where your skills develop as you use them.  (Well, actually they had that in some MUDs well before MMOs but let's not get bogged down on details).The Secret World simply rewards you with Ability Points (used to learn skills) and Skill Points (learned to get stronger) .. hmm, writing that down it sounds weird .. but anyway, you get the points and have the freedom to spend them anywhere .. the game has an ability wheel that is in many ways strange and counter-intuitive, but when you work it out, it's good.The game makes a strong first impression, but then, as you step toward mid-game, starts to wane a little .. so I think most players are either:Dabblers - new players giving it a goCitizens - folks who have had their dabble and powered through, or went away and came back (like me)When I returned to the game after my dabble, I suddenly 'got' it.  I understood the mechanics better and was a LOT more successful in my play - and once you hit that point where you're comfortable with the mechanics, the game becomes really quite cool indeed.Give it a dabble.  If it's not your cup of tea, try again a month later.You won't regret it.  It's a good game.			"

												In this modern world where every legend is true, you begin to choose a faction.A secret one !The "" I will destroy every evil and whatever if everyone see me "" Templars.The "" Money, power, sex, drug, and Game of Throne "" Illuminatis.And the unknown, strange, users of the chaos theory, the Dragons.Each has his own view of the world, and his own way to deal with it.Then, you create your character. with modern clothes. Unhappily, there isn't much choice of clothes and faces.But you will be able to gain more later.Then, your first cinematic, introducing you to this strange world, and your strange faction.But whoever you decided to join, you got magical power, and you will have to master them.During the tutorial where you begin to learn and get even more questions about your faction, you will learn to fight.And you have hundred of ways to do it, there are two time more skills.Don't worry if you put your hard earned skill points in the bad tree, you can get every skill.The only limit is the number of active and passive slot :-)Let's fight with pistols, shotguns, rifles, sword, hammer, claws, chaos magic, blood magic, and elemental magic :DYou can use two different weapons, so slow down this guy with a shot in the knee and make him burn with a fireball !But it's your skills, and the one you will fight against in the three different pvp area, where the three-faction system allows the two weakest to ally (for a time :D) against the strong one.In pve, monsters do basic attacks with sometimes an area of effect you have to evade.But don't worry, bosses in dungeon have all interesting mechanics, and almost none little encounter on which you will loose your time.But what about your stuff ? Plate armor in a modern day ? Nope, in this game your skin is totally different than your power. You can wear clothes with none stats, and relics which only affect your power.So the day where you hesitate to leave your low level armor because it's so beautiful is now over :DDuring your adventures, you will have to explore to discover the Lovecrafty lore, to kill, to investigate with clues and your brain.To fight against this hard game, you will play with the most mature community I met in a dozen years of gaming .)And the beautiful writting and voice-acting will give you even more courage, you will want to know what's next !Why is there war in this world where history show that hate build nothing ?Why is there starvation when we can feed all humanity ? Why you still don't play this game ?			"

												While not amazingly visually stunning, the gameplay itself is quite enjoyable for an MMO. The quests are a bit more challenging - especially the investigation ones - Hope you like googling Latin :)The storyline itself is what keeps me playing, I have not skipped a single video sequence - quite a rarity for me. Even the mission/quest vids help the storytelling along by setting the appropriate drama/horror feel. It is quite an intrigiuing storyline, although each of the ""Chapters"" seems to independant of each other. Each Chapter storyline is never truly ""wrapped up 100%"" so that you are always left wondering if there is going to be more content to keep fleshing out that particular section.I also like the ""open class"" system, a lot of variety to ""play your way"" instead of being restricted to specific builds. The ability to Load and Save your preferred combinations is a great idea and allows flexibility for gameplay.It is easily solo-able with a number of different healing ""weapons"" available to create a survival build, although in the early sections if you can pump out enough damage, you can usually stay alive against all but the larger mobs.And the best thing?? No subscription and no crippled Pay-to-Play interface like SWTOR.All of the game content is available to play, with DLC addons availble (callled ""Issues"" )In my opinion, is one of the better models for Free-to-Play out there, as it has survived remarkably well against other titles that went free-to-play.Regarding 5-man dungeons - I recommend ALWAYS playing as a DPS. Tanking and healing are a pretty big deal and you have to be geared in a very specific way. You will also cop it from the whole group - as you won't be able to finish the dungeon if you aren't set up properly. Best left to the more experienced players until you start reading the forums on how to gear correctly for the roles.All in all I give this game 9/10.For what this game provides, it is highly entertaining and keeps me coming back to play it.More fun in a group, but easily played as a solo with a bit of forethought.Once again, not amazingly graphically stunning, but I don't need all the ""pretties"" to have fun playing a game.Read below only if you would like to know a little more about the paid DLC available for The Secret World (""Issues"") that can be bought in-game ***UPDATED September 2014***  I have recently purchased the additional ""Issues"" and am really enjoying the new storyline content. ********CONTAINS SPOILERS*********Issue #5 was full of great additional storyline - great narrative from ""Tyler Freeborn"" and a great spooky ending.Loved the Indiana Jones ripoff quest (with Ark of the Covenant, rolling boulder and the new Whip auxilliary weapon) in Issue #6Issue #7 was very tongue-in-cheek with numerous ""spy film"" references and tropes.The action was great and I finally got to ride my own vehicle, A Snowmobile! ( if only for about 4 minutes lol)The storyline was in-depth and intriguing and I enjoyed the ""reveal"" near the end (although I had already kind of guessed) Plus you get the Flamethrower aux weapon, what's not to like!!!Issue #8 I am not really a fan of so far. I may change my mind later on, but it defintely feels like it is filler content. I'm guessing Funcom was pressured to make more end-game content, so they came up with 3 grindy ""Scenario simulations"" that you can play repeatedly at different levels of difficulty.My guess was players wanted something to play while their Nightmare Dungeon runs were on cooldown. Unfortunately, the scenarios have cooldown timers as well!!I purchased a Tokyo pass from a vendor, which delighted me that I did not have to grind the scenarios for it ( I believe you need to purchase the Sidestories: Further Analysis to be able to do this)Issue #9 TOKYO!! A whole new area with an additonal level of difficulty. All enemies now have ""shields"" and you have to match your damage type (AEGIS) to that particular shield type to be able to damage it.The major drawback is that swapping between the 3 AEGIS damage types while in combat will disable your ability to attack for 5 seconds while you change them over!!! I found Tokyo quite challenging, even the trash mobs tend to kill you if you arent prepared (eg having the right AEGIS powers equipped beforehand)The quests were quite entertaining and now that the ""Pagan Sidestories"" have been released, there is even more content to play in Tokyo before Issue #10. (Issue #9 without the Sidestories was a little sparse on repeatable quests)Unfortunately as this area is purely end-game content, ""grindy"" elements have come into play- repeating the missions to purchase upgrades for your AEGIS powers and grinding mobs to upgrade the ""research"" levels on the AEGIS controllers.Once again, some great pop-culture references from some of the NPCs made me laugh quite a lot.Can't wait for Issue #10 now.

												First Look ReviewThe Secret World is a very different type of MMO. The Secret World strengths are in its missions. Missions now take research and all no longer just simple ""fetch"" quests. Some investigative missions actually use external game assets, like browsing Google to find a certain game related websites. These kinds of ideas are innovative and really provide the player a sense of immersion. The Secret World is a very challenging MMO and does have a learning curve. Not having a level cap is a hard concept to grasp when playing for the first time. Since the player can basically have all the skills in the game, its hard for a new player to decide what starting skills would be beneficial for early game. Personally, I did not do any research on skills and leveled Shotgun to start out. I soon realized during my first dungeon encounter that some boss uses a good number of Area of effect spells, basically causing me a lot of deaths and very little DPS. My recommendation for a new player is to decide early on the type of player you would like to be (Damage, Healing, Tank) and research what skills would be the best for these roles for early in the game. But, since this game does not have a dedicated class system, players can change skills on the fly to meet the needs of the encounter. Again, great flexibility and innovation.In my 50 hours of gameplay, I did notice some difficulty scaling issues. Without prior research, its hard to determine if the player has the power to survive the encounter. I noticed this while primary completing the story quest and have come to a point where I need to complete other missions for skill points to level up my health and damage. Again, this is due to the fact I went into this MMO without prior knowledge. The Secret World forums has a great write-up on how monsters difficulty is determined based on the estimated power of the player. The Secret World is a fun and challenging MMO and is recommended for any players looking for a flexible and different experience than any other current generation of MMO's. "

But know that it's so much much more than another cookie cutter MMO. Classless, it encourages you to think outside of the box in solving combat situations. And the story is as thought provoking as it is engaging, taking you through a slew of uniquely-spun takes of myths and legends that would leave the brothers Grimm proud.			"

There is also no numbered leveling system. I like the Lovecraftian feel to it and there are plenty of creepy stories that make me hesitate going alone to certain areas.

												10/10 would go beneath the primal fluid again.I definitely enjoyed the game for the price I paid for it. There's plenty of skills to choose from, so you can mess around with different combinations. Quests for this game is very interesting and some are pretty hard if you don't look up a guide to it. If you can find some awesome people to play with, this game will go a long way for you. You choose from one of the three factions: Templars, Dragons, and Illuminati. Each faction is against each other in PVP but in the PVE world you are all together. The server you pick only matters for PVP aspect of the game as you will be able to play with everyone for PVE. Cabals which are the guilds in this game are faction specific, so if your a Templar you can't make a cabal with your Illuminati friend. The biggest downside to this game is the player base. Even with all the servers being able to play with each other, there are times where it is dead.Pros:- Lots of skills to play with- Lots of weapon choices- Lots of unique quests- Storyline is pretty interesting (different for each faction, Illuminati is the best in my opinion haha *eye in the sky*)- Dungeon bosses gain different abilities depending on difficulty- Can unlock everything on 1 character (weapons and skills)Cons:- Community is dwindling- Combat system is not for everyone- PVP unbalanced (normally 1 faction dominates, depends on the servers your grouped with)- Dungeon/Raids get repetitive- Slow updates- Gotta buy ""Issues"" for some new content (not really a bad thing since your supporting the game but it might not appeal to everyone)If you meet anyone from my Cabals Lachesis, Atropos or Clotho, they are some awesome people :D Unfortunately I have not been playing the game for a while now.PS: Beware of Sliggity he's a therapist.

												So, it has been some time since I wrote a review for this game. Before whenever I did I was somewhat interested and said it was just a good game. But after spending many...many hours in this game and hitting a mark where I am doing end game content, I must say that I am thoroughly impressed. This game is a very unique MMO and pretty amazing if you are interested in the RPG community in it as well. Not many reviews here will talk about the ARGs, ((Alternate Reality Game)) that they do, blurring the line between real and fake. The Twitterverse, where you hop on twitter and post as your char, the developers even get in on it and post things as characters in the game world! It is super awesome and super fun if you are into that!If you are into just solo gameplay, this game has you covered as well! An amazing story with likeable chars, unique quests and amazing music! The PvE is amazing as the customization for your ""Deck"" ((Set of skills)) is amazing. You can be anything you want and that is always awesome.PvP, the community is full of amazing people. Before when I wrote the review I didn't talk about PvP... but this is the first time where I have entered a PvP area as a noob and had people actually helping me, wanting me to do better and willing to HELP me do better by giving me advice in very nice ways, never rude.Now, ever game does have it's flaws, this game can be a bit buggy at times and Egypt... *Shudders* Egypt has an AMAZING story, but I found myself struggling to get through it at times. Other than that though, this game is nothing short of awesome.do yourself a favour and pick up this game. This is quite literally the best MMO I have ever played and it would be nice to have more people on here!			"

												It's an MMO for grownups. Lots of fun quests where you have to look things up out of game, and actually use your brain and stuff! There's also a good it of the down and dirty killing things, but with a storyline so good you'll not want to skip the cutcenes explaining EACH quest. Even the NPCs are so awesome and individual that you'll want to stop and chat with them... like the Sir in the park in London. You actually feel like you're a part of this awesome place. Huge open maps that you can either physically walk to and from each place OR fast travel to from a really unique hub.My only qualm is that I wish they'd trust the player a bit more in the character creation. You can create a unique character but it never really feels unique enough. Lots of awesome clothing choices though to make up for it. You can also pretty much create whatever play style you'd like.

												I purchased this game during the original launch. There was a spirit that was there with the release (for anyone who saw the teaser commercials) that really had a hard time making it to the game.I am a huge Lovecraft fan and I enjoy every aspect of cosmic horror. The base game captures a lot of cosmic horror elements quite well, but if you're not willing to pay every time you want to see a little bit of new content, you'll be left bored pretty quickly.Cons:- 0 Endgame- Poor optimization has plagued this game forever      - Makes PvP a chore to play through when multiple people group together      - High particle density boss fights lag- Gated 'premium' content (micro-expansions that nickel and dime you for 1 new dungeon and a minor story line)- Became a dress-up simulator after initial launch failed- World PvP is skewed by faction popularity (Illuminati -> Templars -> Dragon)Pros:- Alt-free system (on the fly class-changing)- Atmosphere and base story are amazing- Being a Templar- Not being a Dragon (who even are these guys)- Not being Illuminati			"

												THE SHORT REVIEW:A strange game that has a colourful setpieces, and wide range of interesting lore.THE LONG REVIEW:The Secret World actually caught my attention because I saw the word ""conspiracy theory"" in the description; it just goes to show you where I get my entertainment. Anywho, The Secret World is a mashup of just that, along with strange myths and legends, and secret societies that you get to take a part in (LIKE THE ILLUMINATI!!!). At first it sounds a little odd because it's set in modern day, but I can assure you that it's a welcome change of pace from the Fantasy and Sci-Fi setpieces that other games have. The story is fairly straight forward, you pick your faction, and develop your character from that point on. As my main, I was able to chose two starting abilities, the first being the ability to use an Assault Rifle and a Sword; which was awesome because the way in which it's presented to you.I think most of my fondness for the game comes from just the mystique of the world and factions. There is just so much lore that you want to discover because it takes on all of those myths, and conspiracy theories that are so entertaining to read about already. So props to the developers for taking on something that I don't even think anyone else has taken on (to my knowledge), technically they're lore is already made for them.But as cool as The Secret World is the graphics and animations can be a little stiff at times, making it kind of dated, but if you have a decent PC you should be able to up the settings. The UI is also kind of cumbersome to use, it's a little bit all over the place, and not very straight forward. In other games, things kind of come to you intuitively, but here you have to sort of test things out to see if they work. Which brings me to my next point, questing. Questing can be great if you get the hang of things, but it was so bothersome seeing so many just all over the place. I'm fine with games making plenty of content available, but I think that the harder missions should have been locked away from sight until the player reached the apropriate level; I saw way to many HARD or VERY HARD quests that I wanted to take on but really couldn't because I kept dying or I just didn't want to bother, which bothered me because it felt like a waste leaving quests there open.Oh, the other thing is that dying isn't normal either. When you do die, your spirit gets respawned at a point and you have to run to your body to revive them. Strange I know, but it works for the universe  - though after a while it might be annoying for some peopleOverall The Secret World is an odd gem, it has a lot going for it's strange premise and the concepts are all there to back it up. I really have been enjoying my time playing the game, aside from the few problems I had. The Secret World is an easy reccomendation, and if you decide to play the game, it's best to do it with friends since the experience will be a tiny bit better; again it's not your typical MMO, approach it as a game like DIABLO or DESTINY.MADE FOR: People who love conspiracies and the secret societies surrounding them.  NOT MADE FOR: People expecting a full blown MMO in the same vein as say World of Warcraft.THE SECRET WORLD8/10			"

												The Secret World is a really fun MMO which I wish was more popular, or it may be because of the server I am playing out. But nonetheless it is a really fun game and the mechanics, abilities and story are really ground breaking and interesting. It can be a bit glitchy at time, and PVP is pretty difficult as a low level with low level equipment, but it is gauranteed to be a fun experience playing with friends, or simply doing something alone depending how you play MMOs.

												I absolutely love this game. If you're a fan of the Supernatural and being badass, this game is for you.What I really like is that you can play alone or with friends and the challenges are the same. I've only played for 40 hours, but after playing some other multiplayer games with toxic communities, this one is not one of them. Everyone is very friendly, and most times are willing to help and teach the beginners.It is also a very forgiving game. If you don't like a weapon set up you may have picked before, you can easily switch to another set and begin storing points for them. The only thing I find lacking is the character customization as the males and females have a set body figure. You can make them shorter or taller but their body shape remains the same. I also think that more customization would be highly benefitial to the game, but I do like that you can wear anything you want and it's not covered by ugly suits of armor. All in all, I recommend this game for the player base and the gameplay, as well as the story.			"

												I have a love-hate relation with TSW. I really like the character system used, giving you a lot of freedom on how you want to progress. An other very good point of TSW is the questing system. You can't just pick up every quest out there and you haveto be keep on what quests you take. I also like how the game looks like - it really gives you an apocalypse kinda feeling.What I don't like are the hordes of zombies (which are pretty agile BTW) that you see everywhere and how some are really overpowered. An other bad thing is the 'X marks the spot' idea for quests. You can see from afar where you have to go to, to do your thing :(Last but not least, the game absolutely looks stunning!Addendum July 8th, 2016 I've give TSW an other try the last two weeks and it's growing a lot on me. These last two weeks I've played over 50 hours already. One of the biggest problems I had with TWS (the hordes of zombies) is almost gone now, because I've moved out of Kinsmouth Town and went on the the Savage Coast, and am about to hit the Blue Mountains. Though there still are a lot of zombies around, the game finally goes deeper into the Lovecraftian lore as well...An other thing to point out (and why my love-hate relationship started) is the main story of the game. In the past I tried to do that one and pick up some missions along the way. This results in the game becoming extremely hard (close to impossible) for me when the main story hit the Blue Moutain. Now I've changed my focus more on completing the maps and do the main story as I'm on that map.Last but not least, I've always loved the story telling as it was done and it's been the reason I gave TSW a try more than once. A day or 2 ago I spoke with a veteran player and he told me that the main developer (who now has left) was a vivid role-player. I guess that's why I loved the story telling so much, having played Dungeons & Dragons for close to 3 decades and recognize when an experienced GM has laid out the main story.			"

												WOW! What a highly under-rated game! Nothings here I would consider 'new' or 'special' (with the exception of investigation missions having me looking up ancient latin text in Google to get a code to open a door to then have to find a famous composers name to solve a riddle in a painting to then... （の ワ の ）it's fun) but the mature, modern setting with the Dark supernatural HP Lovecrft themes... Refreshing. Some nice voice acting as well. Better than average for sure. Effective story telling for the missions. Free form choice of weapons, abilities, and specs to playstyles. Plenty of choice. No P2W aspect within the microtranactions, all clothes, digital dressup. The way I prefer it and am happy to support with micro purchases from time to time. Worth every penny for 30$. If you happen to pick it up on sale, even more value. You'll even get 10$ in ingame micro currency for completeing 30 missions on your account. Free money to buy some personal style from the store!!Totally worth the time youll put in for the money you spent. Especially with no subs.			"

												Seriously why is this game so under-rated and buried. Me and my wife have absolutely loved this game. We really enjoyed it when it first released. We had some computer issues. Got them fixed and forgot to come back. Gameplay is solid. The mechanics of attacking feel good. The Storyline is to die for. Lack of a class system provides an interesting challenge when doing AP/SP. The graphics are also quite fantastic. Seriously very well could be the most under-rated game of all time. I will say i'm unsure of the END game. But honestly the storyline alone is worth the bang for the buck.			"

I am now fluent in Latin and Romanian, and have applied for a job as a codebreaker.The dungeons are great fun.The abilty wheel allows so much customisation to builds.Great Community.Cons: Crafting seems pretty pointless.Combat is very basic.The engine is a bit dated! (the zones look amazing though!)In the 2 funcom games i have played, the guild/cabal panel/options always seem like an afterthought and are not prominent are interesting.... basically a list of names!

												So I've been playing this game about 2 weeks, and I really like it.  I had played AO from launch, and decided I'd skip Funcom games until they got their act together.  I have to say, The Secret World ain't bad.  It's not my beloved City of Heroes, but then ... nothing will be.It's a truly classless and levelless system of the kind Ultima Online wanted to be.  Every character can have every skill at max in the end game.  What makes that interesting is that you can only use a limited set of skills (a ""deck"") at once.  The game really shines when you figure out new builds from what you've unlocked.Plus, I adore Lovecraft.  This game is like mainlining heroin for a Cthulhu fan.  It's a dark, atmospheric war among 3 factions.  The mythology is Harry Potter meets At the Mountains of Madness with a dollop of Bram Stoker.  Good stuff. "

												I'm gonna Say it Here... I Love this Game and I Don't know why.Maybe its the design, maybe its the way the system opens up as you get more Xp, or how no ability is locked off to you without Reason (Story Spoilers for why 1-2 Abilities are locked.. so i won't get into it). The ""Deck"" design for building your character is nice and gives decent hints for how to play different Playstyles, In-game tutorials are there if you need them for most of the Systems that are in the Game... And the Community is Generally friendly.The story is fun (For Me atleast) and goes into directions that are predictable sometimes and sometimes a Complete Curveball (Transyvania and Dracula are one of the more interesting ones). Then there is the Lore entries... You don't just get one or 2 pieces of information about whats going on or Concepts.. you get massive logs to look though that give enough information to sate most people.. and those things it doesn't answer? It's usually just not something you've found yet...Overall I recommend The Secret World.... It's a Fun Romp though a Modern World that's going though a Magical Apocalypse as Cthuluoid entities (And Things MUCH WORSE) are waking up and breaking into our reality....The Dreamer's Wake, How will you stop them?

I loved the world and atmosphere this game gave off, but at every turn I felt like the game could be so much better if it was a single player RPG instead of an MMO. The combat and animations suffer and the fact that enemies respawn after you've killed them just leaves the game feeling hollow. I truly feel if Funcom were to take this world and make a Vampire the Masquerade style game out of it, it would be amazing. "

												I payed full price for this, and to be honest, judging by how the game looks and how the concept was presented, it looked sweet. Now that I played some of it, it really becomes repetitive, especially that you can re-do missions that give you more money or experience than others, and some of them are investigation missions too, it just feels like you are solving the same mistery over and over again just to grind some daily credits. Gets boring really fast, also eats up alot of RAM.			"

												The PvE is absolutely amazing, with freaky horror themes and mythology all mixed together.The PvP is the worst of any game I've ever played in my entire history of gaming. All of the builds in the game center around 1 of 3 of the most powerful crowd controls in the game, all of which being defined by the fact they have very little counterplay options because they are instant-cast and have 5 or less frames of windup animation.Ranged PvP can be defined as Cardiac Arrest + X. Every ranged build is just basic builders/consumers with that one hard-CC being the basis to all encounters that player has. Melee PvP can be define as  Strange Attractor + X or Double Impair Sword.And that's as deep as it goes. Funcom has no idea how to balance it so those 3 builds sit in masses alongside healers who have the age-old balance issues of almost every MMO's pvp healers, in that they heal wayyyyy too much because the game is PvE focused above all, and there isn't a true healthy mid point they can reach between being able to outheal raid bosses but still being able to die to player characters in PvP.If you're looking for a great PvE experience this one is worth a few weeks of play. If you're looking for PvP you should look elsewhere, this one is atrocious.			"

There are more type of quests, for example the investigation ones, where sometimes you have to browse the internet to find answers and clues. You have a great set of skills and weapons and you can freely choose what you want to level. You can choose from three secret society and every one of them are unique and really interesting (I especially like the templars with Dame Julia :D). The combat is not that interesting in my opinion, but not that bad, especially if you choose a weapon which you really like. I think it's a great game and if you like MMO's and interesting stories, you should definitely try this game out! :)			"

												I was really looking forward to this game, and thought it had a lot of potential.  It does have some good points, like a pretty engaging story, especially for an MMO, and a really cool look.  It also has a very nice skill system that allows a lot of customization.  Unfortunately, it's very grindy.  Not as bad as some MMOs, but you will end up running through the same areas, doing the same quests, killing the same monsters over and over again.  After a while it gets tiring.The biggest issue with the game, though, is that it forces you to do a lot of solo missions, where your friends cannot come along.  When you're playing through the game with a group, and suddenly you all have to go into solo instances for twenty minutes to do some mission, it kills a lot of the fun of the game.  And those are the best missions, the ones with story and complexity, but you can't play them with other people.Overall it's better than average for an MMO, and if you like the sort of urban fantasy vibe, it does that very well.

												I thoroughly enjoy this game, and that's a lot coming from someone who generally doesn't like MMO's. The Secret World is very unique in its setting and themes. It asks a lot of its players in terms of patience and dedication, but following through with the investigations the game presents to you is very rewarding. The world is full of secrets, and it is your job to unravel them!			"

												There's no game quite like The Secret World. It's a mish-mash of a lot of things. It works very well as a single player MMO. You get the feeling of a community, but you aren't constantly forced to group to get the best loot or the best experience. The thing that will keep you playing is the world. It is beautiful. As well as this the way you're character will look and feel will become a lot more personalized than other MMOs. Overall, it's definitely worth a look if it peeks your interest. Without a subscription fee, the amount of content packed into this game nowadays is great value for money.			"

												I've had expereince with many MMO's and RPG's. This one is so refreshing. It isn't the standard pick a class and level up system. This one allows you to be whatever you choose to. Whether you want to be up close, ranged, a mix between the two, or some random combination of skills that somehow you are able to make it work.In the game, you are able to use 2 different weapons at any given time, (Not including auxilary since I still havent made it that far) which already expands your capabilites beyond most other MMO's. Now if you don't like what you chose thats fine. You simply earn more Ability Points and Skill Points (which isn't hard at all) put them into a different category and start using different skills and weapons.All the main missions include cutscenes which are fully animated and IMO well written. Then you have side missions everywhere. Some are just there for extra experience, but most actually tie into either the main storyline or one of the main missions.But out of all the things this game offers, so far my favorite, is the investigation missions. These missions are difficult. They make you think. They only give you hints as what to do, you have to figure it out. There are no waypoints with this one. You will have to search things up and read from books, myths, news reports, and anything else you can think of just to be able to complete these. But if you don't care for this, then just google the mission follow the steps get the experience and move on with your life like a lame person would. (No offence to all those who do this.)I haven't experience everything this game has to offer yet, so I'll probably come back and add to this after another 100 hours of gameplay or so. Cause at this point, I only complete the first story mission I was assigned. From what I know, I still have 3 other HUGE zones that the story will go across and I've only done 1.So if you want a simple answer on whether or not this game is worth it. Yes. No subscription, but offer's just as much content as a subscription based game.			"

												I'm really happy I tried this game -- I've overlooked it for years.  I was a long time Warcraft player, and fell out of love because it felt like a grind.  Grind for materials.  Grind for money.  I always had a laundry list of quests with which I power levelled whatever character I needed.  I ran dungeons over and over again for that off chance I'll get that one drop.  TSW is different in that the quests are actually interesting.  I'm not asked to gather 10 goblin necklaces -- I'm asked to track down a serial killer.  And if, god forbid, I do have to kill X # of this, I can skip it.  There is enough content to level up.  And levelling -- I really enjoy it.  You always have points coming in with which you can change your character if you feel you've made a mistake or you feel unhappy with the current state you are in.  I do miss the days when tanks were tanks and healers were alts, but I don't have that sort of time.  I just want to get through some content.  It reminded me a bit of Grand Theft Auto.  A little open world exploration followed by cut scenes followed by action.  Except that you can bring friends.The down side -- this isn't the standard thief/wizard/cleric/fighter game.  It's not elves and tauren and humans cohabitating.  Just humans and more humans in horror settings.  This means that as a franchise it will probably never have the sort of draw as Warcraft.  No draw, dubious financial future, dubious life span of the franchise.  I expect one day to see the plug get pulled.  And I will be sad.  Second -- I hate enforced solo content.  Several times during the main story you are required to go to a solo instance and play and battle.  If you decided to go full healer, you are out of luck -- go back and replay content until you come up with a new build that will make it.  Sorry, but that's a bit silly.  I'm playing this with my wife, and that kind of thing just alienates people who are there to play in a group, or who need more guidance.  This, along with the almost sterilie LFG channel system makes a mess of the social nature of the game that I remember so well from everquest and warcraft.  Maybe it's not the game -- maybe it's me.  But I liked logging in to talk to my friends who were out questing.  I just don't feel any of that here.  And finally, and this is just my personal bias, the zoning system makes the different chapters of this game feel way too compartmentalized.  I get it -- they are different stories, but I remember how cool it would feel to trudge across a desert to find some semi active volcano and forest -- just wandering from end to end of a giant continent.  But that is just not part of the way TSW works.  You go to the first stage of Transylvania or Egypt or some harbor town -- you play enough of the story and you unlock the next zone.Honestly, I bought the massive edition for my wife and I.  It's the price of two new release games.  When I compare that to buying two copies of Black Ops or Saints Row or whatever, it's a game whose price tag is a steal and has more than enough adventure.

												This game is pretty awesome once you get the hang of it. Graphics are pretty awesome and i dont feel like i am forced to buy anything to progress. The cash shop does have items that increase your characters power but its only for early game content and is replaced fairly quickly.  The in-game browser is useful sometimes when you have to use it and believe me you will have to use it a lot. I like that i dont have to keep making new characters in order to try something different i just keep getting skill points and abilities points (AP & SP) and just level up the appropriate skills and im good to go! Crafting is a lot different than i am used to in any game. It is very difficult to understand if you do not do the tutorials as you go. Do not try to figure it out on your own trust me you wont be able to. Most of the zones i have seen so far have a kind of horror feel to them and as you wonder through the woods in some places you can hear chewing and ripping of flesh and some other unsettling noises which is kinda disturbing at first lol. I do recommend this game to everyone especially if its on sale .. you dont need a sub to play and progress in the game .. you only get extra XP and other resources from quest completion with a sub. The gameplay is unique and satisfying and everyone should try it out.Edit: Thought i would come back and give more info about the game that i did not provide in my review. You get your own museum which is sorta like a housing system to show off some cool stuff. Its all instance based and you display exhibits of the creatures you kill in the world. In order to display to the creatures you just simply kill them and collect lore as you quest or whatever it is you do in The Secret World. I suggest you wait until you have finished spending your AP (ability points) on your character progression before attempting to restore your museum. The exhibits are not free and will cost you quite a bit of AP in order to restore one exhibit.. there are many... many .. exhibits. I have spent quite a bit of time doing dungeons and world bosses recently and depending on which difficulty you do the dungeons you will find them quite difficult and you will die alot. Most of the encounters in the game are not melee friendly and have one shot potential so take this in consideration before trying out your builds. I recommend completing the starter decks to see what kind of weapons you would like to play with.			"

  The Secret World is the beast, in good and a couple of small bad ways First of all, I love this game. Weirdly enough, I have had some problems with a ""dxgi_error_device_removed"" error report, it is the first time I've seen this error. After install and observing the report I simply tried rebooting my system and after that, the game worked perfectly, at 100 - 120 fps I played for a couple of hours, and was really enjoyed. Next day when I tried loading the game, it came with the error, I tried rebooting without any luck and now I'm stuck with the error reports. Beside my frustration I can highly recommend this game, since this bug seems to be pretty uncommon for people with newer gear. I really hope the developers find a solution, in the meantime I will try to fix it myself.Of 2 hours of gameplay I can already say It's one of the most enjoyable MMORPG games I have ever played (I have played almost every popular EU&US MMORPG games there is) CPU Intel Core i5 3570K @ 3.40GHz  RAM 8,00GB Dual-Channel DDR3 @ 799MHz  Motherboard MSI Z77A-GD55 (MS-7751) Graphics BenQ XL2420T (1920x1080@120Hz)2 x 2047MB NVIDIA GeForce GTX 660 (MSI) SLI	 Storage 2 x 223GB Intel Raid 0 Volume (SATA)465GB Western Digital WDC WD5000AAKX-003CA0 (SATA)If anyone have an solution please tell. :-)			"

												Honestly: I would highly recommend this game. Enjoyable combat, interesting story, intriguing and well-realized setting, and deft writing with both a sense of gravity and humor. The MMO elements come on too strong for me, and honestly, I wish the game was more of a Borderlands style optional co-op, but it still works reasonably well the way it is. Additionally, I personally would prefer not having a completely silent protagonist without access to even text dialogue, although the fact that every quest of any import is given in soliloquy does do something to help with that. Overall, however, the game is fun enjoyable to play--and it would probably be even more so if the MMO elements were actually appealing to you.			"

												This is the best MMORPG I've ever played to ! I definitely recommend it.- The content is really mature and dark (Lovecraft influences), missions aren't about killing mobs only but it also involves stealth missions (don't try to kill mobs there you'll end up dead) and investigation missions (trust me you'd do things you'd never imagine doing while playing a game).- The universe is modern which is not common in MMORPG and it's very refreshing.- The gameplay is amazing, with 3 weapons (2 main and 1 auxiliary) you can create tons of build among 525 abilities (active and passive) depending the situation you're facing, there isn't level progression in the game and you can switch role (dps, healer, tank) at any time of the game but end game is more appropriate to do that.- The main story line is catchy and interesting. Templar, Illuminati, Dragon ... Chose your side.- The community is really involved in the game and is mostly really mature (especially during event time).Well I guess you can easily notice my love for this game however there are still few negative points about it.- As much as I love pvp in this game, it takes sometimes a long time to enter into pvp area due to the lack of pvp players.- The game engine suffer of some optimization problems especially when it comes to gather a lot of players at the same place (lots of fps decrease) and it also happens randomly at some specific places (and it's not a question of computer hardwares).- Developers are slow to release new contents even tho there are lots of things to do in The Secret World.Besides these few negative points, I must confess that this is one of the best game I've ever played to and I definitely recommend it if you're looking for a whole new experience !

The story is rich and very smart, a real thinker's game to be honest. No MMO has gotten me to really care for the story like this one has. The dialogue is rich and engaging, and while at times te ability wheel prevents your character from their potential,it adds to the challenge that is this game.

Character customization is great, the enviroments are huge and detailed. The enemies will send a tingle down your spine on some occasions.

I thought, man that's more my kinna game. So I finally purchased the base game, and still getting familiar with the game play. I have to say, even though I'm early in the game, it has been Fantastic! I hate I found out about it 2 years after the fact, and wished it had a bigger following. I tried to sell it to my WOW folks, but bad timing on that. :) Anyways, if you're into the MMO and the Horror genre, this is the ONE! Myself, looking forward to purchasing the remaing issues.			"

												A game that's fun and easy to pick up whenever. From lore hunters to endgame smashers, The Secret World is oft understated in the MMO world. I started out on my own originally, quit for about a year, then returned when a friend decided to join in. Since then, we've been joined by two more, who we are running through the hoops somewhat with laughter all around. Many TSW players will admit that starting out can be a little daunting since there is a learning curve, but those who stick around past the frustration will find the game rewarding in many ways.As several other reviewers have noted, this game is coded and run on Flash; however, there are player-made mods (Curse.com has a client that can install them for you) that can help with everything from re-arranging the user interface to auto-sorting your inventory. Additionally, the graphic may not make some of the graphically inclined too happy, but honestly I was not bothered by it and found it charming.I would go into depth on mechanics and whatnot, but it has been covered by others prior to myself. All-in-all, I recommend this game to anyone who wants a challenge.			"

I would recommend the game, I have played a few hours so I am not an expert, nor have I seen everything, but I like what I have seen so far.  There still are people playing it which is nice, the missions I have played so far seem varied and interesting, the graphics are pretty good, and the atmosphere is nice.  The game is not ground breaking, but it is a fun mmo to play.  The only probelms I have had with the game are the long amount of time the patching is taking, not sure if that is because I just purchased the game, but everytime I have wanted to play it is patching, at first it took a long time, now it is down to about 3 minutes.  The other problem is that I had a lot of stuttering when using dx11, so I had to switch to dx9 which I haven't had any problems with FPS wise or stuttering.  I like the game, I would recommend it for some fun playing experiences, definetly not the greatest game every, but for me it is very entertaining.  FYI there are some pretty good videos on youtube by Totalbiscuit and others if you want to look at gameplay prior to buying.			"

												i wanted this game, and bought it, because i'm a big mmorpg person. i didn't do much research before buying it on sale.this game has horror elements. one of the main missions required me to walk through a very poorly lit parkade, where i would sometimes be pulled to the side and attacked by pitch-black, disfigured mutants. at the end i had to defeat a monster that looked like a large, muscular, quadrupedal, vampire arnold (from hey, arnold) that also spawned in an area without light. let's just say it was ♥♥♥♥ing creepy, okay?for the first few areas of the game, i made sure to frequently empty my bladder to avoid any unwanted disruptions.i love the skill system. this isn't a game like world of warcraft where you pick your class and you're stuck with only three ways to play your character until you decide to reroll - it is completely possible to max out all skills and abilities in every section of the skill wheel. you can only have two weapons equipped at a time (not counting your auxiliary), and you have seven (plus one for auxiliary) active and passive ability slots.the combat is very good for a tab-targeting game. from very early levels, they teach you to watch your positioning and surroundings, and that is carried throughout the rest of the game. nearly every boss has mechanics that require you to pay attention to the fight and be aware to what they will do, and some mistakes could mean you sit out for the rest of the boss. there is very little room for error, especially if you lack self-heal or healing abilities.overall, i'm enjoying my experience so far. this game has a lot of small things that games i previously played had not offered me. i do not know what endgame consists of, but i would like to try to fill out my entire skill wheel before quitting.

												The greatest storytelling you've seen in an MMO (yes, story in an MMO, you heard me), combined with a cast of memorable NPCs and excellent voice acting makes TSW a worthwhile purchase even if you normally don't like this genre. You can play it as a traditional single-player RPG and still have a great time. And if you choose to stick around after finishing the story, the game has a surprisingly mature and friendly community that is always willing to help. Now go buy the Massive Edition, because it includes the last 3 issues, which are a treat to play.			"

												Excellent game with new innovative ""leveling"" system. The graphics aren't next gen, no, but they are pretty amazing for an MMO. The story is rich and very smart, a real thinker's game to be honest. No MMO has gotten me to really care for the story like this one has. The dialogue is rich and engaging, and while at times te ability wheel prevents your character from their potential,it adds to the challenge that is this game. Definite recommend for MMO skeptics like myself who usually quit MMO's after a couple of months.			"

												The Secret World is a somewhat unique and interesting take on the standard MMORPG fare. It stands out by having a strong focus on a rich and interesting world, a New World Order themed storyline, paranoid story elements and plenty of characters with their own agendas. TSW shies away from Elves & Orcs and medieval armor and instead brings a cleaner cut world, but one with interesting factions with their own stories to explore, and tons of interesting things to find.HighlightsThe great pleasures of The Secret World over its competitors come from the style and story matter and the very clear choice to make this game NOT full of the typical MMORPG mechanics and content. Quests, for example, are structured so that you can't simply walk from area to area collecting quests then running off to fulfil their requirements. Instead, mission types are usually very different and unique, have adjustable difficulty and more. They're designed to make you play in a different way, to be engaged in what you're doing and thinking about what's going on while you explore. Levelling up, another MMORPG standard, doesn't exist, and failing a mission wont make you want to fight more monsters, collect more resources or spend more gold. Instead you'll seek to approach something differently, fight the enemies more , or talk to characters you missed.* Voice acting is above average, especially for an MMORPG. It helps add distinctness to characters and their personality. Sound assets and audio in general is very well done and treated with respect in this game. Hearing something unusual on a mission in any other game would be a glitch, here it's a clue.* Personally I love the fact that this game has been designed with solo-play in mind. There are elements where it's useful to work together as a group, or have friends involved, but on the whole you can play the entire game without talking to another human player. There's no pressure to level up and unlock this and that, and you can always find something else to involve yourself in* The lack of a level cap or limitation adds more depth to character customization while not restricting you to any one play style. If a particular set of tasks require you to have more health to tank, or your friends need a healer for some quest, you can adapt yourself to fulfil that role* While I have many problems with the pricing structure of this game, one thing I'm happy about is the non forced in-game purchases. Funcom Points are non essential and only really prompted for on the website and can be completely ignored* Whether its the nature of the game, or the types of people that it attracts, the community in this game is great. Stumbling across interesting people to talk to is common, and finding helpful and friendly team members is always easy* Character customization has a ton of features, and other than some small facial structure feature problems, the clothing, gear, equipment and selection screens are all quite deep and usefulMistakesHeld back by a number of small mistakes, there's plenty to make you pause, but nothing that should stop you from enjoying this title if you've already decided it's something you'd like.* The graphics are fairly good and do the atmosphere justice, but they're definitely not as good or well optimized as you'd find in competitors like Guild Wars 2, EVE Online or The Elder Scrolls Online.* Funcom support is inconsistent and typically either very swift or awfully long with their replies and help* There are also some very poor interactions between the Funcom interface/website and the game, buying in-game currency with Steam wallet, for example, is a frustrating process. Nicknames must be unique to the server, and seemingly never expire, so choosing a nickname is a horrible process of trial and error until you find one which isn't already taken* Poor UI elements and general lack of elegance in the overlaysRecommendationsTSW is a polarizing game, and there's a very real risk of simply not enjoying the way the game plays. If you're looking for a contrast to the traditional Triple-A MMORPG fare, if you like slowly exploring and uncovering the details of a story and if you don't mind cutscenes and combat being mixed in there and don't mind also working towards unlocking skills and abilities, you'll likely get a lot out of The Secret World. It's a great time sink for those who enjoy it, with more than 100 hours of story content, with a main storyline that could be completed in somewhere around 12-15 hours if the rest of the world were, for some strange reason, ignored.Reviewing the pricing an MMORPG is a little more difficult because of the number of pricing models available, including any DLCs, paid content and more, and The Secret World makes it even harder with a franky awful pricing model. A one-off payment of £24.99/29.99€/$29.99 which, for the amount of content involved, is fairly priced, even when compared against competitors like Guild Wars 2 which runs from £34.99/$39.99 up to £79.99/$99.99 is available, and fair for what's included.Then there's the Ultimate Edition which is £44.99/54.99/$59.99 and is simply ridiculous for any video game. I know some people like to argue that this is an expected price of some Triple A titles and console releases, but if the standard of game pricing means I'd have to spend more than $300 for a handful of games then it's simply a bad price market, regardless of playtime. There are also 3 overpriced DLCs available on Steam, at £19.99/24.99€/$24.99 each. That's a disgusting £59.97/74.97€/$74.97 for 3 pieces of DLC, each of which also require the base game to play. And to the naysayers comment that they're included in the Ultimate Edition and shouldn't be purchased separately, I ask why they're called Collector's Editions, or even available for purchase if not to try to justify the price of the Ultimate Edition in comparison. Furthermore, the Ultimate Edition includes a second copy of the base game when purchased from Funcom, but NOT from Steam where the majority of purchases take place, which is another disgusting move.If the pricing scheme gives you reason to pause, you should remember that the DLC were originally offered as seperately sold content, giving the customer plenty of price options. The Massive Edition, which has now been removed from the Steam Store and which offered exactly the same content as the Ultimate Edition minus Issue #8 (considered the worst and most pointless of the issues) also came with the removal of the separate DLCs and was then superceded by the Ultimate Edition, presumably for a new round of sales, and to remove those DLC options and prompt buying of the Ultimate Edition. While I'm being harsh on a game that offers an absolute ton of content for the right player, it's important to understand that it's a potential waste of $60 or more for the wrong player and that simply not risking your money on a game you might not enjoy may honestly be the best option for many.When on sale, that risk becomes far more manageable. At the time of review, The Massive Edition reached its lowest price in December 2013 of -67% (£14.99/18.99€/$19.99) which was more than a fair price. So far the Ultimate Edition, which is almost identical) has only reached -30% and I'd recommend waiting til it drops at least -50% or more.* Early PR and even marketing of the game and content was done via ARGs[wiki.crygaia.com], which were puzzles and promotions that involved real world websites and groups along with game content and resources and were quite special in their own right* All active accounts on The Secret World come with TestLive access[forums.thesecretworld.com], similar to a beta or test server* Similar to WoW character pages, you can access a detailed list			"

												I felt compelled to write a review for this game. Played this game on an off for a while now.  I managed to get some of my guild gaming buddies to jump in,  including my wife O.O  This game starts of easy enough with different types of quest missions for different tastes of game play. With a main storry line to follow along, its hard to get lost.  Vidio clips to follow along as you progress to immerse yourself, like an interactive novel.  I have no idea what end game play is like so I won't comment .  But I will say this.  Running like hell is a strategy that should be on your list of game play. Hence my next suggestion is find friends to play along with.  Some of the game play is intense, a fire fight from one end to the other. Solo play is possible but with a lot of watching where you move and when. Playing with a group of friends is more enjoyable and probably the way the game was originally set up. Buckle in for a rough ride.       New comers to the game don't be afraid to totally explore your abilities and skills.  Even have decks that can help you develop a combat style and a new look for your toon. A story line worth watching, not a total waste of time.  PvP gankers well probably not the place for you this game is mostly co-op and that's the way we like it. But the pvp zones come in different sizes and as in all pvp in the beginning grinding is a major factor in pvp performance.  And probably weapon quality that only can be achieved with some time spent in game.  PvE areas consist of questing areas, epic areas that can reward you with better loot (suggest a full group) Group instances, solo instances (part of the story line and also acts like a guide for the strength of your toon  eg. can do it yet, go find better gear. Collect stuff make better gear (strongly suggest going on line as this part is not a simple click and play as some items need to be placed correctly.)    Or loot better gear from the instance or as you dive in deeper into the game.   Yes this game has been around a while and yes probably could use a machine upgrade for some better graphics and I hope is on the agenda as this game does deserve a spit and polish. Yes I do give kinda a mixed review but I did enjoy my time spent on this game. I'm just blunt and say it as it is.19/02/16Ok, been playing for a little bit now and what seemed like an huge grind has been drasticly reduced.  Once you have made your Nightmire challenge (nm* dungons ) and start looking at some of the more challenging instances. You quickly recognize a huge jump in difficulty. Things are done by the numbers, need to do this need to do that. Failure to do so, drastically reduces you chances. But thankfully you have probably found a guild to roll with that can guide you though the nightmare. Bit of a pun but totally true. But don't fret if you have not, the community as a whole is still helpful as always. Notifications do come up that a new player is in your instance with you. So they know right of a nub is in the room. So don't be shy and raise your hand.  As for end game the first Raid is in New York city and suggested entry is for Pugs 10.44 *quality 10 gear with a level 4 up grade on the item itself and the glyph placed in it) Guild runs 10.11 easily enough. Although nm are difficult once you learn the fights its all rather easy, believe it or not its true. Yea a bit more dancing as I like to call it but it needs to be harder right. And to make things even more of a challenge a couple of instance have been added to keep you on your toes. I won't comment on as I have not delved into them extensively as of yet.As of before pvp does not make a huge impact via in game but does help in over all upgrading items that your toon has in his/her arsenal.  Shambala has now been added as a new venue to go rumble in and has proven to be a place to quicly try out new builds and crazy build and builds that make no sense or just fun builds because your toon looks cool. Trust me no one really cares at least when I decided to dance in the middle on more than one occasion no one gave me crap for it. hehehe XD After all its a game and meant to have fun in. Ok blunt truth now. At first I love the new pvp area. But it does get old and the auto balance of your toon has been exploited by a few in game. Thankfully the match is over in about 5 mins but the rewards are good win or loose. A bit better if you win but the main purpose for going is not taken away.  Currency used to upgrade items on your toon.  The down side are the exploits some people use in the game. The run certain builds that take advantage of the balance and well it kinda over. In some cases its mostly prime time its who side has the most exploiters will win the match. More on the down side. It has left the other pvp zones to almost ghost towns. That have left to more crafty ways to finishing them if the zone has come up as a daily. Thankfully it seems exploiters are catching flak from other players as for the numbers seem to have dropped a bit. So as for pvper its proven to be a fun stomping ground, but could be disappointed as for the sudden drop in the other pvp zones. I think most including myself as for this novice pvp'er disappointed by the balance of rewards from one zone to the other and the new balance installed in Shambala only to be exploited by a slim number of elitists that have some profound thinking they are Uber leetz when most just think the opposite and they lack any kind of skill.My thumbs up still remains as I still find this game worth my time. And remain hopeful that the crew at TSW fix the issues that now come up that are all in all kinda minor and probably could be easly fixed. So keep gaming and who knows maybe see you in game.  8D			"

												(Only just purchased on steam, but have 300 or so hours as of this writing)Mediocre combat. Fantastic (though sometimes rage inducing) investigative quests. Interesting take on character building, where you build a set of active and passive abilities that synergize well. One of the only MMOs where our group actually bothers to play with each other, instead of just racing to prep for dungeons. Play because you like theorycrafting or want a game where it's actually easy/rewarding to play with and help out friends.			"

												A phenomenal adaptation/inspiration of HP Lovecraft's delightly horrifying works. Unlike traditional horror, which relies on jump scares and cheap frights, The Secret World draws upon Lovecraft's uncanny ability to tap into what truly terrifies the soul rather than what frightens the central nervous system. You won't be jumping out of your seat on this one. You'll be glued to it.Initially, I was hesitant to try this game out as an MMO, feeling it may better be adapted for single play, but I couldn't be more wrong. The community is just as friendly as my first MMO, FFXI Online, an experience I'd been unable to replicate until TSW. Although you can play through the game by yourself, you'll never feel truly alone, at least until you enter a wonderfully creepy solo instance, further reducing the frights and increasing the terror. Find a friend or sibling to play with, as I did, and you'll truly be in for an incredible experience.The Graphicsare good, even on a computer like mine that's overdue for a graphics card upgrade and experiences odd memory leaks. Even on low settings, the ambience of each zone feels truly unique, coloring each story in a uniquely terrifying way. From the uncertainty of what lies directly in front of you in the fog of Solomon Island to the unforgiving blistering heat of Egypt, this is a world flush with care, love, and lore from its developers.The Musical Score is very good. There's little else to say but that you won't be disappointed in the game's ability to match the cadence of your decesnt into madness with an appropriate tempo to accompany you.The Lore is what will entrance you for hours. Ragnar Tørnquist, the game's creative director, may very well be HP Lovecraft's reincarnation. You'll feel drawn into his world immediately, spending hours simply hunting down little bits of story to add to your knowledge of the secret world, and keeping your eyes open for new information.The Gameplay is truly phenomenal. While the control scheme is typical for an MMO, with your expected hotbar and somewhat uninspired movement, level progression is unique and entertaining. Eschewing traditional levels, you're allowed to select any ability, any weapon, and any strategem you desire, mixing and matching abilities from different progression trees to create a unique set of abilities. Tanks, DPS, and Healers are one thing, but the variety of choices you have on how to fufill those roles are quite large. Your Missions vary from simple collection quests and defeat a certain amount of enemies, to truly baffling mysteries where the game refuses to hold your hand. You're expected to use your brain, decode complicated ciphers with demonic runes, open up a bible to find a clue hidden in Psalms, or go online to one of the game's shadowy corperation's websites and find its employee directory for your next clue, using the game's own web browser feature. I will admit to you a remarkable frustration towards the morse code segments, though. I did not go to nautical school. I'm fairly certain most of us didn't either.For a fan of MMO's, this is a must buy. For fans of Lovecraft, this is a must buy. For fans of neither, this very well might be the game that endears you to both.			"

												This is one of the best MMOs I've ever played, if not the best. The combat is the standard ""Press 1, 2, 3, to attack"" yet it feels a bit different. It may be the modern setting, the mix of rifles and magic, or hammers if you want aswell. The quest design is easily the best I've seen in a MMO. You aren't a ""god"", you are just a soldier for the faction that you choose, among others. At the moment the game seems sparsely populated, but it may just be the time of day. All in all I recomend this, though look at screenshots and the other reviews before you decide, since this isnt FTP. "

												This is an incredible game with great quests, characters and player choice. As these are covered in many other reviews I want to mention the few problems I did have.1.Its hardDon't get the wrong idea most of the PvE is totally fine but after beating most of the game (or when first entering an area) it can be difficult to beat certain missions. (FYI: Im talking about combat difficulty but some missions can be hard for other reasons, there is only one jumping puzzle in the whole game but it is still one too many)While its possible to do ALL of the quests solo it is very difficult if you don't put a lot of time devoloping a really good ability set.The best way to counter this is to play with a friend. A mission that is impossible for two people individually can be a walk in the park if they work together. 2. high level gearIn PvE, if you want the best gear available you have to work with four other players to complete a dungeon.The game has a LFG system which means you can avoid matchmade with someone low level but it can also be hard to find someone who can tank or heal since you will need at least one of each. (DPS isn't as much of a problem at low levels since people could just use their solo classes)The LFG system isn't used much for higher level dungeons so you will have to ask around in chat to find a group.Since dungeons are designed for 5 people they will require either everyone on the team doing their job and knowing what they are doing or if you're still at a low level, teaming up with someone much higher level.3. PvPits hardBasically what helps you in PvE doesn't mean anything in PvP so you will need totally different abilities for each. Doing PvP in a PvE build can result in you going the whole match without a single kill.Honestly with over 1,000 hours in the game i have never had any luck with PvP but since t isn't neccissary to play PvP for the PvE you could just skip it entirely.Or even if you are bad at it, you still get reward for participating, so if you are willing to grind even terrible PvPers can use it to get really good gear.This is honestly one of the best games I have ever played and since you could play hundreds of hours even if you skipped PvP, dungeons and the hardest missions I would say it is definitely worth trying.

												How do I recommend this game. It's unlike any ""MMO"" I've ever played. Let me start with what I DON'T like:1) Buggy. Development is always happening and the game is always getting better. But you do run into bugs from time to time. Generally it doesn't result an any major headache but rarely can.2) DX 11 is problematic depending on your video card. Game looks great with it on, but can reduce your FPS to -nil- during combat. Just change it to DX 9 in the options and bam, all your FPS problems are gone.3) Lock-out's are a flawed portion of the game in my opinion. You run a ""Nightmare"" difficulty dungeon and you can't it again for 18 hours. Even if your group failed. Now that all sounds fine, but heres the catch - if you lose a person, no one wants to fill their spot because the important currency that drops off the bosses has now been reduced. So that can be quite frustrating.Now for my favorite parts! I'll stick to the top three since to be balanced:1) This game is pretty dang dark. ""Dark?"" you ask? ""Like turn up the brightness?"" No. Like F****** dark. Like coming across people who've hung themselves and the details include scratches at the neck and her shoe that's fallen off from the ensuing spasims. ""Why would you like that?!"" Because I'm an adult. I don't need my hand held. I don't need my games 'kiddyized' or more friendly. There's more I'd love to spout off but some of it is spoilers and believe me...2) This story is fantastic. Plot twists, terrible betrayals and otherwise just well written STORY that doesn't feel force fed. You move the story along at your own pace.3) 500 abilities. 500. Takes time to unlock them all, but you can. You can unlock them all. Wanna heal? Ok. DPS? Sure. Tank? Please do. Play the way that makes you happy. There ARE fights that require certain abilities to be had or decks (Decks are ability combinations) that need to be used from time to time, but that's okay. It all works out in the wash.			"

												The best MMO I've ever played, and one of the best games I've ever played in general. The story is interesting, but you have to work to find a lot of it in a similar fashion to Dark Souls' lore system. The mechanics work well, the graphics are actually pretty great, and the part that I think is most impressive is the sheer amount of content in the game. By the time I'd logged around 6 hours, I'd only done 2 and a half real story missions and chose to focus on side missions, of which I'd done perhaps 30 or 40, which weren't even half of the ones that were available at the time. And that's only in the first area of the game. The truly massive amount of content in the game itself in addition to the DLC Issues that come out every so often with massive amounts of content on their own means that you'll more than get your money's worth out of it, especially now that you don't have to pay for a subscription, which is fantastic as well. A game I would recommend to anyone looking for a game to pump incredibly large amounts of time into, which is what I was looking for when I bought it, and boy did I find it. I'd also recommend checking out the Massive Edition since it comes with some pretty neat weapons, a baller pet, and other miscellaneous customization stuff along with three of the great DLC Issues that retail at $10 or so a piece, so it's a great deal at well.

												Isn't the point of a secret NOT to tell it?For starters, when I first saw this game I didn't even know it was an MMO. Silly me. I wanted this game for 3 years, then I finally got it. I like it quite a bit. The Illuminati are kinda jerks, but they're rich, so I put up with it. It's pretty realistic in that regard. The Templars are weird but they have the coolest uniforms, so there's that. The Dragons are... well I don't know what the Dragons are, they won't tell me.Anyways, it's got some interesting combat mechanics, and gameplay mechanics. It's got an interesting story. It's relatively fun to play, easy to learn. You don't have to pay for anything really, except the game and the last few episodes.My only problem with it isn't even in the game itself. My only problem is that it doesn't have the option to upgrade from normal TSW to Ultimate Edition TSW (or whatever it's called). But that's just semantics. BUY THIS GAME!			"

												The Secret World is a buy once - play forever experience. Endless skill customization, a dark and gritty story set in the modern day and more clothing than a Paris fashion show.  Sharp and witty dialogue and a long are slathered over a large number of quests in one of the few MMO's that rewards players that explore and go off the beaten path.  The game shows its age in graphics and janky character animations, but is overall a rewarding experience and one that is easy to recommend.Not sure if you want to pay the price?  Trial keys are available!

												The Secret world is one helluva game, consisting of vampires, Cthuhlu, Secret Societies, and more. This game is worth getting its massive edition as well as the Fall of Tokyo (as the Black Signal, Nightmare in Dream Palace, and Reaping the whirlwind are all bundled in it, leaving only The Venetian Crisis to be downloaded from Funcom.) This game is definitely worth getting, especially because of the rich story, the character customization, and even the setting. Get this game. It's worth the money.			"

												This is a great game what i could only recommend. The story is well written and immersive. This is one of the few mmos/games where its worth watching the cutscenes and dialogues and you don't feel the urge to just skip them.There is a vast amount of content in the game. With my 333 hours played (right now) i'm still only at little more than halfway through the story. You can do it more quickly if you want, but i enjoyed to explore the locations as much as i could and do all the missions. And in top of that the developers are still adding more and more content to the game.There are dungeons and various pvp modes too.Time to time there are various events  which are interesting where you can earn cool rewards.The character customization feels unique and its wery deep. There are 7 type of talismans, 9 type of weapons, 5 auxiliary weapons, more than 500 active and passive skills (which can all be learned to chose the best combination for you), augments for skills and now aegis shields. There are so many possible combinations to experiment with it.All this complexity it might be a little overwhelming in the beggining, but you can find some really usefull guides in the internet. Recently they even made it more easy for new players to learn the basics and to get better equipment. They also made it easier to progress in the story.			"

												If you are looking for something different than the traditional hack-and-slash or ""kill 10 X and bring me 6 Y"" type game, and if you enjoy reading an intriguing novel, TSW is the game for you. Excellent storytelling, fascinating storylines, exciting quests given by realistic characters - this game pins me to my chair everytime for hours on end. Not to mention the unusual skill-ability system, which doesn't penalize you for thinking outside the box and creating a warhammer wielding thaumaturge mage (with a rocket launcher). Some of the research quests are highly complex, requiring real life research (Internet is available in-game), and sometimes solving codes and cyphers yourself. Creativity and logic really helps during gameplay, and prevents the game from turning into a point-and-kill. Overall a very much enjoyable experience. 10/10			"

												so i'm not very far into this game, this is basically a first impression of the game so far: the secret world doesnt play like most mmorpg's i've played before. in the ones i've played, y ou grow bored if you're just gridning or doing quests by yourself, but the thing i like about TSW is that you can play by yourself like its a regular rpg if you want to, and you won't lose interest, or so i haven't yet. one thing i would change is the combat, its not point and click attacking like in WOW or any other  mmo.  you don't attack with your mouse, rather your number buttons, which can be kind of bothersome when you encounter multiple foes. really cool storyline so far (i haven't played any other faction yet besides illuminati) and all in all, i'm enjoying this game so far. on sale righ tnow for about 10 bucks, i'd say its worth it.

												The greatest storytelling you've seen in an MMO (yes, story in an MMO, you heard me), combined with a cast of memorable NPCs and excellent voice acting makes TSW a worthwhile purchase even if you normally don't like this genre. You can play it as a traditional single-player RPG and still have a great time. And if you choose to stick around after finishing the story, the game has a surprisingly mature and friendly community that is always willing to help. Now go buy the Massive Edition, because it includes the last 3 issues, which are a treat to play.			"

It has everything you come to expect from subscription MMOs, but for a one ooff payment.The main game is massive, and once you've finished that there are expantion packs that can be purchaced.The P v P has a stat balance, but there can be a few players whos till dominate, however this can easily be overcome by working together well as a team.If you like MMOs or just like the idea of roamping around a Lovecraftian based world, then I can definatly recomend this game.:cthulhu:			"

												Pros:-Modern setting with good graphics, intuitive controls, and tons of lore-Delve into the story behind factions including the Illuminati, the Templar, and the Dragon-Many hours of gameplay (At 20 hours I had just finished the first main area)-No subscription required, some free items included in purchase (check 'claim items' in store in game!)-Unique travel system between maps using underground tree network Agartha-Cutscenes and voices for every major NPC/quest to draw you into the story-Decent character customization choices for clothes/appearance-Unlock special outfits by completing certain skill sets-Over 500 skills to select from including 9 different weapon categories.-Equip 2 weapons at once, allowing use of skills from both seamlessly without even having to swap manually-Choose 7 active and 7 passive skills from any that you have unlocked from all categories.-Given time a single character could learn all skills; no specialization prevents you from unlocking any others-Solo play possible for those who enjoy it for all but the toughest missions-Variety of mission types - action, sabotage, investigations, item, dungeons, etc-Investigation mission puzzles are likely the most challenging you have seen in a gameCons:-No auto attacks, no attacking without skill use; this means you spend lots of time mashing your main skill button-Equipping new weapons/armor does not change the way your character appears-Some puzzles so challenging you are expected to solve using web browser, which can detract from immersion-Although no subscription required, you do have to pay for further releases of content (issues).-No means of travelling quickly within maps so you lose a lot of time having to repeatedly walk/fight your way through-'No class / No level' system is not accurate; you still gain XP and are limited by your skill and item levels  -This makes it somewhat less clear when you are really 'level-appropriate' for a given area until you end up dying-Due to most missions being repeatable in any area, you have less of a feel of closure when moving on to the next area			"

												This operates on the same model as Guild Wars 2 now, so no subscription fee. If you like conspiracy theories and Lovecraftian horror, and don't mind some slightly dated hotkey-based combat, this is pretty good. The writing is better than any other MMO I have played and the voice acting is good (apart from, as ever, anyone attempting to do a British accent).Worth trying now you only have to pay once for the game.

												TSW is a great f2p MMORPG with a short learning curve but still offers alot to the more 'hardcore' oriented gamer. Fun increases when you are familiar with classic horror and conspiracy novels (f.e. ''Shadow over Innsmouth'' by Lovecraft) but it's not needed to understand what is going on. A great plus is the character progression system, which doesn't use character-levels at all but a very intelligent gear-system that makes sure content doesn't get 'Blizzarded' ( you know...outdated after every patch, completely useless and a waste of time to even go for it). The PVE system works perfectly while the PVP system (which is always a big deal for me) seems a little bit weird... it feels like it was forced in there but not really intended, in other words it plays like a stand-alone minigame thats not a huge part of the game even tho it has impact on whats going on in PVE (buffs etc). The story suggests otherwise, three factions fighting for world-dominance should have a GREAT pvp system imo. But after a few of those really CRAZY and mindblowing missions (like the twisted themepark in area2) you won't really miss it. Everything has voice-over and looks really beautiful IF you can run it on full resolution.Only flaw is the crafting system. It is dumb. Nothing else to say about it ;)TSW gets 9/10 points			"

												-----------------------------------------Battle Cthulhu, reclaim Hell, explore an abandoned amusement park, investigate the mysterious Orochi Group, haunted mansions, Indian legends, ancient cities, condemned laboratories, child experiments, buzzing bees, the growing Filth, mad scientists, soviet slaughterhouses, and all things occult. Come on in.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------State of the MMO:A niche game with a small but dedicated fan base. New content is still being added. I wouldn't worry that you are buying an MMO at the end of it's life.-----------------------------------------There are great adventure zones:Kingsmouth, where a mysterious fog has rolled in and brought its share of zombies.Egypt, where a group of cultists are working to revive a dead god.Transylvania, where ghouls and spectors outnumber townsfolk, and old soviet experiments have created deadly vampires.Tokyo, soon to be released.-----------------------------------------Skill System/Theorycrafting:There are nine weapons, from which you can use any two at a time. Each weapon focuses on two possible roles, like healing/tanking/dps/support. There are over 500 unique skills in total, and the forums are always buzzing about the optimal builds for each role. No weapons are really that underpowered, and each works well depending on the situation. Gear can get rather complicated at high levels. People who like min-maxing will have a blast. If you don't, tons of people will be happy to give you tips.-----------------------------------------Missions:Some of the best I have ever played. There are ""investigation"" missions where you must crack codes, solve mysteries, and investigate the occult. A lot of these bring back a pen and paper adventure game feel, but can easily be avoided if not your cup of tea. Most missions are on a 1-2 day cooldown, after which you can do them again if you like.-----------------------------------------PvP:I actually can't recommend this. There are some that really love it, but I would not say this is one of the games stronger points. -----------------------------------------The Community: This game has the best community I've ever seen. It's a more mature demographic than you might find on the average WoW server. It's easy to find a guild to group/raid with, and even at low levels there are tons of people eager to help. There is even a player made, in-game channel called the Sanctuary, devoted to helping newcomers.-----------------------------------------Cash Shop:There is a cash shop, but 90% of it consists of vanity items/exp boosts. There is nothing in it that could really be seen as pay-to-win. As the game is no longer on a pay-to-play, new content is a one time purchase in the cash shop. Again,  they are not strictly necessary, but I've enjoyed each one enough that I would buy it again. If the massive edition is on sale you might want to get that, as it will save you around $20 at a later date.----------------------------------------------Overall I would highly recommend it.			"

												The Secret World is a game I was tempted to play when it was released in 2012, but because it was most likely yet another MMO condemned to fail I just never bothered. The Steam sale reminded me of its existence and the removal of the subscription requirement gave me a reason to try it out. Yes, it's barely alive and (thus) not much of a MMO but the Secret World still manages to be surprisingly entertaining nonetheless. It may have been different before, but I'm very well able to play the game without even sharing a minute with another player. I even surprised myself with a feeling of rather irritation than excitement when I see another player, who is most likely going after 'my' quest mobs or about to spoil a future quest event. The only thing you might miss when playing on your own are the few dungeons the game has, but the solo-instances make up for them.Which brings me to the strongest point of the Secret World: the quests are captivating. Not just because of the dark (sometimes twisted) stories they have to tell, but also the refreshing gameplay. Most quests involve in-game cinematics and the occasional text (item) is often displayed to you in a very creative and attractive way. Yes, you're still more often than not killing # of these things and gather # of those items. But it rarely feels like a grind; as the mobs and the environment are stunningly original and demand your full attention: Traps are where you least expect them and the mobs are often well camouflaged. A step in the wrong direction often results in death due to a 'double pull'. The occasional 'research quest' are incredibly well done and connects the game with the real world in a fantastic way. Though people with a proper brain will still find some of them extremely challenging. Veterans might beg to differ, but the game is hard so far. As a newbie you're thrown into the deep after struggling with poor tutorials and a 'help'-system that seems to be half finished; on some meaningless subjects you're bored with a video, while some of the essential subjects consist of one empty sentence. While the game pretends like it doesn't matter what kind of weapon (spec) you pick, you will notice soon enough that without any strong healing abilities you'll end up dead quite often, as the healing abilities of some weapons simply aren't good enough. After I realized this and adopted 'Blood Magic'-healing, the game feels more doable. ConclusionThe relatively hard (combat gameplay and learning) difficulty and 'subscribe-to-play' competition were probably the main reasons this game wasn't succesful as an MMO. Yet the Secret World is captivating, rewarding and original in its genre. I sincerely recommend you to give it a go when you're into challenging games with good stories to tell.			"

The first issue plays like a MMO version of Resident Evil almost, but there are epic puzzles, truly freaky moments.  The graphics are pretty nice on the highest settings.  Combat is somewhat like Guild Wars 2, except you can mix and match abilities as you like and all characters can heal, tank, or DPS.  Crafting is somewhat odd, but easy once you get the hang of it.  There's loads of little collectibles and achievements if you're into that sort of thing as well.  The mission system is fairly straightforward, although you'll wish you could pick up more than the limit of side missions the game allows.  There are three factions to choose from, although you will run through mostly the same missions, you will see differing mission completion text tailored to what zone you're in and what faction you're in.  Voice acting so far is excellent.  TSW is also the brainchild of Ragnar Tornquist, the creator of The Longest Journey (an awesome P&C adventure title). The one dungeon I've been through was awesome, hard, and epic.The game doesn't require a subscription, but rather an initial purchase, and here's where TSW makes its money.  The initial purchase (at least through steam) will get you issues 1-4 or 1-7, depending on what version you get.  Currently TSW is up to Issue 9.  Each issue if purchased separately is basically $10.  However, from what I am hearing, each issue averages at least 40 hours of gameplay.  I'm 28 hours into the first issue, but my companion and I are trying to hit every mission.  You can also buy clothing and special items.  It's not pay to win by any stretch of the imagination...it's pay once to continue playing for a long time, and pay to customize your character.I'd definitely recommend playing with another person, it's way more fun.  I don't even want to play it by myself.  I usually end up healing and hitting with ranged attacks while my compatriot tanks with melee attacks.			"

												So yeah this is my first review so I'll keep it short and sweet since there is much I can say. One I can't keep my system on three way crossfire I've noticed Issues with the script. So after switching to only one R7 all is good. Other than that the graphics are amazing, Its hard to believe this game is almost two years old. This game is just way too damn addicting. It has been my personal obsesion for the last past two and a half weeks since i got back into it. Off the bat one thing that is clear is this game is harder than coffin nails so if you don't like a challenge look else where. The secret world is one of those games I couldn't get into around its launch I actually bought a physical copy and couldn't get into it due to the lack of following, content, and just plain old not having the gear to have an enjoyable expirience. Around the hollidays last year they dropped the price down to fifteen bucks after seeing that steam provided the right forum for this game to shine. I said why not and bought another copy. I'm so glad I did, right away I noticed there was way more to do and much more of a following now. Now that I've got the ball rolling I can also say I've even enjoyed the story so far. I can see myself still playing this game two maybe even five years from now. Like someone else mentioned If you're unsure buy it on sale and see what happens. You might like it. For anyone wanting a break from MMOs as you know them this is it. For anyone who's never played an MMO before give it a shot. As for me this is my third MMO this is the first one to pull me in like this.			"

												The voice acting is superb!The gameplay and graphics are good. Deep character customisation, a vast array of skills, abilities and outfits to choose from. It mixes up the standard MMO format of 'go there, kill x' and 'collect stuff and bring\take it here\there', with some interesting investigation quests that can be a real challenge.All this with no monthly subscription. My only regret is waiting so long to pick it up.			"

												If you're looking for something different and are tired of the same old fantasy settings with the same old questing and classes, then this game is might be what you're looking for. The modern day horror setting is a breath of fresh air in the world of tired and true MMOs. With the ability to build up your character to specialize in multiple things you can easily swap from a tank build to a healer. The quest are interesting, the enviroments are creepy, and the dungeons and the bosses they inhabit are fun instead of tedious. With the subscription fee gone, now is a good time to check out TSW.

												Want to play a game that allows you to play all the classes? Want to play a horror style mmo?  Want to play a game that keep you coming back?  This is that game.  I have played it since the closed beta, left three times, and come back.  I love the stories, puzzles, and play style.  It can be as hard or as easy as you want with the investigation missions.  The only advice i would give is when you start you might pick 1 of the healing weapons as either your first or second weapon.  (fist/blood/assult rifle).  it makes  building your survival build much easier.			"

Recommended with CautionThe Secret World is a very artistic game full of varied and immersive content. However, it has its problems and people looking to purchase the game should weigh the pros and cons carefully before investing time and money into the title.ProsStarting out the game is really impressive. The acting and the writing work hand in hand to deliver immersive content early on to the player. You can chose from three factions and each has a different flavor. Missions are varied and don't come off like the typical set of chores ala ""Go to Farmer Fred's fields, kill 10 vermin in the fields, bring 10 vermin tails  back to Farmer Fred for reward.""Any grind is well hidden in the game world which is expertly crafted from the outset. It makes most of TSW highly replayable.Other plusses include the helpful community of users and the excellent response time of their customer service staff. When you run into trouble GMs will respond quickly and efficiently to your troubles.This is where TSW shines and it can't be emphasized enough - it makes the game unique and special. It almost makes its many cons forgivable.ConsThe game has a limited shelf life. You can do their lovely missions over and over and enjoy dungeons and two small raids and mini raids called lairs. However, their later end content lacks the polish that their first few zones have.As a composition, TSW begins to fall apart at end content. It comes off poorly coded and rife with bugs and very low in actual story content. Issue 8 and Issue 9 are blatantly grindy and are lacking in much story content. In issue 9's case the story is there, but there's little of it. It feels more like a beta than anything that should be ready for prime time.High end dungeons for end content players have many mechanical bugs as bosses will glitch and run off the field of battle and reset themselves. As a MMO it fails in encouraging cooperation. Their loot system is antiquated and follows a Need or Greed model rather than some of the more party friendly games like Guild Wars 2 or Wildstar. This doesn't pose a particular problem in the early parts of the game, but in end content where the game degenerates into a grindfest, it can be an excrutiating experience. For example, in issue 8 you can grind bosses and they can drop junk or uncommons. Other problems include a dated engine and poor graphics optimization so there are a lot of glitches, frame rate drops, and lag on even higher end computers which are well above the minimum requirements to play the game. Other ThoughtsFuncom went through some layoffs in the recent past and that has impacted the TSW team heavily. They are slow to put out content and the new content that is being delivered just doesn't have the polish as earlier content.It's blatant that they are cutting corners and delivering substandard content. Anything after Transylvania should be viewed with caution.Pre Issue 8 and 9 had its quirks. Like they couldn't afford to give you choice in the story or even hire a voice actor for your character so you get to play a mute. Or the writers were stuck on how to advance a story and so they have your character constantly derp their way through the storylines. The amount of times your character is punked is mildy amusing at first and then just gets blatantly annoying. More blatant signs start in Issues 6 and 7 where they couldn't manage to put females in the budget and used the generic male story line for females including resources in their cut scenes like male walking animations and story choices. So if you're playing a female or if you are a female player, you're not important enough to put in the budget. You get to move around and respond to story content as if you were male.ConclusionI'd recommend the game for its early missions. There's enough early content in the game that would keep a player and their friends busy for a good many hours and allow for a lot of cooperative fun. If you're an end content player, I'd suggest finding another title because this one just doesn't have what you're looking for.			"

												A decent game with some unusual elements for a semi-action MMO. However, it seems that at one point during its development, the project suffered a few major hits (budget, staffing, production, etc) and to be brutally honest, I don't think this title ever really recovered. What went live was not what this game had the potential to be.I'm not going to ramble about specifics. The UI is a bit dodgy, the gameplay is middle of the road for semi-action MMOs, the writing is reasonable, the in-game instructions on how to play it are not, and if you don't have at least a moderate graphics processor, you're going to struggle with some of this game. Beyond that, all I'm going to say is THIS GAME IS NOT SCARY. It's more of a conspiracy theory MMO than anything else, regardless of what the first zone might be attempting. Oh, and... expect puzzles which involve knowledge you probably don't have.I'm going to recommend this game with a caveat: play it for free for a while, at least until you hit the content pay wall. Keep an open mind about it - you may find the design differences refreshing. If not, well... all you've lost is time.			"

												TSW is an action adventure game with MMORPG mechanics (combat, PvP, group content). The writing and art design are all excellent - enough to warrant a satisfying single player experience! If you're a fan of Gaiman, Lovecraft or King - you'll love the setting. Horror is a main theme here and there are many ""nope"" moments.I've been playing this game since early access and the story/setting still messes up my head big time. It slowly builds from mysterious text messages, words hastily written on torn-out pages, whispers from the faucet. To get a glimpse of what's happening, you have to piece it from lore entries, dialogues, small hints in dialogues or hacked emails.The production value is very high. Most quests have fully voiced cutscenes and there's a lot of unique art assets - all items you investigate have their own art work (cell phones, books, notes etc.). This is one of the most challenging MMOs I've played - both quests and combat require thought and skill. Investigation missions are hard, but even the basic missions require some investigating (in most cases you actually have to figure out where to go). Many quests play like an adventure game - you have to hack computers, combine items, finding hidden objects, solve environmental. Combat requires a lot of movement and the limit on active/passive skills requires a good setup.The game goes very cheap on sales and the basic purchase gives you full access to PvP, dungeons and raids. Subscription is totally optional and just gives you a small xp boost, points to spend in shop and a vanity item. There are paid mission packs released every few months and some of them are good to have for high-end gaming. The game shop is mostly xp boosting and clothing - there are ""magic boxes"", but it's nothing major (everything you get from them can be obtained by normal means).BRAINBONER 428/10			"

												If you want a game that mixes thought provoking puzzles, a classless system, complex-as-you-want ability system as well as traditional MMORPG elements ... TSW is fabulous.  The graphics are very nice (intel i5 w/ Geforce GTX 670 4GB and 16 GB RAM runs ~60 fps).  The investigative missions can be VERY hard (for example, need to know or study Morse Code for one particular mission).  No other game I know of has a built in Web Browser just so you can look up which composer wrote a particular song so you can hack a password ingame.  FunCom is not trying to nickel and dime you but does offer boosts and vanity items in the online store.  Catch it on sale for 15 bucks you will be completely tickled.  Pay full price and you will not regret it.  You'll easily get your money out of this one even before you leave the first real zone.If you are not interested in having to think through problems and want everything handed to you ... THIS IS NOT THE GAME FOR YOU.  You do not have to do investigative missions at all, but they really do help set this one apart from everything else.On the bad side ... my only complaint is some of the monsters' models looks overdone.  Someone tried way to hard to give lots of detail and really only succeeded in a mess.  But they are monsters, so they shouldn't be pretty.			"

Dark Demons Cry GaiaAs someone who generally avoids MMOs, The Secret World hooked me fairly easily with its modern-day urban fantasy setting and Deus Ex-like approach to conspiracy lore. In presentation alone it’s a huge breath of fresh air.The game is “buy to play,” requiring an initial purchase with further subscription being optional. The benefits to a subscription are loyalty rewards for time subscribed ranging from unique pets to clothing items, an XP boost, a 10% discount in the item store, and, most notably, ten dollars worth of currency for said item store. The store itself is home to a great deal of items, but they can ultimately be placed into two categories: Cosmetic and Boosts; even the mystery Loot Crates only provide semi-randomized bonuses that fall into the second category. Paying real money for anything that affects gameplay is really only buying an accelerator for one kind of progression or another, and progression is nowhere near slow enough to make the player feel shoehorned into spending money if they don’t want to. In fact, it’s probably far more likely you’ll find a pair of pants you really want for your character in the item store than a boost you can’t live without.Being effective in combat is more about planning out builds and skill rotation than spamming abilities; players have a fairly limited number of active abilities at any given time, split between any combination of two weapon classes. Some combinations are, of course, better than others, but most weapons have something to offer any given role. The MMO “holy trinity” is present in any activity requiring a group, but because the game is classless and every player eventually learns every skill, there is significant wiggle room. One (in)famous dungeon is often done with a self-healing tank, for example, while the group’s healer switches over to dedicated damage-dealing. Another dungeon usually sees the damage-dealers also playing support roles to help the healer deal with the bosses’ tendency to spam damage-over-time effects.Aside from things specifically meant for groups, the main meat of the game can be experienced from start to finish by a solo player, although this severely limits play options; a soloist will have to be able to survive on their own, requiring some form of healing or tanking ability, usually the former. Co-op’ing the story and sidequests with even a single friend can result in a much more diversified experience with players able to pick and choose roles, but the capability of solo play allows players who wouldn’t normally be interested in a social experience to treat the game like a normal RPG with drop in/drop out co-op. While endgame dungeon grinds can’t be done solo by any means, the entire story can be played through without ever touching the endgame grind. A player uninterested in making the numbers on their gear go up will not find themselves hindered in advancing the plot.The story itself puts most single-player RPGs to shame. NPCs are lovingly voice-acted and animated, reflected in the game’s 40GB install size. Moreover, they are written as interesting people and do not lose the player to apathy while waiting for them to just say what item they need five of brought to them. Mechanics like player resurrection don’t just have lampshades hung on them, but are actually important to the setting; being dead and looking for something of interest on the other side is required for solving more than one quest. The actual plot twists and turns around the game’s various locations, avoiding frustration by giving the player character actual progress in solving the various mysteries before bringing up new ones. There is a lot of story to go through; sidequests often provide relevant information, if not easy access to the in-game codex, giving a reason to do them beyond the XP reward. Unfortunately, the plot does not vary greatly between the different factions; the different NPCs one must deal with provide greater variety between them than the faction specific missions, although a point in those missions’ favor is that they are each actually the same mission as seen differently by each organization. Still, at no point did I find myself not caring what happens next, and not just for the main plot. The player is actively encouraged to wander around Elder Scrolls style (though the game world is nowhere near as large as that comparison may imply, unfortunately,) exploring everything. Many quests are found in the wild instead of being given by NPC questgivers, and almost every quest involves exploring the setting in some way, even if it’s only fighting back a nasty overgrowth of the local eldritch horror.Quests are built with the setting in mind. An entire subset of quests is labeled as “Investigation,” and the game is not kidding. These often require serious thought and observation of details, a far cry from the usual MMO fetch quest. The fact that your character is given a high-end smartphone in the beginning is not just for flavor, as you will often use the in-game web browser to check information from company websites and blogs, or, if you’re very poor at puzzle solving like I am, to google the solution. There is absolutely no shame in giving up on a quest or three in this game. While the investigation missions may be unforgiving, they are rarely illogical and progress naturally; finishing one without cheating feels like one has made a genuine triumph instead of feeling like one has worked around obtuse design.If anything is obtuse, it’s not the quest design but, rather, the UI. Why a game that has not one but two quests involving morse code does not come standard with an in-game notepad is beyond me. Fortunately, many of the UI’s shortcomings (including the lack of a notepad) can be solved with third-party plugins. Quests are also not bug-free, but the developers have been very diligent in fixing them since release. They're also very attentive towards the player base; not only do events happen regularly, they last long enough for anyone interested to achieve even the most grindy of goals and once-in-the-game’s-lifetime rewards without playing the game non-stop for a week on end.The game does not have in-depth PvP, but what’s there is functional. Enough people play it that you’ll end up in a queue for the PvP areas more often than not. Starting players will have a stat boost when entering PvP so it can be played at any point in character progression, not just end-game. Effectiveness is entirely based on build, and the game encourages different builds not only for different situations, but for the different activities as well. A standard solo build will be less effective in a dungeon, a standard dungeon build will be less effective in the Scenario activities where each player must have some level of survivability instead of relying purely on the healer. The game makes it relatively easy to manage different builds with an easy menu for saving them and then switching between different ones.The graphics do not disappoint. High settings put a high amount of detail on everything, from paved road to grass to buildings to clothing. The game is fairly scalable but meeting the minimum system requirements are a must, the developers have not been conservative with them. If you choose to roll a Dragon, be prepared for an experience with the uncanny valley in the intro; by and large, however, the game avoids this problem. The writhing Filth lives up to the horror people speak of it with. The baked desert of Egypt is, as it should be, a far cry from soggy, dreary New England.The Secret World brings some much-needed variety into the MMO space, not just for the setting, but for the effort put into quest design that makes accomplishing things both interesting and fulfilling.

												Excellent storytelling and a break from the fantasy and sci-fi mold make this game engrossing. The ability to level up all the different weapons and skills on a character and swap between different sets of them at will means you never have to reroll or level an alt or find someone that can fit the role you need. At 100+ hours I've still got lots to explore. Well worth the price.			"

												Very unique spin on classic MMO tropes; the investigation missions are very detailed and require such varied skills as breaking morse code audio, crytpography, and attention to small details within the game world. I also like the skill system; there are no levels just experience points to spend and if you dedicate enough time you can max out every available power in the game. Very enjoyable, especially with groups of friends.			"

												First of all, this is an MMO -- so it suffers from the usual MMO problems such as network lag, grinding and cash shop.However, as far as MMOs go, it's actually quite good. The story writing is surprising for an MMO, and they hand out experience generously -- there is no penalty for advancing in the game, and you keep getting progress no matter what. Most of the game can be soloed, although you'll probably hit a problem or two along the way, especially if you don't have dungeon- or cash-gear. Still, it feels much less penalizing for me than other MMO""RP""Gs did.The progress itself is extremely fast, but feels very slow -- while you have hundreds of ""abilities"" that you can get, and points just keep rushing in, you can only ever equip 7 (or 8, if you count the special aux weapon ability). So, for the most part, you'll just spend your points on abilities that you'll never use, which fills up your ability wheel but doesn't change the game.Same goes for weapon skills -- most of the time you'll just advance weapons that you don't use, because you've already maxed out the weapons that you do use... so, again, spending points all the time for only cosmetic progress as your skill bars fill up and the game stays the same.If you have access to good gear then you're probably running dungeons. Since you can get all abilities and use all weapons, you're not locked into a specific role (like DPS, healer or tank) --instead, just get suitable gear for each role, get familiar with a set of abilities useful for that role, and you can just switch your setup whenever you want.Bottom line -- it's still an MMO, but one that feels recommendable enough. It's definitely not a ""thumbs down"". "

												This is without a doubt an interesting take on the MMO genre. Instread of the usual high fantasy route, this game decided to go with a more urban take and set the game in the modern world kept secret to all of us normal people. As your character is basically forced to join into a secret society; either the Illuminati (who are much less competent than you would think), the Templars (Think old guard, less sinester than Assassin's Creed would have you believe) and the Dragon (Far East Triad that does what the Illuminati wishes they were doing). Afterwards you take up your new powers and fight against supernatural horrors arround the world or atleast the Soloman Isles, Egypt, and Transylvania in the base game.Combat is mostly combo points to anyone familiar with WoW or Diablo, Firearms attach them to your enemies, magic has your character hold the points, and melee changes it up and works like a 5 point energy that restores over time. It doesn't take much to get use to.Quests come mostly in two favors, your 20 bear asses collect or kill quests and investigation missions. Investigation has you searching areas, solving puzzles, learning passwords that often require real world research to find. The game has an in game internet browser for this reason. Yes, investigation missions give more experence than almost anything else (that anything else being the main story).Overall this MMO is intresting, but I can only recomend it if you can find it on sale. I will also note that this is only for the base game. You will be paying more money if you want more content outside of the base game.			"

												This game is pretty damn good if I say so myself. The storyline is unique in a sense that it combines modern day cities and areas with ancient myths, giving it a farmiliar feel but also a very foreign vibe to the environments. The characters are completely customizable, both in the way they look and how there is no specific class system. The community is very helpful with different problems as long as you just ask, and overall it is a fun and addictive experience. The only complaints I have on this game is that the graphics seem outdated by a couple of years or so, and it is hard. And I mean HARD. Because of the way the game is built, there is no leveling however your character recieves skill points to level up different skills and items, most of which would keep you alive in higher skilled areas. I found it hard to just go in alone and do my own thing, and the community is smaller than a standard MMO so it usually is just solo questing. Of course, once skills and quality gear is found, the game progresses rapidly and you'll be in transylvania and egypt in no time. There isn't much of a learning curve, although it takes some experimenting to find out your own playstyle, as there is no class or leveling system. All in all, a buy to play game with no subscription fee is well worth the money, and in the case of the Secret World, is worth every penny. 9/10			"

												Something about The Secret World immediately makes me paranoid in the best of ways.It doesn't play like a cookie-cutter WoW clone, which I think is a very good thing. It's VERY story heavy, and the story is fiendishly engaging. A lot of the quests have fully voiced cutscenes which involve the NPCs giving you hints for what you should do. The quests are highly intuitive and unique and are, in my opinion, a fantastic study in how to break the 'Kill X monsters' or 'Find Y items' monotony of many MMOs. Prepare to use your brain because these quests actually require you to think. Pressing B in-game brings up an internet browser which they fully expect you to use to google things. One quest wanted me to spell out a specific word from a specific verse in a Latin translation of the Bible. Another had me go to a fake company's website to look up how to repair one of their radio dishes and then sent me a location in Morose Code. I haven't even covered a fraction of the content, but I'm excited to see what else they have for me.The game isn't perfect by any means, but it's still really cool. The setting and the world they put together is my all-time favorite type of setting, so I admit I'm biased on that but even so it's really well done and very coherent. I'll try and wrap this up without repeating things now:Pros:Super awesome atmosphere, interesting story line, really unique and memorable quests, gear and clothing are different things so you can dress however you'd like, go clothes shopping in London, punch some zombies, really flexible skill system which can and should be changed up as needed, most things can be completed solo if approached intelligently, it actually treats me as if I can think instead of blindly pushing me from quest hub to quest hub, you can phone in completed quests so you don't have to run back to the quest giver, look for quest clues while you're a ghost, there's a skinwalker type dude who can sell you GIANT STACKS OF TACOS in London. Don't want to use tacos instead of traditional health potions? That's cool too because you can break the tacos into giant stacks of nachos for quicker snacks.Cons:Skill system can be intimidating at first, the minimum specs are kind of high and it doesn't really play well if they aren't met, quests, especially investigation type quests, can get really hard, really fast simply because it's expecting me to do things I'm not trained to do in a game. One quest dealt with a ghost and I didn't know what to do because it turns out I needed to be dead to see the next clue.It's different, but I'd like to see more things like it. There isn't a subscription fee so if you're even curious you should give it a chance. If you're not sure it'll run, ask someone who plays for a referral and try it for 72 hours free.And remember, EVERYTHING. IS. TRUE.			"

												Great game.  Many reviews call it one of the most underrated games out there and I have to call that pretty accurate.  MMO in a modern environment with all kinds of fun twists.  The game has a great mix of zombies, cultists, conspiracy theory, and other crazy subjects that just fit well.  It keeps some of the favorite MMO conventions like tank, healer, dps roles---but at the same time, breaks away with a fairly complex skill system.  The game is overwhelming and pretty hard at times and always a bit strange--but very few games have captured me like TSW.  The quests are actually interesting and varied.  The cut-scenes remind me of GTA a bit in style and do a good job of drawing you in without being too long winded.			"

												I'm a sucker for mash-up urban fantasy/horror so I am so all over TSW's premise. The game's first (non-tutorial) zone, for example, features using local Native American magic and the favour of the god Thor to help the Illuminati and an expy of Stephen King fight Viking zombies dredged from the deep by Cthulhu-esque horrors, summoned by Loki using Aztec blood magic and the sword Excalibur, as part of a plot to bring about Ragnarok by stabbing a giant black cube-thing which is part of the machinery of Gaia. Things just get weirder from there.The story, cutscenes, characters, and dialogue in this game are, in my opinion, the best in any MMO currently out there, and it's one of the only MMOs I've played through multiple times solely for the story. This is definitely TSW's strength; this, and a particular type of quest the game has, called Investigation Missions, which will... well. There's an in-game browser for a reason, and I sure hope you like looking up Egyptian heiroglyphics and Hebrew plagues on Wikipedia, because you will be.They're the good parts.Unfortunately, then there's the rest of the game. TSW's mechanics are, in my opinion, as terrible as its writing is amazing. Mechnically, it's a tedious, frustrating grind that gives the illusion of choice in character building, but is ultimately so poorly balanced that I really hope you're playing the one spec that's actually useful because otherwise you're going to be spending an awful lot of time in the graveyard. (Slight disclaimer: all of this game's gameplay is built around groups. Though it's possible to solo--and I have--it is exponentially easier to complete with even just one other person along for the ride.) Not to mention that, once the story is over, the gear grind begins and, well. It's a gear grind. I hope you like raiding!There are going to be people who love TSW's mechanics, and more power to them (they're the sorts of people who like to use words such as ""oldschool"" and ""hardcore"" to describe their MMO playing). I'm not one of them. So take the last paragraph with a grain of salt.Mechanics aside, I have a lifetime sub to TSW and I don't regret it... but I wouldn't recommend it for everyone, either.			"

												I no longer enjoy MMOs these days. If you're looking for a good World of Warcraft fix, The Secret World won't help you at all. In the traditional MMO sense it's not that good. There's no feeling of progress in gaining xp and gearing up isn't satisfying so as a Diablo-style loot fishing lottery it's bad. The combat is a lackluster combination of Age of Conan and Guild Wars that feels hollow and has to be included in the game just because MMOs apparently can't exist without constant combat. The skill trees seem bland and honestly I don't see much difference between the fighting styles because they all have generic skills that do some damage. How do you even fire a shotgun in 50 different ways?HOWEVER, all of that can be endured or mostly ignored (combat hasn't been difficult either so far) to enjoy what this game does best, it isn't actually a WoW-style MMO but instead it should be treated as an online adventure game. The very detailed setting areas seem lovingly crafted, the lore is interesting and subtle and the NPCs are actually pretty well written and voice-acted. The world is a hodgepodge of secret societies and X-Files paranormal and Lovecraftian influences combined with just about everything else that fits under horror. If you liked how some of the areas in Age of Conan felt and looked, I think it's based on the same engine. It seems fairly taxing though so weaker rigs might have problems.Here comes the real reason why you should give this game a try: The quests. Sure, there are traditional MMO style quests that have you fedexing items somewhere or following simple map pointers to kill 5 of thing X and return, with cutscenes. These are enjoyable because the well-made maps make it seem like exploring instead of grinding. THEN you run into some of the investigation quests which might be the best content I've witnessed in MMOs. These are quests that don't have any easy pointers at all, only vague and cryptic clues. They're like Alternate Reality Game things where you must use google and wikipedia to decipher all the puzzles, they can't be solved just within the game (well, the game actually has a built-in web browser). Don't be tempted to go straight for the spoilery walkthroughs but try to solve things yourself! I don't think I've felt so clever in ages when I managed to crack a devious puzzle involving medieval lute music and googled actual score sheets.So, have you ever made that mistake in an MMO where you realize that a particular puzzle has to do with entries in the bible, so you look it up and fail to see how it all fits, only later on realizing you should've checked wikipedia based on another clue so you'd realize you had to look up the passage in the original latin translation? Other MMOs have done the Indiana Jones action side but this game does the library research/puzzle cracking side.I've played this thing solo just because I think it works nicely as an atmospheric single player roleplaying/adventure game where you sometimes bump into other players, I have no idea what the group instances are like. If they're like the usual raid combat stuff I'll happily ignore them because I'll focus on the content that makes me feel like a X-Files librarian instead of the usual warrior puppet flailing around to the beat of bosses.Oh, and because it doesn't require a subscription I don't need to handle it like a job that has a clock ticking ""play me now or you don't get your money's worth!"" Grab it on sale and you're set. Perhaps you'll even enjoy the combat side, but I don't think that's necessary to enjoy this game anyway.			"

												Hello I walk into emptyI can't recommend this game enough. Funcom's central product, it seems, is individualistic and memorable experiences, and The Secret World is exactly that. The base game is good quality, with haunting and horrifying settings and strange and memorable characters. The quest structure mixes episodic hubs that introduce you to fleshed out and interesting characters, and an overarching narrative that has you unravelling the designs of some unknown force.The game also offers something unique to MMOs: the investigation mission. These are augmented reality puzzles, drawing you into some truly challenging and lateral riddles, while using alternate reality to beautifully blur the lines between our world and the secret world.But it gets better.The DLC take off and make everything good about the base experience more spectacular. Issue #5, The Vanishing Of Tyler Freeborn, is the first great example of this, with a climax taking place inside a psychedelic nightmare brought on by a cosmic horror called ""The Filth"", a major antagonistic force running through the game. This sets the stage for what is to come in the remaining DLC, with the lines blurring ever more.			"

												TL;DR: Used to be great, now it's dead. I want to play, I want to love it, but can't.I used to play this game a lot. Sometimes I'd take a break of a couple of months, only to come back when the urge to dive in gets too great. I've got 9 characters all kitted out for end-game. But now, there is nothing to get back to. There is still only the old end-game content to repeat, which is just too easy now with the current end-game gear. The only hard part of the end-game is to find a group to play it with. There are hardly any players around to group up with. Community initiatives like Noobmares or Sanctuary also no longer function as a good place to find a group. There simply aren't the players for it. It's still a great game for it's solo content. DLC Issue 8 (?) has the scenario's, which is solo end-game route to take. Instanced 30 minute sessions of hard content, which require you to tweak your weapon setup to reliably complete it succesfully. However, with 3 scenarios at 3 different difficulty levels, it gets old.And that's the thing with this game. It gets old. There is no new content. The last big release of content was Tokyo, where Season 1 of the main story line has been concluded. It was delayed over and over again. It was supposed to include a new playing field to do missions in, dungeons, raids and a lair. However, by the time funcom started releasing it, it was cut up into pieces. The playfield came in 2 seperate DLC issues, with extra missions as purchasable content (now repackaged as DLC issue). The dungeons came in another seperate DLC, the raid in yet another seperate DLC. All to be purchased. Still waiting for the lair. And the promised auxillary weapon. Ok, rant over. Back to reviewing:Pro/con:+ Great atmosphere.+ No fixed classes.+ Enough to do solo.- No new content to speak of since ... forever?- Endgame group content practically dead.- No reason to fine-tune your build anymore, as you can breeze through 99% of the game with ease.

												I tried several times to get into the game, from its publication in 2012 until 2015. The ideas Funcom had were superb, The game's tone is as sinister and mysterious as intended. I can only recommend it for its vibe, and I suggest to everyone who is interested watching the first two hours of the game on Youtube.Where the game falls flat (for me) is the approach to player friendliness, or User Experience, as it is called in the software industry outside of gaming. User Experience is horrendous. Google for ""secret world frustrating"" and you will see what I mean. Many of the quests have you running or clicking around aimlessly, as you cannot find what you are supposed to do, or where you are supposed to do it. TSW's idea of mission design is like giving lego pieces to somone who has never seen any, and tell them ""Play!"".They follow the same route with the brilliant idea how a character's skills are built, then leaving the player completely in the dark how to do it efficiently, so that you can actually play the game. The forums do not help either, as the majority of good advice is from players who left in 2012 and 2013. With the game's changes since then, their advice no longer works, and trying to understand what experienced players talk about is like reading a foreign language without a dictionary.Some players claim that the game is the Thinking Man's MMO. They are entitled to their opinion. I view it as the Unfinished MMO that would have needed another two years of design and development, and with that it could have been a great title.I am utterly disappointed, as the game could have been so much more.

												The Secret World was a MMORPG with a great setting. It ran and developed for years because of its dedicated fanbase.Now Funcom decided to take a huge dump on these players. The content will get rerelesead as Borderlands clone while the actual game got sentenced to death.Way to go Funcom! Develop content with support from your loyal playerbase and just when your CFO or any ♥♥♥♥♥♥ decides he needs more money, you take that content to a new game. To grab the money from other people who you didnt already milk.Cashgrab 101, I tip my hat.And: no, thank you. No salt needed, I got plenty of my own!			"

												For fans of mmos and lovecraftian stories, I gotta say this game has left a pretty strong impression as I'm hooked in the world. The stories of the characters from the towns and locations you visit just suck you into the whole experience. I'm the type of person who can't stand playing mmos alone for too long, but Secret World just does it in a way where I feel completely driven to keep going solo and enjoy the bits of lore that the developers has left for us to discover. Absolutely one of my favorite games and I highly recommend for anyone to try out if they love dark stories and conspiracies/occult in their games.			"

												Fantastic RPG.  Setting and themes not often investigated in other games, especially in MMOs.  This probably isn't the best exemplar of the MMO genre, as raiding, dungeons, and PVP, while there, are in the background compared to the stellar questing.  This game is not as social as others as you will not come across so many people during questing, and this is by design.  However, the questing, story, and environments are so good it's well worth playing, and you could treat this as a single-player game of sorts if you want to.  Combat leaves a bit to be desired, but the system for ""leveling up"" (there's no actual levelling up in this game) is pretty unique and good.			"

												I know you might have already heard/read all of this before, but I'll say it anyway. The Secret World is both a wonderful game and a wondeful MMO.Its game mechanics are good : dynamic fight, complete lack of classes allowing you to build your character according to your play style, very different types of missions...The writing is absolutely marvelous. Every single mission has a story behind it, and shows it to you. Every. Single. One. No ""fetch me twenty wolf pelts"" or ""bring me ten goblin heads"". Here, you even have missions that ask you to think and do proper research to solve the riddles.And there is so much I could say about the setting or the story but that I won't because I'd be serious spoilers and they are both worth discovering on your own.

												I have never played such a facinating, intense, clever single/multiplayer MMO ever and I have played a few! This game allows you to take many paths such as a main line quest to find the achient truths behind the whole back story of the game.  With three different factions and their own point of views on all the quests you will want to replay it at least 3 times! If history and future dont take your fancy enjoy many of the millions of side quests, each mission unique and significant. Level you character up to be who you want to be! You want to throw blood at an enemy fine! You want to be a swordsman go ahead, what's that you want to bludgeon people with a hammer sure! The game has so many possibilities from missions, to boss/dungeon fights or simply collecting history and enemy bites called Lores. Play on you own, with a friend or a group!

												The Secret World is a really fun MMO that suffers from some population issues. Unlike some MMOs, though, that shouldn't hinder your enjoyment of the base game. The questing is fun and the combat is very interesting. I certainly recommend it to anyone who enjoys story content in an MMO, or just questing in general. The quests are engaging and the story is intriguing.There's enough content to get you your money's worth, and if you've got friends, even more so. 78 Illuminati conspiracy theories out of 100.			"

												This game is amazing. The environment and setting are far better than any other MMO I have played. The fact that a large majority of the quests in game have voice acting and cut scenes sets it apart right away. The gameplay is fun and feels more involved than other MMOs. The quests require actual thought and I have found myself using the built in web browser to look up random facts to figure out how to solve the current puzzle many times. If you try to solve every puzzle on your own without looking up the solution this game will keep you entertained and sometimes stumped for days. Even the few and far between ""gather"" quests are all unique. There are awesome dungeons 5 man+, random server events where you are tasked to work with people on the server to defeat things that appear, PvP and a great guild(cabal) system.The leveling system is great. No levels. Ok levels.. kind of.. whenever you gain enough experience you unlock ability points to put into either skills or areas where you can modify your stats. At no point are you locked into a class you can spec for another class and switch when you like with the points you gain from ""leveling"" and no cap or even really a level number(as far as I know)The story is really where this game wins though probably due to the extra effort put in for the voice acting and very regular cut scenes. The missions as I said above really make you think and keep you invested in what is going on. The amount of lore you can find either by the hidden lore items you find or just by talking to quest givers and NPCs that you find is insane. If you play.. when you play.. make sure to click the dialog text multiple times I did not know about that when I first started. The NPCs have a lot of dialog if you are into that. The lore mixed with the awesome environments makes this game by far my favorite MMO.			"

I can easily see this game being over 500 hours especially with the expansions that i got included with the ultimate edition!After 20 hours, im no way near bored, still discovering and learning new things every day and the missions are so much fun! None of the quests feel boring or repetative, they actually feel like real quests that you are doing. Plus for the main quests i love seeing the FMV sequences play out, they can be quite fun!!If you havent seen this game before, i urge you to not think about it, just buy it! The only problem is that when you get into this game theres no getting out, and you wont be able to play anything else for weeks to come (probably much longer!)!!! "

												An excellent title, but not in truth an MMORPG as most would view it from others on the market. Story driven RPG elements are core to this game not just how you get to ""max level"" and voice acting brings this game to a place that really is only on par with single player games. The game plays very much like a single player game, and in many ways tends more to that as a whole. Every area of the world is instanced and most of the game can be played solo which seems breaking in concept, but really is not that different from other games, it just becomes a more solo experience if you are following the storylines. Dungeons and PVP bring back that multiplayer experience however but require that extra step in actually wanting to be social to establish a group.As a fair warning the combat in the game is often seen as ""broken"" by thouse picking it up and only giving it half a chance, it has an extremely high planning curve to it as you aren't just handed a class that has been designed to work without thought. In The Secret World you choose abilities as you progress, and can learn them all in time but only have 7 active and 7 passive equiped at a time. These abilities set the framework of your playstyle, and picking abilities that combine in a way that enhance each other is critical for success in the game. Everytime I come back to this title I find something new to enjoy, and highly reccommend it.			"

												Ever wanted to battle a Lovecraftian creature with a shotgun? Now you can. The Secret World is a unique MMORPG for many reasons. It features a modern day setting in which secret societies battle out with many various myths and legends. The game also has a class-less system, in which players can put a combination of any two weapons of their choice and create a skill set based on their own playstyle. The setting takes place in a modern day age where creatures terrorize the world and it's up to secret societies to contain them (for multiple reasons). The game features an engaging story and side-stories to go along with quest. The stories are amazingly well-done, espically in quest/missions, often invoking a sense of mystery to push your forward. Many of the quest vary, but still retain some of the fetch and kill quest, many have you solving eleborate puzzles, sneaking through a heavily defended base, solving a murder, dodging the line of sight from a sniper; while, more are simple, such as killing X numbers of enemies.  However, the game has a very dark overtone, which can be a turn-off from the usual easy-going nature of MMO worlds. For those wondering about the classless system, the ""Trinity"" still remains. The character can equip non-aesthetic gear known as Talismans to boost their profiency in one of the ""Trinity"" (DPS, TANK, HEALER). The classless system features 9 weapons each with different roles such as support, healing, dps, debuffing, and etc. You can combine any of these two into combos that fit your playstyle. The combat is a lot more active than most mmos, requiring you to dodge and actively use skills.Speaking of non-aesthetics, the gear you get stays off your character, so you aren't forced to wear that ""ugly armor"", the game features clothing that you can purchase, unlock, and (obviously) wear to suit your character. While the intial character customaztion isn't so robust, the game features a full line of clothings in which you can dress your character.The game features big areas that are themed, filled with plenty of quest to keep you busy. The difficulty curve feels about right, slowly scaling up with your progression through each area. The game features the typical ""instances/dungeons"" where you battle your way through the standard 6 boss format with up to 5 players. It also features three difficulty levels, Normal, Elite, and Nightmare. Normal serves as the progressing line through each dungeon, with fairly standard completion. Elite is the same thing, but for higher level gear, and Nightmare is a brutal and hellish asylum for those whom honed their tactics to form a congregation to conquer Satan's dungeon for a rewarding payoff. (It's THAT ♥♥♥♥ING HARD).Although, with such content, comes a couple of bugs. Playing the game for long periods of time can cause a memory leak, and once in a while you may experience a quest/dungeon/game breaking bug. However, this can be easily repaired by contacting an admin via /petition command, or logging off and back on. The beginning of the game (the first area) can seem a bit slow, slowly racking up abillities points while more slowly accumlating skill points to spend on your weapon skills. In short, The Secret World is a unique experience from an MMO perspective, featuring the right amount of difficulty, story, and gameplay to keep a driving force to play it. The game features several bugs however, which are easily repaired but can get annoying sometimes. For those looking for a core MMORPG, the trinity and character devloping remains and does not delve into over-""casualising"" itself. The game is downright hard, yet forgiving. It inspires creativity by allowing a free-form system in skill development. If you're looking for a refresher and are willing to try out something a little different, The Secret World is that MMO.-This awesome game was a gift from an awesome friend, shoutout to him :D!!! Thanks a lot for it!-			"

												Awesome modern-day MMO with decent customization options, decent variety of weapons and skills, frustrating interface but still with lots of decks and builds options to choose from, well designed storyline even though the quest system its a bit lame... , the game has a terribe optimization and as far as im concerned theres no work around for it.It has a very little co-op aspect but still dungeons are fun to play with friends or even with strangers.Unlike other reviews , ''OMG NOT WOW 0/10'' I would give this game an 8/10 .

												I still love this game. Combat is wonky. Over all tho I'd give the game a 7/10 Story starts off slow but really is quite amazing. I love the DLC and the outfits and over all the game always hooks me and feels good to play.Cons I wish the combat was more solid its very ping based so a little lag could mean dying. I really wish it didn't have so many pay walls. There are quite a few. While the game is completely free some outfits/ and all DLC which there is 13 of now can mean forking out a good chunk of change.			"

												When it comes to playing games in the MMO genre I've been around and I've been around as far back as when Ultimate Online kicked off. I've played many between then and now and must say that The Secret World provides an amazing experience and does a solid job mixing up the MMO formula. It really can play like a normal single player game if you want, outside of doing dungeons a few group quests and some end game material you aren't forced to group with others.With that said you will always run into people running around that if they see you struggling will generally give you a hand. Chat is mostly friendly with people offering to help or looking for groups. The class system is open ended. You build your character as you want. You aren't restricted and being forced to reroll, you just swap out your abilities and can change your playstyle or role in a group just like that. Obviously some builds are more optimized than others but part of the fun can be trying something different or new out. The great thing is you can unlock everything on one character. Sure it will take a long time but it is feasible. You start the game by selecting one weapon and as soon as you gain your first SP, you can unlock a second if you will. Having said that, you can only ever have 2 weapons equipped at any time but between combat you can swap them. This means you can use only active abilities for the weapons you currently have equipped.Combat plays out with a universal 1 second global cooldown with more specialized and powerful abilities having extended timers or requirements such as building up charges for effectiveness. You also have a dodge move that can pull you out of the fire, sometimes literally, fairly frequently.Now I want to tell you that it does a wonderful job with the horror themes and mythology. The voice acting...works but the dialogue is generally well written and each quest giver has their own personality and self contained reasons or stories for being involved. Mission variety is fairly standard ranging from gather ""x"" to kill ""y"" but where the missions really shine are the dungeon/group activities and the investigation missions. Both require you to actually think while some require you to just check for the solution online as it presupposes an understanding of say a long dead language. They make whatever you have played before from Point and Click Adventure games to Silent Hill/ Resident Evil/ Horror genre tropes look like grade school.The game does have an item shop that contains mostly comestic items and ""issues"" or DLC. TSW handles issues like DC Universe handles DLC. Now with TSW they also have the first 4 issues I believe for free to all players. So you'll just have to pick up the later ones and yes, they still are supporting the game with new issues and content on a frequent basis.The visuals are ok, a bit dated for the time and some of the abilities have recycled animations as I stated earlier some of the voice acting is bad (normally in a good way though) but on the other side the aesthetics/atmosphere/environments, ability control/combo system, interesting story/monsters, solo/group play, puzzles/mission variety and taking place in a modern setting far exceed the negative things I have to say about the game.So do I recommend this game? Yes. I highly recommend it. Snag it on a sale and give it a shot. It's pay once and play which is no different than the next Bioshock DLC, Madden or Total War game except when it's on sale it is about the price, or actually lower than, the price of the Bioshock DLC but has far more potential to suck you down to the dark and wet city of R'lyeh and keep you there either until you go insane or you find the secret to The Secret World *cue X-Files music*.J'ai fini			"

												An MMORPG in an urban fantasy environment, appealing graphics, immersive and interesting lore and storyline, no classes or character level to restrict you, dualwielding weapons, quests that are far more interesting than the ""good old"" running between NPCs while killing mobs, each quest has its story, each questgiver its personality..The Secret World is unique among MMOs, and the best one I've played yet. I find myself forgetting that it is an MMO, just to be reminded by some player running by, occasionally stealing my zombies. But well, there's no shortage of zombies.Sometimes I even mistake the zombies for players. Oops.			"

												Okay, here's the thing... This isn't an easy game to get your head around from the start. There's very little hand-holding to teach you how to play. However, once it mentally clicks, this game is top notch. The comabt is a little wonky but once you get use it, it's not all that bad.There's no levels, and you have access to all the skills in the game as you progress. I think there's over 500 different skills you can play around with.The lore is incredible and vast. Tons of content here.This game uses the same engine as Age of Conan, and it's a little clunky if you're playing under DirectX11 but visually, under Dx9 it's still a beautiful environment.This game is for people who like to think. Be prepared because there's a lot of online reserarching from the ingame browser.Happy Questing! :)			"

												A very unique MMO which actually maintains a stroy naritive and high quality of story telling. The game really works the horror gerne and keeps you engaed with a fairly good mix of quest types. Some quests are crazy complex but with an inbuilt brouser(or just use your own brouser and google) but they feel really rewarding if you do them yourself.All in all a great game, end game maybe a little weak but in time it may evolve, content is released in fairly regular bitesized chunks which you can buy at your own pace rather than subscribing(although you can sub/lifetime sub if you wish) Tokyo has just released givingthe first whole new area since lauch so I hope to see more people noticing this little gem of a game and giving it a little time in the near future.

												The Secret World is an interesting deviation from the usual MMOs. The skill and ability system allows more customization to your character's battle strengths than most games in the genre. It also involves a bit more thinking, given the number of puzzles included which need solving prior to advancing in your quest line. On the other hand I also find it a bit more repetitive than other mainstream MMO options, and find myself less invested than usual. Perhaps this is a result of not requiring social interactions, since the rare group quests are optional through most of the game.The final thing worth noting is the Item Shop - always a point of contention with MMO gamers. Many of the items available are purely cosmetic, several others can be obtained without payment. The implementation of the item shop does not break this game, in my opinion. I'm fine without ever using it.			"

												Enjoying it so far. Suprisingly good story with plenty of voice acting and cutscenes are present at the beginning and end of almost every quest other then the side quest. The other interesting thing about this MMO is the investigation missions which require you to do research and solve puzzles with little to no help from the game. These missions are pretty difficult to give you an idea in my 10 or so hours of play I have had to decode morse code(or at least attempt to :P), solve ingame riddles by studying ingame lore, and figure out passwords by using the ingame browser to solve the hints. The maps are also pretty well done and while not as massive as many other MMOs the maps are still quite large and space is well used. FInally the one thing that really suprised me and which will probably keep me in game is the dungeons. I have only done 1 so far but it was great basically no junk mobs just bosses and mini-bosses, and i must say the bosses are amazingly well done.			"

												I gave this game a thumbs up, but do realise it is an aquired taste. The strong point of this game is the story and the atmosphere. Compared to other MMO's it beats them by a mile (storywise). However compared to strictly story driven (stand alone) games, it is not all that good. I often wondered if this game would have been better as a stand alone. There are a lot of cutscenes, which are usually nicely done. The quality of the main storyline did suprise me as it flutters around and some side missions are actually better than the main storyline.The combat is rather rather dull and hp of many mobs increases faster than your dps. Combined with the story driven missions it makes the game feel rather slow. This does not have to be a bad thing mind you, but when indoctrinated by WoW or the like you will really have to get used to this game. The game can be quite unforgiving at times, which at certain points is a nice challenge, and at other times quite silly (making you want to read the mission guides in advance). Bringing a friend does help quite a lot (but be aware some parts of missions have to be done solo in mini instances).PVP is aweful at the moment. Players are ""balanced"" but not quite to the level of other QL10.5 types. Most areas are static most of the time, being at the mercy of the faction with the most players. On the flip side, it allowed me to read a good book while picking up points for epics, jumping in (and dying painfully) when we got attacked. All in all I enjoyed the atmosphere in the game and running around trying to find out what happened. I picked the game up on steam with a discount and I think it was worth the money. Though, as you noticed, I think it could have been a lot better. I have not played endgame content (raids), nor do I think I will. The replayablility does not seem that high to me, once you have seen a story, you will want to go to the next (even though they are repeatable).Ps. the game seems to be optimized very badly, at least for 32bit systems. I actually had to tweak my memory to make it run (I wish I could say smoothly). I ran it without steam, hence the low hour count.			"

												Fun, but poorly optimized.  With an i5-4210M (2.60GHz) and a NVIDIA GeForce GT 750M GPU, on low graphics settings this game tends to frequently stutter, especially during combat.  The developer needs to optimize the game better, but otherwise there's a lot of good and fun ideas to be hadEDIT:  It seems the game runs very poorly on DirectX11, which would explain the poor optimization thing.  Running the game in DirectX9 allows it to run quite nicely and generally isn't choppy at all except when the game tries to load a crowd of players in (and that doesn't last very long).  Game is fun, quests are pretty well thought-out, would recommend.			"

												Have played this game since its earliest beta, hands down one of the most unique MMOs on the market that you can play. With the addition of the Ultimate Edition out now you can purchase  the entire game , spanning from Issues 1-4 (Which come free with the game when it was a subscription game), to Issues 5-11, 3 Sidestory DLC Packs (1 for Investigation Missons, the other 2 for Tokyo missions).The main thing that sets Secret World apart from the rest of the MMO market, is that its a Classless game, no ""Levels"", there are a total of 525 normal abilities that you can master and aquire, doing that unlocks you a sweet Tron style outfit, the Panopic Core. The XP Bar is there just like anyother MMO, but each time you gain XP you gain Ability Points, which are used to unlock abilities, and Skill Points, which you use to increase your skill in the weapons and Talismans, Talismans are basically your gear in game, they do have stats, just like a normal mmo. You can only have a total of 7 Active Abilities / 7 Passive Abilies, 8/8 once you aquire the Auxillary Weapons.The cosmetics of the game are your characters clothing, you can aquire clothing in anyway in TSW, either by unlocked abilties, achievements, Decks (premade builds), buying them from a clothing store ingame or from the Item Shop. The Item Shop for TSW is pretty much all Cosmetics, you can purchase the Issues and Sidestory packs from the ingame shop, but it just unlocks Questing Content, nothing else. There are Ability Point Injectors you can purchase, but seeing as you can get AP pretty quickly without using them, they are not worth it.The game spans multiple locations, from New England to London, Egypt to Seoul, Transylvania to Hell, and finally to Tokyo where the games Season 1 concluded in Issue 11. The content in the game gives players hours, upon hours of playtime. Each zone having its own unique feel, the characters in each zone are fully voiced in and out of their cutscenesThere are multiple missions types in the game; There are your normal 'kill this, kill that, gather this, gather that' missions called Action Missions. Side Missions that are usually 1 or 3 tier simple quests, Investigation Missions, which require the player to think outside the box by looking up information about the quest, even the cutscenes themselves hold some information about the actual quests, and then Sabotage Missions which requires the player to not get detected by any of the mobs, explosives, or cameras.The Community of TSW, is probably the greatest community in an mmo that i've been apart of, Devs and GMs interact with the community every week, two of the devs have started streaming every week on twitch showing the ins-and-outs of how they make the game.There will be times when something bugs out, and you have to send in a petition to a GM to get it fixed, the usual time it takes for a GM to respond to your petition will roughly be atleast 3 minutes tops, the GM team they have is always online to help players when they need it, and thats great customer service.Overall, The Secret World is an amazing MMO that more people should check out, specially with the new ultimate edition that gives you every content update in the game.

You essentially create your own class here as well meaning you could set yourself up for some wicked combos or you you could be completely uselss lol.			"

												This game is a nice departure from most typical MMOs and FPS shooter games I have played. Whether you feel like solving a mystery or plowing through baddies this game has it all. The only problems I have had is the game was freezing my CPU up and it likes to crash my video driver once in a while. I have solved these problems for the most part by toubleshooting with the help of the forums here on Steam. All in all a fun game despite the glitches.			"

												As MMO's go this is by far the most unique and enjoyable,the storyline is fantastic, and great fun.The no levels thing works really well, it takes a lot of the grinding out of playing.  You're chasing points and tokens that you can actually use, not forever killing different groups of ten boars ad nausuem.the pvp system was designed by a genius and is incredibly fun to play, with a mechanic that gives it a high turnover and  constantly changing battlegrounds but it is far from perfect.Firstly it's an MMO, so it has the clunky and unpleasant control configuration that plagues all mmo'ssecondly, I prefer to think of it as an M-M-O.  because you don't always nessescarily have all three working together at the same time.  Sometimes it's massively online, and other times it's just Massively Multiplayer because you've been disconnected again.Solo instances are a thing...and there are quite a few of them, so you get seperated from any group you might be in because everyone has to grind these solo quests alone.there are no armours, so you can get your character looking more how you like rather than like (s)he just walked out of a garbage heap like you do in WOW.you'll roll your eyes at these faults when they crop up...but you probably won't stop enjoying the game for them, it more than makes up for it's shortfalls.

												I give this game 10 stars out of 10, it is EXCELLENT. I play WoW and GW2 and sometimes get bored with them, so SW is a great alternative. There is so much to do in SW: questing, crafting, PvP, PvE, dungeons, and puzzles to solve. I especially like the built in web browser so I can do research without opening up Firefox. The built in help is the best I have ever seen in a game. I already know that I will be addicted to the game, and play it for many years to come. The DLC is a bit expensive, but so long as I buy them only a few at a time, they are affordable. I really like the travel system also, very different than other games. One of my students recommended SW to me and I'm very glad that he did. In fact, I'm about to message a few friends of mine to invite them to join the game. I'm glad that the company dropped the monthly subscription, I wish Blizzard would do the same. Having free play, with an online store, and DLC is a great way for the company to make their money. Most people will NOT subscribe, especially because their are so many F2P games out there. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO ALL IT IS ABSOLUTELY GREAT!!!			"

												The Secret World is an interesting deviation from the usual MMOs. The skill and ability system allows more customization to your character's battle strengths than most games in the genre. It also involves a bit more thinking, given the number of puzzles included which need solving prior to advancing in your quest line. On the other hand I also find it a bit more repetitive than other mainstream MMO options, and find myself less invested than usual. Perhaps this is a result of not requiring social interactions, since the rare group quests are optional through most of the game.The final thing worth noting is the Item Shop - always a point of contention with MMO gamers. Many of the items available are purely cosmetic, several others can be obtained without payment. The implementation of the item shop does not break this game, in my opinion. I'm fine without ever using it.			"

Mysteries, X-Files, Cthulhu and oh... Well! First, when you are interested in this game and you are a veteran in MMOs, try to forget those experiences. This game is different in so many ways. Still the game leaves a lot open, and you can actually wish for more, it does so many things right that I have to wonder why this game isn't more widespread - especially since you have a Buy2Play game, with an Item-Shop and Subscription options (The subscription refunds you some worth for the item shop at a really good value).The genre is a mix of many different Pen & Paper RPG's and relies on Missions (Quests) - it features one of the best Quest-Systems to be seen on an Computer game. First, each Main Quest is told by a little in game animation, telling the story behind your quest - you have to listen carefully and attentively - especially on research missions. You could call the Game a mixture of Call of Cthulhu meets Torg meets Nephilim meets Villains & Vigilantes... among some things, also some Arcane Earth is mixed in (A Freeware RPG from the early 1990s).The developers did a great job with the storytelling, and I have to say - the game is quite versatile on a technical level too, at the moment I am using a low end PC with on Board Graphics - the description says, the game won't run on this machine... but wondrously it does - of course some finetuning required. But it runs like a charm... still I can't wait for the spare parts of my main computer falling into place, just to see more of the marvelous dark and sinister graphics of the game.The game has some bad attitudes though, there are some jumping riddles that are hard to solve, because jumping works like a mess in this game. Some ""Boss"" Fights on the Main and Story-Quests are frustrating, and sometimes even botched up (not all, some are on purpose a challenge - mind that) and of course, the game still is not really finished. I think the secret world is a game, where the money spend is a really good investment - it offers a lot, without being made for fanboys. Parts of the game show, that it was made for Mature and Adult players - this should stick in the back of your mind.Pros:Good Questing System, that is showing the advancement within each quest. Levelless RPG, you are building your character around skills and equipment. Even further enhancements are possible, later in the game.Deep Stories, sometimes with some eastereggs and blinking towards media and P & P RPGs. Challenging without overburdening the player... if you aren't strong enough to solve a quest - you might come back later - after some more skills.Cons:Some quests and boss fights seem to be bugged, but the game is constantly cared for and even in the month I did play the game there were some changes.  While the game runs stable, it's sometimes the Servers that are overacting - I had some troubles during the past month, but that might just be temporary.Highly Recommended!This game has everything a good MMORPG should have, plus more. The Devs actually put a lot of thought into their gameworld, and the sinister mood of the game isn't just transposed by fog, rain, thunderstorms and bad weather - but more by the storytelling and the immersive gameplay.There are some celebs in the game, as voiceactors of course. It's a shame that this game hasn't drawn a massive amount of players onto the dark realm of a Secret World... At last, it's far more entertaining than a lot of stuff outside, because of the steep learning curve and the challenging content.I hope the developers still have some surprises for us in reserve!

												Currently in Egypt and taking my time. There's so much to see and do in this game, from auctioning things off to questing and farming monsters for achievements. With the new museum, there's even more to do in the game. Cosmetics are just that in this game, cosmetics. There are no clothing stats and no leveling, so you can go at your own pace and enjoy it. There's no really forced grouping beyond maybe the dungeons, so you could reasonably solo the whole game if you wanted to. The dungeons have different levels too, as long as you complete the normal level first. The item store has lots of cool things, and you can get the DLC content easily if you save up on points. The quests are fun and challenging, with investigation quests being the hardest, but most rewarding kind of quest. The story carries easily over the worlds, despite some little hiccups, overall you can just take it all at your own pace and enjoy it, changing gear and weapons as you go along to find your own style.

												I'll cut right to the chase. If you hate fun, stop reading. If you are under 18, stop reading. If you dislike MMORPGs that are story driven and best enjoyed by yourself or with one friend, stop reading. If you are looking for a game in which your only purpose is to murder anything and everything that moves, stop reading.There, that should whittle it down a little bit. The Secret World is, in my opinion an amazing, adult-oriented (no, I don't mean T&A you perverts) MMORPG even though the MMO part of it is somewhat forgotten about in most of the game's design. This may be because, after nearly a decade of World of Warcraft I personally am tired of crowded cities, whiney children and more trolls than players worth their salt, I can better appreciate a world where my instance of the game is only populated by a maximum of 99 other people. The Secret World is a game crafted in a modern setting, with many references to pop culture and things that are relevant to us, in the world, today. This is not a high fantasy RPG. The game requires you to not only kill things, as is the standard fare for RPGs, but also to investigate and use your knowledge and reasoning to solve puzzles and open locks, track locations. Your character is a little bit Robert Langdon, a little bit Indiana Jones and a little bit Lara Croft, with maybe a little dash of Nathan Drake. A lot of the time I found that the game doesn't necessarily tell you to go here and talk to this specific person to find out this piece of information. A large majority of the time the game tells you that you have to look for someone, or an item, or a particular monster that lives somewhere in this general area. We think. We're pretty sure. You'll find out, I guess. It could be dead center. It could be in the last place you'd look. Or under a car tire. Maybe. Well, good luck!The combat system is somewhat bizarre feeling at first, but really easy to pick up on. You don't gain 'levels' per se. You gain points which you can spend on 'trees' of sorts to increase your skills in certain things, akin to Final Fantasy X's Sphere grid, or XII's job board. You can max out shotguns, or blood magic, or you can sort of steadily increase your ability with everything evenly, or any combination you like. My one complaint about the game, is REALLY long load times and that even having the recommended system specs, the game is still a pig on resources and when entering a new area my usually steady 45FPS is dragged down to 1-5. It's almost as if instead of loading the textures in pieces, it loads the entire zone in ONE big image which it then wraps around the mesh. It also has a really, really far view distance. It loads EVERYTHING. You can spot a lighthouse from the far side of the map.Recommended:OS: Windows 7 64 bit is highly-recommended Processor: Intel Core i5 3.0Ghz or equivalent Memory: 6GB Hard Disk Space: At least 30GB of free space Video Card: Nvidia GTX 560 Ti 1Gb DirectX®: 11.0 Sound: DirectX 9.0c compatible sound card My specs:OS: Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bitProcessor: Intel Core i7 870 @2.93Ghz/3.06GHzMemory: 8GB DDR3HDD free space: 239GBGPU: ASUS Radeon HD5750 FORMULA 1GB GDDR5DirectX version: DirectX 11.0Sound card: Creative Labs Sound Blaster X-Fi Elite ProAnd I still experience this system lag, even with the settings at mininum, and with DirectX 9.0. If this bothers you, this game will probably drive you nuts. If this is something you can live with, or if you have a cutting edge PC as of this writing, I strongly recommend giving this game a try.8/10			"

												Here's the thing about The Secret World: it's a game about risk taking, character building and overcoming circumstances bigger than yourself. If you're looking for an average MMO romp that holds your hand to the point of nearly crushing it, then TSW is the wrong game for you. However, if you're patient, enjoy challenge, thrive on deep skill/character customization and enjoy stellar plotting/writing, then there's absolutely no reason why you shouldn't be playing this game right now. Funcom's diamond-in-the-rough makes up for its lack of polish with an incredibly intuitive, level-less skill system that blends TCG-like deck building with the simplicity of Guild Wars 2's weapon-based combat system. Armor is invisible and only provides your character with stats, leaving you with cosmetic outfit pieces to dress your character in. All quests, except for the main scenario quests, are repeatable and provide you with in backstory on characters and locations, as well as providing you with clues that enrich your main scenario experience. The cash shop provides no pay-to-win items--with the ""AP Injection"" boosts being arguable at best--and instead gives you more options to customize your character with (that are also affordable). You can be a part of the Illuminati (just saying).I could go on and on about this game, but I'll check in here for now. I promise you won't regret investing your time and money into The Secret World.

												The best mmo game I've ever played. It has no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, everyone seems so adequate I want to got acquainted with every single person, also it has some quests which are actually quests. Im talking about puzzles, not about ""slain 10 boars"" quests. The first game I read every single story, main, puzzle or dungeon quest (additional quests dont contain any interesting information), because there is always an interesting story. Every single dungeon has its own tactics and you surely won't beat a single boss if you dont know how to move or what to press. Also it has very wide world with an atmosphere of a post-appocalypse, I wanted to make some screenshots to show that, but I always forget to press F12 when I see a great view, because I am always too excited about it. This game also contains a lot of easter eggs, such as Jack' O Lantern, Overlook motel and MiB (the three I saw for myself, maybe there were more but I didnt notice). Also it has pretty good character customization. By the way, unlike other mmo games this one has cosmetic clothes: usual dress you chose at start and then change in shops using in-game currency, called Pax Ramona; and items which gime you bonuses such as health, hit rating etc (called talismans. Chaning it wont apply any visual changes to your character). The game has 3 alliances to chose from and has no classes. Thats because you are free to chose any 2 weapons you like and make up your own kind of class, using 7 active  and 7 passive skills. The game has very interesting and as for me hard craft system, so you can make your own equipment like weapons, talismans and even energy drinks (some kind of potions which give you damage absorption or vampiric effect on your attacks, for example). If you need more info about this game, you can ask me, I will be glad to help you.			"

												I have played many MMo's almost from the start.  I played this last year for 6 months, and stopped. Since that time, I have purchased almost all the MMO's available on Steam. The problem is, that sooner or later, they all become the same. Same mechanics, same p2w issues....or broken economies. I decided to come back here - to the ""Secret World"". It really is unique. The most adult...and an experience not found in other MMO's. Without pointing out things already discussed by others....I can simply say, that if you want a deep experience, one you can handle mostly on your own, until you are ready to seek out and join others (or not)...this game can't be beat.The mechanics behind the skill systems are varied, deep, and potentially endless in their set ups. Its like   ""X-files (the creepier episodes) meets I am legend meets the Seventh sign. What more can you ask for?This is the only game ( MMO) that I have actually spent significant time changing my outfits to suit the atmosphere of whereever the missions take me.   And trust me......I would never have thought clothing options would be so fun?  (omg)Get this. Play this.Learn what is happening in the world around you ......			"

												As MMO's go this is by far the most unique and enjoyable,the storyline is fantastic, and great fun.The no levels thing works really well, it takes a lot of the grinding out of playing.  You're chasing points and tokens that you can actually use, not forever killing different groups of ten boars ad nausuem.the pvp system was designed by a genius and is incredibly fun to play, with a mechanic that gives it a high turnover and  constantly changing battlegrounds but it is far from perfect.Firstly it's an MMO, so it has the clunky and unpleasant control configuration that plagues all mmo'ssecondly, I prefer to think of it as an M-M-O.  because you don't always nessescarily have all three working together at the same time.  Sometimes it's massively online, and other times it's just Massively Multiplayer because you've been disconnected again.Solo instances are a thing...and there are quite a few of them, so you get seperated from any group you might be in because everyone has to grind these solo quests alone.there are no armours, so you can get your character looking more how you like rather than like (s)he just walked out of a garbage heap like you do in WOW.you'll roll your eyes at these faults when they crop up...but you probably won't stop enjoying the game for them, it more than makes up for it's shortfalls.

												Here's the thing about The Secret World: it's a game about risk taking, character building and overcoming circumstances bigger than yourself. If you're looking for an average MMO romp that holds your hand to the point of nearly crushing it, then TSW is the wrong game for you. However, if you're patient, enjoy challenge, thrive on deep skill/character customization and enjoy stellar plotting/writing, then there's absolutely no reason why you shouldn't be playing this game right now. Funcom's diamond-in-the-rough makes up for its lack of polish with an incredibly intuitive, level-less skill system that blends TCG-like deck building with the simplicity of Guild Wars 2's weapon-based combat system. Armor is invisible and only provides your character with stats, leaving you with cosmetic outfit pieces to dress your character in. All quests, except for the main scenario quests, are repeatable and provide you with in backstory on characters and locations, as well as providing you with clues that enrich your main scenario experience. The cash shop provides no pay-to-win items--with the ""AP Injection"" boosts being arguable at best--and instead gives you more options to customize your character with (that are also affordable). You can be a part of the Illuminati (just saying).I could go on and on about this game, but I'll check in here for now. I promise you won't regret investing your time and money into The Secret World.

I really wish it didn't have so many pay walls. There are quite a few.

												I'll cut right to the chase. If you hate fun, stop reading. If you are under 18, stop reading. If you dislike MMORPGs that are story driven and best enjoyed by yourself or with one friend, stop reading. If you are looking for a game in which your only purpose is to murder anything and everything that moves, stop reading.There, that should whittle it down a little bit. The Secret World is, in my opinion an amazing, adult-oriented (no, I don't mean T&A you perverts) MMORPG even though the MMO part of it is somewhat forgotten about in most of the game's design. This may be because, after nearly a decade of World of Warcraft I personally am tired of crowded cities, whiney children and more trolls than players worth their salt, I can better appreciate a world where my instance of the game is only populated by a maximum of 99 other people. The Secret World is a game crafted in a modern setting, with many references to pop culture and things that are relevant to us, in the world, today. This is not a high fantasy RPG. The game requires you to not only kill things, as is the standard fare for RPGs, but also to investigate and use your knowledge and reasoning to solve puzzles and open locks, track locations. Your character is a little bit Robert Langdon, a little bit Indiana Jones and a little bit Lara Croft, with maybe a little dash of Nathan Drake. A lot of the time I found that the game doesn't necessarily tell you to go here and talk to this specific person to find out this piece of information. A large majority of the time the game tells you that you have to look for someone, or an item, or a particular monster that lives somewhere in this general area. We think. We're pretty sure. You'll find out, I guess. It could be dead center. It could be in the last place you'd look. Or under a car tire. Maybe. Well, good luck!The combat system is somewhat bizarre feeling at first, but really easy to pick up on. You don't gain 'levels' per se. You gain points which you can spend on 'trees' of sorts to increase your skills in certain things, akin to Final Fantasy X's Sphere grid, or XII's job board. You can max out shotguns, or blood magic, or you can sort of steadily increase your ability with everything evenly, or any combination you like. My one complaint about the game, is REALLY long load times and that even having the recommended system specs, the game is still a pig on resources and when entering a new area my usually steady 45FPS is dragged down to 1-5. It's almost as if instead of loading the textures in pieces, it loads the entire zone in ONE big image which it then wraps around the mesh. It also has a really, really far view distance. It loads EVERYTHING. You can spot a lighthouse from the far side of the map.Recommended:OS: Windows 7 64 bit is highly-recommended Processor: Intel Core i5 3.0Ghz or equivalent Memory: 6GB Hard Disk Space: At least 30GB of free space Video Card: Nvidia GTX 560 Ti 1Gb DirectX®: 11.0 Sound: DirectX 9.0c compatible sound card My specs:OS: Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bitProcessor: Intel Core i7 870 @2.93Ghz/3.06GHzMemory: 8GB DDR3HDD free space: 239GBGPU: ASUS Radeon HD5750 FORMULA 1GB GDDR5DirectX version: DirectX 11.0Sound card: Creative Labs Sound Blaster X-Fi Elite ProAnd I still experience this system lag, even with the settings at mininum, and with DirectX 9.0. If this bothers you, this game will probably drive you nuts. If this is something you can live with, or if you have a cutting edge PC as of this writing, I strongly recommend giving this game a try.8/10			"

												This title has its ups and downs. PVP is intimidating since you are thrust in and most likely out geared by the dedicated players. Yes you get a buff to slightly equalize the playing field, but it doesnt help much.( I'm now holding my own in pvp but it took some time)Storyline can get dry but overall it has a very interesting take on all current and old mythology.The fact you can be whatever you want in your skill progression is extremely appealing.Sadly if you want more after you have trudged so far into the game you must buy the expansions to get that fix.The community population is small at times and grouping up can be a hassle for dungeons because of it.Traveling will become a tiresome thing if you decide to play. The travel system is so dated, New York to Transylvania, ugh.Even with the ups and downs the game is good in my eyes.Decent Visuals     Great Music			"

												Okay, here's the thing... This isn't an easy game to get your head around from the start. There's very little hand-holding to teach you how to play. However, once it mentally clicks, this game is top notch. The comabt is a little wonky but once you get use it, it's not all that bad.There's no levels, and you have access to all the skills in the game as you progress. I think there's over 500 different skills you can play around with.The lore is incredible and vast. Tons of content here.This game uses the same engine as Age of Conan, and it's a little clunky if you're playing under DirectX11 but visually, under Dx9 it's still a beautiful environment.This game is for people who like to think. Be prepared because there's a lot of online reserarching from the ingame browser.Happy Questing! :)			"

												I absolutely love this game. It is a lore-driven MMO which seeks to immerse the player in tiered quest lines across multiple locales. Fantastic design.The leveling system is thrown out the window in favour of a much more involved (and often revised) system of skill and ability points which are earned as the player hits experience threshholds. Basic stat grinding does not exist. The auction house, as with any MMO, can cripple the feeling of progressive improvement so I would avoid it. Atmospherically the game excells, although I will note the graphics are nothing to write home about. There is occasional framerate slow-downs and sometimes the camera angles can be difficult to set. Otherwise, the game plays smoothly. I'd give this game a 8/10. A must buy if you have a group of friends who seem even remotely interested.			"

												The Secret World is a great MMORPG. Players choose one of 3 secret societies to join - The Templars, The Illuminati, or The Dragons. Each of these organizations has their own base of operations and a rich history (Though the Dragons are fictitious). The game gives you access to 9 weapon trees, and unlimited Ability and Skill Points to spend.  As long as you continue to complete quests, you will receive both AP and SP, and there is no cap as the goal is to eventually unlock every ability and explore every weapon tree. This game is a great experience, and I would highly recommend it. The fact that there are no subscriptions makes this a great MMORPG to pick up and play!			"

												The secret world is an MMO focused on all things found in Lovecraft lore. The game looks nice, sounds nice, and plays very well for how ambitious it is. The game boasts a large world and replayable missions while lacking tried and true character leveling instead opting for experience based skill and ability point on a threshold system. This lends itself to a feeling that no point spent is wasted. I highly recommend the game to anyone looking for a solid MMO with a moderate difficulty who isn't a fan of a monthly sub fee.

												I still love this game. Combat is wonky. Over all tho I'd give the game a 7/10 Story starts off slow but really is quite amazing. I love the DLC and the outfits and over all the game always hooks me and feels good to play.Cons I wish the combat was more solid its very ping based so a little lag could mean dying. I really wish it didn't have so many pay walls. There are quite a few. While the game is completely free some outfits/ and all DLC which there is 13 of now can mean forking out a good chunk of change.			"

												Awesome modern-day MMO with decent customization options, decent variety of weapons and skills, frustrating interface but still with lots of decks and builds options to choose from, well designed storyline even though the quest system its a bit lame... , the game has a terribe optimization and as far as im concerned theres no work around for it.It has a very little co-op aspect but still dungeons are fun to play with friends or even with strangers.Unlike other reviews , ''OMG NOT WOW 0/10'' I would give this game an 8/10 .

I suggest getting the sword early on, there is a very early ability available which functions as a self heal if you slot the corresponding passive for it, and there are plenty of aoe sword attacks available. Fist weapons have alot of HoT abilities, which can be quite good to use just before heading into a fight, so I would suggest getting that as your secondary weapon when starting out a new character.BUILDS AND GEAR (endgame pve/pvp)It can be quite difficult to play any build you want if you do not have gear with stats that compliment them! Endgame gear can be hard to get for either pve or pvp purposes, however pvp is a bit more forgiving in that you get a stat buff depending on what pvp role you choose, and then the stats on whatever gear you're wearing will replace the least-prioritised stats from the stat buff (also known as equal-footing buff). This makes it a little easier to make viable, specialised builds for pvp without having to attain endgame gear.			"

												The setting is what originally got me to buy it. When I first heard about it, I figured it would be like Hunter: the Vigil but online, and settings-wise, it is similar.What has kept me playing are the NPCs and the ability system. I play with subtitles on and I take screenshots all the time because of the awesome, funny, or insightful things the NPCs say. Player abilities are built around selecting 2 weapons, 7 active powers and 7 passive powers. It gets more complicated as you go because synergies emerge as you earn powers that set conditions and then exploit them. There are no experience levels; content is separated mainly by the quality of your talismans (talismans because pants and shirts are divorced from in-game effect, freeing you to look how you want). Group roles tend to fall into tanking, healing, support and damage. You are free to change roles any time you aren't fighting: just use the gear manager to switch between ability and equipment sets.Every MMO seems to want to avoid the ""kill 10 rats"" type quests, but The Secret World is one of the few that succeeds. Those missions still exist, but they are clearly labeled Action and they appear along side Sabotage missions, where the player must avoid detection and Investigation missions, which actually require researching the clues on the Internet.PvP is the primary deficiency I've seen. It is kind of unpopular and my computer can't handle it. (Assault rifle particle effects can be crippling.)TL;DR - Not a straight WoW copy and great if you're into Lovecraft & World of Darkness			"

												This game rocks so much on so many levels. It's not your average MMO. It's way more than that.The skill system is pretty nice and you can build your character as you want. 3 kind of weapons, 3 weapons in each, loads of skills to choose from, and the possibility to change these at any time. Bored with swords? Well then take a rifle and start building your character again. :pThe graphics and level/world design are pretty awesome, and I am not even running the game at best quality.The gameplay is nothing special, but it doesn't have any flaws, at least I haven't met any.But what makes this game so amazing, is the story and the quests. Yes, that is the true heart of this game. The setting is pretty simple, since basically, it's our modern world. Yet, it's so more complicated. The story is greatly told, with a lot of cinematics with good voice acting, and loads of quests that allow you to discover things you wouldn't even believe. There is especially one type of quest that I like, it's the investigation quests. Instead of giving you a goal and showing you how to go there/do it, it makes you search your way through it. Riddles and enigmas to decipher, to get through the quest and finally achieve your goal. It's really interesting.What's really interesting in this game is that it's really a MMO and a RPG. It really mixes a classical RPG with everything you have in a classical MMO: PvP, different builds, chat, dungeons, guildes, etc... It's not your boring MMO with meaningless quests, it has a real story and feels really cool.I mean, who never wished to be a Templar? These guys rock. Well, ok, the Dragon rocks too.			"

												The Secret World isn't perfect. That being said, it is one of the most entertaining, immersing and downright fun games I played.Now, I'm not a big fan of MMOs. You can look at my hours spent of TF2 and compare it to true veterans, but that's because I have other activites to do in my young, adolescent life. MMOs are an unfortunate example of this, and I can never truly get into them due to the sheer level of devotion it demands from the player.The Secret World is not that kind of MMO. In fact, it gets so much right, it's hard not to pick it up in the first place.Unlike many of it's genre, TSW has a very deep and interesting story. That isn't to say that other MMOs have good stories, but this game revels in pride with it's atmosphere and lore. When you first create your character, you are given a selection between three factions; the Templars, the uncompromising yet morally-just (for the most part) lions of the Secret World. If you love knights or want to be the closest you can get in this world to a hero, then don the red and white of the Templars. The Illuminati are the opposite; instead of fighting for order and stability, the Illuminati seek to change the world with their power - for better or worse. If you dream of becoming stronger than anyone else, then you'll love this faction. Finally, the Dragon are a green sea of chaos, always making small actions that bring changes of gargantuan proportions. If you're looking to change a long-stagnant world, then play as the Dragon. Personally, I chose the Templars, for I agree with them for the most part.Anyway, the story kicks off with you swallowing a Bee. Unlike the boring bees we know, these creatures grant magical powers to those they choose as their bearers. After (somewhat) mastering your magical powers, your consulted by one of the three factions to go to their headquarters and begin your journey. After a short prologue, you are free to explore the world.First of, the world is huge. The Secret World boast three main regions to explore. The first area you got to is the sleepy Maine coastal town called Solomon Island, which is a sort of earlygame area. You go to Egypt for the midgame, and finally Translyvania for the lategame. If you could pay the DLC, you get to go to one more area, but I'll cover that another time.The story follows your war on the rising darkness, and you meet a wide cast of colorful characters to help you in your journey. This may be me personally, but I loved the questgivers. They weren't some mindless, one-dimensional characters who just were there to give quests, they have their own little quirks and loveable traits. This - as I mentioned - is one of TSW's strong points; the story. Seriously, you'll spend hours on the well-written characters, and even more time finding all the lore collectables.The story may be great, but it wouldn't matter if the gameplay sucked. Thankfully it doesn't, and while I don't have that much experience with MMOs to compare it to another format, I enjoyed it. It really is something different; unlike the traditional MMO format, you don't have levels. Instead, you have a selection of one of nine weapons that let you create your classes. I chose a Hammer/Shotgun DPS/Solo build, and you can do whatever you want, provided you can make the synergy work. Another unique fact is that there are no levels; the experience is fixed, and you get an Ability point for every 40,000 XP you get, and a Skill Point for every 120,000 XP.Ability Points, as the name implies, unlock new skills for your characters. Abilities are based off the combat; you have resources, and you need ""builders"" to build a resource with each hit so you can do resource-consuming attacks. There's also healing spells, buffs, debuffs, you get the idea. Meanwhile, Skill Points are this game's level system. If you put a skill point into a weapon you use, it goes up. The cost for every weapon rises until it reaches it's maximum. In order to equip a powerful talisman (equipment that determine your stats) you need to have the required skill level for that item. The best part about the Skill Point system is that progression happens at a very generous pace: you'll be hitting levels very quickly, making it a lot more fun than the tiresome slog of other MMO grinds.Finally, the DLC. Now normally I dislike DLC, but here it's some of the best this side of the medium. You'll have to pay with Funcom Tokens (which require real money) but the content it provides is so fun, it's very much worth the admission ticket. Even beyond the DLC, the game doesn't actively force you to buy it to have fun; you're more likely to buy a sick motorcycle than you are to purchase XP boosts.Overall, this is a very, very fun game! If you are a MMO veteran or a newcomer seeking to enjoy fantasy in the modern world, this won't disappoint. That's a promise.			"

Update: They ruined it. I kind of regret spending money on this now. They've made a lot of bad changes for their new free-to-play re-release(that replaces my Steam version) and totally screwed over the original player-base that spent $50-100 to play all of their very over-priced content, while also limiting your character slots to one in the re-release and making you start over, among many more changes I don't like. Screw Funcom. This is no longer the game I purchased, which is bullsh!t.----- Original Review: -----9/10 - Easily my favorite MMORPG, which is also an incredible single-player game. This is a unique experience I highly recommend.Pros:Mature-themed and intelligent dialogues--they don't hold back.The atmosphere is amazing; better than most games I've played. You'll never want to leave.Unmatched missions that have a lot of variety and plots that are better than some AAA titles, with great voice acting and solid cutscenes(featuring your character!) for at least half of them(There's a lot!).A lot of missions are repeatable.Investigation missions are unlike anything you've seen before. They require real investigation, whether it be using your knowledge of the game, searching the internet(there's an in-game browser), or even calling real phone numbers. Expect these to be insanely difficult. You should put some on hold and do other missions while you think about their solutions or hints, explore the vast world until something ""ticks.""It makes you think.Everywhere in every zone, there's rich content to be found, whether it be hidden lore or a mission.Tons of in-depth lore to uncover.Many large zones to explore with different themes, filled with great design, content and atmosphere.Encourages exploration.You can explore when you die, as a ghost, and it is required for some things. The world changes when you're dead.Lovecraftian horror.Choose from three factions, each with their own story and hub. Illuminati, Templar or Dragon.Great character customization with tons of cosmetics to unlock or buy.You get a hat for eating 7460 tacos.Countless in-game achievements with rewards of all kinds(XP, cosmetics, items, titles, etc.).There's no character levels. You earn XP to unlock Ability Points and Skill Points; the required amount of XP never changes. You're able to unlock all 500+ abilities on a single character to create complex builds. Skill Points decide which quality level of items you can equip.Since your equipment's quality level matters so much, it's not such a bad idea to rush to the next zone to get better loot, then go back to make things a bit easier(A mission may be required to advance to the next zone).Two weapon types can be equipped at once in any combination and you can change them at any time, then you can unlock a 3rd special weapon later in the game.9 Main weapon types include Assault Rifle, Pistols, Shotgun, Fist, Hammer, Blade, Elemental, Chaos and Blood.There's auxiliary weapons such as a Rocket Launcher, Flamethrower, Quantum, Chainsaw and Whip. These would be the 3rd weapon you can equip at once and they each have their own set of abilities.Seasonal events.Good pacing; not grindy as most MMORPGs are.Nice music, I never felt the need to disable it.Buy-to-play, no subscription.Over 160 hours in and there's still a ton of content I haven't done.Memorable.Dungeons and Scenarios have multiple difficulties.After completing 30 missions, you get 1200 free points to spend in their store, which can be used to purchase extra mission packs among many goods.The Issues(mission packs) that are sold don't really come into play until endgame and they're optional, so if you make it that far, they probably deserve the extra money anyway.It has PvP, for those that are looking for it. You can completely avoid it like I have.The community is nice and helpful. Be sure to join the ""#Sanctuary"" chat channel, great place.You can fast travel to anima wells you find at a very low cost.The zone maps seen via the [M] key are very nice, with coordinates as well as the ability to place text markers to label noteworthy spots. I use that feature a lot.Addon/mod support.Countless high quality textures and images you'll see in missions.Upgradeable sprint speeds(unlocked through faction rank. You have to buy the upgrade in your faction's hub and a lot of people tend to miss this feature for a long time).Item crafting and disassembling.Auction House(I like them, and it only helps this game).Expand inventory space many times simply by using in-game currency. You can split inventories for sorting.You'll probably only use one character, but you can have multiple.Makes time fly.Cons:Ridiculously underrated considering this may be the best MMO available. There's not a ton of people playing(a few thousand maybe), but that's okay, since at least 90% of the content is possible solo. It's pretty much a single-player game with social features, but you can group up if you wish. I'd say most of the players are using a non-Steam client, so ignore the Steam charts. It's actually not integrated with Steam at all, so you don't have to run it through Steam either. You get a key for the game that you redeem on your account to activate it.Some people don't like the combat, some say it's the only downfall, but I personally kind of like it; I've seen much worse. You'll be dodging plenty of attacks, kiting and aiming with AoEs or cone-style attacks, plus the animations and effects are nice.DX11 has a couple bugs, so you may be better off running it in DX9 like me. I think DX9 even gives a better framerate. The option is available.The framerate could be better, but it's acceptable and I get too immersed to notice. I think maybe it just doesn't like my 8-core AMD CPU very much, that's not uncommon with MMOs.The prices on Steam are fairly high, especially for Issues(additional endgame missions), but it's definitely worth it.It may be a bit difficult to get into at first, for some people, but that's because there's so much to it!50GB install size, but judging from the amount of high quality content and voice acting in the game, that install size seems fair.No Steam achievements. I would've enjoyed them.Update:10-Day Free Trial here[play.thesecretworld.com] "

												tl;dr: Great ♥♥♥♥ing game with innovative mechanics and ideas, reminicent of the World of Darkness and the Dresden Files. Go try it!Some thoughts; The Secret World (TSW) is one of the most exciting MMO’s that I’ve had the pleasure of trying, with a deep and intriguing setting that encourages exploration both of the world and the narrative. The setting is heavily influenced by the works of writers such as H.P. Lovecraft and Stephen King, where you awake to a secret world, filled with monsters, spirits and ancient horrors from beyond this world, where all the legends and fairytales have a kernel of truth in them. The game looks stunning design-wise, and every area of the game draws heavily upon both pop cultural and historical representations of such settings as dreary New England or Ancient Egypt. You’ll spend a lot of time enjoying all the references that pop up and the new takes on myths and legends, all tied nicely together with the game’s central lore. TSW boasts some of the most intriguing quest systems I’ve seen so far in a MMO, especially the investigation missions, where the answer to a given problem often is not to be found in the game itself, requiring that you make use of the game’s built in web browser to investigate the clues for an answer. This can lead to some very frustrating moments as the difficulty of these investigation missions can be rather steep at times, showing that the game priorities not only combat as a challenge mechanism. TSW also makes heavy use of the graphical representation of the world itself to give you clues to further you on missions, where you can have walked past something several times, only suddenly to realize that there is an actual reason behind the design, beyond simple esthetics; they are a clue. But it also feels familiar to traditional MMORPGs.When it comes to the combat, TSW is complicated, simply put, and many a player has had a running face-first meeting with the metaphorical brick wall, as the game suddenly demands that players develop a deeper understanding of the mechanics of the game in order to bolster combat efficiency. The in-game tutorial of this is a bit lacking -especially given the huge amount of freedom the player is given concerning builds- which leads to no small amount of frustration at times, but once you have overcome this wall and started to learn how abilities work in conjunction with each other, the gameplay is rewarding and deep. Given that TSW has turned Free to Play, it is well worth giving it a go, both as a single player experience and as a deep and challenging MMO. The main critique I have of the game is the end game, where it turns into a traditional MMO and focues upon raiding and grinding, but this too is fun and challenging. Funcom regularly updates with Side Stories, quest chains and new areas that both further the main storyline and act as smaller short story-like experiences.			"

												The combat in the game can get a little repetitive like most MMO's, but the way the quests are done are a completely new and refreshing take.  The investigation missions force you to search for answers outside the game which makes for an experience like none other.  The puzzles start getting a bit tricky after a while as well, so the game outside of combat gets pretty challenging.  Definitely recommend this.			"

												Very good ambience, graphics are awesome and the skill system is absolutely awesome. No classes, you can decide how you want to play. Tank, DPS, Healer, Hybrid. There aren't alot of dungeons in the game, but they're always fun to repeat. The game gets alot of content updates (including new dungeons). You can choose from three factions at the start of Character Creation, in which you can level and exile. Every faction has it's own features, advantages or disadvantages. You got to try the game out, the story and the ambience are just amazing. The graphics rock even on low settings. So please try it out, it's worth a shot! (Maybe even two.)8.6/10			"

												Are you a fan of Chuthulu? MMORPGs? Killing Demons? Zombies? Vampires? If you answered yes to any (or all) of these than this might just be the MMO for you. There are no classes or levels. You pick your starting weapons (guns, melee or magic) your group (illuminati, Templars or the Dragon) and off you go to solve the mysteries of The Secert World! While this game suffered early when it was released it has since been updated and refined into a decently made MMO that has a strong committed base of players. The missions you get sent on will test everything from your characters strengths to how intellegent you are. I highly recommend keeping a pencil and notepad near you while playing if you don't just want to Google the answers for the Investigation missions.8/10 - Graphics8.72/10 - Story7/10 - Innovation10/10 - Replayability9/10 - Sound & Music10/10 - Challenge (without being frustrating)			"

												I'd like to apologize ahead of time for the lack of a pros and cons or other in depth analysis you might see in other reviews. I'm just here to brown nose a little.I don't write reviews, ever, but for this game I can make an exception. It's story telling is genius, its graphics don't even need to be good (Even though they are) because they way they've managed to capture the atmosphere is so perfect that I lack words to describe it, and the voice acting is top of the line.The Secret World is like playing through a really good psychological suspenful, mystery, horror movie. I captures all of the best elements of story telling and its lore has a deceptive depth to it. For the life of me I cannot understand why this game hangs on the fringes as something of a cult ""classic"" when it has the potential to be something huge.Between solving puzzles and wracking my brain dechipering codes or unravelling painfully obscure mysteries I find myself at a loss for exactly how to convey just how much I like this game. It's strange really. The feeling it gives from the music right down to the appropirate scenery. Every lovecraftian thing, every eldritch monstrocity seems enough to make anyone's skin crawl with creep, fear, and confusion.In more than 100 hours of gameplay I've played solo, I've not completely a single dungeon, and I still find this game incredibly entertaining.I'll say this and shut up. The story writers for this game could have easily written a series of novels and even the scripts for award winning movies. Hell, even a television series would be mindblowing with the kind of writing they do. I don't know what intellects they have behind it all (Never watched the credits) but these folks are top notch.

												Probably the best story driven game, with some very complex puzzling. This game should be on peoples bucket list.The game does not go without a few graphical glitches/animations… today what game does not? Hell some games literally release broken, then have the audacity to bombard you with DLC content before they even fix their game.This game is cheap, you can find it online a lot cheaper than on Steam Store, all that aside.The game sports 3 factions, The Illuminati, The Templar, and The Dragon. Each of these factions have their own story behind their motives, I won't spoil anything though. The game has hundreds of hours of cut scenes and amazing voice acting, and so freaking many characters each with their own story and motives as of why you get to meet them and why you do what you do for them. That alone makes almost every character worth remembering.The combat is a bit clunky I won't try to sugar coat it, but it works, there are many builds out there and the game provides many within the game for you to cookie cut around. There is a lot of gear in the game many of which can be upgraded into more powerful versions as an end game gearing method. You don't need to do end game content to make your own end game gear, although it would speed up the process a bit if getting the best gear was your priority.The game has a crap ton of cosmetics, some of them are locked behind achievements, and goals that make it all that more worth to pursue. A lot of them can be found in stores within the game, or the auction house, it's pretty cool to run into a store and just try on clothes.The game has a huge world that expands quite a bit, hell the game has 15 expansions and more being worked on. The game has multiple settings, one of the areas you will be doing story missions is in Egypt.If there is any game out there worth 20 dollars… I'd say this game honestly will give you the bang for the buck, of course... if you can get past the few glitches and clunky combat... the story will be one of the most rewarding you'll ever play in history.

												The Secret World is probably one of the best MMO's at the moment. The graphics are good and if your graphics card is good enough, you can even get tesselation into the game which makes the game look pretty awesome. The game is also optimized pretty badly, it runs mostly in quite good fps but there are some places which makes your fps spike pretty low, especially if you use the tesselation.What makes this MMO stand out from every other MMO's currently available is that the ""class system"" is unique and works pretty well, because you can make your own ""class"". What would be cooler than playing with a group where one player uses firearms, one magic abilities and another a mixture of melee and magic? The class system is so cool that you can even mix two different types of abilities into one. There isn't any levels in the game, complete quests and kill enemies to gain ability points which are used to unlock more abilities for you to use.Also, the game takes place in present time. The enemies are mostly created from different urban legends which makes them quite interesting and unique from other MMO's. The storyline kind of mixes things with real life, urban legends and myths which makes it really interesting and different. One of the things I like the most with the quests are the research missions, which tells you what you need to find out, then you use the in-game browser and find out the answers yourself to continue the mission. Sometimes it is too hard to find out the answers yourself though, so you need to find a mission walkthrough to get past one obstacle, but they are pretty fun and sometimes they make you involved deeper into the story.Although, the early stages of the game is pretty easy with a group, I recommend playing this with a few friends. The game gets tougher when continuing towards the end, and once you progress long enough you can't solo the quests anymore. One of the biggest reasons why you should play with a group, and it is more fun than playing alone.If you want a good MMO, which is different from other MMO's at the moment, you want this one. So what are you still waiting for? Buy it, play it, treasure it. Whatever, just stop reading this and go join the war!			"

												This is a groovy-cool, eerie MMO that breaks a lot of rules that MMO's have picked up along the years. First, there is no leveling. That's right. You gain experience and apply experience benchmarks towards skills and abilities. Your one character can conceivably learn how to do everything in the game. There is no cap on your advancement. This is a really cool aspect to the game. They balance this seemingly amazing gift with the fact that you can only ever have 7 active abilities and 7 passive ones. Many of these play off each other too, so it behooves one to play their character with a concept. The lore of the game is ripe with themes from H.P. Lovecraft also, so if this sort of horror appeals to you, then TSW is a real treat. Armor is gone, replaced by an assortment of magical treatments that provide you with the real armor against all of the unholy and undead things in the game.

												While at first I was leery of starting on another MMO after a long stint without more than scattered gameplay on EVE and The Old Republic, I found myself interested in the concept behind this game. After the initial ""WTF"" phase that most gamers go through with a new style, I discovered that not only did I enjoy the game, I'd found one that had topped any MMO before it in my opinion. While it seems TSW starts off slow, it picks up the pace almost instantly after the starter missions. Grinding away in the same area constantly seemed unappealing until I saw the way the game encouraged not only teamwork, but communication between party members (a feature I hadn't seen since the early days of Everquest).Following the introduction to the gameplay alone, I found that the storyline was not only well-constructed, but engaging for the players. Every time I finished a mission, the one following it left me more than curious enough to progress through the line following it.This game, despite its seemingly grind-dependant system, is one I would highly recommend to any MMO gamer who lost their spark, lost interest in gaming, or just wants to try something new.

												This game is awesome!  I've played a few MMOs over the years and this one is by far the most fun.  There are a variety of mission types:  collection, research, escort, etc.  The difference is in this game some of them really make you think!  In some cases you have to go on the web to find answers and I admit I've been stumped and looked at a walkthrough a few times.  I was daunted by the number of forum posts dedicated to ""the perfect build"" but they aren't needed.  You can get the skills you want and eventually you can unlock all of them, there are over 500!  I started playing with elemental magic and a pistol and then I started reading about builds and I was really overwhelmed.  I decided to start a new character only to find out that it really doesn't matter what your build is during the first few parts of the game.  I didn't need to restart after all, however doing the missions a second time was still a blast!  Point is, don't bother looking at perfect builds.  Later in the game you have to put more thought into your build and there are 9 weapon options:  blades, fists (claws), hammers, pistols, shotguns, assault rifles, chaos magic, elemental magic, and blood magic.  What I learned is just pick two you like, you don't have to worry too much about weapon synergy right away, just have fun.  Go ahead and read the build forums and then rip out your hair in frustration as you figure out exactly what you want, don't say I didn't warn you.  There is tons of content.  There's a main storyline and hundreds of missions spread out across different areas.  Buy the game, you probably won't regret it.  BTW you should pick up the Massive Edition for some pretty decent starting weapons and 3 more ""issues"" of content.			"

												This game takes a long time to download, plus the extra time for patches, the game is fun and the quest can be tough at times are longer and arent just grinding. The game isnt worth the 30 dollars, but if you ever see it on sale for like 10 or around that and you want to get a mmo then I would say pick this up. But be sure to have friends, or search and do every quest you find along the way.			"

It isn't a HUGE user base, but they are, for the most part, fantastic people. Some of the nicest, most friendly and helpful gamers I have met in an mmo (and I have played a few) are hiding out in Secret World. Oh, but one major caveat -- if you are squeemish about zombies, blood, gore, and getting the bajezzus scared out of you, DONT buy this game. If you like a little fright every once in a while, though, then by all means, come join us in The Secret World. (and send me a tell, I'm happy to help - Twaine)			"

												Very good ambience, graphics are awesome and the skill system is absolutely awesome. No classes, you can decide how you want to play. Tank, DPS, Healer, Hybrid. There aren't alot of dungeons in the game, but they're always fun to repeat. The game gets alot of content updates (including new dungeons). You can choose from three factions at the start of Character Creation, in which you can level and exile. Every faction has it's own features, advantages or disadvantages. You got to try the game out, the story and the ambience are just amazing. The graphics rock even on low settings. So please try it out, it's worth a shot! (Maybe even two.)8.6/10			"

												An MMO is only as good as the sum of its parts: the story, the multiplayer aspect, the cash shop, the ""hook,"" and the company that makes it. The Secret World is a very good MMO, but because its director has changed, the end product is a bipolar mix of MMO design philosophy. The early and middle parts of the game are rich, interesting story, supplemented by detailed environments, memorable characters and enemies, and well-written plots. The endgame is a punishing grind for gear and skills. Additionally, the latest holiday events were grind-fests, as well. Would I recommend this game? Yes. The story itself is such a beautiful thing that it deserves recognition. However, the endgame is a bucket of cold water to a damn good Sunday afternoon nap, so be sure to prepare yourself.			"

												For the LAZY PEOPLE! - If you want to see a PRO-CON list immediately, click ""Read More"" and scroll DOWN!Categories!!! - Positive commentary.!*!*! - Negative Commentary!!! - I can't recommend this MMORPG enough. I can't get enough of it. Been playing it non stop recently and I don't think it'll end anytime soon. The game mechanics are superb for the style of gameplay it utilizes. Gunplay and melee combat and spectacularly executed, and I have seen few games that can pull it off. Especially in an RPG style game like this. The magic is also well done. Each weapon and fighting style can be combined in hundreds, if not thousands of different ways! The skill trees and the abilities are very well done as well as thought out. Once you learn it, it becomes quite easy to figure out what you want to do with your character, and at that point, the posibilities become endless.!!! - To start, one of the most important things I really want to mention about this game is it's setting and style. It is MODERN DAY. And there are no fairies or anything! Which is a really fresh getup with the game. Now you're probably thinking, ""There are muthical creatures in this game!"" Yes! There are! And each one of them are gruesome, disgusting and AWESOME! They look beautiful. Much different from a futuristic and fairytale style setting. Oh! And I forgot to mention. It has the Illuminati, Templars and Dragons! Secret Societies for FACTIONS!? That's a win/win for everyone.!!! - You could become a pistol dueling swordsman, a elemental mage who uses shotguns, and even an Assault rifle marksman who bashes enemies heads in with a HAMMER! The combinations and playstyles very in so many forms it takes player variety to a whole new level. I still have yet to use all the weapons and magics with all their main inner ring abilities.!!! - The questing as well! Man oh man, whoever designed the quest lines and missions on this game knew what the heck they were doing! Along with the main storyline that you play along(which is also extremely compelling) you are allowed to do extra missions along the way with an additional set of 3 extra side missions possible. Now they are not given to you, but as you move to your next objectives you can pick them up along the way, rewarding you with money and some awesome trinkets and gear.!!! - The game mechanics are also something extremely notable. The way combat is done is fairly simple and straight forward. It is hotkey based but is simplified to the first 7 number keys on your keyboard. You can apply 7 active combat or supportive abilities of which are all really fricking awesome! Along with that, passive abilities (7 of them as well) can be activated as well! This makes loadouts limited, but it allows  you to experiment with combat combinations and permutations.!*!*! -As for the bad parts, there is few to say but the ones that are there are something to note of. Grinding is definitely an aspect of this game, but it doesn't really feel like it as you have much to explore and kill. But repetitive killing will come if you are focusing on acquiring AP and SP points. And there is no Leveling up system, which is pretty cool but it makes guidelines for the newer players hard to follow as they try to progress.!*!*! - The monsters and enemies on this game are a problem as well, especially when trying to get through the storyline. Determining whether you can fight and KILL the monster you are about to engage is hard to predict since there is no definite sign. Fighting something you can't kill is of serious consequence since you have no real ability to flee. The storyline throws you through missions/tiers quickly, meaning you get through the mission faster than your character can keep up with. So you WILL have to grind and wait a bit to be able to kill or fight the monsters coming up in the next section of the mission.!*!*! - The learning curve on this game is also a bit of a moderate level. The interface and hotkey tutorials is easily forgotten so you will have to dock some time into learning it. Understanding some of the combat mechanics such as Resource Pooling and Ability screening can be a bit tricky. Figuring out what your supposed to do, how to get stronger character wise, how to get better clothes and MUCH better gear can also be a bit of an issue for new players unless they delve into some research. Noobies might find it frustrating a bit to figure out what they're doing.The All in All:PROS-The Factions are Illuminati, Templars and Dragons. Awesome in a box.-New and Fresh setting. Set in the Modern Day rather than fairies and Knights in shining armor.-$29.99 is a GREAT price for what you're getting.-Combat is fun and well executed.-Great Mission and Questing opportunities-Graphics won't murder your computer. (CPU may be an issue)-Thousands of different play styles and combat combinations.-Really. Fricking. Fun.CONS-Learning the game is a bit tricky.-Character Development vs Monster Progression is hard to keep up with.-Some might find the game a bit repetitive in combat.(Vary your playstyles as you go through! Don't stick to one or two weapons!)-Most of the ways to make yourself look cool is by paying REAL MONEY. But it is not a requirement. Faction armor is provided.The Verdict, Should you buy this game?YES! For 30 bucks you are getting a SWEET deal. Any MMORPG fan is going to fall in love with this game. The factions are each unique and great! The weapons and magics are all cool and well designed. The quests feel endless. For not subscriptions, this is a MUST BUY! This is definitely a 9/10. I say 9/10 since there are definitely some fixe(not just bugs) and tweaks dearly needed. But otherwise, almost perfect. Get. This. Game.			"

Multiplayer content so I can play with friends? Tick!I love this game and am having a blast. My only concern is that the first couple of hours didnt really do it justice and it wasnt until I got into the first quest zone (Kingsmouth) that it really started to shine.

Well, this is about it.There is no MMO with a story line coming CLOSE to TSW that i could find.  The combat, crafting, et al is fine and nuanced, but i gotta say, if you really want to try an mmo, where you LISTEN to the quest givers because it is actually interesting instead of just trying to fast-forward to what you have to do, i have to say, GET TSW.And the investigation missions are so amazingly hard, if you think you are smart, well this would be a place to prove it.

Explore Kingsmouth (a city mixing Kingsport and Innsmouth from Lovecraft), Egypt and Transsylvania, uncover conspiracies and deal with ancient evils.

												*****VERY IMPORTANT READ ME*****If you go onto Humble Bundle you can buy the ultimate edition for 18$, which includes a HELL of allot more. On The secret worlds website it is 70$ but not on humble bundle. On Steam it cost 30$ ( FOR THE STANDARD EDITION) and all you get is the game and first 4 episodes (which are free..) I wish id known before i bought it, as each episode is like 25$ and there are 15 of them and 11x25 (NOT GOOD FOR YOUR WALLET; 15-4 from the 4 free episodes = 11). The ultimate edition gives you a unique outfit, in game boost, and starter weapons and episodes 5-11 (6 episodes). I do recommened. I heard of this ""Humble Bundle"" From a friend during a dungeon in the game. It's legit, you can google it.Additionally if you already bought the game on steam like me and want to redeem the bundle after purachasing it, you must enter the key code on steam after linking your steam account to humble bundle. Once you activate the code on steam, it will show it as unlocked. You must then go to library --> TSW --> Hover/click/ something (you need to find DC CODE and then copy it. Go to TSW website, activate THAT code onto your account. (NEED HELP? DM ME; i got a bit paranoid at first when i couldnt find my items.)Hope this helps. DEAL IS ONLY AVAIL FOR 6 MORE DAYS (it has a countdown timer). Anyway hope this helps please feel free to read the rest of my review before i bought the bundle P.S Will remove this portion of the review once the bundle is no longer on sale***READ ME/IMPORTANT ABOVE^^**Very fun game with very fun character cuztomization. You can join 3 Factions, Illuminati, Templars, and Dragon. Each are extremely unique and interesting and have all very different vibes to them. The game is not really focused as much on your faction (from what i can tell so far; ive been playing for about a week). Instead, your story is based on ""Episodes"" (i think thats what they are called, and there are around 12 currently out). Each one is focused on something super interesting and different from the next. What i mean, is one episode may be about zombies, while the other about wearwolves, and another about killer clowns). You do get Faction quest as you get promoted ( every episode has an ♥♥♥ load of side quest, main missions, and ""story quest"", which the Xp granted from these qust also go towards your faction rank). Faction quest deal solely with what your faction believes in or is trying to accomplish personally, rather than what another faction is trying to accomplish.Character cuztomization: Very unique, you can change race skin color, tattoos, lots of hairstyles, blemishes/freckles, the eyebrows, jaw line, lips, eye color ECT. You also get to choose starter clothes (which are just regular clothes like hoodie/ tank top, converse shoes). UNFORTUNATELY you CANNOT change the body type.. Which is annoying if you want your character to look like you. You can change their height but not their actual body or fit level. They all ahve the same buff as ♥♥♥♥ ripped body.Purchasing the game: Game cost 30$ comes with first 4 Episodes (my purchase version did at least), but every episode after the 4 you have to buy which I looked at the price seem to be over 20$ PER episode. Character progression: The game is so unique in the way that there are no calsses, rather, every character is different. There are 3 different weapon TYPES: Guns, Melee weapons, and Magic. Each TYPE has 3 more weapon options to choose from. GUNS: Assualt rifle / Dual Pistols / Shotgun Melee: Hammer /Claws (like wolverine claws) / Sword Magic: Elemental magic/  Blood magic / Choas magicEach weapon has its own ROLE. For example, Blood magic can Heal and deal damage, while Shotgun can tank and deal damage. Each weapon has 5/6 different build types geared towarard that weapon. These build types all have different usable abilities and passive abilities, You can mix and match abilities and Passive abilities. Although you can only use blood magic, hamme, pistol, etc IF you are using that weapon. YOU CAN CHOOSE 2 WEAPONS THATS IT (but can switch at any time). Its very fun to choose weapons. Being able to take out hords of zombies with a shotgun then use Elemental magic to take down a boss.DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT buy ANYTHING for your character!! CLOTHES, MOUNTS, PETS NOTHINGGG. I only say this for new players as you will realize your first character will likely be a ♥♥♥♥ up or you simply just do not like the character. There are no levels and there are an INFINITE amount of ability points (which means you can basically unlock every single ability in the game) BUT THIS TAKES A LONG ♥♥♥ TIME TO DO AND it kinda screws you over in the beginning. As in the start of the game you really need to focus on a main weapon or two main weapons to actually get further in the game. The game is hard (actually literally impossible) if you do not do any side quest to gain XP to upgrade your weapons. I recommend trying all kinds of weapons in the starting room (at the start youll get to try every weapon) and take a good ♥♥♥ look of that weapons abilities and your secondary weapons abilities to see if they pair well. You may want to DPS in dungeons, and thats fine, but you wont get far if you are squishy and cant heal yourself during the solo gameplay. I wasted 20$ on clothes and a mount because the character i had sucked, and then i tried questing more to regain ability points to retrain into a new weapon, and it takes to long that at mid start area its kinda too much of a hassal.Faction: Factions are all fun as previously mentioned. IMO Templar seem to be most popular, then illuminati, then dragon. There is also PVP and conquering between each faction.Crafting: You can craft, but what i have seen it does not seem to be super OP weapons or anything, just like alterations. Story: Beyond amazing with great lore, keeps you interested. MMO experience: Seems to be lacking. DEF a large amount of players, and you also pass other players, but you dont seem to really group up with anyone besides with dungeons. No two characters look alike. You can also choose names, first and last name being whatever the hell you want even if someone else already has that name. Then you have like a ""Nickname"" which is literally a middle name except it has to be one no one else has which is what you are in the game data base i think, BUT other characters still see your first and last name. It appears like this.Samuel ""Bigfoot"" Renalds The name in quotation marks is the nickname/middle name and thats how it is ingame as well. Episodes: Episodes are meant to take a long time, so do not try to speed through the episodes. The zombie area for me has lasted a week and i have not yet gotten past to the other episodes quite yet. Cinematics: Has cinematics which is cool and keeps you entertainted, graphics are good but not not 2017 Good. Reminds me of old grand theft auto graphics on PS2.. Which isnt bad.Subsciption: You can buy subsciption 15$ a month but you still have to buy episodes even with VIP. All it does is increase money gain and xp gain and stuff like that (again there are no levels, so really this just makes it easier to get Ability points, which again, is an infinite amount of!). You get VIP rewards based on how many days youve had. 30 days you get an animated walk thing. Like as you run around it leaves a trail of golden honeycomb looking animation behind you. If you buy through steam you also get additional free goodies like shirts and hoodies and stuff (which eventually you wont care about but at first is cool!) OVERALL YES I WOULD PLAY AND BUY AND ALL THATgot lazy and now i dont feel like writing anything else but hey hope this gives insight			"

												I was a big fan of this game on release, but I ended up going back to World of Warcraft because I could not keep up two subscriptions at the same time. Now that the game is subscription free, and absolutely FULL of quality content, this is the perfect time to come back. The game is alive and well, with a vibrant community and constant updates, it's really nice to see.Definitely recommended, quality MMO!			"

												The game story and world building is really amazing. I wish that the main player was voice-acted (I'm spoiled from playing SWTOR and Mass Effect) but for what it is, it's quite good. It does seem to be a bit harder to figure out for new players compared to other MMOs like SWTOR and ESO. Very distinctive and stylish though so an A- overall.			"

												The first MMO I ever played was Anarchy Online, also by Funcom.  I bought it when it was first released and played for years to come.Since I've tried to find an MMO that I felt had as much depth as well as a breathtaking atmosphere and nothing could compare.  That is until I got my mitts on The Secret World (again by Funcom - it appears they got my number).  So, I'll break it down into a few categories outlining my favorite part of this game.Story:One of the largest problems I have with MMOs is that I live in Japan, a time zone that makes it difficult to get online during the busiest hours of play.  Usually when I hop into an MMO is sparsely populated and just finding a team can be nearly impossible.  Therefore, it's necessary that an MMO have a solo experience that is every bit as strong as the multiplayer experience.  On this, The Secret World does not disappoint.  The questing and story mission are some of the best I've ever experienced in any game, much less an MMO.  The number of story missions, main missions and side missions is staggering, but what's even more staggering is that they all interweave into each other, contributing to the overarching story as a whole.  Everything feels connected and it's the most rewarding solo experience in a game I've played to date.Multiplayer:At first, I thought the multiplayer aspect of the game was sorely lacking, but upon joining the Sanctuary chat channel and finally getting powerful enough to start enjoying dungeons, playing with a team really opened up.  Even though there aren't that many dungeons available, they're of the quality that I relish playing them over and over with different teams.  The enjoyment comes not from figuring out the dungeon, but figuring out how best to work with your team members.  You can constantly tweak your build to fill in gaps in your defense or build up your offense.  What this results in is that at the beginning of the dungeon, when the team is still freshly formed, the team is weak.  As you plunder through the dungeon, each member slowly tweaks their build and play style to work well with their teammates and by the time you reach the boss of the dungeon, you're team is working together like a well oiled machine, soaking up hits while dishing out the pain.  Or, if you don't gel well with your team and try to figure out the best way to work together, you all die.Character depth:The reason the multiplayer aspect works so well is because of the depth of the character build system.  There are no classes, you can learn any weapon on the fly.  You can be a healer for a particularly tough fight, but on the easier parts, you can switch over to a damage dealer and help knock the enemies down faster.  Or, you can build a leech healer that steals HP every time you deal damage, creating a nearly indestructible solo build.  The ability wheel at first seemed simple, buy the most expensive abilities and equip those.  You can't think about individual abilities, just like the theme in multiplayer, you have to think about which active abilities and which passive abilities play well with each other.  As you dive deeper into the ability wheel, you start to realize the complexity of it all.  This allows countless different builds and allows you to make a really unique character that tailors perfectly to your play style.  It requires some serious thought though.  I have a stack of notes on my desk of build ideas (some borrowed from others, some my own creation and some blends of the two) that I try out depending on the situation.  Additionally, there is no one universal build.  There is so much diversity in the enemies you come across that sometimes you have to use a completely different build just to survive.  This is by far one of the most rewarding aspects of the game.Atmosphere:Graphics have come a long way since the days of Anarchy Online.  This game is nothing short of gorgeous.  I have a fairly serious PC (Phenom II X6, Radeon HD 1950, 32GB DDR3) and I still only manage an average of 30 FPS, so keep that in mind.  The visuals are stunning and each area has its own unique feel.  Nothing feels like it has been reused or recycled.  But, in a way, this game reminds me of the Stalker series of games.  It's not just about pure graphical power, because in that sense, there are many games out there that can outshine it.  It's about the whole package  The visuals, the sound, the music, it all works in wonderful unison to pull you into the game.  It's so easy to get caught up in the atmosphere and depth that I often found myself completely letting the real world surrounding me dissolve and disappear (much to the chagrin of my significant other).  Community:I've found that the community is even better than the community in Anarchy Online, which is to say, amazing.  The Sanctuary chat channel in particular is a godsend.  Some of the most helpful people I've ever met in a game, I've met in this game.  Everyone is good natured, willing to answer any questions (no matter how menial they may seem), and even help us lowbies battle through some of the more particularly difficult situations.  Getting into a Cabal (the equivalent of a guild or org) is taking the wonderful community and adding in a very strong sense of camaraderie.  The community is always active, helpful, fun and downright pleasant.Overall:If you would have asked me in my first 10 to 15 hours of play what I thought of the game, I would have said it was good but not great.  If you were to ask me now (at just 150 hours in), I would say it's downright amazing.  The game unfolds piece by piece, drawing you in further and further.  If you're looking for a unique gaming experience you can share with thousands of wonderful people, this is your one stop shop.			"

												I honestly am not sure what to write about. I mean, there's a lot that I can write about, but would take quite a bit of time to flesh out. There's a lot of content to this game, and I mean A LOT. The missions have so far almost never been just a purely, ""Go here, kill X amount of this enemy and then come back for your reward."" (You can actually just ""send in a report"" when you're finished instead of returning altogether.) There are missions that have unique requirements to them such as learning the lengths of two songs IRL to find the coordinates for a buried treasure side-mission, figuring out the password of a doctor's computer by using the hints provided, and figuring out the keycode by learning which song the pastor of a church was going to play first on Sunday. The combat gameplay is pretty decent as well. It feels a little stiff in some things you do, but it is overall a good experience. Enemies are also capable of being unique as well in what they do. They can be very unforgiving if you don't figure out your ♥♥♥♥, you can actually die in the tutorial level easily if you don't get your head out of your ♥♥♥.Classes are... class-less. There's no real defined class or set, besides how you decide to build your character. ""Wanna be a glass assassin? Alright! Wanna be a glass healer? Okay! Wanna be a tank assassin? Fine! Tank healer? Healing Tank? Tank Tank? Glass glass? Vampire(Metaphorically speaking)? Sniper? Ninja? Errr.... Vegetable? Cake? Umm... A pile of ♥♥♥♥? Your choice!Abilities work as you need to have the weapon equipped to use that the ability is used by, but you can use every ability and weapon in the game. However, you can only pick 7 active abilities and 2 equipped weapons at a time, but can also change them out whenever you like. You also get to use the passive abilities from the weapons WITHOUT needing to equip the weapon associated with it which you can also switch out whenever you like. You're able to save your ""class"" sets and switch between those so you can make a role switch on the fly.There's 9 weapon types total. Pistols (dual wield), Assault Rifles, Shotguns for the guns. Hammer, Sword, and Fist Weapons for the melee. Blood, Chaos, and Elementalism magic. They all have their own unique abilities and attacks and passives. You can use 2 of any kind whenever you wish in whatever combination. They have their own focuses, as being a DPS, Heal, or Tank focus. You get to pick 2 starter weapons, but you can try out each weapon when you're going through the runthrough with your character.Character Customization is... enough. There's enough there to make your own unique character(s), but then again, there's still more that you want and need to make YOUR OWN character. Enough, but still needs more to make you feel satisfied unless you can get what you're looking for with what there is.Areas are very expansive and full of content. I'm actually still stuck in the first map. I've been able to put about 20 hours into just the first map so far.PvP is actually very balanced. I have been able to deal enough damage to just about nearly kill veterans in the PvP wars with only my starting abilities. (PvP Wars places you on an even playing field in terms of stats, not items or abilities.) PvP war is the only PvP I've played so far, but you can be as weak as a first-timer when you're a veteran since there are not ""Levels"" and ""Classes"".This review will run on even longer if I continue, I will stop here and allow you to make the decision of whether or not you want to make the plunge to buy this game! They also allow TSW buyers to send people 72 Hour keys to play the game for free to see whether you'll like it for yourself! If you know someone with TSW already, ask them to send you a key!My honest opinion: 85/100 (so far).			"

												There is nothing like The Secret World. In a MMO marketplace dominated by fantasy and ""space"" titles, TSW has attempted to do something unusual and has succeeded. The developer, Funcom, has a history of releasing cerebral, out-of-the-box titles and TSW continues this development strategy. While not tied to a single famous IP like Funcom's Age of Conan MMO, TSW reaches into many lesser known or less celebrated genres such as spy (James Bond), explorer (Indiana Jones), and horror and also the works of H.P. Lovecraft, Stephen King, and John Carpenter as well as many conspiracy and secret society tropes found in movies and fiction. The updates to the game are released as Issues (complete with comic book cover art) and the hundreds of game missions are connected as part of a vast, interwoven story which unfolds as the game is played. Fully voiced and animated cut scenes for main missions add to the feel of a film or television series with recurring characters. All of the conventional MMO features are here too with a crafting system, PvP, pets, mounts, raids, and guilds (Cabals) but unlike anything found elsewhere in multiplayer online games. For a new experience intended for an adult audience, play The Secret World.			"

												I can't tell if I hate The Secret World or love it, it has really nice story telling, solid combat and intriquing locations, but it plays on the perfectionist, you'll never find the ""perfect"" build because there's so many abilties and combinations to mix around with in the games ""deck"" creator (Essentially a create your own class) but you can't be one thing, tanks and healers NEED a dps build to get through the story or swap to something like a Heal Tank or Leech Healing (IE: Stealing health from the enemy using DPS and redistrubiting it to your team or yourself) as someone who wants to always be at their peak, it's infuriating finding a deck that feels nice but just doesn't have the DPS or heals, and with the announcement of Funcom being up for sale, it's a risky buy but I'd still recommend it, if nothing else, for the storyline. and you WILL need the expansions for this (called Issue's) as the game's story heavily relies on them so do yourself a favor and get the ultimate edition.

												Excellent game if you are in to conspiracy theories, horror(zombies,vampires,ghouls etc).  A good story that is mostly narrated in cut scenes.  If you are not too fussed about pvp and enjoy running around doing single player type missions and bumping in to a few other players now and then, and maybe doing a dungeon or two, if you can get the team, then give this game a go.  If you know someone who already has the game ask them for a free 3 day pass to check out the game, you will know within a couple of hours if this is the game for you. If you think there are too many 'ifs' in this review, you may need to ask yourself, 'IF it was worth reading all the way to the end'			"

												At this point I have only played through the first area (Kingsmouth).  I have to say that this is quite possibly the best mmo I have ever played.  I'm not exaggerating.  It's not perfect, but so many things are done right it's amazing.  The skill/ability system, the gear, the quest system, atmosphere, story, and don't even get me going on the voice acting; I'll just say it is by far the best of any game I've played, escpecially mmos.  The combat is similar to GW2 or DDO, where it's action oriented with no auto-attack but you have a target; well, soft-target since it targets whatever is closest unless you lock the target. This game is so good I wish they would overhaul Anarchy Online and use the same quest, skill, and ability system; it would fit there perfectly, and they already ported it to the same game engine.  If wishes were dollars I'd be a billionaire.			"

												There really is no class and you choose what ability you want from a really long list but because of that you need to understand what all of those ability do and dont do, what i mean by that is that choosing a set of ability that is not trash to play with is a pain to do because there is so much to learn, unless ofcourse you find a build made by somebody else and you use it instead of making your own but i always found that this never really feel right to me since it was made for somebody else play style. While there really is no class the traditional role of healer/tank/dps still exist and are needed in group play, you can make a hybrid ofcourse but they have the same problem as hybrid in other game, they dont excel in a single role.Puzzle/enigma solving seem to be common in this game.The story is often important in this game to solve puzzle to make progress in the story and it sometime need information from the real world to be solved, they tried to merge the two so much that you even have access to an internet browser ingame that take you to the real internet and you need to search for information from the real world to solve some of the puzzle/enigma.Those are the biggest difference that i saw in the few hours i played but since i was looking for a mmo that is more friendly to casual gamer than this i stopped playing.So if you want a mmo with a lot of ability customization possiblity and that the dev try to ""merge"" with the real world this is for you. It too bad there is not a trial version for those that are not sure to like it or if this is what they want.			"

For a long time I wanted to play this game, before it came out I was super pumped to play, after it arrived Life situations lead me away from gaming but soon a gnawing feeling came back I kept looking up this game wondering about it. After playing it I was hooked I played for all 32 hours straight I was sickened by the amount I played and time and energy put into the game. So I put it down immersed myself in school and family and yet...and yet I never forgot about it or stopped thinking about The Secret World... now 8 months later I have returned and I feel this time I wont stop...

												This game is mindblowing. I have been playing mmos since UO, and I seriously started to think that the mmorpg genre can't show me anything new. I was wrong, and this game gave me back my faith. We can often meet with the expression of a game having no ""level system"" which is always untrue, only the hardcore fanboys/girls believe it strongly. In a hidden way there is always a level system. However in the case of The Secret World my statement is only partially true! You get XP, and by reaching the right amount you get one of the two types of points. One type is used to purchase skills, one is to level up the abilities needed to wear better stuff. So basically if you want to equip endgame items, you need more xp, so thats paralel to a leveling system, since a new character cannot equip lvl 10 talismans for eg. but pretty much that's it. The skill system is amazing! Confusig at first sight, but in reality it's so simple, yet refreshing and new. And there are lots of skills. Lots, but not overwhelmingly lot. Amazing flexibility, you can really mix anything with anything, you can mix guns with magic or meelee weapons, no matter what you choose, if you choose the right skills for your 2 weapons, you will be succesful.The story is awesome. The game is filled with cutscenes, everything is fully and nicely voiced. You can skip them though. If you hate the ""next-next-next-accept-close-next-next"" type of games, you'll loooove this one. If you love stories, you'll love this one. Why? Because accepting a quest is EASY. 2 clicks, open and accept. And you know what type of quest is that from it's color and icon, even before opening it. If you want it's story, you'll have a cutscene. You don't like it? Just skip it, and go. You don't have to wait. Story maniacs, like I am can find many NPC to interact with with a small symbol. If you ask them, they will tell you stories and information. Again: fully voiced.Sounds are awesome. Period. What about the music? Astonishing! Beautiful. Period. The kind of music which I can listen outside the game, too. Soundeffects are also super. Graphically the game is nice, and runs smoothly on almost max graphs on my few year old, veeeeeryfar from atomic-high-über gaming PC. It has surprisingly few errors. I only found one so far, my sword sometimes goes trough my character's arm, which is pretty good comparing to other mmos (WoW: worgen's fur vs armor, rings a bell to anyone?).As for the atmosphere... AMAZING. Gloomy, but not depressing, apocalypic feeling, cool horror monsters and some quests really bring the true horror feeling. Also the game has brutally CHALLENGING (I mean it!!!) puzzles, if you are as clever and educated like me, you'll only need the chat or the game's ingame internet browser (yeah, for obvious reasons they made one) 50-70% of the time. From deciphering morse codes, to translating latin texts, to finding things in a Bible, realizing a painter's or a composer's name, there are tons of things which gives you the feeling that you're inside of a treasure hunting movie with a freemasonic theme.This game is pure genious. Some monsters become repetitive after a while, it's a common mmo sickness. Luckily you can choose to start another type of quest instead, if you don't want to butcher anymore, and when you would get too tired of the monsters, you'll be sent to the next areas.My biggest problem so far was the fact, that I haven't bought the game with all issues, while on sale, since you can't get them without the game on steam. Now I'll have to buy them for a full price. No, seriously my biggest problem with the game is that you cannot drop a quest. If you want to pause it, you'll have to take another from the same type of quest to take it's place. (There are a certain number of quests from each type that you can have at a time.) But the thing I like in it: if you pause a quest, and later return to take it again, you can continue it from the point you've abandoned it: most quests have steps called tiers, and after completing each tier, you get XP, and after completing the whole line, you'll get the final q reward.If you love mmos, buy it. If you love mystery games buy it. If you love horror, at least watch some gameplay videos! If you prefer gore/guro style things maybe it's not for you, but if you like mild horror too, you'll love it. There were some moments which gave me chills, and in one case I even screamed (:blushes:).			"

												Probably one of the most interesting single player games that I've played so far. But seriously, if d20 Call of Cthulhu (with a non-sadistic DM, of course) was an MMO, this would be it. Considering that it's only $30 when not on sale and that you can easily get over a hundred *fun* hours off of it (which, sadly, my steam profile doesn't reflect since I originally played before I realized that TSW was on steam) and that on sale it could even go down to $5, I can't recommend it more. Long story short:-Kinda bad combat system that takes some getting used to-Cutscenes before a lot of quests (when the quest giver is human, of course)-Long story quest that gives you an actual reason to go to the different zones (unlike a certain game made by blizzard)-Non level-based experience system (you still gain experience, but you get a certain number of ability points or skill points after a set amount of experience that never increases; you get to choose where the points go, rather than being what the game wants you to be. Sandbox elements too good.)-HOLY ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥ THE INVESTIGATION MISSION. THE ♥♥♥♥ING IMMERSION IS STUPIDLY GOOD.-Press b to bring up a functional internet brower in-game (which is used for a lot of quests)-The amount of effort put in by the devs is too damn high (http://www.kingsmouth.com/ = the website for the first town you go to. There are twitter accounts for important characters, and other websites for important companies)-Immersion immersion immersion-Stuff-Things-If its on sale, buy it-etcYes, I recommend this. It might not have taken 5000+ hours out of my life like Maplestory or WoW, but I'll be damned if TSW isn't a good $30 game. Also, no subscription needed. "

												*****VERY IMPORTANT READ ME*****If you go onto Humble Bundle you can buy the ultimate edition for 18$, which includes a HELL of allot more. On The secret worlds website it is 70$ but not on humble bundle. On Steam it cost 30$ ( FOR THE STANDARD EDITION) and all you get is the game and first 4 episodes (which are free..) I wish id known before i bought it, as each episode is like 25$ and there are 15 of them and 11x25 (NOT GOOD FOR YOUR WALLET; 15-4 from the 4 free episodes = 11). The ultimate edition gives you a unique outfit, in game boost, and starter weapons and episodes 5-11 (6 episodes). I do recommened. I heard of this ""Humble Bundle"" From a friend during a dungeon in the game. It's legit, you can google it.Additionally if you already bought the game on steam like me and want to redeem the bundle after purachasing it, you must enter the key code on steam after linking your steam account to humble bundle. Once you activate the code on steam, it will show it as unlocked. You must then go to library --> TSW --> Hover/click/ something (you need to find DC CODE and then copy it. Go to TSW website, activate THAT code onto your account. (NEED HELP? DM ME; i got a bit paranoid at first when i couldnt find my items.)Hope this helps. DEAL IS ONLY AVAIL FOR 6 MORE DAYS (it has a countdown timer). Anyway hope this helps please feel free to read the rest of my review before i bought the bundle P.S Will remove this portion of the review once the bundle is no longer on sale***READ ME/IMPORTANT ABOVE^^**Very fun game with very fun character cuztomization. You can join 3 Factions, Illuminati, Templars, and Dragon. Each are extremely unique and interesting and have all very different vibes to them. The game is not really focused as much on your faction (from what i can tell so far; ive been playing for about a week). Instead, your story is based on ""Episodes"" (i think thats what they are called, and there are around 12 currently out). Each one is focused on something super interesting and different from the next. What i mean, is one episode may be about zombies, while the other about wearwolves, and another about killer clowns). You do get Faction quest as you get promoted ( every episode has an ♥♥♥ load of side quest, main missions, and ""story quest"", which the Xp granted from these qust also go towards your faction rank). Faction quest deal solely with what your faction believes in or is trying to accomplish personally, rather than what another faction is trying to accomplish.Character cuztomization: Very unique, you can change race skin color, tattoos, lots of hairstyles, blemishes/freckles, the eyebrows, jaw line, lips, eye color ECT. You also get to choose starter clothes (which are just regular clothes like hoodie/ tank top, converse shoes). UNFORTUNATELY you CANNOT change the body type.. Which is annoying if you want your character to look like you. You can change their height but not their actual body or fit level. They all ahve the same buff as ♥♥♥♥ ripped body.Purchasing the game: Game cost 30$ comes with first 4 Episodes (my purchase version did at least), but every episode after the 4 you have to buy which I looked at the price seem to be over 20$ PER episode. Character progression: The game is so unique in the way that there are no calsses, rather, every character is different. There are 3 different weapon TYPES: Guns, Melee weapons, and Magic. Each TYPE has 3 more weapon options to choose from. GUNS: Assualt rifle / Dual Pistols / Shotgun Melee: Hammer /Claws (like wolverine claws) / Sword Magic: Elemental magic/  Blood magic / Choas magicEach weapon has its own ROLE. For example, Blood magic can Heal and deal damage, while Shotgun can tank and deal damage. Each weapon has 5/6 different build types geared towarard that weapon. These build types all have different usable abilities and passive abilities, You can mix and match abilities and Passive abilities. Although you can only use blood magic, hamme, pistol, etc IF you are using that weapon. YOU CAN CHOOSE 2 WEAPONS THATS IT (but can switch at any time). Its very fun to choose weapons. Being able to take out hords of zombies with a shotgun then use Elemental magic to take down a boss.DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT buy ANYTHING for your character!! CLOTHES, MOUNTS, PETS NOTHINGGG. I only say this for new players as you will realize your first character will likely be a ♥♥♥♥ up or you simply just do not like the character. There are no levels and there are an INFINITE amount of ability points (which means you can basically unlock every single ability in the game) BUT THIS TAKES A LONG ♥♥♥ TIME TO DO AND it kinda screws you over in the beginning. As in the start of the game you really need to focus on a main weapon or two main weapons to actually get further in the game. The game is hard (actually literally impossible) if you do not do any side quest to gain XP to upgrade your weapons. I recommend trying all kinds of weapons in the starting room (at the start youll get to try every weapon) and take a good ♥♥♥ look of that weapons abilities and your secondary weapons abilities to see if they pair well. You may want to DPS in dungeons, and thats fine, but you wont get far if you are squishy and cant heal yourself during the solo gameplay. I wasted 20$ on clothes and a mount because the character i had sucked, and then i tried questing more to regain ability points to retrain into a new weapon, and it takes to long that at mid start area its kinda too much of a hassal.Faction: Factions are all fun as previously mentioned. IMO Templar seem to be most popular, then illuminati, then dragon. There is also PVP and conquering between each faction.Crafting: You can craft, but what i have seen it does not seem to be super OP weapons or anything, just like alterations. Story: Beyond amazing with great lore, keeps you interested. MMO experience: Seems to be lacking. DEF a large amount of players, and you also pass other players, but you dont seem to really group up with anyone besides with dungeons. No two characters look alike. You can also choose names, first and last name being whatever the hell you want even if someone else already has that name. Then you have like a ""Nickname"" which is literally a middle name except it has to be one no one else has which is what you are in the game data base i think, BUT other characters still see your first and last name. It appears like this.Samuel ""Bigfoot"" Renalds The name in quotation marks is the nickname/middle name and thats how it is ingame as well. Episodes: Episodes are meant to take a long time, so do not try to speed through the episodes. The zombie area for me has lasted a week and i have not yet gotten past to the other episodes quite yet. Cinematics: Has cinematics which is cool and keeps you entertainted, graphics are good but not not 2017 Good. Reminds me of old grand theft auto graphics on PS2.. Which isnt bad.Subsciption: You can buy subsciption 15$ a month but you still have to buy episodes even with VIP. All it does is increase money gain and xp gain and stuff like that (again there are no levels, so really this just makes it easier to get Ability points, which again, is an infinite amount of!). You get VIP rewards based on how many days youve had. 30 days you get an animated walk thing. Like as you run around it leaves a trail of golden honeycomb looking animation behind you. If you buy through steam you also get additional free goodies like shirts and hoodies and stuff (which eventually you wont care about but at first is cool!) OVERALL YES I WOULD PLAY AND BUY AND ALL THATgot lazy and now i dont feel like writing anything else but hey hope this gives insight			"

												I was a big fan of this game on release, but I ended up going back to World of Warcraft because I could not keep up two subscriptions at the same time. Now that the game is subscription free, and absolutely FULL of quality content, this is the perfect time to come back. The game is alive and well, with a vibrant community and constant updates, it's really nice to see.Definitely recommended, quality MMO!			"

												The game story and world building is really amazing. I wish that the main player was voice-acted (I'm spoiled from playing SWTOR and Mass Effect) but for what it is, it's quite good. It does seem to be a bit harder to figure out for new players compared to other MMOs like SWTOR and ESO. Very distinctive and stylish though so an A- overall.			"

												For what it's worth, the base game of Secret World is fun and very immersive. It's also great fun to co-op. However, the end game content is lacking. There's not much point in having alts since you can easily respect your character. Plus, the ""missions"" for each faction can be are terribly frustrating so once you get through you'll be hard pressed to ever want to do them again. Dungeon running is fun but it takes a lot of time and practice to get the hand of it and with each new issue (what... I already paid and now I have to pay again!?) you'll find yourself further and further behind.			"

												I first experienced The Secret World at PAX 2012 when they had a small demo available to play.  While there I got some Illuminati dog tags and a free code to try out the beta when it became available.  Well, I did the beta and fell in love with the game.  The combat system can be challenging as it gives the player free reign, you can use whatever weapons and skills you want, you can tank, heal tank, dps, heal, or heal by causing damage (leech heal).  The storyline is the best of any game I have ever played.  If you love story driven games, this is the game for you!  The incorporate lore and stories from all over the world, the in-game lore items are an amazing read and gives you some insight into the NPCs you encounter.  Overall, its a great game, optimization is the only downside to this game as running DX11 can cause random crashes and frame drops.  On DX 9 it's still graphically good, but fps can still be an issue.			"

												This game is mindblowing. I have been playing mmos since UO, and I seriously started to think that the mmorpg genre can't show me anything new. I was wrong, and this game gave me back my faith. We can often meet with the expression of a game having no ""level system"" which is always untrue, only the hardcore fanboys/girls believe it strongly. In a hidden way there is always a level system. However in the case of The Secret World my statement is only partially true! You get XP, and by reaching the right amount you get one of the two types of points. One type is used to purchase skills, one is to level up the abilities needed to wear better stuff. So basically if you want to equip endgame items, you need more xp, so thats paralel to a leveling system, since a new character cannot equip lvl 10 talismans for eg. but pretty much that's it. The skill system is amazing! Confusig at first sight, but in reality it's so simple, yet refreshing and new. And there are lots of skills. Lots, but not overwhelmingly lot. Amazing flexibility, you can really mix anything with anything, you can mix guns with magic or meelee weapons, no matter what you choose, if you choose the right skills for your 2 weapons, you will be succesful.The story is awesome. The game is filled with cutscenes, everything is fully and nicely voiced. You can skip them though. If you hate the ""next-next-next-accept-close-next-next"" type of games, you'll loooove this one. If you love stories, you'll love this one. Why? Because accepting a quest is EASY. 2 clicks, open and accept. And you know what type of quest is that from it's color and icon, even before opening it. If you want it's story, you'll have a cutscene. You don't like it? Just skip it, and go. You don't have to wait. Story maniacs, like I am can find many NPC to interact with with a small symbol. If you ask them, they will tell you stories and information. Again: fully voiced.Sounds are awesome. Period. What about the music? Astonishing! Beautiful. Period. The kind of music which I can listen outside the game, too. Soundeffects are also super. Graphically the game is nice, and runs smoothly on almost max graphs on my few year old, veeeeeryfar from atomic-high-über gaming PC. It has surprisingly few errors. I only found one so far, my sword sometimes goes trough my character's arm, which is pretty good comparing to other mmos (WoW: worgen's fur vs armor, rings a bell to anyone?).As for the atmosphere... AMAZING. Gloomy, but not depressing, apocalypic feeling, cool horror monsters and some quests really bring the true horror feeling. Also the game has brutally CHALLENGING (I mean it!!!) puzzles, if you are as clever and educated like me, you'll only need the chat or the game's ingame internet browser (yeah, for obvious reasons they made one) 50-70% of the time. From deciphering morse codes, to translating latin texts, to finding things in a Bible, realizing a painter's or a composer's name, there are tons of things which gives you the feeling that you're inside of a treasure hunting movie with a freemasonic theme.This game is pure genious. Some monsters become repetitive after a while, it's a common mmo sickness. Luckily you can choose to start another type of quest instead, if you don't want to butcher anymore, and when you would get too tired of the monsters, you'll be sent to the next areas.My biggest problem so far was the fact, that I haven't bought the game with all issues, while on sale, since you can't get them without the game on steam. Now I'll have to buy them for a full price. No, seriously my biggest problem with the game is that you cannot drop a quest. If you want to pause it, you'll have to take another from the same type of quest to take it's place. (There are a certain number of quests from each type that you can have at a time.) But the thing I like in it: if you pause a quest, and later return to take it again, you can continue it from the point you've abandoned it: most quests have steps called tiers, and after completing each tier, you get XP, and after completing the whole line, you'll get the final q reward.If you love mmos, buy it. If you love mystery games buy it. If you love horror, at least watch some gameplay videos! If you prefer gore/guro style things maybe it's not for you, but if you like mild horror too, you'll love it. There were some moments which gave me chills, and in one case I even screamed (:blushes:).			"

												There really is no class and you choose what ability you want from a really long list but because of that you need to understand what all of those ability do and dont do, what i mean by that is that choosing a set of ability that is not trash to play with is a pain to do because there is so much to learn, unless ofcourse you find a build made by somebody else and you use it instead of making your own but i always found that this never really feel right to me since it was made for somebody else play style. While there really is no class the traditional role of healer/tank/dps still exist and are needed in group play, you can make a hybrid ofcourse but they have the same problem as hybrid in other game, they dont excel in a single role.Puzzle/enigma solving seem to be common in this game.The story is often important in this game to solve puzzle to make progress in the story and it sometime need information from the real world to be solved, they tried to merge the two so much that you even have access to an internet browser ingame that take you to the real internet and you need to search for information from the real world to solve some of the puzzle/enigma.Those are the biggest difference that i saw in the few hours i played but since i was looking for a mmo that is more friendly to casual gamer than this i stopped playing.So if you want a mmo with a lot of ability customization possiblity and that the dev try to ""merge"" with the real world this is for you. It too bad there is not a trial version for those that are not sure to like it or if this is what they want.			"

												I throughly Enjoy this game once in awhile, I played it alot just when it was released, ran Endgame content, which, while buggy as hell, was fun to do, Abilities, Spells, Passives, and Aux weapons are all fun to play with and make weird crazy synergies, and quite honestly, if it weren't because I mostly play games with friends to have fun, and none of them seems to like this game, I'd probably have more then 5000 hours by now.The story is pretty catchy if you actually read into the quests, or just watch the cutscenes unfold, there are some funny and some interresting NPCs and characters in general, I like the gear system, and loved the Fashion system, you can look however you want and not have it mess with stats at all, and planning and synergizing skill and strategies with allies in Dungeons, and Raids, aswell as Nightmare areas, are really fun, (though you do get groups that don't communicate at all, but that's the same in all games).The UI is wank, and the game is still to this day riddled with bugs, though it's alot less bad then during release, and getting higher up in gear level can be tedious to start with, but it has alot of good qualities that overshadow its flaws for me, and what problems the game has, I can live with.Would I recommend this game to people?Well, ask yourself, do you like a deep skill system can allows synergies between weapons and spells you didn't even realise were there? Yes? WellDo you bother following the narative of a games story as you progress through it? Yes?Do you like quests that challenge you, not nessesarily your character in the game, but you as a player, that have to sit down and actually do some research to get on with certain quests? Yes to this too?Well does the game being buggy at times put you off, that said alot of it is minor now, and you can usualy work around it? If it doesn't put you off from a game, then absolutly I'd recommend it! It's a great game and very fun to mess with, Builds, Dungeons, and some pretty interresting quets await ahead in this game.All this said, I'll mention that the game does have PvP, but I'm not much of a PvP'er so I've barely touched it, it seemed okayish to me, but my guess it that there are probably 2-5 builds that completely dominate the PvP Areas, and that if you don't play those that you won't do too well, but I don't know for sure, this review is all from the PvE aspect of the game for me.

For a long time I wanted to play this game, before it came out I was super pumped to play, after it arrived Life situations lead me away from gaming but soon a gnawing feeling came back I kept looking up this game wondering about it. After playing it I was hooked I played for all 32 hours straight I was sickened by the amount I played and time and energy put into the game. So I put it down immersed myself in school and family and yet...and yet I never forgot about it or stopped thinking about The Secret World... now 8 months later I have returned and I feel this time I wont stop...

												Despite it's age, this game has some amazing voice acting, Is very solo friendly, and a large amount of Lore pulled from the real world to mess around with. Grinding can be a bit dull at points but I find it easy to ignore as they're far apart. Finally the 30 dollar entry fee can feel a bit steep this far out from relese, especially since there are DLC that cost around $25 a piece. There's a membership option, but that isn't so cheap either. I may be griping over nothing but I feel with these particular transactions that I'm dealing with a freemium without the free entry.			"

												Definitely the best MMORPG I have ever played.  Entirely devoid of your average generic ""go pick this plant, kill 10 of these mobs, and escort this snail paced sissy lala to his moms house"" type quests...the missions are incredibly intelligent, immersive, like a good book you can't put down, and have a Lovecraftian atmosphere.  If you want to put your brain on auto-pilot and mindlessly hack and slash mobs, then this is not the game for you...you HAVE to use your brain.     You can be any role on one character, because you can learn all of the skills, unlock all of the weapons, and get all of the gear, all on the same character.  Weapons range from wolverine like fist claws, to assault rifles and different melee, range, and magical types.  Reading the passive skills, and learning what weapons/skills/talismans to use in different situations is the key to your survival...you'll do a lot of learning from mistakes, that's for sure.       This game also has one of THE most helpful communities I have ever experienced on any game, and I have made a lot of good friends here.  My wishlist is forever stocked with special Collector Editions, Issues, and other DLC for the game, as I have fallen in love, and I definitely recommend it to anyone who thinks it sounds interesting.  Also a game that is best played with a friend, and I also recommend joining a cabal (guilds in game)  If you do join, I'm on the Arcadia server, I'm a Templar (one of three factions) and my IGN is Jennory, I'll help you with any questions you may have :D			"

												The Secret World is an amazing game.  The game puts a new spin on the mmorpg genre while still keeping with familiar gameplay mechanics.  This game does not hold your hand, in fact it barely helps you at all, and I love it.  There are no levels, instead you gain skills through experience that are weapon based, and you can use as many weapons as you want, switching entire gear sets on the fly, changing up your gear, as well as your active and passive skill sets.  The setting is very dark, with a ton of different monsters to slay and the tiered questing system is also very cool.  The devs are still involved and very active, the community is actually really great, and the game caters to solo and group play, so whatever your style you can find your niche in The Secret World.  If you enjoy mmo's or rpg's this game is for you.			"

So far I've been surprised positively and I think it was well worth the 29EUR price.It's not the basic MMORPG with tons of quickbars filled with skills - you can only have 7 active and 7 passive skill memorised at time, but you can still learn everything and adjust your build from the fly to go well with your party members. Someone compared it like having every soul tree open in Rift, but only 14 skills at a time.Game world is beautiful, just like in Age of Conan. (Funcom knows how to do nice eye candy) I'm liking the story telling and videos, not just walls of text tossed to your screen. Quests and puzzles are actually fun, very different compared to the regular ""kill 40 creeps"", though there IS lots of killing to be done. :)Guns, swords and spells in modern time - a nice change from the ever so boring fantasy theme!

												If you ignore the click-click-click combat, the strangers spouting specialized acronyms, the clutter of semi-opaque inventory windows... you will find puzzles. Glorious puzzles. And when I say puzzles, I mean it in the true sense of the word: these are enigmas designed to test your ingenuity. You will need to pay attention, write things down, reasearch, translate, sketch, stretch, shower, stew, contemplate, contemplate, contemplate, and even then you might not be able to put everything together. But when you do, oh! Such a sense of accomplishment. I have never experienced a game as stimulating and rewarding as this.			"

												The Secret World is an amazing game.  The game puts a new spin on the mmorpg genre while still keeping with familiar gameplay mechanics.  This game does not hold your hand, in fact it barely helps you at all, and I love it.  There are no levels, instead you gain skills through experience that are weapon based, and you can use as many weapons as you want, switching entire gear sets on the fly, changing up your gear, as well as your active and passive skill sets.  The setting is very dark, with a ton of different monsters to slay and the tiered questing system is also very cool.  The devs are still involved and very active, the community is actually really great, and the game caters to solo and group play, so whatever your style you can find your niche in The Secret World.  If you enjoy mmo's or rpg's this game is for you.			"

												10/10 I'm usually not a fan of MMORPGsIt's hard to find one worth playing with a good crowd of decent folks.This game is an MMO with a surprisingly low number of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.It's also an awesome game in and of itself, with plenty to keep you busy.The RPG aspect revolves around all the campfire stories being true. Cthulhu waits beneath the ocean, vampires roam Transylvania, the Mummy will rise, and an abandoned theme park will be full of rides come alive and deadly zombies. You can play solo through most of the game, or you can join a group. Otherwise you can wander round helping out other players at random. That's right, people can rely on the kindness of strangers. Folks are right neighbourly around these parts. The mechanics set this up because there's nothing to lose by buffing or healing a random and no attacking PCs outside the PvP areas (which give you strong warnings and a countdown before you become a target, there are no accidental fights.)

												The story is something I'd like to see. I wish there were more MMOs with a horror theme and a real-world setting.But this is one I cannot enjoy. There's a lot of 'stealth' and timing elements that are very hard, impossible for me. There's a lot of frustration looking for well-hidden and hard to find objects. Every mission is repeatable and I find myself doing the same ones over and over instead of finding new ones. It gets boring.Combat is weak compared to other MMO games and the character development system gives the illusion of free will but really traps you into buying a set of skills with synergies or else having a terribly innefective character.It's hard to get a group together and the world looks vacant with very few other players.I'm disappointed in my purchase and will be going back to LotRO. That being said, I'm sure there' an audience for this game. Just be aware that it's got a very high element of a scavenger hunt. It's complicated, rather than complex, and a lot of times it's east to be totally lost as to where to go or what to do next.			"

												There're no good nor bad MMOs. Every MMO is tailored for different kind of people, some MMOs focus on storytelling, some on good combat, role-playing, trading and crafting. I never recommend MMOs, I just say what I like/dislike, because in the end, it's all about personal preferences. I gotta say that The Secret World is a pretty good game. But I did not like it.I've played the game for 10ish hours, which is not nearly enough to fully understand an MMO, but it's enough to grasp the basics and realize if I like the game or not.Let me tell you how I felt during my time playing.So right after I clicked the character creation button, 3 factions popped up - Illuminati, Templars, Dragon (which is some Chinese organization?) - and I got to see a video for each one, showing me what's their ideology. I picked Illumati as they seemed the most appealing to me. Cinematic rolls in, recapitulating what happened during the last week. Long story short - a bee flew in my mouth, gave me super powers and apparently now some weird energy bursts out of me from time to time (not in a sexual way). Alright, the story is a little bit odd, but let's run with it. After 10 mins of high-quality cinematic experience, I have sudden need to go pick my laundry. I meet this Russian guy, let's call him cousin Roman - and he tells me he's being watched by the Illuminati, I look around and soon find their base located nearby in an old building (not so super secret afterall eh?). All of a sudden I'm being dragged by some guys, screen goes dark and when I wake up, an Einstein-looking mofo greets me, I go through briefing and finally get to weapon selection room, where I picked two of 9 possible weapons. Up until now I was actually fine with what was happening, despite the fact that the story might not be the best one ever. What really throws me off is how all the weapon animations and poses look like - one of the main things, that make me interested in an MMO, is how I feel when playing my character - it doesn't matter whether I play as a cute anime chick or a muscular man. Or a muscular anime chick. Whatever it is, I just want to feel like a bonafide badass and The Secret World has the exact opposite effect - I made a pretty cool-looking character, but after I got to try out the weapons, I felt like a cringey, awkward neckbeard weaboo warrior. The pistols don't even aim at their target, I just shoot them in random directions and the bullets land regardless, the swords remind me of The Blade[imgur.com] meme and the magic... why even put magic in such a mature, modern world? It's all such an odd mashup, as if the developer was trying to put in as many different combat styles as possible, but I really don't think it's necessary.Alright, weird story and awkward animations, I can live with that. After that I went through a portal thingy and got ported into a heaven-like place with a bunch of giants chilling around. Scratch the mature, modern world, forget I ever said that. We full fantasy now. I went through another portal and found myself in a post-apocalyptic world, where human survivors fight zombies and finally got a taste of combat, gotta say it was a bitter taste. At this point I have 4 abilities, 2 for each weapon type, which would be fine, if only there was at least some synergy between them - but there wasn't. I could mash the same single-target button, switch it out with an aoe button from time to time, but I didn't feel like it makes any difference. Also my buttons felt unresponsive, like every ability needs to finish its animation before I can do stuff, which I'm not a fan of either. As my next ability, I picked a drone, not only did it not synergize with my kit at all, it also seemed to be completely useless. This combat just doesn't make me feel like a badass at all, it makes me feel lame, slow and bored. It's just not fluid enough, not fun for me. Instead of being a god among humans, I'm a weaboo neckbeard gun-wielding ninja warrior.I really like the quest system, you can find quests pretty much wherever you go, no giant exclamation marks above NPC heads, you just talk to them, or find a random item laying around in the world and voilá quest started. I also gotta compliment the crafting system, which involves disassembling and assembling all kinds of items. Character customization is also well done and the game doesn't seem to be pay-to-win. However, I can't play without a combat system that I'd enjoy, that's the dealbreaker for me.Ever since WoW's Cataclysm, I've been desperately trying to find an MMO that would fit my tastes, played over 25 different ones. Is The Secret World ""the one""? Unlikely. I might give it another shot, perhaps the combat gets better eventually, but at this point I say no, I still like WoW more, even though I don't really like it. Gotta love WoW. And hate it. Eat donkey d, Blizzard. "

												Amazing game. It's an MMO that plays like a single player game, and the atmosphere and lore are incredibly immersive and detailed. I read that, in some areas, you will hardly ever see any other players (by design) in order to enhance the player's immersion in the environment. Pretty kickass. The Ultimate Edition is a great deal in terms of value, so if you're thinking about buying TSW and wondering which version to get, pick the Ultimate Edition. You'll save a bunch of money on the other issues (storylines) in the long run: you get issues 1-4 with the base game, but you get issues 1-11 with the Ultimate Edition. You also get 30 days of membership, 1200 bonus Funcom points (which you can use to buy issue 12 or 13 if you felt like it), an exclusive outfit, some other items, and a bonus game key for the standard edition of the game that you can give to a friend. It really is worth it to get the Ultimate Edition over the base game.			"

												TSW gives an interesting spin on the Fantasy genre by placing it in a modern setting rather than the classical Middle Ages theme.  It bares more resemblance to a Lovecraftian horror than a Tolkien work, dubbed by my friends ""Call of Cthulu; the video game"" (even if only few parts have sanity meter mechanics).Settings include a small town in New England overrun by undead, a city in Egypt fighting against a new uprising of one of its ancient foes, and a series of post-Soviet occupation Trannsylvanian towns besieged by vampires and werewolves.The foes run the gambit from classic design to compleately reimagined, whatever needed to fit into a modern setting.  Zombies in track suits, golems made of scrap metal, cultist in hoodies, and vampires covered in parkas and gas masks (to protect themselves from the sun, duh), scuttling wendigo, sloshing dragur, glowing will-o-wisps and more.Characters are distinct and memorable, with NPCs that will make you laugh audibly, cry physically, and moments that will make you go ""what the f###?!?""  Every one of my friends who have played this game have a favorite, and a least favorite, character.  Dialogue is well written, better than some TV shows.Quests vary between standard assult and dungeon missions that require slaying of hordes of mosters (or one big one), sabotage missions that require tact and subterfuge, and research missions that involve extensive out-of-game study.I cannot emphasise the awesomeness of research missions enough; they are incredible in-depth puzzles and can make you do anything from learn arabic to visit game-based websites on the real world internet to scribble notes about demon runes like a madman.  The lazy can simply Google search for a walkthrough, but those who enjoy mystery will have a blast connecting the dots.As a MMO RPG, it still suffers the stanard MMO RPG flaws; other players mercing your tagets before you can reach them, small pools of active players looking for group for the dungeon you want to run, nessicerey grinding to become strong enough to handle the next area, player characters in gaudy outfits providing jarring contrast to the scenery, the silent protagonist, and so on.  However, these flaws don't detract significantly rom the game.When all is said and down, I would recomend this game to any fan of modern fantasy.			"

												This game is great.  The story and quest writing is excellent.  The puzzles actually require you to think.  I'm enjoying everything about this game.  It actually has some difficulty to the game, which I like.  Many MMO players may find this to be a turn-off since I constantly see people whining about difficulty in MMOs and almost all MMOs now hold the hands of all the cry babies out there.To address the biggest complaint I see people make about this game.  The combat is action bar based...  why is it such a big deal that the game isn't ""innovative"" in 1 aspect?  The most popular MMO in the world has action bar based combat, so obviously it doesn't make or break a game.  Plus, this game makes you think about how to level your character and equip abilities, unlike many other MMOs.  The number of combinations of active and passive abilities is huge and gives you so many possibilities. "

												TSW gives an interesting spin on the Fantasy genre by placing it in a modern setting rather than the classical Middle Ages theme.  It bares more resemblance to a Lovecraftian horror than a Tolkien work, dubbed by my friends ""Call of Cthulu; the video game"" (even if only few parts have sanity meter mechanics).Settings include a small town in New England overrun by undead, a city in Egypt fighting against a new uprising of one of its ancient foes, and a series of post-Soviet occupation Trannsylvanian towns besieged by vampires and werewolves.The foes run the gambit from classic design to compleately reimagined, whatever needed to fit into a modern setting.  Zombies in track suits, golems made of scrap metal, cultist in hoodies, and vampires covered in parkas and gas masks (to protect themselves from the sun, duh), scuttling wendigo, sloshing dragur, glowing will-o-wisps and more.Characters are distinct and memorable, with NPCs that will make you laugh audibly, cry physically, and moments that will make you go ""what the f###?!?""  Every one of my friends who have played this game have a favorite, and a least favorite, character.  Dialogue is well written, better than some TV shows.Quests vary between standard assult and dungeon missions that require slaying of hordes of mosters (or one big one), sabotage missions that require tact and subterfuge, and research missions that involve extensive out-of-game study.I cannot emphasise the awesomeness of research missions enough; they are incredible in-depth puzzles and can make you do anything from learn arabic to visit game-based websites on the real world internet to scribble notes about demon runes like a madman.  The lazy can simply Google search for a walkthrough, but those who enjoy mystery will have a blast connecting the dots.As a MMO RPG, it still suffers the stanard MMO RPG flaws; other players mercing your tagets before you can reach them, small pools of active players looking for group for the dungeon you want to run, nessicerey grinding to become strong enough to handle the next area, player characters in gaudy outfits providing jarring contrast to the scenery, the silent protagonist, and so on.  However, these flaws don't detract significantly rom the game.When all is said and down, I would recomend this game to any fan of modern fantasy.			"

												The Secret World is in so many ways different then other MMORPG's. It is not just solving quests, it is about solving riddles. You have to use more then just your brain, but also your wits and the internet. I don't know how many times I had to look at some walkthroughs, because the quests were so hard and I never thought of that. The game is awesome. And as awesome it is, it is also that hard to play. You can learn everything and build your skill deck everytime new, till you have a skill deck you feel comfortable with. And if you are tired of it, just change the skills. Doesn't cost you any gold like in WoW where you are a warlock, mage, hunter or whatever. And thanks to the upcomming issues you get even more access to more toys to play with.			"

												I was thoroughly enjoying the setting and stories. I downloaded this game based on the Extra Credits review, especially the section about the investigation missions.My only problem with it is the standard MMO grinding. Yeap, I killed that group of zombies last time I walked around the block and they're back for me to kill again. Killing the baddies in this game is too grindy for my likes. Especially when the baddiest are so frigging powerful. I definitely prefer games where I seem to be making an impact in the world. If I shoot a bad guy in the face I want him to stay dead.However I did really love the setting and storytelling of this game. I just wish I could have gone further.			"

												I have played through much of the starting area and I have to say that it is one of the most innovative MMMOs I have ever played. It is uniquely story-driven compared to many other MMOs that have story elements tacked onto fighting in order to level up. Of course, with any MMO one aspect is to see your character advance. The Secret World is no different but FunCom has somehow removed the grinding elements. You can learn any skill and max it out if you wish—so there's very little sense that you can ever screw up and select an ""unworkable build"". Instead, you take the abilities you've learn and configure them so that they work well together. No re-spec is necessary. Gear is important, but not absolute, and its readily available.If you're the sort of person that ""wants to love their MMO"" but somehow just quits without ever going very far, this may be the game for you. Now that it is subscription free like Guild Wars 2, playing is a one time investment. There is a real world store but it sells consumables and cosmetics which are unnecessary. There are even ways within the game to get new outfits without spending any real world cash.If this goes on sale at Steam, I heartily reccomend it.			"

												This game is AWESOME! It's quite emmersive. There are 3 types of quests. Main quests, side quests, and small quests. Main quests and side quests consist 3 types of quests, Action quest (the usual fighting stuff except most of the time you have good reason to do it), Sabatoge quests (these are inflitrating something, usually an underground hideout, or some sort of enemy related building, and well.... you sabatoge it with various things to do), and Investigation missions (these are what seperates the secret world from everything else. Basically it's an ARG where you have to find clues, solve puzzles, and investigate things both in and out of the game with reasearch via google and books). Small quests are just small things like go from point A to point B and do something or fight these monsters. The more generic quests. And every quest besides small quests have a fully voiced cinematic cut scene. Combat is very free and open. The only downside that's preventing me from playing right now is that I don't have anyone friends who play it and the game is significantly better with friends. #4EverAlone :(			"

												Amazing game. It's an MMO that plays like a single player game, and the atmosphere and lore are incredibly immersive and detailed. I read that, in some areas, you will hardly ever see any other players (by design) in order to enhance the player's immersion in the environment. Pretty kickass. The Ultimate Edition is a great deal in terms of value, so if you're thinking about buying TSW and wondering which version to get, pick the Ultimate Edition. You'll save a bunch of money on the other issues (storylines) in the long run: you get issues 1-4 with the base game, but you get issues 1-11 with the Ultimate Edition. You also get 30 days of membership, 1200 bonus Funcom points (which you can use to buy issue 12 or 13 if you felt like it), an exclusive outfit, some other items, and a bonus game key for the standard edition of the game that you can give to a friend. It really is worth it to get the Ultimate Edition over the base game.			"

												Hey all !Just want to put few words in here about this tittle. I have been playing MMORPG for over a decade now. Seen better and worst many times before. The secret world is definitely worth your attention if: you like horror climate in games, if you like freedom from start of the game, if you likke innovative ways to build and progress your character, if you dont mind progressing through most of the game on your own and dont mind spending lots of time looking for groups. Then this game is a perfect choice. Myself however i had a large issue with lack of group runs on the low level, i dont mean QL1 or 2 here i mean QL5 and above. Sadly there is no groups for new players, yes the Sanctuary chat is friendly and full of people but none of them is willing to do group runs below QL10 cause they dont get anything out of it. The facebook page is almost dead and apart from devs putting up the news there the response is very very little. Seem that the game is largely populated by high level players who dont bother with newbies. No LFG tool also does not help in this type of game as fresh players have no way to learn their class in group. Personally i think this takes a lot of good out of this game. MMORPG is all about teaming up with people and overcoming obstacle in groups and i am sad to say but you will not see this in here untill you waaaaay deep into the game and bored of feeling that you play another single player rpg.Iam recommending this game as a good game on its own but not for hard fans of team work.

												Super rich story and atmosphere. That is what hooked me to this game and it never misses a beat there. The combat is pretty basic, but the best thing about it is the variety at which you can choose your skills from. There is little chance that you and another player will have the exact same build, unless you are using the preset kits. The missions in this game can be very challenging! So challenging that they installed an in game browser so you can look up clues in your missions. Which can range from morse code, quotes from the bible and sheet music, which all in all make for a really rewarding experience.			"

												There would have been a time when I would have not recommended The Secret World; always a conceptual marvel, beautifully told and voice-acted through episodic adventures, but hampered though combat too clunky and obtuse to prevail over its ridiculously harsh difficulty scaling.This has since changed, a complete rebalancing of mobs and streamlining of its combat system allowing the game to finally play to all its collective strengths; the storytelling, music, atmosphere, freedom of choice, art direction, wardrobe system, lack of handholding... it's all still there, no longer burdened by everything in between.This of course raises an important question: is The Secret World still an archaic behemoth true to Funcom's mixed legacy? Well... yes, but consider it a massively more intuitive one as of my recent revisiting -- a fan without question.			"

												Simply put: Don't buy the game standalone.  I don't mean don't buy the game, I mean don't buy THIS particular version of the game.  The Ultimate Bundle is what you actually want to buy.  Why?  Because the Ultimate Bundle comes preloaded with almost all of the expansions for the game (you'll also get $10 worth of Funcom Points upon completing your first 30 quests; I recommend using this to buy Issue #12).If you buy this there is no upgrade option, you'll end up having to buy the Ultimate Bundle which is basically buying the game twice.  Either that or you can buy the expansions if you want, but that'll cost you more than just buying the Ultimate Edition.  So in summary, the game itself is GREAT, I absolutely recommend it.  But buy the Ultimate Edition so you won't end up having to buy it twice, and you'll save a bunch of money on the expansions!			"
