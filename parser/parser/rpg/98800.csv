												I want to tell you the story of one of the most fantastic adventurers I ever created, his name is Gershwin. He began as a strange idea for the most stupid type of character I could have made. He would punch everything, get the crap kicked out of him, and drink every philter of booze he found. I crafted him and then set him loose on the first level and was amazed when he did not die immediately. I followed his adventures as he raided kitchens, punched robots to death, and drunkenly stumbled through level after level. He made it farther than any other character I had made, I formed a massive backstory for him as he went that bordered on actual fanfiction. It was the most beautiful thing that has ever happened. Gershwin swaggered onto yeat another level and began tearing through the obstacles in the best hat zorkmids could buy.  Gershwin ran into a room filled with fountains and saw a single lutefisk warrior on an outcropping. He rushed over to give him what for like the gentleman adventuer he is, but the warrior must have known him by reputation as he started to hide behind the nearest fountain. Gershwin rushed over and gave him the, ""Dance of One Thousand Boots."" Then Gershwin realized, he had kicked the fountain in his haste as well. The fountain had landed in an immovable position and was wedged there forever. My heart broke in that moment because I knew, Gershwin would forever be bobbing his eyebrows on that stone islet. Never to adventure again. He is now the only save file that will forever remain, and Gershwin will forever be punished for my hubris. Buy Dungeons of Dredmor, have adventures, inadvertently enact a tragedy.			"

												Some say that a god cannot exist. Those who say that have not met our Lord and Saviour Lutefisk. The Lutefisk is a kind giver, and also a taker, for one cannot recieve what they are not willing to give away. Thus has been taught to me by the Lutefisk. As we delve deeper, we will all be taught by the Lutefisk; we will all join the Cult of the Lutefisk. However, a new Cult is not the only thing that Dungeons of Dredmor offers.     As a roguelike RPG, gameplay is simple: run around, grab loot, kill monsters, and don't die (and not just because Lutefisk does not promise an afterlife). However, there are many fun and exciting features. An advanced set of skill selection, in the form of multiple skill trees with linear paths, keeps combat unique and different. For example, I have had builds where I run around and just kick monsters to death (yes I mean kick, as in with a boot) while dual-wielding shields and builds where I teleport in, drop mines, push monsters onto said mines, and teleport out of explosion-related danger. There are several different interactions in the game that either reward or punish you. For example, Krong, the God of Anvils, leaves blessed anvils randomly on floors in the dungeon that you can enchant your gear with. It is not until you place your gear on the anvil, the point of no return, when you find out if Krong blesses or curses you. And of course, interactions involves our dear Lutefisk. Tithing Lutefisk at a Lutefisk Shrine, a food item that offers barely any health regen, may appease the Lutefisk God, and he may give you an enchanted item. DoD also offers a completely fair difficulty curve: each floor means significantly harder enemies. Therefore, as logic dictates, you should complete the entire floor you're on for as much experience and items as possible. The only exception to this rule is random minibosses and of course, Dredmor. Minibosses are literally there to make sure you're paying attention to the game. If you're punching everything, and notice this one monster is doing half your health in one hit, you should probably use a different strategy. Dredmor is a completely overpowered piece of... bologna... but I mean, to me this makes sense. It's HIS dungeon, HIS realm of power, and you're trying to stop him. If he was weak, why would a HERO (and quite the hero you are!) need to stop him? If nothing else, this hard task merely forces you to further investigate every chest, to question every move, and to work ever harder at making that perfect combination of skills.     Another good part about this game is that it's very accessible. There are three difficulty levels, permadeath is optional (so you can save your dearest characters), there is an option for smaller floors with the same experience gain, and with DLC, there is an option for 5 more floors of grinding before the boss. Speaking of DLC quickly, two DLC packs are super cheap (2.99 USD each and actually the Deluxe edition has the game and those two DLC for just 6.99 USD), and the third DLC pack is free. Cheap and easy to get into means that casual players can enjoy as well, while advanced difficulties and more options means that the hardcore Roguelike fan can cater to their style as well.     Another important thing about DoD in my opinion is the community. This is one of the most friendly, most helpful, best communities I have ever experienced on any game ever. Most questions get answered in minutes, and the number of guides for new players is seemingly limitless. These same helpful and friendly people also make amazing mods that add even more playability to a game I haven't been bored for even a second in.     TL;DR: All in all, DoD is an accessible, fun, pun-packed, Cult-creating, deceptively simple Roguelike RPG with a good community and workshop integration. I would highly recommend this game even off of a sale, and when on sale I will attest that it's literally a ""can't miss"". If anybody has any questions, ask in the comments section, I will do my very best to answer them in a timely manner. Similarly, I will try to continue to edit this guide at appropriate times.        The""Your TL;DR is still annoyingly long, sir.""TL;DR: Very fun, creative game; amazing community; astounding Workshop content; optional Cult participation. Worth every penny.			"

												Now that reviews are here, let me review the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game.Dungeons of Dredmor is, in one word, the-seriously-best-game-ever.No? Well, maybe I'm overstating. But it's definitely one of the best -if not THE best- Roguelike I've ever played. I will always return to this game. It will constantly captivate me in its shiny roguelike eyes. Maybe it's because every character you make can have a new and exciting build. Maybe it's because no run-through is exactly the same. Maybe it's because there's actual crafting that's better than in some big name MMO's. Maybe it's because your death is always your own damn fault. Or maybe it's because diggles are so cute (but they hate you so much). I don't know, probably all of the above (definitely). I will always love this game and this game will always show me a good time. If you know what I mean. And I think you do.Negatives? The humor is sometimes a little too much, I think, like every-blooming-thing needed to be funny. Oh, there's funny in there, but sometimes you just want the flavor texts to give it a rest already. Furthermore, I guess the art style turns off some people, not me personally, but I've heard it as a complaint. I can understand that, but my advice would be to ignore it and just try it.You won't be disappointed.			"

												Before you get this game, I strongly advise that you do some research.Not because the game sucks, it's actually one of the best roguelikes I've played recently, but because of a problem I'll describe.The game has an auto-save feature that sometimes crashes the game (Runtime Error).You can NOT remove this auto-save feature, which wouldn't be a problem if it didn't corrupt savefiles, but unfortunately it does.The developers of this game even acknowledged the issue, but did nothing after 2 years of knowing about it.The only workaround is to:1) Turn off Steam Cloud2) ""Save and Continue"" in the menu (unavailable if you play Permadeath mode)3) Manually backup your savefiles from Windows folders every now and then,  so when it happens you can replace the corrupted saveI lost a 28 hours savefile due to not knowing of this issue, and I'm not gonna recommend the game despite it being rather good. I might give this another try someday, but right now I'm stunned.Do yourself a favor and do some research before you get this game, and you won't be caught offguard.			"

												  In 1980 a game called 'Rogue' was born. Since then, a genre known as Rogue-like was born.A rogue-like game typically features a randomised dungeon, turn based movement and a plethora of skills and items at your disposal. Classic RPG weapons and armor, wizardry and sneaky rogues fighting monsters, all drably illustrated with ASCII graphics.Dungeons of Dredmor takes all that, slaps on a easy mouse interface, some charming graphics and audio, and chucks on some good humour to boot. This is quite possibly the only game - now and forever - where I can roll a beserker viking pirate communist emo vegan. Monsters will waltz up to me moaning ""I wasn't even supposed to be here today"". It won't make you laugh until your face falls off, but it'll have you smirking with the occasional ""hah!"" throughout.If you're just curious and never tried a rogue-like before, give it a shot. It's a fairly simple game, but with enough hardcore depth to have you reaching for the wiki once you get into it. It also has a range of addons found on the Steam workshop, so there's never an end to the strange setups you can employ and the delightful humour it prizes. It's often on a 75% off sale during holiday periods, and at that price it's well worth a dabble and beyond good value.			"

												Dungeons of Dredmor is a rather by the book implementation of the concepts presented by the nethacks, rogues, and past games of the genre known affectionately as, ""rogue-like,"" you take the genre and pump it full of Internet Memes, Canada and Scandanavia jokes, and then add Diggles...  Like a packing plant pumping their meat full of water and a hint of salt.The game plays well, and is rather thoroughly randomized, the difficulty stems more from your skill choices than from the game's settings, death can be permanent if you wish, and after playing a game or two you may like that extra bit of pressure on you.The hand drawn animated deaths are nice and the game has a sense of humour about the entire affair, you'd be surprised the variety of ways one can die.The DLC for the game do flesh it out a bit, and when on sale it's well worth picking up.This is a solid rogue-like game - one you should give a try.

												This game is amazing. 280 hours on record, and counting. There are lots of skills and so much variation it's unreal. And then there's user-created content. A lot of which is balanced and well thought out, showing how much people enjoy the game.This is one of the best $5 games ever made. The variety is great, the humour is great, and the DLCs are nice add-ons to an already great game.If you're after the latest 3D graphics, this game isn't for you. But if you can put that aside and appreciate the graphics for what they are, you are in for a treat.A large part of the game's greatness is due to the character customization. You choose seven skills , which may be related to fighting, magic, roguey stuff, or general skills that are slotted into one of those three categories. Each of those options is actually a skill tree, with multiple skills that you unlock as you level up. You can also do a ton of crafting, or none, as you wish.This game is all about giving us players the choice to try to win the game however we like, which is why I will keep going back to it again and again.

												This game... oh, this game.Very rarely do I find a game that I consider I might actually play -Forever- (or at least until I am no longer able to).  This is one of those games.  I will play it, revisit it, time and time again, until I can't anymore.  It's that epic.True to it's rogue-like nature, there is very little hand-holding in this game.  There isn't -too- much to figure out for yourself, but there is definitely enough to keep things interesting.  The turn-based combat is refreshing, as is the way you can use items (clicking on an enemy while holding a bolt from your inventory will shoot them with said bolt).  The base stats are a a refreshing new twist, with stats not seen in any other games.  Of course, you've got about a million ways to start your character depending on what type of play-style you're going through.  Base stats serve only to enhance secondary stats, which are used throughout most of the game.  Nothing big to figure out, but you could definitely be a min/maxer if you wanted to be.  I prefer the role-play / lore route.Perma-death mode is the only mode I'll ever play.  As your characters die, your name, level, and score all get added to a giant headstone which shows all of your previous deaths as well.  Making it exceedingly interesting to see just how much farther you can push into the dreaded Dungeons of Dredmor.Over all, I HIGHLY recommend this game.  I feel like it is one out of over 150 titles that I own that I got much, much more than I paid for.  If you pass this one up, you're missing out.  Buy it.  Buy it now.			"

												This is typical old-school roguelike. That means you will enter the dungeon many times with different characters and this time they will have really crazy sets of skills. It's worth to try how is to play as vegan, tourist or geologist. This is definitely something that other games don't allow.If you still not convinced, maybe powerful crafting system will convince you. You will create hundreds of different items, starting on potions, ending on Chainaxe or the Historically Inaccurate Viking Helm.VERDICT:If you're a roguelike fan, this it's must have for you.If you have never tried any roguelikes, this is a good game to convince you to that genre.If you like only modern shooters, you will never have opportunity to wear the Communist Power Ushanka.Like this review?

												Dungeons of dredmor is an example of ""don't judge a book by its cover"". Initially, it looks poorly made, but once you start playing you can find yourself immensed in the game. There are tons of items, craftables and combinations to make. Battle is fluent despite of being turn based, and there are plenty of class and spell combinations to try out. Overall it has a great variety for such a ""small"" game! A big plus is also the fact that there are several difficulty levels, including a ""softcore"" mode where dying doesn't mean game over. This makes it equally enjoyable for hardcore roguelike fans as well as more casual players who would like to give the genre a try. Strongly recommended :)			"

It's quite simplistic: turn-based movement and combat, with procesdurally generated rooms, monsters, and loot. You are given a choice of seven skills when you create your character, which have different abilities and powers as you level them up. Simplistic yet fun.   Graphics 7/10 You're not going to find anything fancy here, but Dredmor has it's own unique art style.   Story/Quests 5/10 Evil lich Dredmor was captured, evil lich Dredmor is breaking free. So the kingdom needs a hero. Unfortunately, this is you. You can pray to the Goddess of Sidequests to get sidequests, but they can be really annoying and difficult.  Overview 8.5/10 DoD is an enjoyable roguelike. While it does suffer from a few minor bugs, and setting up mods without the game breaking can be long and tedious, it is worth it for the sheer amount of gameplay, as well as the DLC.

												Few games personify the attempt to make Rogue friendly and approachable like Dredmor. There are lots of games out there now that rock a similar angle— many of them good, some of them great— but very few retain the structure of Rogue like Dredmor. Here you will find bare-bones inventory management(so many times you'll drop things, rearrange them, et cetera), permadeath(though it can be turned off), procedurally-generated labyrinths and stupid monsters. The crafting system, the skill trees, all of it is designed to let you fall through the cracks. All of it is designed around letting you die.And it is gloriously addictive, if you like that sort of thing.The first forty hours of Dredmor I didn't even get to see the namesake Lich at the bottom of the dungeon. I was playing on the hardest difficulty, with permadeath, and I just kept dying before the fifth floor. Then, suddenly, playing a character named Pyra Mancy, everything lined up perfectly and victory was assured. It was delicious.Triple A games have abandoned this concept, that insane difficulty makes ultimate success that much more rewarding. But of all the games I've beaten on my gameslist, it's no wonder that I'm proudest of Isaac and Dredmor. The art is amateurish, the music repetitive, the story nonexistant.But it nails the sense of accomplishment that comes with patience and dedication, and for that, it's well worth the asking price.

Beware of the false shepherd Lutefisk!
Caution! You're now entering the Diggle Danger Zone!Developer: Gaslamp Games, IncPublisher: Gaslamp Games, IncFormat: PCReleased: August 1st, 2012Yeah, good luck playing any video games today with this guy staring at you with his big... deep... fishy eyes.(The Lutefisk God is not to be confused with Dagon, Prince of the Sea. That's, uh, a different video game.)Let me start by saying that Dungeons of Dredmor is rogue like dungeon crawler and a parody of those at the same time. Lovely isn't it?Oh boy where do I begin?I think this game was my first step into the roguelike genre and it became my favorite genre by far ever since.Having said that let's get down to business.StoryYou're the chosen one. The hero. The man or the woman with the eyebrows of destiny! It's your duty to venture into the depths of the Dungeon of Dredmor and to show not only him but also every damn Diggle you'll encounter on your way who's Boss: The one with the most majestic eyebrows ever! and that is you!GameplayDungeons of Dredmor is turn based game means you move on a tile based square grid where you and your enemies take turns. Each floor is randomly generated meaning you will never see the same layout, types and amount of enemies or loot. Every single playthrough will be an unique and unforgiving experience.Before you experience your first death by a fierce Diggle you will have to choose the difficulty and your seven starter skills.You can choose between warrior skills like Swords, Axes, Maces or Smithing, rogue related skills like assassination, daggers or burglary and you can obviously become a powerfull wizard using skills like golemancy, alchemy or Astrology.There have been several expansions for this game so far and each expansion includes some new skills like Demonologist (Realm of the Diggle Gods), Clockwork Knight (You have to name the expansion pack. <- yes you really have to) and Tourist (Conquest of the Wizardlands).After choosing skills to your like or letting the game choose some randomly for you it's time to enter the dungeon!The game starts as you take control of our Hero with those beautiful eyebrows. Your goal is to get to Dredmor and to show him who's boss (obviously that's you but he didn't get the memo yet).In order to reach Dredmor you'll have to fight your way through fierce Diggles, grab some better loot and also level up.While exploring your surroundings and getting beat up by those Diggles you will encounter several objects you can interact with. Like a well with a blue liquid in it. Too blue to be water so you take a sip and here comes's the beauty of the game. The effect will be random meaning you can get healed which would be sweet so you can get your revenge on those Diggles (ye I they're our arch enemy!) or you can get poisoned and die a pathetic death.Also there's Krong. You will have a serious love and hate relationship with this fellow. You will find some anvils in the dungeon. Interacting with it will either bless you and upgrade one of your items or Krong will curse you for not cleaning your teeth this morning.Also keep in mind that some area of effect skills can and will hurt you as well just in case you think it would be a good idea to set the ground on fire. It's gonna get hot and you won't like it trust me.Then there's also Brax. A bad ♥♥♥ shop keeper who clearly isn't scared of all those damn Diggles.You can buy and also sell loot. If you are brave enough you could also see if you are fast enough to steal something but ... that's up to you to decide. You will have to face the consequences.VisualYou either love the Art Style or you hate it. There's not much else. Personally I really Diggle (hah see what I did there!?) the Art Style and I think it's just fitting for this game. It's not looking to serious and let's be honest: Nothing's serious in Dungeons of Dredmor.The only thing that's a bit meh is the UI but the way the game looks is quite charming.What else can I say about this game?Gaslamp Games made a lot of things right I'd even go as far as to say nearly perfect if not for some minor interface issues and also the crafting in this game is tad clunky.If you can overlook the art style (which probably isn't to everyone's liking) and the minor interface issues you will deeply enjoy this game.Given you like roguelikes and getting beat up by Diggles ...

												An incredible amount of replayability for such a small price tag.  I've had this game for more than two years, and I keep coming back to it.

												This is a game I've owned for quite a long time now, and before I begin I will clarify that I have way more 10 hours play time on this game, as at many times in the past I have been without internet access and this has always been my go to offline game, I'm sure the number is much more close to 50 hours or so and it still remains my go to offline game.I've mentioned in other reviews that I don't like games with a short lifespan and little replayability, well this game then is an absolute wonder to me because not only does it provides almost an endless amount of gameplay and tons of replayability, it is incredibly addictive and fun to play.The mechanics are very simple and there is little to no story at all, which leaves your imagination to get carried away and fill in the gaps as you crawl through the large dungeon areas slaying hoards of quirky little monsters and farming items you have no desire to eat, use or sell. This is a game where you will probably only ever be using the arrow keys and a mouse click, and the simplicity of this provides an easy gaming experience.I will say I have never played past the medium difficulty level, and I will go further as to say that I have never even completed a single save, I don't usually play with permadeath on either, it's mainly a case of me creating various heroes and forgetting how far I got on each one and deciding to start all over again. This is not a game you could finish in one sit through, even when enabling the mode which reduces the size of the levels, this game is still massive and takes a lot of time to cover each area and collect each item.One thing I would imagine playing this game is that the simplicity and repetitiveness of this game would get boring, but it never seems to do that, I believe it is probably the desire to push on for more loot, gold and exp to max our your skill sets, as well as find interesting new items with cool stats and comparing them with your current inventory, perhaps one of the most thrilling discoveries you can make on any level is finding the store, which always stocks a bizaare inventory.The music is also really good, and while it may feel repetitive at some points, it still manages to sound really great and perhaps helps in setting the mood for becoming immersed in the game.I would say the main factor for enjoying this game is that it excels in making you feel that you have achieved and made progress, there are a lot of achievements you can unlock, and two expansions which add more levels and crazy skills to master, this is definitely a great entry and perhaps a little overlooked work within the roguelike genre and I cannot recommend it enough.That being said, this game is pretty buggy at times, the levels appear to be randomly generated and at times this can result in some items being blocked off and unattainable without the right skills, and this while slightly annoying, doesn't really take much away from enjoying the game, the game was also very buggy when I played it around it's time of release, but it does seem a lot more stable now. So I would still say it's definitely worth picking up especially given how good the price is.			"

												-TL;DR at Bottom-Dungeons of Dredmor is simultaneously an addictively expansive roguelike with heaps of replay value and a disappointingly, shallow experience, and in this way, it is the World of Warcraft of it's genre. For it's price it absolutely is worth it, but at the end of the day you are left wishing the devs would have put a bit more thought into the game to create a solid experience.At it's base, DoD is a turn-based dungeon crawler with painfully basic combat. You walk around rooms, meet monsters, left click them until they're dead. Occasionally you'll meet a situation where the enemies are statistically and/or numerically superior to you, at which case you must randomly spam offensive/defensive items and abilities at the issue until it's solved, and you really don't even have to pay much attention to exactly what it is you're using. It's just too inconsequential, regardless of the vast amount of options available to you. Increasing the difficulty or enabling perma-death somehow manages not to address this issue, it simply requires for you to pay more attention to the handful of mechanics that really matter. It might seem better for the first few floors of each playthrough, but regardless of settings and skillbuilds, the experience will degrade into the above mentioned simplicity by floor 5 no matter what it is you do, which is primarily due to XP and high level items being too abundant, leading to overleveling reducing the difficulty. Again, this stems from a lack of critical thinking employed in the basic game design, and while it'd be unfeasible to change anything at this stage of the game, it should have been taken much more seriously back in it's development infancy. The importance of a balanced experience distribution in an RPG game is one of the first things any old scrub with a couple hours of dabbling in RPG Maker learns, so it's downright embarrassing that Gaslamp Games took it so lightly.So that's the core of the game. Why is this a good purchase then? Well the game has three factors that save it from itself; Humor, Content and Steam Workshop.Humor, I would say, is DoD's greatest asset. Without it's presence, it would crumble and fall into the realms of indie shovelware, and it combines together with a feature that you can never go wrong with; content. So there's a lot of humor is what I'm trying to say. So the way this game works is, after presumably completing the short tutorial course, you start a new game and enter character creation. This process is unlike anything you've experienced before. You right off the bat get to chose a number of skill trees (1-8) for your Adventurer and decide your playstyle on the spot. The fun factor in this is all the various combinations made possible by this formula. Simply put, you can be a regular Melee user, a wizard or a mix of both, and if you'd like you can take the Warlock tree to help with that. Or not. It's very freeform, although hard to explain. Right off the bat you'll notice via the Skill Trees' descriptions that the game's funny. You have skill trees like ""Battle Geology: Like all geologists, you can create earthquakes, armor yourself in stone, and petrify enemies. "" and ""Warlockery: Warlocks are wizards that really wish they were warriors. Or Rogues. Or cheesemongers. Anything but wizards, really. Their ""spells"" (as they are) serve to make them less wizard-like in a variety of ways."". If these two make you chuckle, or at least make you go ""heh"" internally, then you'll have an absolute blast once you actually plunge into the game. Every item name, item description, skill, spell, room, monster, monster description - really everything that's anything with words on it will have humorous dialogue that simply never gets ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ old. Even monsters often make snarky comments from a list of a thousand or more phonemes. It ranges from low to high brow humor, references and even some memes here and there and it never feels distasteful or tired. If you're imaginative and weird, like me, you could also give a voice to all the text in your head, so that the Narrator from Trine 2, or hell, Jef Goldbloom says all the stuff, and it'll be all the more hilarious. And there's tons of this content, just tons and tons and tons. Rightfully so, because the game consists of 10-15 dungeons per run with each floor taking at LEAST an hour to complete unless you're leaving stuff unexplored.This is where the Steam Workshop comes in. I personally don't recommend playing the game without all 3 DLC's installed AND the majority of the workshop content subscribed to and loaded up. The almost inexhaustible supply of content is the single one thing that can and will distract you from how shallow a game Dungeons of Dredmor actually is. When you're pretending to be a Vegan Necromantic Steampunk Knight and reading funny bits all the time, you don't care about gameplay. You'll be immersed into the whackiest, stupidest scenarios you've ever seen and you'll make it work. It's all novelty, but when there's this much of it, it works better than a real freaking game.I should fleetingly mention that crafting and inventory management is a huge hit and miss. During some runs, I'll have patience and indulge in the hassle that comes with dealing with it. Other times I'll simply ignore 90% of the loot that spawns all over the floor and wish they put more effort into it. Ironically, while I'd say it's bad in this game, DoD's crafting is exactly what today's MMOs could use in order to make crafting actually freaking interesting. Because MMO's are MEANT to be timesinks, and items there would be worth the literal hours it takes to get specific equipment with noticable and snazzy uses like in DoD. As opposed to stupid junk you will NEVER pawn off on marketplaces, nor even think about using yourself. Oh and the music is loud and obnoxious but it grows on you.One last, last thing; The gameplay is crap, alright, fine. But I should tell you that if you're of the particularly imaginative sort, there's plenty of room to create fun, self-imposed challenges that could alleviate this issue. On a basic example, you could stylize your character to only wield clockwork/steampunk styled items, which limits your equipment and arsenal. You can take concepts like this to much deeper levels that I can't really explain without you having played the game. It's like those weird people you see on GameFAQ's making up weird challenge run guides for Final Fantasy games. You can do that if that's your sort of schtick.-TL;DR-Gameplay: 2/5 - Shallow. Relies on your imagination to make it fun. Not for the casuals.Replay Value: 5/5 - There's lots of ways to play and things to try and as a Roguelike, the game does excell.Content: 5/5 - Thousands upon thousands of hilarious descriptions, names and phonemes is the game's primary source of fun.Music: 3/5 - It grows on you, but nothing to write home about. Title song is catchy.Art: 3/5 - It's pixelart. It's alright. Level art styles will leave you scratching your head sometimes.			"

												Everyone who likes real roguelike games (as in games that are similar to the original 'rogue' game, not all these platform games and stuff that people keep calling ""roguelike"") must buy this game! This is the best modern adaptation of rogue/nethack/moria/etc that I've seen so far. (Also see Sword of the Stars for a good sci-fi themed game of this sort.) Crafting makes a good addition to the game, as does the excellent skill system. You're also given difficulty level settings and permadeath can be enabled or disabled.Overall this game just kicks ♥♥♥ and it's hard to find anything wrong with it.			"

												This game definitely has all the characteristics of a roguelike but is modernized in a way that let's us mere mortals enjoy it as well, has a great artstyle and enjoyable humor, and of course, extreme difficulty.Your goal is to get through all ten floors and defeat the dreaded Lord Dredmor, but DLC adds an additional 5 floors as well as bonus floors. I would definitely recommend getting all dlc and the base game at the same time, especially considering the price for the amount of content.If you're not daring enough to get through the entire game on its intended settings you can disable permadeath and/or lower the difficulty.This game is also highly moddable, which should further extend the large amount of replayability that already exists in the base game, just look at the steam workshop for some fantastic user created mods.And remember, dying is fun!

												Oddly charming and brutally difficult in parts, Dungeons of Dredmor is nonetheless a stellar addition to the roguelike genre.Taking the role of the standard ""young man on a quest for glory"", Dredmor sets itself apart from the pack through a number of interesting and oft-hilarious mechanics, including varied skill trees, monsters who insult you with lines that could have been ripped out of The Secret of Monkey Island, a wide assortment of loot and armor (the descriptions are hilarious themselves) and a well-put together crafting system that rewards exploration and experimentation.This is the kind of game you can easily lose 50 or so hours to, and I've barely scratched the surface myself. Well worth the price, and definitely a game that will appeal to any fan of the genre.			"

												If you want to get started with roguelikes, Dungeons of Dredmor is as good a place as any. It straddles an important line between more mainstream adaptations of the concept and the originators, where neophytes can find easy access and veterans can find a new take on old ideas. And while it may not be perfect in a lot of ways, it passes the main test of being something you can play for way, way too long.Dredmor is really a traditional, grid-based, turn-based, everything-random roguelike dressed up in some handsome(ish) graphics and modern sensibilities. The only story you get is that you're a hero, and you're descending into the titular dungeons to whack the equally-titular Lord Dredmor. There's a thick layer of nerd humor over the whole package that runs more than skin-deep, as it even informs the class and stat systems. Luckily it's not the aggravating metahumor of something like Retro City Rampage, and is actually quite snappy and clever for the most part.The aforementioned class system is probably the big draw of DoD, for newbies and veterans alike. Each character you roll gets seven skill sets to choose from a list of dozens, including everything from sword and shield skills to veganism and communism. Every time you level up, you can unlock another skill from one of your sets, allowing you to knock out one tree with half a dozen levels or diversify as you see fit. Sets tend to be eclectic mixes of active skills and passive bonuses, with some being demonstratively better than others, but all of them interesting and worth a try.Outside of the skill system, there's admittedly not a lot of innovation to be found here. You wander the dungeon, grab loot, kill monsters, and so on. There are shrines to pray to, gods to appease, vending machines to shake, traps to disarm, levers to pull, and plenty of things to die to. Unlike the roguelikes of yore, however, death tends not to come all that swiftly in Dredmor. It's pretty easy to keep your stats and gear up with the challenge presented by enemies if you're cleaning out the floors, to the point that by floor three or so, nothing's going to kill you outside of a room completely packed with monsters.This ties into the main problem with Dredmor, the fact that individual runs can get pretty boring after a point. Unlike most roguelikes, the early game is when you need to pay attention to your skills and your loot. Once you get your rhythm locked in, levels start to blend together. The slow default move speed and animations drag things out a bit longer than they should, and your inventory and crafting windows really could have used another pass on usability. For as many steps forward that Dredmor takes as a modern roguelike, it has a couple feet planted firmly in the past.All that said, I was able to sink 30 hours into the game before I grew well and truly tired of it. And those were an enjoyable 30 hours of looting, smashing, and giggling at the goofy jokes. Dredmor will go a lot farther with those new to the roguelike genre, but there is undeniably something for everyone, at least while it stays fresh.			"

												So, it's occurred to me that I've had this game for a long time (and played it for more hours than it even shows here) and yet I've never done a review of it as I usually do for favorite games.  'Bout bloody time I did.So, Dungeons of Dredmor... where to begin?  It's hard to really talk about all of the aspects of the game because there are SO MANY of them.  This is likely to be one of the first things you notice about Dredmor:  The sheer ridiculous amount of content, particularly once you have the expansions installed (and I highly recommend all three).  Character creation for example... even just the base game has 35 ""skills"" to pick from, with the number being just under 50 with the expansions installed.  And these skills are really skill SETS.  You choose 7 of them when you create your character (any combination is fine), and once you're in the game, each of these will start at their base skill.  When you level-up, in addition to getting a boost to your prime stats (more on that later) you also go into the big skill list, and you choose one of the seven to rank up.  Each rank in each set offers you something new... some fun new active ability, some wonky passive, some stats... in my experience, there really arent any ""duds"" among the skillsets here, and levelling up is always very satisfying.And the skills are VARIED.  There's some crazy stuff here.  Some of them are fairly basic... for example, sword skills, or crafting.  But then you get to Dredmor's general comedic weirdness.  For example, one of my favorites is the Bankster set.  Right from the start, this one gives you an ability called ""High Interest Loan"".  Use it, and a big pile of money drops at your feet.  Sounds good, right?  Well, it has a fair chance of then also hitting you with a ""Bankster debuff"", of which there are about 7 types.  ALL of them drain money from you in some fashion, with one of them lasting indefinitely until you either run out or the effect is removed.  Now it doesnt seem so good, yeah?  Well, that's where the rank 2 ability, ""Dump Toxic Assets"", comes in.  You can take any Bankster debuffs you have at the moment, turn them into poison-based damage, and fling them at your enemy.  As with any skills in the game, these have cooldowns, so using this set PROPERLY (as most of the abilities in the set can debuff you) requires that you time your skill usage correctly, and that you understand what they do.   Skills and spells in the game are like that:  Some of them get complicated in an interesting way, and they often tend to be fairly creative in how they behave.  I mean, really, when was the last time a game let you kill a giant angry carrot by having a bad credit score at it?   Things get even more interesting when these skill sets combine, and with so many, there's TONS of ways to synergize.Items are pretty similar:  Very creative, very diverse, very useful.  And this game LOVES it's items.  You'll get a ton of them.  WAY too many.  You have a large inventory, but you'll run out of space fast.  From things like food/drink (heal HP/MP) to potions or mushrooms to crafting equipment or much crazier stuff, the game has about a kersquillion items.  The best part is, most of them are actually USEFUL to you.  And that's good, because the game REALLY expects you to be using them.  While the combat, at it's core, may be simple (walk towards a monster to strike them, and of course you have your spells and such) the game likes to throw alot of monsters at you.  Sometimes a HUGE amount, in what are known as ""Monster Zoos""... big rooms where every single freaking tile has a monster on it.  You could get anywhere from 50 to 150 monsters in one zoo; zoos are effectively the ""boss fights"" of the game (complete with unique music) and there's one on each floor (but you dont know where!) except the first.  Beyond that, sometimes you get elite monsters, the occaisional monster from a couple floors up, and of course monsters have various stats and abilities, some getting rather unpleasant indeed.Which relates to one issue that some players may run into is that, yes, while the game may be accessible in some ways, it can get pretty darn tough.  I've seen plenty of players hit their first zoo and just get utterly splattered (and then try it a few more times, getting splattered even worse); traditional roguelikes dont exactly teach you to deal with 120 enemies (many of them with ranged spells or goofy abilities) all at the same time!  Yet the game expects you to do this on EVERY floor.  This is where all of those items and skills come in though... beating really tough encounters in this game, zoos or otherwise, is almost like solving a puzzle, carefully figuring out how to use all the stuff available to you to defeat it; you cant just beat everything over the head and do nothing else.  The good thing is that the game pretty much ALWAYS gives you the tools (there are a sqillion items lying around for a reason...) you just need to figure out how they can be used to get past a given situation.  It can get complicated.  Not to mention the way your stats work.  You have 6 primary stats, and 19 secondary ones.  Primary stats can affect secondary ones, but more than that, this means that there's LOTS of possible stats that can appear on equipment (or on buffs/debuffs).  Building your character well means understanding what all of these do.  In addition, there's ALSO like 16 damage types.  For players such as myself that love min-maxing and dealing with stats in these games, well, this game does it VERY well.  But for others this may be a major turnoff.However, this IS a roguelike... one way or another, there are so very, very many ways to die, yet one issue is that this is a LONG game.  Each floor is huuuuuuuuuuuge, and in the base game, there are 10 of them (with expansions, there are 15, as well as special side areas).  And there's about a gazillion things to do.  A full run-through of the game takes quite a long time.  This isnt exactly new for this genre, but it's very worth mentioning.   You have the ability to save & quit at absolutely any time though.  But it can be very frustrating to do something like get aaaaaaallllllll the way to Lord Dredmor (who is NOT a pushover) and then die to him.  All that time it took to get there... lost in one moment of SPLAT.   The game will never kill you in ways that are genuinely unfair, but that of course never stops frustration in a case like that.   Accessible though the game may be, it really is best suited to roguelike fans that are more than used to things like that happening.If you can get past that bit though.... this is an absolutely fantastic game.  I've played so many roguelikes, but this one is by far my favorite. It has it's small issues... but there's so very much going for it that it's way more than worth those minor quibbles.  Also it's got a really good sense of humor.Highly recommended.			"

												Today, Dungeons of Dredmor (DoD) completes five years, and still remains a great introduction to the classic style of Roguelike, while it offers a great deal of challenge to veterans of the genre. DoD features character building, with a wide range of skills to choose; easy to understand mechanics; great dose of humor, with a lot of references to movies and games; a fantastic soundtrack (the best of this kind of game, IMHO); Steam Workshop support for mods and backup on Steam Cloud (despite the store page not show this feature). The gameplay it's slow paced, ideal for a strategic approach instead of an action-oriented one, and demands patience from the player. The biggest bless and curse of this game, at the same time, it's the loot fest at every level. When you start playing, you'll certainly spend a decent part of your playthrough managing your loot on your tiny inventory (remember to use Shift+left click to pick up  and drop items with more ease). Thankfully, the ""Conquest of the Wizardlands"" DLC adds the Pocket Dimension - a place where you can store unlimited amounts of loot. By the way, this game is so cheap that you should buy the complete package for a better experience. Last but not least, I strongly recommend you to activate the OpenGL on the launch options to achieve a smoother experience, avoiding crashes caused by memory leak, while it enable the Steam Overlay. To do this, simply right click Dungeons of Dredmor in your Steam library -> Properties -> Set launch options -> type in -opengl -> press ok. Funny fact:  Everyone that claims this game it's ""too easy"" never managed to beat it. Funny, huh? Despite the cartoonish graphics and light-hearted aesthetics, DoD can be brutal.   "

												Dungeons of Dredmor is an intelligently designed Rogue-Like, it's very hard and extremely satisfying. You choose between a variety of perks when you start off your character, and it's crucial to pick a good build, because that's what you're stuck with for the entire run. The game has a moderatly strong sense of humour that come up in incredibly surprising places, the soundtrack is enjoyable, there's lots of enemy, item and level variety, but most importantly, there's no spiders (as far as I've been).Overall, I think that Dungeons of Dredmor is a very good game if you enjoy rogue-likes  and that you should pick it up with the DLC.

But you will push on, you will persist, and in the end, by dint of hard work and mental fortitude... you will die again. Yeah. Just take a gander at my playtime.Dungeons of Dredmor is a frustrating and addictive time sink, with uproarious descriptions (like Self-Righteous Sword of White Lies: ""Really, it's for their own good"" and One-Armed Leather Jacket: ""Evidently we DO need another hero""), intermixable skill trees (you can be a Communist Vegan Tourist Pirate with the power of Mathemagic) and deceptively cute enemies.

												This game manages to be the perfect gateway into real roguelike games and also as hardcore as any other out there. Its tutorial makes beginners feel very welcome and prepares them for their journey(s) ahead. The charactercreation is more simplified than you would probably expect from a roguelike like DCSS, but the system of picking 7 different skills, thus having hundreds of different combinations makes your choices more than meaningful.What sets it apart from other genre competitors is its presentation handsdown. Where other roguelikes kind of lack in that department and are just pure gameplay, Dungeons of Dredmor has a lot of charm in its visuals and writing. This is one of those rare games thats overgrown with little jokes and references but still stays funny and unique.If you have never played a real roguelike and want to get into them, this is probably the best game for you. If you're a seasoned veteran, it is also a good pickup because of its unique skillsystem and refreshing presentation.			"

												A very accessible rogue-like with enough depth, strategy and personality to stand above most of the rest. The simple graphics and combat of Dungeons of Dredmor obscure its incredible depth of design, functional mechanics and polishing, and it really is a fully fleshed out title. My fun in Dungeons of Dredmor comes from battling through hoards of monsters while interacting with the world, using traps, spells, crafting and more, all while exploring ever deeper.HighlightsThere are plenty of little things that help this stand out and help to make it something more than most rogue-likes, but the central design philosophy of accessability and the respect it has for the classic elements that make rogue-like games so fun that make it very much worth my time and keep me coming back.A plethora of additions and extra gameplay elements like crafting and landmines which would easily become an annoying chore or distraction in other games has been made completely optional and ignorable here, yet still adds lots of practicality to the game when you spend the time.* The attention to enabling and supporting Steam Workshop content definitely deserves comment. It's been woven into the game perfectly and means sharing rooms, items, monsters and even things like insults and decorations is rewarding.* The humour deserves mention. There are references to movies, old video games and culture not just spread throughout the world, but even in the U.I. and elsewhere.Mistakes and AnnoyancesIt has been genuinely quite hard to find something to dislike about this game and the only things that are worth pointing out haven't really affected the fun I've had with this title, but they're here in the interest of a complete review. The main drawback or limitation of the game is in the simple and, some would argue, boring combat. Fighting thousands of monsters in the same way, typically using the same specific skills and abilities can wear thin and unless you're willing to make some form of goal and targets, or story for yourself, reasons for playing can easily feel empty and flat.* The tutorial is quick and simple, but also very lacking. There are a ton of gameplay elements and user interface mechanics that aren't covered anywhere and usually have to be searched for to learn about, or will simply be discovered by chance.* Dredmor, the end-game boss can feel out of place and the ending can feel abrupt for some.RecommendationsPresently available on Steam for £3.49/4.99€/$4.99 and with no real limit in replay value, Dungeons of Dredmor will take around 20 to 30 hours to complete a successful run, but reaching that run may take you 100 hours or more. As a result, it's very fairly priced and good value for money even when not on sale, yet routinely goes on sale for -50% and -75% and is a must buy for anyone looking for an approachable rogue like.The Complete version costs just 30% more, is available for £4.99/5.99€/$6.99. It is almost exclusively the better choice over the stand alone because it adds Conquest of the Wizardlands and the Realm of the Diggle Gods DLCs which add a total of 12 new Skill Trees, hundreds of new items, dungeon levels, monsters and mini-bosses and plenty more. Unless you don't expect to play more than a few hours or you're on a strict budget then there's no obvious reason not to grab the Complete pack.* Don't forget to install and name the Expansion Pack which is available for free.

												One of the better roguelikes on Steam. With all of the DLCs loaded, there are literally dozens of different skill trees that you can pick for a new character. Not to say that all of them are equally useful (because they're not), and it's entirely possible to cherry-pick an overpowered build - which, if you ask me, is perfectly alright: let people play how they want to. It makes hitting the 'random' button during character creation more exciting.The game's sense of humor will either totally pull you in or will totally put you off. Every skill, enemy, and item you find in the dungeon will have a description that's punny, a meta-reference to something else, and/or just silly. Personally, I love it, but I could see some people taking the game's lack of seriousness as a point against it.Levelling up almost always provides new skills and abilities that significantly improve your hero, so you really feel like you're getting more powerful - it's not just 'your mana bolt is now 1% stronger.'There are negatives/things that bother me:- There are only about a dozen different monster types. Going deeper in the dungeon will just unlock the same monsters with new color schemes.- By default, everything moves wayyyy too slowly. Hit the '+' key at least once when starting out so you don't have to spend hours watching your character amble along through the dungeon.- Inventory management is a total pain in the ♥♥♥. Even with the Wizardland DLC (which I highly recommend), which gives you your very own dimension to store all the crafting junk you come across, you'll still find yourself constantly running out of room because you've picked up a dozen types of cheese, a bar's worth of different types of booze, masses of mushrooms, crossbow bolts made out of six different materials of four different qualities (not even including one-off bolt types!), potions, throwing weapons, wands, etc., etc., etc. Get used to hearing ""Your inventory is full!""- The game's too long, and yet there are options to make it even longer! By default, there are 10 levels of the dungeon. At around dungeon level 5 or 6, your character will probably be strong enough that anything outside of massive monster zoos or a crazy mini-boss monster won't pose much (if any) threat. However, to be able to keep up with the power curve, you're going to have to grind through the levels anyway. With the DLCs, you have the option of expanding the dungeon to 15 levels, as well as having a virtually unlimited amount of wizarding worlds to explore - I would highly recommend NOT doing so.- While there's an option 'no time to grind', which makes the dungeon smaller (yet having a roughly equal XP curve), which I totally recommend playing with, do note that by choosing this option, you significantly alter the balance of loot - specifically, any crafting class will find it more difficult, since you'll run into significantly less materials.- Dredmor himself has been balanced against the twink builds. This means that it's possible to have a character that can clear out the entire dungeon but still be unable to actually win the game. Especially classes that are forced to go toe-to-toe with the big man himself - bring massive amounts of dodge and counter or you may as well just go home.All those things are real problems with the game. However, I've sunk 120 hours into this game and have won it at all difficulties (with permadeath), so I obviously think that the game is well worth playing, despite its warts.			"

												Where's the ""I'm not sure"" for recommending this game?The game leaves a fantastic first impression - it's easily one of the most intuitive, easy to learn Roguelikes, without sacrificing customization and a level of the strategy.  It's colourful, full of personality, and clearly made with love.  Amazing for introducing someone to the genre.It also, however, begins to drag after a while; a complete game with Realm of the Diggle Gods and full-sized floors takes an absurd amount of time for what quickly starts devolving into incredibly repetitive content.  Monsters have little variety, stellar equipment slowly starts fading into a pile of ultimately unremarkable items, there's extremely little secrets or rare content to discover... it lacks the meat, depth, and sense of discovery to actually sustain itself over long periods of time.So to be most specific on whether I'd recommend this game or not: If you don't know what the word ""Roguelike"" means yet, this is a great way to start the genre and enjoy yourself.  But if you're already into Roguelikes, as charming as Dungeons of Dredmor is, you'll find that once you get a game that survives the first ~4 floors, the game is ultimately just reptetitive and boring.

												This is my favorite dungeon crawling game. It has a humorous fantasy theme that I find endearing. The best part is that going deeper into the game lets you see more items and skills and each one has a joke attached. There are 50+ skill trees and you can pick 7 when you start your character.If you're easily frustrated, this is not a game for you. You will be dying constantly and that's how the game teaches you.  That's really not a problem though because the entire dungeon is randomly generated, so you'll get a different experience each time.There is so much game here for the price that I think you're actually kind of stupid if you don't pick this up. If it looks good to you, don't hesitate. I spent over 300 hours playing and it was worth every penny.			"

												This is one of the best roguelikes I have ever played, and this is coming from a guy who generally HATES roguelikes. This game is incredibly well designed.Unlike other roguelikes I feel the game actually gives me a leg to stand on and isn't out to screw me from the start. Its fair, something you usually don't hear in the same sentence when it comes to these games. The game wants you to succeed  and it wants you to have a good time.I also love how huge the levels are, I spent about an hour and a half on the FIRST FLOOR! Seriously, I just kept finding new doors to kick open. It also means you will be sufficiently buff for the next level. Seriously, dont blow through them.But in conclusion. While yes this game may not look like much on the outside give it a chance. Its tons of random fun and has charm for days.			"

												Rogue-like for non-masochistsIt's a beautiful, funny and easy to play rogue-like (turn-based dungeon survival), full of jokes and terrible ways to die. It has options to be played on easier modes than the classic rogue-likes, and has a lot of interesting skills to try, but it is somehow limited on the number of monsters and itens. Playing on ""easy"" (non-hardcore mode) you will probably hoard a lot of powerful itens that you will never use, because you won't need it. Playing on ""hard"" is the same thing, because you will die before you get the chance. Reading the itens description will provide some laughs. Other than that, it's an addictive light-rogue, where you can select the amount of punishment you want to have, so if you are into comical graphical rogue-likes, you may like it.Conclusion:Addictive and satisfying, a rogue-like that makes you laugh and lets you get to the end within less than a lifetime.Positive points:* Beautiful graphics* Very funny item ans skills descriptions* Can be played on ""easy""Negative points:* Not much variation* Lots of useless and repetivive stuff* The final boss is boring			"

												The thing about Dredmor is that, on the surface, it's really just an average roguelike, intended to ease people into the genre by featuring colorful graphics and easy controls (with mouse support!).But Dredmor actually does have a few things going for it:- Workshop support.- Witty Dialogue.- Skill Trees (most roguelikes only have a class system, with each only having one specific ability that you're allowed to build on).- Actually being a roguelike, in spite of its goal of easing people into the system.Dredmor's Skills are on a build-as-you-want-it basis, so you can take a magic skill tree and pair it with a warrior skill tree with some (possibly disastrous) degree of efficiency. And with every update adding a few more skills, you can technically play a lot of classes without having to play the same combo ever again.It's also actually a roguelike, compared to ""roguelikes"" like Binding of Isaac (don't get me wrong, that's a fun game, but it's not a roguelike as some people claim it to be), Enter the Gungeon, and so on and so forth.Of course, it wins on Gaslamp's sharp wit department. You might end up chuckling at least once at all the referential humor the game boasts.			"

												Dungeons of Dredmor is a rather silly rogue-like with its odd sense of humour, but one with an extreme amount of depth to it. In many ways it is extremely simple to play, with a variety of skills to choose and customize your character with, crafting of various types of items ranging from weapons to armor to consumables, and a huge roster of different enemies to fight.Essentially the game is played by traveling room by room. There are multiple stairways which are used to changed levels, and there are also a plethora of different interactable environmental items, and you also have your personal pocket dimension which you can use to store loot.Primarily what is really good about this game is that it is beginner friendly. While experienced players can also find enjoyment from playing Dungeons of Dredmor, one who has never really experienced what Rogue-like games has to offer will likely be the targeted audience of this game. While other Traditional Rogue-likes will generally be more about attracted players who have already played Rogue-likes, it is rather unique to see a game like Dungeons of Dredmor which seeks to attract players from outside of it.Hats off to this game for that!

Then there are addons from the steam workshop you can check out for enhanced gamplay.The sound track is some of the best in a while, and the gameplay is fast and slow in parts, and the AI really gives you a fight if you are not ready for it so watch out. There are a few diffrent gameplay modes for challenge basicly a easy, medum, and hard, with permadeath, or smaller floors with same exp gain. If you have not tried this game yet, this is a must to have for any rpg fan.			"

												Dungeons of Dredmor is a rogue-like in the vein of similar rogues such as ADOM, TOME, and, the most obvious of them all, Rogue (I am not counting games such as ""The Binding of Isaac"" or ""Risk of Rain"" because I don't believe they have enough elements in them to be considered rogue-likes). Although it may be more accessible than any of those three games that Dredmor is similar to, do not think that this game is a rogue meant only for newbies, for the game equally appeals to those who had previous experience with rogue-likes. In addition to this, the game has a really neat character creation system, as you pick seven skill strees which determine what kind of archtype your character is (and, in turn, determines what kind of stats will be increased the most), as well as give you some skills that will help you kick some monster ♥♥♥. Combine that with a very solid combat system and a catchy soundtrack, and you got yourself a good rogue. Now if the humor wasn't mainly pop culture references/memes and the game wasn't extremely buggy, it would be even better			"

Basic InformationTitle: Dungeons of DredmorGenre: Casual, Indie, RPGDeveloper: Gaslamp Games, Inc.Publisher: Gaslamp Games, Inc.	Release Date: 13 Jul, 2011Basic OverviewDungeons of Dredmor is a very intresting and very different from other Rogue-like RPGs I have played in the past. This game has randomly generated levels, along with loads of skills that you can mix and match to your liking. This adds very high replay value to the game, which is what you would expect from a (optional) perma-death game. It's sometimes frustrating to be killed by an enemy when you've spent to long on a play through, but that's to be expected from a perma-death run of this game.Game playThis game has a lot of variation, whether it's randomly generated floors or a huge amount of skills to choose from. Each run is very different from the last. I found myself dying a lot when I first started playing it, but the I kept coming back for just 'one more run.' Then that one more run turned into two or maybe three. The game really pulls you in, it has a great atmosphere when playing it on Perma-death. You never know what's going to happen which makes you more alert for what can happen, maybe you will find a monster zoo and then you have to be careful. There is a wide variety of different enemies for each floor, and each floor has a different theme to it with specific enemies that you will encounter along the way. As for the weapons and classes there is a nice variety for them as well which gives you a better attack damage for a specific weapon type and will depend with what happen you start off with. But what makes this game even more unique is that you can substitute a weapon class for another skill that may or may not be better. You can make the game even more difficult on yourself if the hardest difficulty is too easy for you by having skills that aren't very helpful to you. There are so many traps, and levers that you have no idea what it will activate. Maybe it will open a door, or maybe it'll teleport you to somewhere else. That's the beauty of this game. The attack system is turn-based, so you move once then the enemies move. It can be a simple point and click or you can use WSAD for moving your character, then attacking is just simple being close to the enemy (if you use a melee weapon) and clicking on them to take it in turns to attack.Score (Out of 10): 10 - Very high replay value and variation!Sound & MusicThe music for this game is perfectly fitting for the atmosphere and the game play for this game. Although it can get a little bit repetitive it's still nice to listen to when you are fighting a bunch of enemies at once. The sounds of each thing that you use, such as swinging your sword or axe is all very unique. It is quite obvious that the developers put a lot of time and effort into creating the sounds for each things. I would like to see some more music in this game that matches the atmosphere of the game.Score (Out of 10): 9 - Would like to see some more music that fits the atmosphereGraphics/Art StyleFor me the art style of this game is just perfect. It really fits in with the with the whole atmosphere and dungeons kind of feel. It's not a too series style of art, but then again it doesn't look innocent. It just fits perfectly with the whole gaming experience. Some people might not like it because of the cartoon kind of style to it, but I am just saying it from what I think.Score (Out of 10): 10 - My own personal opinion, you might not like the art styleConclusionSo there is my whole review for this game, it's a very unique type of rogue-lite RPG game. It has very high repay value which always makes you come back to the game. It has great atmospheric music, I would only want to see a few more soundtracks on this game, and the art style, well take it or leave it. You'll either love it or you'll hate it.For more reviews on a wide range of games, go and follow Lot's O Giveaway's curator group here.

												Note: my play time doesn't reflect my countless playthroughs. I can't even fathom the hours I've poured into this on rainy days.PROS:* As roguelike as roguelike can get. Sometimes RNG will bite you in the butt, but sometimes the dice are nice. For the most part though, it's pretty forgiving, at least early on. Most of the time it's just a matter of picking a couple skills that can reliably get you through the first few floors, and by that time you'll have enough levels (and lucky loot) to keep on climbing.* Maintains an upbeat, quirky, and tastefully humorous tone in the music, dialog and flavor text, all of which belie the treacheries of the Dungeons.* Mods galore! More rooms in floors, more classes with unique effects that are (usually) balanced, check out the Steam Workshop and see if anything tickles your fancy, there's plenty to choose from. CONS:* Very bulky crafting system, with an equally bulky UI to go with it. More often than not, you're better off praying to RNGesus than trying to amass the skill levels and materials for some recipe you found. Ironically, the game itself makes fun of how bulky its crafting system is, one joke I did not smile at.Overall, if you like roguelikes even in the slightest, this is a must-have in your library. Get it, play it on hard with perma-death, get really far, die, get frustrated, shut it off, then come back because you *know* you want some more of that sweet Dredmor punishment.			"

												Dungeons of Dredmors is a game that captures the esscence of ""rogue"" games without overcomplicating things. In esscence a game of luck and chance, and dealing with that potentially poor luck. This makes it fun, maybe even a bit unpredictable if you will. Of course like any other game it can drain a lot playing, as it is tedious at times. This is due to how it ultimately (sadly) utalizes a system where unless you chose to be hoplessly aggresive, will lead to the unenevitable level grind. Of course the option is there for it to be otherwise, but that only applies to people who know when/how to back out of risky situations. Moving on their are more things that can make it tedious. The amount of stats is quite large. This isn't going to give it a negative mark though. Every stat works off of a basic system of x+y-q bladabladabla. Overall they're simple for everacheivers who actually care. For people who don't it categorizes them into different major skills, and gives helpful advice as to which role should invest in it.			"

												This is a very addictive rouguelike game. It's a lot of fun, but maybe not as accessible to a nongamer as a more ubiquitous roguelike/lite like the Binding of Isaac. I think it could be very easy to spend hundreds of hours in this game.			"

												A damn good roguelike that is a parody of other roguelikes and contemporary pop and fantasy culture as well.  Chock full of numerous film, fantasy and video game references, it also has incredibly deep gameplay; with many playstyles to choose from and a incredibly complex crafting mechanic.  The modding community is also busy with this game; and there are lots of great and hilarious mods that are fun to play.  A great game at a great value with lots of replayability.			"

												Simple, fun, easy-to-learn roguelike perfect for people looking to get their feet wet in the genre but who are looking for a simpler experience. The persistent sense of humor is what really sets it apart, with everything from mobs to skills to item descriptions having some ridiculous pun or reference thrown in that keeps things light-hearted throughout. While I will say that there are certainly some issues regarding balance of skills and easy abuse of AI mechanics, the game is for the most part well balanced and definitely polished, and definitely worth the asking price.

												""Curse you diggles! I hate this stupid game, I'm so fed up of dieing! Although, one more try wouldn't hurt ...""Another roguelike with the one-more-life addiction working for it. Dungeons of Dredmor ticks a lot of boxes for me. I love the art and the sound and think it works fantastically together. I haven't even scratched the surface of the Steam Workshop for this game, which will potentially add hundreds more hours of fun to it. What DoD does best, is it makes me engage with my characters journey. I'm likely to stay alive in DoD for a few hours, and this makes me attached to what I've achieved so far and makes me want that character to be victorious. Alas, they rarely are. They often meet their end in some embarrassing way, to an enraged Diggle or something (sidenote - I really want a Diggle plushie. That would rock). Just writing about DoD makes me want to play more!This game is superb for it's price. Play it on Permadeath for the best experience.			"

												Just the right amount of randomness.This is my first rogue-like game. If you don't think you can take the frustration of defeat at the hands of Lord Dredmor and have to start all over again from the first floor, you can always disable the permadeath feature and play this like a casual.Pros:- Sick sense of humor, congratulating you on your death and many more funny stuff that you'll encounter in the dungeon.- Vast amount of skill selection with countless combination plus steamworkshop = great replayability- DigglesCons:- My dungeoneering skill does not help me in playing this game.

												Dungeons of Dredmor is hilarious. It's a fresh take on the reemerging ""rogue-like"" genre. The game is a balanced mixture of old and new. Although turn-based, the gameplay moves quickly and is challenging. What's more, the humor is spot-on.The only possible downside is a small, but steep learning curve. You're left to learn from your failures, of which there will be many. This may or may not be a negative, depending on personal preference.Overall, a great game well worth its price of admission.

												This is one of the best dungeon crawlers I've ever played. The amount of content you get for just a few dollars is incredible, and 800 hours later I still find myself learning new things. The humor is goofy and fresh, there's tons and tons of skill combinations, and for once, it's an RPG with a crafting system which is actually pretty interesting. Dredmor is simple enough so that people of any background can easily jump into it and have fun, but there are also difficulty levels for all sorts of players, and enough depth to challenge you as you progress.I've been playing this game for several years now, and it is by far the best purchase I've made on Steam. The community surrounding Dredmor has also been incredibly friendly and helpful, and a wide range of mods doesn't hurt, either.			"

												Many a time I have guaged a game's quality based on how much I think the game should be worth, and how much the devs are chargin for it. For example, the game 1000000. It is a cheap game, sold at a cheap price. And then take BL Pre-sequal, a game that arguably charges more than the content it provides is worth. However, Dungeons of Dredmor has presented me with the rare privalege of saying that this game is worth more than the asking price. Since purchasing and playing many a game, over many an hour, I am happily willing to say that, if it were demanded of me, I would have payed 15$ for this game. Maybe even 20$. That is how much it is worth to me. Any many of my friends agreed with me. Many of their first words of reaction were ""You got this for HOW MUCH?!"". And so I present to you Dungeons of Dredmor, a game that, for some reason, feels the need to make you pay but a fraction of the game's true value. Buy it, and buy it now.			"

												Honestly, there aren't many meaningful challenges in the game. Most enemies are incredibly easy. Most gameplay is wandering around identical rooms in the dungeon trying to find better equipment or crafting ingredients. Most combat is standing on the same tile, waiting for the next monster to walk up to you so you can defeat it in 1 or 2 swings. Crafting would be fun if inventory management were easier. The skills are funny, but they don't add a whole lot to the game.			"

												Dungeons of Dredmor is a roguelike. For those of us who are not elite(ist) gamers, just think of it as a hard hack-and-slash game with procedurally generated content and very real risk of permanent death which forces you to start over (a little wiser each time)My initial impression of this game was a very positive one. It's very easy to get into, has a lot of skills to choose from for character creation (implying lots of replayability, but I was wrong) and it covers everything with a layer of clever tongue-in-cheek humor (like witty pop culture references? this game has lots!)However after playing this game on a netbook for over 80 hours, properly experiencing it in all its glory, I stand corrected enough to say that I would not recommend this game to someone else looking to derive some fun out of their play sessions, unless their entertainment consists in dying over and over unfairly...case in which I probably still wouldn't recommend this game because it simply isn't that good all things considered.First off, a major technical issue. This game is built poorly, seemingly by dwarven plasticsmiths (those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s) It's a little 2D game with sprites that have 2 animations each. Still it actively takes 600MB of RAM, reserving even more than that. On my 2GB RAM netbook I can forget running this and a browser at the same time. Shame, because it looks like exactly the type of game to be played on a netbook/tablet, and not on a proper desktop configuration like the game demands. It also personally annoys me as this seems to be a problem with more and more lazy pixel-style indie games: games that look like they were made 20 years ago demand 4GB RAM and 1GB VRAM. What the hell?Onto the gameplay itself. It's balls hard. Not in a good way as it seemed on first glance. It's unfairly and frustratingly hard. It's unfair because while you have an ample amount of skills to choose from, only a few are actually effective (give you a high likelyhood of winning the game) while others are downright useless. The same goes for weapons (don't use crossbows unless you like taking 4x longer than a character with his bare hands to win the game). This wouldn't be so bad, as every such game has some strategies that work better than others, but this game in particular is very stingy with its descriptions of mechanics. Without reading a guide, you will frequently encounter weapons and abilities whose actual effects are very underwhelming compared to what their descriptions would have you believe. You pretty much have to read a guide before diving into the game, or you'll frequently wonder ""what does THAT mean"" when finding, say, an artifact or another with a typical description like ""The honorable poodles - it is studded with cheese crust and decorated with high quality tin""Once that's out of the way, and you finally have a good understanding of the game mechanics that let you create an effective character with a fair chance of winning...you will run into another problem. Basically, once you figure out how to not die, everything all the way up until the final boss becomes one relatively simple, mindless, long-winded repetitive grind. And the final boss? FUBAR, because even many good builds won't scratch that guy (hints: Magical Law, Burglary, Crossbow, crafting/encrusting in general). A situation in which 99% of the game play is mindless faceroll, and that 1% (final boss) has the shot of taking it all away because of RNG is not fun (again, unless you're a difficulty fetishist). I also have to ask myself why they even made the game with 51 skills to choose from when less than 15 of those are actually going to let you win the game. Could it be that in spite of first impressions, this is not that good of a game?			"

												Why do I recomend this game? Because it plays really like a rogue RPG. You don't have traditional classes, instead skill trees that add spells, skills or passive skills to your character. You'll find a lot of eastereggs (references to other games or movies in this game), some of which make you laugh. And the game is even on lowest level a tough nut. Furthermore it has decent retro style graphics and a good playability, it is nice to be beaten up by a Diggle.			"

												This game is a flat-out, old-fashioned dungeon crawler. You travel through a dungeon killing monsters trying to reach a goal boss and along the way gain the skills as you get deeper. Of course magic included. if you are a fan of games with sarcastic humor, this game is full of funny jokes that make you laugh, but of couse you must pay attention to the details of the room to catch them.

												Have you ever wondered what it would be like to have a Rogue-like developed by a team of roughly 10 people who grew up in the mid 90s and were raised entirely by Doom and The Secret of Monkey Island? Of course you don't, that's pretty weird.Fortunately it exists and it is probably one of the best ""true"" rogue-like games made in the past 10 years.What is it?Dungeons of Dredmor is a Roguelike Fantasy RPG with several pop culture references from the 90s up to the 2010s.If you are unsure of what a Rogue-like is[en.wikipedia.org], it's a gameplay style based on the 1980 release ""Rogue"". In a nutshell, you are given one life to complete the entire game, any death results in a save wipe or a sentence back to the start of the game. As such the game itself is relatively shorter than other RPGs, maybe 2-3 hours with experienced players.In the more traditional rogue-likes, like this game, you move in a square based grid and take turns with the enemies to either pick up one of the 20 or so types of cheeses, find new gear to equip, or die horribly to one of the many monsters in your way.Controls to this game are rather simple, move in a grid based map with WASD and use the mouse to interact with objects next to the player. However, I very much recommend turning off mouse movement. It sounds nice at first, but as far as I know you cannot cancel any mouse movement queues. So if you are suddenly ambushed, you have to take a good 3 turns just to move to the spot you clicked. Which is very bad.Long story short, this is a very difficult game for newcomers to rogue-likes or even intermediate players who understand most of the things. If you really like the concept of this game and must play it first rather than others, thankfully you can lower the difficulty and disable permanent deaths. And it doesn't even make fun of you for it!I highly recommend the tutorial even if you know what you're doing, it's humorous and gives you a good idea of how to play (character numbers good, hp good, damage bad). Further help can be found in this guide that i totally didn't pick because it is only the top rated one: 


Beginner's Guide 
A Guide for Dungeons of Dredmor
By: arbor day

			A collection of some basic information to help get you started, and things I wish I had known the first time I played the game. This guide is a work-in-progress.		


If you want a more casual rogue-like experience to ease into the realm of insanity, I’d recommend trying the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon series of games from Spike Chunsoft for Nintendo DS/3DSIf you want a harder, more confusing, and actively update rogue-like; try Dwarf Fortress Adventure Mode[www.bay12games.com] (good luck)My ExperienceI've ""started"" playing this game maybe 4 years ago when I received it in a Humble Bundle. I played it, died, got angry, died again, and wrote it off as a bad game. Since then I have learned that there can be fun found in losing as well as winning. So, About a few weeks ago I picked it back up and tried to beat it again.As I am writing this (August 14th, 2016), I have yet to complete the game in its entirety, let alone the DLC which extends the game even further. I have met my inevitable demise about 20 times over the years i played this off steam and even now. I plan to make it to the end on my own accord on Normal with Permadeath on, even if it takes me another 4 years.Price Point?5 years ago this game released for an almost unheard-of price point of $5, it is still $5 because you can't really lower it anymore than this. They eventually added 3 DLCs. 2 for $3 and 1 for absolutely free! (under the caveat that you have to give it a name). Since then the made a complete edition bundle for $7, which is obviously the best choice in this scenario.Sales of this game are somewhat common, roughly once every 2-3 months for 50%, with it having a deep discount of 75% at one point.Game Updates?On April 1st, 2012, the devs ""announced""[www.gaslampgames.com] that they would be making a sequel to this game. In 3D with the inclusion of Microtransactions and Social Media postings.As of August 2012, after the release of the third dlc, the devs have no longer added content to this game and moved onto other projects.Thankfully the game has native steam workshop mod support, so you can add a set of items, skills, or re-sprites to add more to the game. Of course there won't be many mod developers for such a small game as this, but there are quite a few at least.Is it worth buying?Yes. If you like the humor from Monkey Island, the gameplay styles of any ""true"" rogue-like, or even want to try one for the first time. Definitely pick this title up, even if it's not on sale.(You're spending maybe $3.50 extra, that's like half the price of a fast food meal for 2)(Also, hilariously enough, there actually is a Doom roguelike)[en.wikipedia.org] "

												Addicting dungeon crawling game. I had to run the tutorial to learn how to use items.  I really wish they would make this game controller supported and make simpler controls.  I love how there is an option to play until you die and not respawn.  The extra challenge makes the game more rewarding, however it does get annoying going through the easy floors over and over again.  I also really like how one can customize the character's skills/abilities before starting the game and how the dungeons are always organized differently each game. Highly recommended.			"

And it doesn't even make fun of you for it!I highly recommend the tutorial even if you know what you're doing, it's humorous and gives you a good idea of how to play (character numbers good, hp good, damage bad).

Beginner's Guide 
A Guide for Dungeons of Dredmor
By: arbor day

			A collection of some basic information to help get you started, and things I wish I had known the first time I played the game. This guide is a work-in-progress.		


If you want a more casual rogue-like experience to ease into the realm of insanity, I’d recommend trying the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon series of games from Spike Chunsoft for Nintendo DS/3DSIf you want a harder, more confusing, and actively update rogue-like; try Dwarf Fortress Adventure Mode[www.bay12games.com] (good luck)My ExperienceI've ""started"" playing this game maybe 4 years ago when I received it in a Humble Bundle. I played it, died, got angry, died again, and wrote it off as a bad game. Since then I have learned that there can be fun found in losing as well as winning. So, About a few weeks ago I picked it back up and tried to beat it again.As I am writing this (August 14th, 2016), I have yet to complete the game in its entirety, let alone the DLC which extends the game even further. I have met my inevitable demise about 20 times over the years i played this off steam and even now. I plan to make it to the end on my own accord on Normal with Permadeath on, even if it takes me another 4 years.Price Point?5 years ago this game released for an almost unheard-of price point of $5, it is still $5 because you can't really lower it anymore than this. They eventually added 3 DLCs. 2 for $3 and 1 for absolutely free! (under the caveat that you have to give it a name). Since then the made a complete edition bundle for $7, which is obviously the best choice in this scenario.Sales of this game are somewhat common, roughly once every 2-3 months for 50%, with it having a deep discount of 75% at one point.Game Updates?On April 1st, 2012, the devs ""announced""[www.gaslampgames.com] that they would be making a sequel to this game. In 3D with the inclusion of Microtransactions and Social Media postings.As of August 2012, after the release of the third dlc, the devs have no longer added content to this game and moved onto other projects.Thankfully the game has native steam workshop mod support, so you can add a set of items, skills, or re-sprites to add more to the game. Of course there won't be many mod developers for such a small game as this, but there are quite a few at least.Is it worth buying?Yes. If you like the humor from Monkey Island, the gameplay styles of any ""true"" rogue-like, or even want to try one for the first time. Definitely pick this title up, even if it's not on sale.(You're spending maybe $3.50 extra, that's like half the price of a fast food meal for 2)(Also, hilariously enough, there actually is a Doom roguelike)[en.wikipedia.org] "

												Dungeons of Dredmor is a very fun Rouge-Like Dungeon crawler. Gameplay:If you just begin the game you might be confused at how the skills work. They are all very unique and sometimes confusing, but you can test these out and monsters and find out what happens, so that isn't a real problem. Gameplay is great, Gaslamp nailed the Rouge-like formula and add some fun quirks. Monsters taunt you in a variety of fashions, Ranging from strange to one that made me kill the taunting monster in the worst way possible. GraphicsVisuals are good and unique, they can look a bit dated, but other than that they are unique and enjoyable.Sfx:Sound is really where I have issue with the game. I like the sfx, but the music is repetitive and annoying. Overall:It is a great game that I would suggest you pick up, and the DLC since it is worth the money.			"

												It's a damn fun game with a fun sense of humor. Graphics are good so your eyes aren't bleeding from looking at the screen. Music is great. Some skills are broken while others are underpowered, but that's just the nature of the game. RNG can make or break you but most of the time you're fine as long as you play cautiously. The game also doubles as a great way to introduce people to the Roguelike genre.Main con is its instability from time to time. Could use a bit more work on the backend but Gaslamp Games has since moved on to solely working on Clockwork Empires, so don't expect it anytime in the near future (or at all, but never say never!)

												I have played 6 or more new characters over the last couple days. Many of them I played for upwards of five hours. Every last one of them has had their save lost or corrupted after the game crashed. Every one. I tried playing without mods, I tried flushing steam cloud, I tried disabling steam cloud entirely, both from steam and the xml file. I want to rant about this and give them a big thumbs down, and yet-How many other games could keep me coming back to make a new character after these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t crashes?			"

												I should sue everyone involved with the making of this game. Allowing it to be sold for a measly $5 is simply villainous, my friends. Don't let my Steam playtime deceive you, this game gave me many hours of enjoyment while unable to connect to the mmo's I typically play due to no internet. In times of such darkness, I turn to Dungeons of Dredmor. Below I will explain this game's pure awesomeness.Pros+ Large amount of skills, each varying, humorous and genuinely useful. You choose seven skills to use at the start of the game, then choose which you invest in which essentially allows you to create your own class with its own skill-trees+ Fitting artstyle and music+ Hilarious, un-matched humor that is always refreshing and never (seriously), never gets old. SKOL! LUTEFISK FOR THE LUTEFISK GOD!! Also that noise the diggle makes when it comes up out of the ground. Sort of a ""doodoodaDUUU!"" that's so damn cute :3+ Randomly generated dungeon every time with just enough pre-made rooms and events to keep things interesting + ^ that and the numerous skills give this game an absurd amount of replay value that goes well beyond an investment of 5 bucks +Very moddable, with tons of great mods already available on the workshopCons- I don't know, you're part of the Diggle Rights Movement? No real cons, honestly, and for 5 bucks who caresNow that we've got that out of the way, let's talk expansions. Each of the expansions add more skills, all of which are hilarious, not to mention some of the funnest in the game (Communism skill seriously rocks) and are both totally worth 3 bucks if you dig the game as much as I do. Also, free expansion? Say what!? (I named mine March of the Diggles, by the way)  In all, if you like roguelikes, buy this game. Actually, if you like games in general just buy it. It's five bucks and I've probably got more enjoyment out of this little indie title than I did in Skyrim.TL;DR VERSION: Infinite hours of fun for five dollars. 10/10 Krong Anvils.			"

												This is a good game. It is fairly easy and accessable for a roguelike (but still much more difficult than most modern games), and the graphics are some of the best in the genre.The trouble with it is that there are much better, free, roguelikes out there like Brogue (for novices) and Z+angband (for hardcore gamers). So if you really need the nice graphics, go ahead and buy it... but otherwise you're better off just installing Brogue. "

												What a game!!!! Im not usually a fan of Turn-Based RPGs but this one just got me hooked instantly!!! I thought to give it a try and what a game!! Its original price is so worth the game, 4 euros is litterally a bargin for such a game. In a game like this expect to die...........a lot. Its a Rogue-like, Turn-based, RPG, Permadeath game, meaning litterally if u die, well ur dead. The execution of all them put together waas done so well in this game. You start the game with your choice of sex and then 7 different ""talents"" you could say, from around 40 different ones!!! You basically mix and match what u want to be and then are put in a randomised dungeon, to survive. I have died 10 times four with the same talents and then just tried something else. Im now playing, still alive lvl 10 with the talents i originally wanted, but with more understanding of the game im now not fouled. Its a hillerious game with great amounts of time and depth put into it. I am having a lot of fun and now cause of this game i might look into more turn-based games. Its a game that i would most definatly recoment to others as its a huge amount of fun. A game well worth 10/10 ^^ :crafting:			"

												I can't remember when I bought this, but I got the Diggle Nog cheevo for the 2011 Winter Sale event, so that could say something.  It took about three years of hiatus and 107 hours to finally kill Dredmor...once.  On Easy (and Permadeath).Dredmor is a roguelike, and I think it's a pretty good introduction to the genre since I've not really played many of them.  You start out by picking from three difficulties, if you want your character to be permanently deleted when he/she dies or not, and if you bought the Realm of the Diggle Gods expansion, if you want to have 10 or 15 floors.  From there, you're given a page full of skills and you're to pick seven to make your character build, as opposed to having set classes like Warrior or Battlemage or whatnot--or you can just pick Random and see how that does.  And then you're given your choice of cosmetic gender, you name your character, and you're sent on your merry way.Everything is laid out on a grid and every time you move or attack uses up a turn, where everything else is allowed to move or attack.  You can quite literally stand with enemies surrounding you and nothing will happen until you do something.  You level up with enough EXP by killing enemies, destroying Dredmor statues, or unlocking doors/chests with lockpicks.  When you level up, you recover all HP/MP, and you're given your choice of your seven skills to raise which will influence how your stats increase.  Skills work on a linear tree system, but you're allowed to raise your skills in any order, between raising them all up evenly or maxing one as soon as possible.  Every skill in every tree does something, be it simply raising your stats by a set amount or giving you interesting new spells or moves or powers.Combat is pretty much ""hit it until it dies"" if you're going melee, but every character can use crossbows provided they have ammo and wands as long as they have charges, no matter what build you went with.  Some enemies use long-ranged spells too, so it's a matter of using what you have to counter their threat.  Monsters typically don't show up en masse during the game except in Monster Zoos, big rooms where mooks and minibosses pretty much Zerg Rush you.  You don't necessarily have to clear them out, but you get a free item for wiping everything out, and it's a lot of EXP, too.  You also get free items for doing sidequests gained by praying at the Inconsequentia statues scattered through the dungeons.  They're pretty basic quests--kill this enemy/group, retrieve an item, use this item on a special statue, etc.  I think Dredmor is a pretty fair game in terms of difficulty.  If you die, it's almost always your fault.  Died to a trap?  You carelessly marched forward without enough Trap Sight Radius.  Fight an enemy to where the point both of you are near-death and you miss, dying to its attack?  You didn't heal yourself, retreat, try to lead it into traps, etc.  Of course, this game is randomly-generated so you can quite easily end up with a bad draw on items and stuff, but one draw of roguelikes isn't the game giving you the tools needed to win, but winning with the tools you're given.  No one game is unwinnable if you keep your wits about you and don't get complacent.  The expansions...well, expand.  RotDG adds monsters, skills, items, five more floors; YHTNTEP adds more monsters, items, skills; CotW adds even more monsters and skills and items, but also adds new floors apart from the main dungeon on top of a customizable safe zone (though the base game has a basic version of this place).  There are also quite a few mods on Steam and not on Steam that add more of the above and with things like additional room layouts and so on, but some may require some or all of the expansions, so watch for that.  So yeah, TL;DR I would really recommend this game.  If you're new to roguelikes, this is a pretty good place to start.  Easy mode is pretty easy, hard is pretty damned hard, but that all depends on how the RNG treats you and how you build your characters.  There are a lot of achievements here...though a lot of them require you to die to various critters.  But you know what they say:  Dying is fun!			"

												Dungeons of Dredmor is a rogue-like dungeon crawler. On first glance, it seems pretty basic and generic as there are so many games with the same genre. However, Dungeons of Dredmor manages to stand out from the rest with it's wide array of skills, items, floors and monsters, it's humor, and how much fun you have playing it. Dungeons of Dredmor has you as a hero to defeat Dark Lord Dredmor. On you quest to defeat Dredmor, you will need weapons, armor and a brain to slaughter monsters across the 10 dungeon floors. DoD has you start off with you picking from about 30 skills (Excluding Deadshot which was removed) and you have the freedom to choose whatever you like. It's a great sense of replayability that is added this way. You can mix and match different skills to see what you like as a player and various skills change your playstyle.. If you happen to mix to certain skills together, you may come up with an amazing combination to destroy some enemies. When you've picked your skills, you get spawned on the first floor. It's good to note that every floor is randomly generated and that the game is turn-based, allowing you to strategize your next move.Now as you progress through the game, different items will be there to enhance your character through different stats, I won't go into detail though. While the same items do pop up on occasion, they feel different because the stats and it's name is always different. Killing enemies will give you XP and will eventually get you to LVL up, therefore giving you one skill point to give you a passive or active skill. As I've said before, the game's large variety increases how much you play. DoD also has a surprising in-depth crafting system that will let you make better weapons, armor and various items like food and potions. DoD also has DLC, which is a must buy. It only enhances the game that's already worth your money.The DLC's add more skills, items, floors and balances the game in general. There is also a decent sized workshop community, constantly added mods to make the game better. Overall, Dungeons of Dredmor is an amazing buy. It's challenging with the option of Permadeath and it really makes you think in a lot of situations. For anyone who loves rouge-likes, you must check this game out. PROS:+Fun and Addicting+Charming+Humorous+Wide Array of Skills+Hundreds of Items+Challenging+Excellent Soundtrack+Permadeath Option+Deep Crafting System+DLC enhances and balances the Base Game+100+ Achievements+Steam Workshop+Bang for Your BuckCONS:-Graphical Style may not be your taste (Grew on me) -Other players have been known to lose their progress-Items don't change character appearance.DUNGEONS OF DREDMOR: 9.5/10			"

												Roguelikes too daunting for you? Can't remember if you drink potions by hitting ""P"" for potion or ""Q"" for quaff potion? Introducing Dungeons of Dredmor with its revolutionary gameplay system: Having actual graphics!Jokes aside, Dredmor is addictively clever and humorous. Half the fun is blazing your way through the dungeons to see how far you can get; the other half is learning intricasies such as: ""just because you have the option to drink something does not mean you should"" or ""A bolt of mass destruction does exactly what you would hope it would do"".

												Goofy and loads of fun. I haven't gotten terribly far yet as I'm not very good but I am not quitting until I beat it at least once! This game does not take itself seriously so if you're looking for a rogue with a somber atmosphere this isn't it.If you're looking for a game that rewards you with taunts for your mistakes (playfully) and has achievements for just about every misstep you can make so you can look back fondly on all your ill-advised choices, this is it.I don't usually like these kinds of games as I find them too obtuse for my enjoyment but this one has something special about it.Maybe it's the massive eyebrows.

												Missing alot of strategy elements and decisions. Very simplified. If feels like the Munchkin version  of what was supposed to be a roguelike. There is a difference between random for the sake of random and an engine designed to be random but with plenty of modifiers and things that affect outcomes and many solutions for every problem. When you die rarely is it because of an element of the game that you didnt understand properly or something that could have been stopped or modified if you had taken the proper steps to prevent it. If you want a good true roguelike from the steam store buy Tales of Maj'eyal or Vulture for nethack(nethack is free so are most of the tile sets, but vulture has a GUI and mouse controls so its easier to play without having to remember the 40-60 commands for nethack). The Nethack engine is by far the most in depth classic roguelike engine on steam even though its over 20 years old. Or get Wazhack for a different style of rogue			"

												It's an ok game after its said and done.  If you're looking for decent rogue-like for its price, this is it.  If you seek something more hardcore, look elsewhere.Edit:  To the dislikers, there's Nethack, Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup, and Tales of Maj'Eyal just to name a few examples of games better than this.  They're also free, have more content, ard are more challenging in general.  At best, this game is for those who don't want to learn how to play any of the aforementioned games.  This isn't a bad game, but IMO its lacking.			"

												This game serves as an excellent example of how something can be ""dinky"" and still good. There are all sorts of ""rogue-like"" and ""rogue-lite"" games on Steam nowadays, and this is certainly among the best.You're basically a person with some customized build of your choosing going through a dungeon with the goal of becoming more powerful and slaying some guy. The story is comical and background noise at best, and the real strength of the game is in exploration and advancement.The one flaw in this game is the art style. Obviously, the graphics are very low tech, but there is a difference between ""good"" low tech (Shovel knight, Braid, etc) and ""bad"" low tech, and this, albeit barely, falls into the bad. Everything around you kinda looks vomit-colored and some of the monsters blend in with the scenery so well that they look like furniture. If it weren't for the fact that items ""sparkled"" when on the ground, you'd really have no way of knowing the difference between a new pair of boots and a corpse. Dob't get me wrong; it's not the worst looking game in the world by any means, but it could easily be made better.In short, this game is cheap and goes on sale a fair bit. It's perfectly for when you've got some spare time at work and things are slow, so you should look to add it to your library when you get the chance.			"

												Love playing this game. Its old school dungeon crawling-rpg goodness. Crafting,lots of skills to choose for your own custom player class,items,weapons,enemies to keep you busy as you venture further and further down the depths of the dungeons.Lots of different status effect stuff to enjoy and hate.The most confusing part when you first play will be what skills to pick for your very first character,but its also part of the fun.Game got a lot of  love from both the Dev's and the players. If  you want something that can soak up over 100 hours of ur gameplay time (depend on how much you like playing with different class builds) I say get this. Has 2 pay for dlc that are actually more like full on expansion packs, and 1 community dlc that is free for everyone.Lots and I mean lots of mods,I play vanilla for the most part but I put in a few craft mods and a skill mod here and there.The game has different difficulty modes for different flavors of players from casual players to hardcore types.For the ol school player out there I HIGHLY Recommend this game.Get the complete version and you will not go wrong goes on sale for a wooping $1.75 for a single and is worth the purchase.Or get a 4pack and share with yor friends.This game falls in my archieve of games to play before you die. Yes I love it that much.			"

												Robust yet simple, deep yet entirely lighthearted, Dungeons of Dredmor is a shining example of a roguelike done in exactly the right way-- Hilariously.This is how it's meant to be. You build a unique character from skill pools ranging from simple swordsmanship and spellcraft to things like math, legal, and veganism-based combat, and proceed through a randomized, turn-based dungeon in the traditional roguelike style- which is to say, slowly, with an emphasis on choosing what you'll do next and contending with the consequences. Commands are never overwhelmingly complicated, with the game dishing out new active skills conservatively, and yet there never seems to be a shortage of ways to handle any given situation. As frequently as death comes (it's the nearest thing to an inevitability), there's always the sense that maybe, just maybe it would have been better to hurl something at that last monster and run away than to have tried to sneak up on it. While there's inevitably some frustration in trekking through a dungeon for a full hour before being reduced to a bloody, lifeless high score, Dredmor eases the pain with variable difficulties and and the option of turning off the permadeath, so impatient adventurers might throw themselves into something brutish and horrible just to get the full experience before rounding out their experience with a swift death, while more anxious players might tone down the experience to something more casual and preserve their precious adventurer until the game's proper end. The sheer extent to which your uniquely-tailored character can actually be developed keeps the latter approach from getting stale too quickly, while the extent to which your handpicked skill trees actually matter from the beginning keeps the quick and dirty approach fresh from restart to restart.In the end, if there's a single thing working against Dredmor's lovingly-crafted delves, it's the entire genre's problem: Every move is its own intimate life-or-death decision, with all the time in the world to choose between as many actions as your character is capable of, and as such it can only have ever been a single-player experience. As tempting as it is to tell your friends about that incredible time you narrowly escaped a desperate one-sided fight by electing to abandon your sword and instead physically throw the monster into a brutal trap, it's an experience you'll have invariably shared with yourself alone. It simply can't be helped- Dungeons of Dredmor is a very single-player game, and yet it still does its best to keep you company. Each learned skill rarely comes without a joke to accompany it, monsters sling petty insults your way, and even in your most dramatic victories, the game's narration will do everything in its power to take the ♥♥♥♥ out of you- but what more can you expect when you're a law-school educated burglar, communist viking, or Regent of Throwing Stuff At People? Dredmor's a lonely experience, but makes every effort not to feel like one.Overall, if you've ever been a fan of roguelikes, Dungeons of Dredmor is a refreshingly unique presentation of everything you're already certain you like, and if you've never touched one before, Dredmor is still a perfectly complete example of everything the genre ought to be, with success dependent on what you do, rather than how fast you can do it. As hard as you make it, as deep as you feel like going, and dripping with wit and charm (and other fluids), this game isn't content to simply kill you repeatedly. It wants to be your friend while it does so.My advice? Let it. Unless you've specifically got a problem with turn-based or single-player gaming, Dungeons of Dredmor is a humble yet delightful dungeon-crawl worth far more than its modest price tag in delicious suspense, strategy, humor, and gratuitous fantasy violence.

												A fun modern roguelike with a great sense of humor. Besides being turn-based with traps and randomization this isn't your typical roguelike; archaic design is thrown out the window and gameplay is intuitive and can be mouse or keyboard driven. There is no hunger or limited turns and permanent death is completely optional across the three difficulty settings. There are tons of skill builds to choose from and most of them are fun and useful in some way or another. Graphics are nothing special but it does look good for a roguelike and there is enough variation between floors to keep things fresh. The soundtrack is surprisingly good and this game is worth about twice what it costs, so buy it if you like the genre. Exceptional replay value.			"

												I bought this game on HumbleBundle so it was very cheap.  On the whole, the game is very much a rogue-like game.  The dungeons are randomized as are the encounters.  The items can be tediously repetitious.  Many of them are reskinned with a different color and the stats vary based on luck rolls.  Still, in terms of replayability, the game is solid.  You get to choose a set of any skills you wish from a pool and use them to run through dungeon levels.  This means you can play over and over and have a different experience each time (while the skills don't combo, they will supplement each other better others).  If you are looking for a challenge (I have yet to reach the end), this is definitely a great game to pick up.  Perfect for a quick hop on and hop off game during your free time.			"

Those who are deep fans of the genre may tell you about all the options that are better on gameplay, and that Dredmor is coasting on the pretty visuals (well, pretty for a roguelike). They're right, but it doesn't matter. Dredmor is still a great fun game in its own right, and a good introduction to the genre if you find yourself enjoying the style of gameplay. 5/5			"

												This is a game I recommend as a primer for Roguelikes.  If you've never played Rogue or Nethack before, play this first.  If you have played Rogue or Nethack...then play this too!It's chock full of adventure, loot, style, humor and most importantly fun.  Permadeath is of course the only true way to play. The complete game with all the DLC is well worth the regular price but you can get this in numerous game bundles for cheap as well. "

												If you're a fan of dungeon-crawling RPGs or tabletop games like D&D, then it's hard to imagine you wouldn't like Dungeons of Dredmor.It's witty, nerdy, challenging, and deep.It can be a little glitchy sometimes (but not in a game-breaking way) and the visuals and sounds harken back to older games, but I've never encountered anything that's turned me off from this game.I think of it like a turn-based Diablo 2 if Blizzard's writing had a great sense of humor instead of a soul-crushing sense of tragic despair.

												This is a fun roguelike that gives you some very nice customization options on how you want to play.  You can turn permadeath on/off, and you can turn on ""no time to grind"" mode, which makes the levels physically smaller (so there's less loot), but the monsters give more xp per monster kill, so there's still the same amount of xp per dungeon level.I'd recommend playing a few times on permadeath mode, because your first couple characters are going to be terrible because you don't know what skills work well together.  Permadeath mode is also VERY intense.  Although I had fun playing with permadeath off in later characters, there's nothing like the thrill of getting out of a situation where you thought you were totally screwed in permadeath mode.Once you've been killed by the final boss in permadeath mode (he WILL kill you the first time you fight him), by then you know what you're doing, and can turn permadeath off and build a good character to beat the game.

												What can I say about Dungeons of Dredmor? Well, first of all, let me say that this is the first time I've played a roguelike and enjoyed it. Immensely. This is perhaps the most accessible, most enjoyable roguelike game out there, with a great artstyle, a metric butt-ton of nerdy jokes and references to things like Doctor Who, Discworld, etc, and some of the most hilarious achievement sets I've seen thus far on Steam (there is literally an achievement for kicking a door until you die from a broken foot). This game has almost infinite replayability, with dozens of skills in nearly endless combinations and enough mods out there to keep the game going long after you've played the whole shebang, Dredmor is a delightful, near-endless experience I'd recommend to anyone with a bit of extra cash on their hands.

The humor is nice, lots of weird off the wall classes making for a lot of unique ability, an easy to read and use UI and still a good amount of roguelike depth. Dungeons are interesting, enemies are entertaining, and there are a lot of interesting mechanics to explore. You will likely get bored after a while as the runs can be rather slow paced at first but for $5 plus a couple more for both expansions.

												A lot of us define a good game by one we can sink a ""£1 an hour of good gameplay"", and in that sense, Dungeons of Dredmor is one of the best investments possible - you can get it, with all the DLC, for only £5. I've currently got 51 hours in it, so it's been more than a good investment, in that sense.The gameplay is... Solid. It's turn based, so  you're hardly on the edge of your seat, but the enemies are unique and the taunts are funny. Lots of references. There's even a fantastic mod, ""Death by One Thousand Taunts"", which adds even more. It's great.Because there's a surprising amount of workshop content for a near-six year old game, some mods add new skill trees, etc., so even if you do a playthrough of every skill type, there'll be new ones to try.I never thought I could play rogue-likes. I'm not that great at Binding of Isaac, though that might be because you cannot save and exit it, however with Dredmor, you can save and exit, so you can come back and replay whenever you want.You can run this in a potato. And get more than enough hours into it to make it more than worth the while. 9/10 a fantastic investment.			"

												A rogue-like for newbies of the genre! Dungeons of Dredmor is a fantastic starting point for people who wish to play an often unforgiving and visually lacking genre. So let's start at price, Dredmor is dirt cheap. At £3.49 for the base game, it's a steal that will offer countless hours of adventuring fun, and this is helped by the fact that no dungeon is ever the same, thanks to procedurally generated dungeons! The story is the Evil Lord Dredmor is here to do bad things and you are a hero who has to kill monsters, pretty generic... However, the game is packed with humour, which is super pleasant and the game doesn't take it's self serious! Gameplay revolves around stat-checking, crafting, combat and cleverely disguised turn-based mechanics. The game is surprisingly tactical and you can often mess up if you don't think about your character's positioning! And that leads me to my final point: Permadeath and replayability! You can pick 7 base 'Perks' in character creation (which can be randomised). As you level up you can evolve these Perks. However, should your character get killed (and they will), you stay dead and start fresh! This is optional for the less hardcore rogue-like players. In conclusion I say if you like role-playing games you should give Dungeons of Dredmor a shot. It's fun, simple and hilarious.			"

The combat is a little like Skyrim, in that you can get out of it exactly what you want. I'm generally kind of cheap, but there is no question about this game being worth its asking price. My suggestion is that you get the DLCs as well. They're cheap and they add a ton of content to an already fantastic game. Plus, you get the full range of mods from this game's wonderful community.If I had to pick a gripe, however, it would be an aesthetic one. I don't love the way the game looks, though it is serviceable. The main character's eyebrows are almost distractingly large. Aside from that, none of the equipment that you pick up or craft shows up your character. This is a little irritating, as it doesn't necessarily give you the sense of progression that one might want out of a game like this. Regardless, however, this game is fantastic.

												A silly, beginner-friendly yet potentially tough roguelike.To me, its greatest strength is the customization - you can pick seven skill paths for each character, which heavily influence gameplay and can result in interesting combinations. Additionally, there's user-created skills and other content, some of which is as clever and balanced as the original game.Compared to NetHack and most similar roguelikes,  there's a lot more focus on clarity, but there's still some things you have to learn through experimentation. There's also a lot more focus on spellcasting and character creation and the (optional) crafting system.Combat is fairly hack-and-slay, which can feel pretty tedious, but there's a ""no time to grind"" option for smaller floors, and synergetic abilities can finish battles a lot faster.The game features three difficulty modes and the option to turn off permadeath, so beginners (and anyone else) can reduce its frustration potential if they want to. On the other hand, the hardest difficulty delivers a great challenge akin to traditional roguelikes.			"

												I got an achievment for the game crashing. 10/10In all seriousness, though, this game is fantastic. It has incredibly fluid gameplay, which is both challenging and addictive. The combat is a little like Skyrim, in that you can get out of it exactly what you want. I'm generally kind of cheap, but there is no question about this game being worth its asking price. My suggestion is that you get the DLCs as well. They're cheap and they add a ton of content to an already fantastic game. Plus, you get the full range of mods from this game's wonderful community.If I had to pick a gripe, however, it would be an aesthetic one. I don't love the way the game looks, though it is serviceable. The main character's eyebrows are almost distractingly large. Aside from that, none of the equipment that you pick up or craft shows up your character. This is a little irritating, as it doesn't necessarily give you the sense of progression that one might want out of a game like this. Regardless, however, this game is fantastic. If you're into dungeon crawlers or rogulelikes, don't even hesitate to pick this one up. It's a real gem.			"

												I bought this game on HumbleBundle so it was very cheap.  On the whole, the game is very much a rogue-like game.  The dungeons are randomized as are the encounters.  The items can be tediously repetitious.  Many of them are reskinned with a different color and the stats vary based on luck rolls.  Still, in terms of replayability, the game is solid.  You get to choose a set of any skills you wish from a pool and use them to run through dungeon levels.  This means you can play over and over and have a different experience each time (while the skills don't combo, they will supplement each other better others).  If you are looking for a challenge (I have yet to reach the end), this is definitely a great game to pick up.  Perfect for a quick hop on and hop off game during your free time.			"

												What can I say about Dungeons of Dredmor? Well, first of all, let me say that this is the first time I've played a roguelike and enjoyed it. Immensely. This is perhaps the most accessible, most enjoyable roguelike game out there, with a great artstyle, a metric butt-ton of nerdy jokes and references to things like Doctor Who, Discworld, etc, and some of the most hilarious achievement sets I've seen thus far on Steam (there is literally an achievement for kicking a door until you die from a broken foot). This game has almost infinite replayability, with dozens of skills in nearly endless combinations and enough mods out there to keep the game going long after you've played the whole shebang, Dredmor is a delightful, near-endless experience I'd recommend to anyone with a bit of extra cash on their hands.

												Best casual roguelike game on steam. The humor is nice, lots of weird off the wall classes making for a lot of unique ability, an easy to read and use UI and still a good amount of roguelike depth. Dungeons are interesting, enemies are entertaining, and there are a lot of interesting mechanics to explore. You will likely get bored after a while as the runs can be rather slow paced at first but for $5 plus a couple more for both expansions.

												A lot of us define a good game by one we can sink a ""£1 an hour of good gameplay"", and in that sense, Dungeons of Dredmor is one of the best investments possible - you can get it, with all the DLC, for only £5. I've currently got 51 hours in it, so it's been more than a good investment, in that sense.The gameplay is... Solid. It's turn based, so  you're hardly on the edge of your seat, but the enemies are unique and the taunts are funny. Lots of references. There's even a fantastic mod, ""Death by One Thousand Taunts"", which adds even more. It's great.Because there's a surprising amount of workshop content for a near-six year old game, some mods add new skill trees, etc., so even if you do a playthrough of every skill type, there'll be new ones to try.I never thought I could play rogue-likes. I'm not that great at Binding of Isaac, though that might be because you cannot save and exit it, however with Dredmor, you can save and exit, so you can come back and replay whenever you want.You can run this in a potato. And get more than enough hours into it to make it more than worth the while. 9/10 a fantastic investment.			"

												Want to initiate yourself in Roguelikes, but, for some reason, can't stand some of their gimmicks? Maybe it is the permadeath? Maybe it is the fact that most of them rely on the Random Number God having mercy on you (Hahahaha! Mercy, what a funny joke!)? Maybe it is the fact that the ASCII graphics do not help you get immersed? Give this a try, then. It has three difficulty levels to lessen RNG impact, the option to turn permadeath off so you are not pressed by the need to constantly play it safe, and the graphics are just awesome!

												This one is an awesome game for the dungeon crawler fans out there. It's a large turn-based dungeon crawler-ish game, a so-called roguelike, with a LOT of stuff to do in it. Well over 30 unique skill trees into which you can invest, tons of unique items, a whole bunch of magic spells and many other things make this a great game for the gamer who likes to have lots of things to tweak and mess around with. Recommended!			"

												The perfect game for any e-emo and otherwise suicidal and/or masochistic person out there :ONothing screams ""FUN"" in your face like dying over and over to random nonsense and that's what this game is all about. Less complicated than the usual Rogue-likes (which I can't name any of, because I don't play such things..I only heard the term before and wanted to use it myself to appear knowledgeable enough to actually recommend this game), this game has a great sense of humor and lots of replay value. Also one of the dlcs is actually for free, so...The whole thing is cheap as heck, but I digress...So you wander around a random dungeon and try to stay alive long enough, to be able to unleash a lot of rage once you die after lots of wasted hours. If all that hasn't sold you yet, you are a sane person. I do recommend :O			"

												Want to initiate yourself in Roguelikes, but, for some reason, can't stand some of their gimmicks? Maybe it is the permadeath? Maybe it is the fact that most of them rely on the Random Number God having mercy on you (Hahahaha! Mercy, what a funny joke!)? Maybe it is the fact that the ASCII graphics do not help you get immersed? Give this a try, then. It has three difficulty levels to lessen RNG impact, the option to turn permadeath off so you are not pressed by the need to constantly play it safe, and the graphics are just awesome! You like Roguelikes? Then WHAT THE HECKLES ARE YOU DOING, STILL READING THIS RECCOMENDATION? Go get it, go, go, go!			"

												DoD is a really fun ""roguelike"" RPG. While the story has no depth, and the presentation of the graphics and sound are extremely basic, the character creation system is varied, and the turn based combat is very tactical. Each character selects 7 skills from a pool of 30+, which cover melee and ranged combat, offensive magic, summons, buffs, crafting, thieving, and more. Each skill can be improved at level up to unlock new spells or abilities. The strategy of combat revolves around knowing where to position yourself, and choosing the right time to use an ability, item or spell. The many different combinations of skills provides lots of varied playing styles. Replayability is further extended by each of the 10+ dungeon floors having a random layout for every new game. The ultimate challenge is to play through in permadeath mode, where your character and any saves are deleted upon death. The low purchase price is ridiculously good value for money.			"

Bashing through the next door, bleeding (from an agressive carrot) you kick in the door, sacrifice lutefisk to the lutefisk god, hoping for something good to whack those creatures only to find yourself at the receiving end of a nasty trap. You're dead. Did I mention it has Emo as a school of magic? And that you can become Totally Not Drizzt? Yeah.

												This game is great.The is is mainly about getting to the bottom floor of the dungeon and slay lord dreadmor. To do that you have to pick skills in the very start of the game and then advantages this skills offer you. Then it is all about tactics and how you use this skills to survive and level up to gain more abilities to use (some which are active and some passive) There is a ton of items that you can equip to your charachters to better face the dangers of the dungeons and also items you can create on your own by using smithing or other create skills.The game offers three difficulties(Basically easy, normal and hard) There are also other types of options you can turn on and off(some which are from add-ons). These options are permadeth(Lose your character if you fail and die)  No time to grind           (Smaller floors) and More floors dungeons with 5 extra floors. There is a lot of quotes everywhere if you like totally random humor which i do. It is strongly adviced not to turn the permadeath off as the only way to win is by trial and error and wasteing time trying to figure out the perfect skills that fit you the most.It is also adviced not go on the internet for guides for the perfect skills. Althoug you might want to use the wiki to get information on in game items and charachters.This game has enitrely radom generated floors.This game offers mod support.WARNING: it might take some time getting in to the game and it might be hard finding it fun in the beginning. but as you try more and know what to do, you'll almost certanly will find it fun.

												Dungeons of Dredmor is one of my favorite games.  It is just so much fun to play, so many small little thing have been refined to just make it a really fun and good game. It has a lot of skills you can choose from, the crafting is pretty large and it really gives you a lot of options on how to play it. If you think the game is a bit of a grind you can turn on ""no time to grind."" It speeds up the game quite a bit.  If you think it is too hard you can try easy. If you think the game isn't forgiving enough you can turn off permadeath. The humor is great, and the interface is really well done, making the game feel very fun to play. nowadays I usually play on no time to grind, 15 floors normal difficulty with random skills, there are still skills I haven't played a full game with, plus there is a lot of community stuff as well so it almost feels like it is endless fun. Though if you are one of those people looking for a cheap thrill through graphics, or If you must have completely laid out for you, this game might not be your cup of tea.  You have to put a fair amount of effort into it to beat it on permadeath.			"

You can copy saves out of the save folder and manually manage a group of saves if you want to further strip the rogue-like elements out and just play for fun.A fun game overall.

The best thing is that, regardless of what seven skills you pick for your character, you are not locked into using certain types of equipment.

												I’m probably dating myself here, but did anyone else play Castle of the Winds? I’m glad that back in those days we didn’t have timers to keep track of hours spent in games because it would have been quite depressing to see my counter on that game.While I’m not a huge fan of the whole rogue-like genre (I much prefer rogue-lite) Castle of the Winds holds a special place in my heart and Dungeons of Dredmor was a wonderful trip down memory lane. I don’t have tons of experience with other titles in the genre, I found DoD to have tons of content for plenty of replayability without the beginning levels getting stale. There are lots of classes and skills to mix and match, the procedural generation is logical and reliable, and the interface is easy to use and navigate. Aesthetically DoD is very charming, I don’t exactly know how you would classify the art style -it’s somewhere between hand drawn anime and south park- but it’s clear that the developers had a lot of love for the game they were making and the world they were creating. This game took me back to a simpler time and I love it for that; Dungeons of Dredmor is a great game to add to your collection.			"

												I feel like this game is the mother of the -modern- ""roguelike"", in that I only remember seeing the extreme popularity of the genre rise after this game was released.  Likely a coincidence, who knows for sure.  In essence, this is THE roguelike dungeon crawler to get if you're looking for this kind of game, complete with its steal of a price tag.This is about as archetypal as they come:  a(n optionally) perma-death dungeon crawler that is turn-based, randomized floors, a lot of randomized loot, a LOT of surprises, borderline unfair difficulty (which is what makes it so fun) combined with fine balancing, a boatload of skills to make a unique character in a large number of ways, strong overtone of well-executed humor, and then some.  Charming visuals and old-school, catchy music seal the deal.I once died trying to kick a locked door down.  No, I wasn't actively going for the achievement.  Yes, there's an achievement for dying while kicking a door down.  There is also an achievement for crashing the game. "

												Dungeons of Dreamor is a dungeon crawling RPG with an interesting take on the turn based approach. By that, I mean that your actions count as turns. You don't go into a battle mode, the entire game works on turns. If you take a step, pick up an item, use an item, use a spell, use an attack, defend... all of these things count as a turn. So whenever you do something, every enemy gets to as well. This is also used in coodowns on abilities and regeneration of health and magic. Insead of waiting on a timer, you do actions to keep the game moving. It's great for pacing. Before you even start playing, you have some options you can set, and then you get to pick from a number of different abilities. So you're not restricted to a class, as in some other games like this. Instead, you just pick whatever abilities you want, which is fun for customization and replayability. As you level up, you can chose to level up those abilities as you see fit, but only one per level. The gameplay, aside from the turn system, is pretty standard. You walk around a huge dungeon, fighting enemies and looting the place. You can also craft a great number of things along the way, provided you have the materials, the tool used to craft it, and enough points in the required skill to make the item. This is where I start to have some issues.See, you can pick your own skills. You can also level your own skills as you please. But sometimes you'll pick skills that don't cover the areas you need in order to make certain items. If you don't have that to level up, you simply cannot make those types of items. That can be annoying. It can also be annoying to have all the materials, the skills, and not the tool required to make the item. Although that can be remedied by finding one somewhere in the dungeon. My biggest complaint is that the inventory you have is a tad small. It makes you have to manage your items well, constantly craft items to use up materials (but that's not always so easy to do), or constantly backtrack to the shops to sell things. I guess you could leave stuff laying around but then it'd go to waste. Having a few more slots would help a lot. I guess it comes with the territory of looting. And with the skill complain, I suppose you just have to plan ahead and know what you can and can't do, which in turn will help you identify which items you do and do not need. Some of the skills in the begining don't explain what they do, choosing to have a joke description instead. This can be annoying to deal with and try to remember what they actually do later. Some of the drinkable and edible items you get aren't specific about what they do either. You might drink something or eat something that puts a debuff on you, hurts you, or even kills you! And the game is littered with traps. Some you can see, some you can't. Sometimes you can go around them, sometimes you need to walk over them to get to another spot. Sometimes you can disable them, sometimes that'll fail and they'll go off anyways. Imagine hitting a random trap that you couldn't even see, only to have THAT be the end of all your hard work. With permadeath on (as the default), it's quite maddening. Still, this game is massive and... very difficult. I've sunk almost 20 hours into it as of right now and and never made it past the second floor. Am I bad? Maybe. But it's pretty easy to die from random stuff. I may have misread this but I think there's something like ten floors normally and fifteen with the expansions. So there's tons of stuff to do in this game. There's even tons of things I haven't even figured out yet! It's an amazing amount of content and playtime for what only costs you 5 bucks. Heck, toss in the extra buck for the DLC and get even more out of it like I did. It's very well worth the price tag and I'm really surprised it isn't going for more than that. It could definitely be a 10 or even 15 dollar game. Dungeons of Dreadmor gets an 8/10 for being an immense dungeon crawler with an interesting take at a great price.			"

												Dungeons of Dredmor combines the fun of a classic dungeon crawler, with zanny and hilarious monsters and abilities. Be an egyption vampire sword smashing alchemist, or maybe being an emo reporter who enjoys traveling to show of your fire magic. Be whatever you want to be, and experience a new way to play every time. For more fun, try to utilze the random abilities feature, ensuring that every time you play with be completely new. Want to compete with a friend? Choose the same abilities and see who can survive the longest in the dungeon. A never ending source of fun and merriment for all who play it.			"

												Character building is one of the biggest draws to a game like Skyrim and you'll find it here.One caveat is that the last boss exists and will be difficult for a poorly synergized build.There's hardecore mode for people who like that sort of crap too, but it's completely optional.  You can copy saves out of the save folder and manually manage a group of saves if you want to further strip the rogue-like elements out and just play for fun.A fun game overall.  Goofin around with builds is great.			"

												One of the most fun and addictive games I have ever found. Endless dungeon-crawling goodness with an enormous array of skills, tools, and combinations, a great sense of fun, and the ability to progress at your own speed. You can always roll up a new character and find something you hadn't seen before, or learn a new trick. The game is a series of dungeons descending to an ultimate evil, with pocket dimensions, shops, and altars to various gods along the way. You create a character with a wide selection of skills in different trees (Archeology, Paranormal Investigation, Barbarian, to name only a few) which you can then level up as you progress. Along the way you fight strange and often hilarious monsters and collect materials to craft or sell. Strange combinations of these produce interesting results, mixing in teleportation, tunneling, invisibility, mind control, and many more!The game is charming, the art is lovely, the creators are helpful and responsive, and the music is pleasant. Try it.			"

												If you like fantasy pop-culture references, irreverent humor, and hoarding items ""just in case"", then this is the game for you. Didn't think I was going to enjoy this game as much as I do, but it's challenging and addicting. At a certain point, it feels a bit grindy, but there's the option to streamline dungeon size such that your spending less time on each floor but still progressing through the game. Plenty of replay value if you like exploring different play styles and challenging yourself!And there's seriously nothing like strutting around feeling like you own the place and then feeling your stomach drop when you open a door to a monster zoo.Buy this game, it's totally worth the price, and you'll have a blast adventuring!

												A fun  and funny turn based dungeon crawler. The only ""downside"" I can think of is that it is very hard to actually beat the game and that it can be time consuming. However, both of those are also part of the game's charm. The game is not meant to be beaten on your first try, it is meant for you to make a character, see how far you can get with it and then try again with a different one, or the same one, your choice. All in all I think it is definitely worth your time, I've had it a long time and still have a lot of fun with it			"

												Dungeons of Dredmor is a pretty fun look at the old roguelike genre, and was a great romp down memory lane. While the graphics are simple, as is the gameplay, a simple interface masks a surprisingly deep customization and talent system. The synergy between different skills will have you experimenting with builds for DAYS. The addition and seamless integration of Steam Workshop was nothing short of brilliant, and when you feel like you've seen everything in Dungeons of Dredmor, provides HOURS of extra enjoyment.Good: Solid gameplay, fun visual aesthetic, good music. Deep and complex customization presented in a brilliantly accesible way.Bad: Some skills are just too good. Whenever there's a skill that me and ALL my friends separately came to the conclusion that it MUST be in your build, things need a little tinkering. Ugly: Not much.Possibly the worst thing I can say about DoD is that the era of the traditional rogue formula is definitely showing its age. The procedure of ""I move, then all enemies move, then I move"" is showing its age as a design process. Dungeons of Dredmor could be that last, best look at a wonderful genre, and I enjoyed the hell out of it, but I think it will be the last true rogue I play. It's time to see what the words ""rogue like"" can do attached to other formats of gameplay.			"

												I have a soft spot for roguelites, even though I'm (generally speaking) absolutely SHÏTE at them. But they're usually a whole lotta fun. Charging into a horde of enemies, battle-axe in hand, loincloth flapping in the wind, and then getting stomped into monster sandwich spread because what kind of a fûckin' retärd doesn't wear PROPER armour when they're out savaging monsters?!But I digress. Dungeons of Dredmor then. I like it. I won't go so far as to say that I love it, but I will just spoil this review right now and tell you: YES, I WILL RECOMMEND THIS FÛCKING SHÏT, BECAUSE IT'S A REALLY GOOD GAME.I feel like I basically cut myself short just now, seeing as how I don't have all THAT much to talk 'bout when it comes to ol' DoD. I mean, the humour in it is nicely silly, without being overly dumb. And I do like that it's not pitching a tent in either the Bulletstorm cesspit or the Duke Nukem Forever leper colony, but the much less unappealing Monty Python-esque silly nonsense, uhh... fish factory. I dunno. I was struggling to come up with something, so I just wrote the first thing that came to mind.Anyway! Moving on. I like that pretty much every single skill in the game is at least somewhat unique, and that they all have some measure of usefulness, even though some are pretty damn overpowered (lookin' at you, Perception (yes, that was a pun, get over it)) while some are... well... less useful (*coughs* veganism *coughs*). But anyway. The ability to mix 'n' match skills 'til your boxers squeal (because the expression ""till your hearts contents"" makes no göddämn fûcking sense!), so you'll have plenty of replay value.The gameplay itself is nicely straight-forward. You typically walk around with WASD, you see an enemy, approach them, and then either bump up against 'em or click on 'em to attack. Not exactly rocket surgery, ehh? But the fact that the game is, how should I say... ""step-based"", I guess? Well, whatever you'd call it, it's the only hybridization of real-time and turn-based I've ever seen that actually works really well.Those of you who've played Fatal Labyrinth on the SEGA Genesis know what I mean. To clarify, enemies can only move, attack, and do other stuff at the same time as you do, but you don't take traditional turns attacking each other. So when you attack an enemy, they'll attack you back. This makes it so that you'll ALWAYS have time to think about what to do next, but the pacing of the game doesn't necessarily suffer for it, unlike in games like Heroes of Might & Magic or XCOM.The graphics are fairly simple and low-key, just to change the topic com-fûcking-pletely, but they have a nicely stylistic charm to them. Most pixel games generally just go for the 8-bit style out of sheer laziness, but DoD seems to take the same road as Stardew Valley or Shovel Knight, and instead have a pixelated style with plenty of details and actually nice colour palettes. Which I obviously like.And now I'm reaching dangerously close to the final point regarding DoD: if it's such a solid game, why do I not like it more? Well, I will warn you right now that it's insanely fûcking grindtastic, and unless you play with the Smaller Floors option on, you'll be doing a fûcking retärded amount-a walking around in the game. There's also the fact that even though almost all skills are in some way useful, there are builds that WILL inevitably break the game, even on the hardest difficulty, and basically turn you into an all-powerful mega-god.But I have to admit, DoD does a lotta things really, really, REALLY well, and since my only complaints with it are minor nuisances at most, I really can't give it that low of a grading. It's also worth noting that Dungeons of Dredmor (unlike nearly every single roguelite out there) does actually let you play on a fairly softcore difficulty level, and while I personally wish there were more options to customize the ""hardness"" of the game, this does make it so that even less skilled players can play it. So that's definitely a big plus.All in all, DoD has a lotta solid points, and while it's a bit rough around the edges, it's still got a lot of charm to it, and it's definitely worth buying, even if you're normally not a huge fan of roguelite games. 8.9/10			"

												So... I am writing this review, because the game pushed me towards the edge of negative emotions. Which is quite sad, because the game itself and idea are really good and addictive, sadly not enough to forgive all the non-stop, gamebreaking issues.The mains reasons why I cannot, by any stretch of imagination recommend this game.1. Game crashes. Crashes sometimes are game-breaking, as the game sometimes just does not save at all. A crash couple times after 1-2 hours of playtime led to completely losing the whole progress until that point and resetting everything including game settings, which is impossible to accept,2. Game does not autosave for no apparent reason. It shows during gameplay that game has been saved, yet when starting the game the day after I'm still starting not from what I have left, but from the very previous save, which feels like even bigger waste of time - there is no way I am going to go through same thing I have passed already and got the good stuff and upgraded my character. It's just not fun at all and misses the purpose, because it's far from similar to replaying the game after death. It makes me not want to play it anymore because I don't know when save will work from the proper place and when it won't.3. Numerous glitches, including popping through doors, attacks that were impossible to hit they still do, I believe it's some sort of trying to give an advantage to silly AI which sucks terribly.4. Game performance is just plain awful. It has not been optimized for anything, and as far as the retro visual estetics go, clunkiness and non responsivness to keyboard is one more thing that CAN NOT BE ACCEPTED in game that has been out there for so long.I swear, don't buy it. It's more frustrating than anything you've met and after reading revious others left you can see these are not an uncommon problems. It will make you love the game, and few momens later you will hate it dearly and want your money back so you can get go get a burger instead of buggy, unplayble game. Shame on you, lazy ♥♥♥ developer.			"

												Having played a couple of days and reaching Lord Dredmor, i must conclude that the game:- has a fun set of monsters- invites you to try out new skill combinations, thus has replay value- has a _great_ music- includes lutefiskbut looking back, there are some negative points too:- bugs roughly every 10 minutes (at least on the linux version), ranging from misplaced items (cant reach) or monsters (4 stacked upon), crashes every 30 minutes (after some in-game time / progress)- the crafting system is dysfunctional (getting a lvl1 recipie in the last lvl of the dungeon - too random, too many ""silly""/useless crafts, 3 ingots for a simple item without stats - ingots too rare)- fun for 99.9% of the game, then Lord Dredmor kills you with 2 strikes- nonexistent help/tips: ""what does potion/mushroom xxx do?"" is part of most roguelites, but a simple tooltip how to use knightly leap or what some stat-gain gets you would be very pleasant.- lutefisk cube: The idea is that you can transform every non-food item to lutefisk and then donate it to the fish-god who gives you a random item. But to have a good chance you need about 200 pieces. But trading a 13k gold item for 1 piece of lutefisk?? Would just need some price/lutefisk scaling. This game is in such a nice and interesting state, but lets call it beta quality and finish up those loose ends.			"

The crafting system is large and well varied, the Wizard Keys and finding graffitti scrawled on the walls with codes to new levels, all the loot you can shake a stick at, in-game vending machines selling you everything from baseballs to ground meat and nukes and Root Of T'char. The greatest thing about this game is how varied the outcomes can be. You have the choices of 6 different talent trees out of 15+ ones and none are ""right"" OR ""wrong."" The game gives you the freedom to play as you please and the Save-Exit function is a godsend when you start delving and you feel tired. Levelling up and playing is turn based and the enemies move as you move.Overall: I have so much fun with this game that I've yet to finish ONE game. 70+ hours on and offline with this game and every time there's that itch to re-roll a character and try a new combination JUST BECAUSE the skill trees augment and vary your gameplay so much!GOOD:-Fair play RPG.-Lots of contents, weapons, combinations, skill trees, items.-So MANY bad/good puns and references to other bits of culture.-Game never really feels 'unfair' or 'hard' as some other roguelikes. There's mostly always a way to live...mostly. Or run away.-Diggles.-Heroic Vandalism!-Do you like eggs? WELL WE GOT A LOT OF 'EM!-SO MANY community mods and addons for this game made by dedicated players. Hate the current skill trees/items? Well replace them!-The monsters yell and insult you whilst you bash their heads in!-Wands, nukes, steampunk, veganism, were-diggle skills, get Wizard-krunked, Astronomy, blacksmithing...gosh!BAD:-The game does have a tendency to be unbalanced at times when it is you happen to delve too quickly and the enemy levels outpace yours and you find yourself getting smacked upside the head.-The same way you can combine types of damages on weapons and armor...remember that the enemy can do it too. Don't be shocked when you get slapped to all hell when you get hit by 4-8 different types at once and get instagibbed with Boss monsters.-The game is rather lengthy and for some players it's a lot to sit through in one sitting. Breaks are nearly mandatory sometimes. Set your number of levels and difficulty in advance.-Do not turn on permaDETH if you're not a fan of dying. Flushing away a couple hours/days work because you got teleported over a body of water and can't swim is enough to make you cry.-Butcher Rooms. Nuff said.-The stability of the game is still questionable at times and prone to some far-spaced but non-lethal bugs. It's a lot to deal with but the game is still stable.PLEASE NOTE that this game is NO LONGER BEING WORKED ON. This is a CLOSED project. Gaslamp has given up nearly all the resources to create the game back to the community to continue making content and debugging and in general have been very, very good to their players. From allowing us to name the expansions, to adding our own achievements, to allowing bug reports in beta they have done so much for this game and honestly...it's a project made with a lot of love.I may be selling you this game wistfully but I guarantee anyone who buys and plays this wonderful project WILL enjoy themselves immensely. I do recommend this game.			"

												This game has many good things going on for it. It has the potential to be an amzing roguelike. Yet it falls short for four reasons 1) Lack of depth. A major part of roguelikes is exploration, synergies and ""huh thats cool"" moments. ToMe, ADOM, NetHack, Caves of Qud and many others excellent roguelikes do this well.2) Graphics; although this purely a personal compalint, but i can look at an @ sign for hours but the terrible walk animation I can not.3) Difficulty, the difficulty jumps incridably steeply, without giving players a good indicator of why, a chance to adapt or means of survival.4) The games length is artificially extended by grinding out enemies and clearing floors to deal with the difficulty cruve.That being said this game simplicity makes it an excellent roguelike introduction to players new to the genre as they wont be swamp with complicated numbers and stats.

												 A nice little dungeon crawler. Though it certainly isn't for those ""Oh I died, this game is obviously broken"" people. This game is cruel. It is clear from the first step you take that the game wants you to die, and if you get to the 10th level without your highscore table filling to the brim, then kudos to you and your epicness. If oyu're looking for an easy, slow game, don't look here. If you're looking for a story-driven RPG, don't look here either. But if you're here looking for a cruel, addicting and unforgiving game, with nice cartoony graphics, and some of the best humour I've seen in a game in years, look here.			"

												Dungeons of Dredmor is an RPG set in a fantasy world. Play as a noble hero who must stop the demonic Lord Dredmora. The once very powerful, was finally defeated, stripped of his power, and then thrown into the underworld. Centuries later, after regenerating his powers, Lord Dredmor decides once again to destroy the human world. Before the start of the game create your avatar. Producer gave up from the traditional choice of character classes. Instead, we assign our hero seven skills that come along with the progress in the game, we can develop. Moving around randomly generated locations (mostly dungeons) kill hundreds of enemies, collect treasures and avoid traps. A variety of weapons includes swords, axes, and magic. During the game we are able to combine items and create them, such as healing potions or better weapons.8/10			"

												Dungeons of Dredmor could be viewed as a casual, beginner's first roguelike. It has a great sense of humor and numerous references that will put a smile on your face. It's quite a long game, and it can get a little repetitive after a while, especially considering that most of its charm lies in jokes that can only really be experienced once. However, the game is cheap and certainly worth the price.			"

												Игра от бога.Во-первых это рогалик. Хочу сказать не самый дружелюбный к игроку рогалик, как например Rogue Legacy. В этой игре первые пару часов вы будете бесконечно умирать от ловушек, попадать в западни и, не дай бог, встретить комнату, полную монстров (Monster Zoo). Зато потом почуствуете всю ее прелесть: игра дает нам возможность самим делать персонажа. В игре предложены несколько десятков черт вашего персонажа, большая часть которых потом сможет развиваться как самостоятельная ветка скиллов. Все это дает нам возможность создать как самых стандартных персонажей, типа мага, война, рыцаря, так и совсем странных, как, например, войн-вегетарианец, по совместительству адепт огненной магии, турист и криминальный следователь. Звучит забавно, не так ли? Это не все, что заставит вас улыбнуться в этой игре. В Dungeons Of Dredmor юмор присутсвует везде: в описании предметов, врагов и умений. В этой игре время, которое проживет ваш персонаж, зависит только от игрока, от того как быстро и хорошо он умеет ориентироваться в той или иной ситуации, как он изучал умения, да и как ведет себя в бою. В игре почти нету места рандому, разве что банальная генерация локации и монстров. Не стоит забывать и про музыку! Она тут отличная. К сожалению самих композиций тут не так и много, но все они очень качественные и самое главное — приятные на слух и подходят под игровую атмосферу. Если тут есть ярые любители собирать ачивменты, то их тут предостоточно, причем как минимум 10 из них займут у Вас не меньше сотни часов. Могу смело посоветовать всем любителям хардкорного игростроя купить DoD, а лучше со всеми вышедшими дополнениями, как по мне, так она эта игра того стоит. "

												Dungeons of Dredmore is a great rogue-like RPG, playing both as an homage and parody to the hack 'n' slash and roleplaying games of old.  What makes this game stand out most is the artistic style and the humor of the game itself, being sure to take itself just seriously enough to remain a very solid game.  Also worth mention is the music within the game, composed by Matthew Steele.  If you are a lover of the rogue-like genre, this game is a great deal at less than $5 (U.S.)			"

												It’s a really entertaining rogue-like with a lot of fourth wall breaking humour. The flavour text pokes fun at itself while the game options offer various degrees of difficulty and decent gameplay. Per usual, turn-based style when the enemies act when you act. The UI can be a bit confusing, mainly when it comes to icons on the character sheet – by the end of the game items can have almost a dozen of effects and the icons are small and look similar. Also choosing the “paths” at the beginning is obfuscated by the fact that you’ll see the progression they offer only in game, not at the character creation page. Other than that, a lot fun to play. Score 80%.			"

												ARGH THIS GAME IS SO GOODIt's a fun little rogue-like (and a genuine rogue-like this time,) where every runthrough is different and fun in its own way. You can try-hard it or mash the random button when choosing your character's skills at start and still have a pretty good time. The game is simple and streamlined where it needs to be and more complex where it should be. Grab the DLC too, and pick up some small mods that don't interfere with the core experience too much, and you've got yourself a fun experience that you won't regret. I'm willing to say this is the best *real* rogue-like (and not just a game with rogue-like elements; Binding of Isaac for example) on Steam.I highly recommend going in on the highest difficulty setting with hardcore mode on.

												Incredible game with an amazing sense of humor, more games should aspire to be like Dungeons of Dredmor. The fun never ends thanks to the games difficult design and many mods from the workshop, Gaslamp games deserves way more than what it has gotten from this game. Considered a casual rouge-like, is probably the toughest on the steam market. I have only beaten the default game twice in all my hours playing, and have yet to defeat the final boss on the Diggle realms DLC (All the DLC is worth buying since its dirt cheap and adds a lot to the game).  You can sit down and play this game or go on and off on a run, personally I like to play this while I listen to a podcast. BUY THIS GAME.			"

												I'm going to be frank here, Dungeons of Dredmor is one of the best roguelikes to come out period. Definitely pick it up, if not for the normal price then at the steam sale or the humble bundle!Here a few bulletpoints about the game:+ The game features a HUGE amount of content with 1 free expansion and 2 paid DLC+ The game as well as it's DLC is often featured in the steam sale, so it can become very cheap+ The amount of skilltrees featured in the game as well as the random level generation guarantees a unique experience each   playthrough+ The variety is yet increased by the addition of mods via steam workshop+ This game has great humor seen in the enemy taunts, item descriptions, skill descriptions or random stuff you find in your quest to slay dredmor+- It's hard as balls! Be prepared to die over and over again. First you'll die at the first few floors, but as you get better you start dying in the last few floors because you're overconfident^^. +- I'ts not made for short play-sessions. Even on the ""No time to grind"" setting which let's you have smaller floors worth the same experience points it will take you 15+ hours to beat to game (or lose those 15+ hours dying from a mistake on the last floors)To be honest the game doesn't really have glaring flaws, however combine the difficulty with the fact that you might spend a lot of time on one character only to see him die can be quite infuriating.

YouTube™ Video: Steam Review E28 Dungeons of Dredmor 

			Views: 143		

			Want something that's totally self-aware, makes you worship lute fish gods, do inconsequential quest and gives you quanta tons of content to sift through?		

Dungeons of Dredmor: An old schoolish, dungeon crawling, loot grabbing, Diggle killing, grid based, rogue-like indie game from Gaslamp Games. Dungeons of Dredmor is a really simple and challenging game, when starting a new game you are first asked to choose between difficulties, permanent death or not and smaller dungeons with the same number of enemies and, if you have the DLC an additional 15 levels to go through. You will not be hurting for things to see and do in Dungeons of Dredmor also, if anyone has gotten 100% on it you are truly one of a kind. Next you are greeted with picking skills, you can choose up to 7 skills from a list of 50 different skills, all offering unique abilities and play styles, and once you've chosen between such skills as Emomancy, Killer Vegan and Bankster you choose male or female and enter the dungeons! The story behind this game is that the evil lich Dredmor was imprisoned beneath the world for being a meanie but, has slowly eroded away his bonds and you are asked to enter into his prison (or dungeon) and stop him!...again! Its dirt simple but, hey it works well and the dungeons are no joke. The game is grid based and combat is turned based, you can click or use the keyboard to move, upon entering combat you trade shots with your foe, (or take turns), the challenge of Dredmor is in how you build your character and, a little bit of luck with finding powerful items and shrines but, mostly in how you build your character. Although there are many skills to pick from some are better suited for dungeoneering than others, some only work better with other skills and there are some that are must haves, make no mistake there are ideal builds for this game. Items come in to play a little bit, especially food and healing items but, the crafting system in Dredmor is deep, there is a lot to craft and I haven't personally seen it but, what I have seen is almost every item in the game being craft-able. There are also skills associated with crafting, so you can build your character around any of the crafts if you so choose (such as being a clockwork, steam-punk knight) and, crafting things is as simple as having the crafting kit and using it with the correct items and there are a TON of items to craft. The graphics are also nice with this mix of hand painted/ comic look style, the game also runs as smooth as butter and, looks so simple you should be able to run it on just about anything so it's a great game for laptops. My only complaint about the graphics is more of a personal desire, the game shows you all these really neat hand-drawn items that look totally badass however, it never shows on your character; your character always will have the same frilly Guybrush Threepwood outfit regardless of the badass armor and traffic cone you have equipped, that kind of detail would have been greatly appreciated. Music in the game is excellent, with lots of organ, piano and strings, giving a sort of melancholy tune alongside some quirky upbeat tunes. The tracks tend to repeat if you linger on a floor too long so that may be a downside depending on how much you like it and, the music is what you'll listen to the majority of the games (in fact it often overpowers the other sounds of the game) so it’s a good thing it’s an awesome soundtrack.Dungeons of Dredmor is funny and challenging, a great game to play anywhere and caters to a lot of playstyles, it’s a solid experience and gives you a huge amount of content to enjoy for a cheap price of $4.99 USD. For $6.99 USD you can get the complete set which I honestly suggest because it’s a great deal for the amount of added content you get even if you don’t end up seeing all of it. If you want a challenge, or a never ending rogue-like game, enter the Dungeons of Dredmor!TL/DR; Dungeons of Dredmor is a rogue-like dungeon crawler with a HUGE amount of content for $4.99 USD, it’s got humor, charm and challenge, with plenty to do and replay ability to the Nth degree. It’s really cheap for what you get, Gaslamp Games certainly is giving you bang for your buck, honestly, if you don’t own the game, consider getting the full package for $6.99 USD, it’s just a few extra bucks and well worth it, plus the DLC by itself is $5.98 USD on its own so don’t waste your money unnecessarily! Check it out and support these guys so we can get more greatness in the future! -Double Thumbs up from RoyialVideo Reviews: youtube.com/RoyialNetwork "

												I've logged over 600 hours on Dredmor. I may log 600 more. The level of character customization (especially with the expansions) is incredible. The game is tough, and nearly every death leaves me thinking ""DAMN! That was MY fault. Okay, time to start again and THIS time I won't get careless and screw it up!"" followed by my screwing it up again.It's a game I've played in 10 minute intervals and in 8-hour sessions. And the game is genuinely funny (which is rare in my world). I've been playing video games since the Atari 5200, and Dungeons of Dredmor is Top 5 material for me. The game + expansions can be had for just over $10 - an absolute steal.			"

												ARGH THIS GAME IS SO GOODIt's a fun little rogue-like (and a genuine rogue-like this time,) where every runthrough is different and fun in its own way. You can try-hard it or mash the random button when choosing your character's skills at start and still have a pretty good time. The game is simple and streamlined where it needs to be and more complex where it should be. Grab the DLC too, and pick up some small mods that don't interfere with the core experience too much, and you've got yourself a fun experience that you won't regret. I'm willing to say this is the best *real* rogue-like (and not just a game with rogue-like elements; Binding of Isaac for example) on Steam.I highly recommend going in on the highest difficulty setting with hardcore mode on.

												A game that is both a roguelike and hilarious. There are not many games like this. Packed with nerdy references galor and infinite replayability, it's hard to not adore this game. Tons of skills to choose from (even more if you get the $3 expansion), including skills such as Necronomiconomics, Psionics, Mathemagic, Golemancy, and Fungal Arts. There are tons of skills to choose from to make your ideal ""hero"". There are also a variety of difficulties/modes to play on, and since every floor of the dungeon is randomly generated, you'll always be surprised. This is one of the funnest indie games I have ever played, and I think it deserves more attention.The expansion, Realm of the Diggle Gods, introduced the skills Big Game Hunter, Emomancy, Werediggle, Killer Vegan, Piracy, and Demonologist, along with100 new items, 5 new dungeon levels, and many other little things. It also doubles the amount of genders you can choose for your character.			"

												I'm going to be frank here, Dungeons of Dredmor is one of the best roguelikes to come out period. Definitely pick it up, if not for the normal price then at the steam sale or the humble bundle!Here a few bulletpoints about the game:+ The game features a HUGE amount of content with 1 free expansion and 2 paid DLC+ The game as well as it's DLC is often featured in the steam sale, so it can become very cheap+ The amount of skilltrees featured in the game as well as the random level generation guarantees a unique experience each   playthrough+ The variety is yet increased by the addition of mods via steam workshop+ This game has great humor seen in the enemy taunts, item descriptions, skill descriptions or random stuff you find in your quest to slay dredmor+- It's hard as balls! Be prepared to die over and over again. First you'll die at the first few floors, but as you get better you start dying in the last few floors because you're overconfident^^. +- I'ts not made for short play-sessions. Even on the ""No time to grind"" setting which let's you have smaller floors worth the same experience points it will take you 15+ hours to beat to game (or lose those 15+ hours dying from a mistake on the last floors)To be honest the game doesn't really have glaring flaws, however combine the difficulty with the fact that you might spend a lot of time on one character only to see him die can be quite infuriating.

YouTube™ Video: Steam Review E28 Dungeons of Dredmor 

			Views: 143		

			Want something that's totally self-aware, makes you worship lute fish gods, do inconsequential quest and gives you quanta tons of content to sift through?		

Dungeons of Dredmor: An old schoolish, dungeon crawling, loot grabbing, Diggle killing, grid based, rogue-like indie game from Gaslamp Games. Dungeons of Dredmor is a really simple and challenging game, when starting a new game you are first asked to choose between difficulties, permanent death or not and smaller dungeons with the same number of enemies and, if you have the DLC an additional 15 levels to go through. You will not be hurting for things to see and do in Dungeons of Dredmor also, if anyone has gotten 100% on it you are truly one of a kind. Next you are greeted with picking skills, you can choose up to 7 skills from a list of 50 different skills, all offering unique abilities and play styles, and once you've chosen between such skills as Emomancy, Killer Vegan and Bankster you choose male or female and enter the dungeons! The story behind this game is that the evil lich Dredmor was imprisoned beneath the world for being a meanie but, has slowly eroded away his bonds and you are asked to enter into his prison (or dungeon) and stop him!...again! Its dirt simple but, hey it works well and the dungeons are no joke. The game is grid based and combat is turned based, you can click or use the keyboard to move, upon entering combat you trade shots with your foe, (or take turns), the challenge of Dredmor is in how you build your character and, a little bit of luck with finding powerful items and shrines but, mostly in how you build your character. Although there are many skills to pick from some are better suited for dungeoneering than others, some only work better with other skills and there are some that are must haves, make no mistake there are ideal builds for this game. Items come in to play a little bit, especially food and healing items but, the crafting system in Dredmor is deep, there is a lot to craft and I haven't personally seen it but, what I have seen is almost every item in the game being craft-able. There are also skills associated with crafting, so you can build your character around any of the crafts if you so choose (such as being a clockwork, steam-punk knight) and, crafting things is as simple as having the crafting kit and using it with the correct items and there are a TON of items to craft. The graphics are also nice with this mix of hand painted/ comic look style, the game also runs as smooth as butter and, looks so simple you should be able to run it on just about anything so it's a great game for laptops. My only complaint about the graphics is more of a personal desire, the game shows you all these really neat hand-drawn items that look totally badass however, it never shows on your character; your character always will have the same frilly Guybrush Threepwood outfit regardless of the badass armor and traffic cone you have equipped, that kind of detail would have been greatly appreciated. Music in the game is excellent, with lots of organ, piano and strings, giving a sort of melancholy tune alongside some quirky upbeat tunes. The tracks tend to repeat if you linger on a floor too long so that may be a downside depending on how much you like it and, the music is what you'll listen to the majority of the games (in fact it often overpowers the other sounds of the game) so it’s a good thing it’s an awesome soundtrack.Dungeons of Dredmor is funny and challenging, a great game to play anywhere and caters to a lot of playstyles, it’s a solid experience and gives you a huge amount of content to enjoy for a cheap price of $4.99 USD. For $6.99 USD you can get the complete set which I honestly suggest because it’s a great deal for the amount of added content you get even if you don’t end up seeing all of it. If you want a challenge, or a never ending rogue-like game, enter the Dungeons of Dredmor!TL/DR; Dungeons of Dredmor is a rogue-like dungeon crawler with a HUGE amount of content for $4.99 USD, it’s got humor, charm and challenge, with plenty to do and replay ability to the Nth degree. It’s really cheap for what you get, Gaslamp Games certainly is giving you bang for your buck, honestly, if you don’t own the game, consider getting the full package for $6.99 USD, it’s just a few extra bucks and well worth it, plus the DLC by itself is $5.98 USD on its own so don’t waste your money unnecessarily! Check it out and support these guys so we can get more greatness in the future! -Double Thumbs up from RoyialVideo Reviews: youtube.com/RoyialNetwork "

												One of my favourite games of all time. Countless hours of fun, and it's just the right dificulty to keep you coming back for more, with your experiences never being the same.

												I've logged over 600 hours on Dredmor. I may log 600 more. The level of character customization (especially with the expansions) is incredible. The game is tough, and nearly every death leaves me thinking ""DAMN! That was MY fault. Okay, time to start again and THIS time I won't get careless and screw it up!"" followed by my screwing it up again.It's a game I've played in 10 minute intervals and in 8-hour sessions. And the game is genuinely funny (which is rare in my world). I've been playing video games since the Atari 5200, and Dungeons of Dredmor is Top 5 material for me. The game + expansions can be had for just over $10 - an absolute steal.			"

												Incredible game with an amazing sense of humor, more games should aspire to be like Dungeons of Dredmor. The fun never ends thanks to the games difficult design and many mods from the workshop, Gaslamp games deserves way more than what it has gotten from this game. Considered a casual rouge-like, is probably the toughest on the steam market. I have only beaten the default game twice in all my hours playing, and have yet to defeat the final boss on the Diggle realms DLC (All the DLC is worth buying since its dirt cheap and adds a lot to the game).  You can sit down and play this game or go on and off on a run, personally I like to play this while I listen to a podcast. BUY THIS GAME.			"

												A fun dungeon crawler. Combat can be a little slow, and the graphics could use some improvement, but the well-implemented RNG elements, item drops, and crafting mechanics make up for this. Difficulty settings range from easy to imbalanced with the option of making playing in roguelike mode, which is a nice touch if you're looking for a challenge.9/10 Recommended			"

												Unique and challenging at times, it's a joy to play. The humour and various references are great. There are numerous skills that you can mix and match to become whoever you. An axe weilding communist vampire? An archealogist dual sheild weilding vegan? The choices are endless and the mods from the Workshop can add countless more.I've only beaten the game twice but its still fun to try new combinations and see what works and what doesn't.  I usually come back to this game every few months spend hours playing it.  Its a unique game( at least for me, i had never played  a roguelike before) and i just enjoy the humour.

												I wasted 29 hours on this game until the corrupted savegame error hit me. That's when I completely lost interest in it. There's no fix for it. I do not want to work with a game where I constantly have to keep working around and muddle with save games in windows folders and backup copies. This is not the MS-DOS era. Although I did enjoy the first hours, this bug simply kills all enjoyment because it means you will have to start a fresh new game from the start.Simply not recommended.			"

												Warning, if you've never played this game, minor spoilers ahead. (Like, really minor, but spoilers nonetheless.)This game is a unique combination of simple, easy, difficult, relaxing, laid-back, humorous, and just general old-fashioned fun. Holy crap it's fun. Basically you crawl your way through levels of the dungeon to get to the main bad-guy, accumulating a number of unique and silly items, skills, and badassery. Levelling up always feels good, and gaining a skill almost always has a noticeable affect on your combat.Fair warning, you will die a lot. And if you're like me and love pain, you'll play on perma-death (which is optional). On about my fifth character, I was really getting into the swing of things. I had tons of items. I had a pocket dimension I could go to to dump unwanted detritus that might be useful in the future, and I'd just made it through the second floor (still haven't seen the third; the floors are fairly big and ooze with content and monsters). I was fairly powerful at this point, at least for the floor I was on, and easily laid waste to waves of monsters with the help of my zombies and clouds of poison that I conjured. So, feeling like a badass, I hopped over to my pocket dimension to drop off some loot, when I noticed that from said dimension I could also leap to other dimensions! ""Okay, cool,"" so I did. Plowed through one small dimension, no sweat. So I go to another, run into two monsters, kill myself with my own poison cloud. It was my fault for not paying attention, but alllll the hard work, the several hours I'd put into his skills, levels, items. Gone!At that point I said to myself, ""Okay, this is probably the point where going back to the first dungeon just becomes a tedious grind, and I won't want to play anymore."" Well tonight I felt like trying again, trying some new skills. Frankly, it's no less fun than when I played for the first time. The floors are all randomly generated, so it's never the same run between characters.My current character has kicks that literally explode into fire, tearing through enemies like nothing, and I'm only on the first floor.It's not just the content, it's the little quirks. You can tell the developers had a blast making this game. Everything shines with creativity and humour, and it's just a lovely little game gah I love it.10/10, recommended a thousand times yes. It's cheap, you should buy it with the expansions. Get ready to lose at least a few hours a day.			"

												A very fun little rouge-like game where you have a lot of synergy with many off the abilities, some of which are just made for humor like vampire and the ability to sparkle or communism and a ability to drop a bomb. It's one hell of a time waster, but at the same time you can actually cut down the size of the dungeon with NO reprecussions. None. No achievements are affected either. Really, it's a lot of fun, especially as you can wear some light armour with magic which paths the way to making something like a Magus from Pathfinder's Ultimate Magic or Arcane duelist from D&D 3.5 or, again, Pathfinder.

												This is a Roguelike done right: you can play casually and die horribly in a thousand ways and that's fun. Or you can take it a bit more seriously and get really close to winning before dying horribly and that's frustrating fun. Or you can play really really seriously and actually win the thing and that is freaking awesome. But however you play there's good art, excellent music, and tons and tons and TONS of items with great descriptions for you to read through. Add on the crafting system and all the skill trees and this game is basically just built out of replayability.			"

												Dungeons of Dredmor is an excellently done Rouge-like RPG game. With the huge ammount of different skills, all of which are completely unique, all the references in the game and also all the humor that is in it, the game feels like no other one. All the expansions (DLCs) are really well done and it feels that they are actually a big part of the game. My favourite DLC (or expansion) is ""Conquest of the Wizardlands"", adding the ability to customize your pocket dimension, find magical graffiti in the dungeon and use the codes from the magical graffiti in your pocket dimension to open ""Portals to distant lands"", one of them being the ""Diggle Hell"". Dungeons of Dredmor is one of the best RPG games I have ever seen. It is addictive as hell, you can play it always and it never gets boring, because every time you play, the dungeon is completely different. The reason why it's not a 10/10 is that I would like to see the gear I wear on my character when it is equipped. That feature feels missing from the game. Final Rating: 9 / 10MUST OWN			"

SummaryTo get the basics of the game out of the way, Dungeons of Dredmor is a hilarious turn-based dungeon crawler RPG with optional permanent death (if you play without it you're missing the point in my completely subjective opinion) and brutal difficulty. I frickin' love this game and I will organize my more detailed thoughts about it in a Pros and Cons list:Pros:-Consistent(-ly silly) visual style throughout the artwork and sprites, which is retro-ish but doesn't go too far and compromise on necessary artistic detail. (Honestly, I really hate looking at a game with ""CLASSIC RETRO NOSTALGIA GRAPHICS"" only to feel like whoever made the art was just being lazy)-Charming audio design. The music is a bit repetive, but the sound effects of the enemies and spells are sometimes as silly as their descriptions. The real beauty of the ""sounds of Dredmor"", though, is in the announcer, who has a deliberately inconsistent and ridiculous tone of voice which reminds me in a good way of the announcer from Gauntlet Legends. Much like the artstyle it is simple but funny and effective.-Functional UI that adequately accommodates the many complex systems of the games. It's not perfect but it gets the job done.-A fair number of skills to choose from and combine to make new characters, with many unique playstyles able to be experienced. I've heard that past roguelikes have had more deep character building and stats, but I think what DoD has is perfectly acceptable and still gives a lot of replayability.-A very large amount of equipment and consumables available to collect, with an enchantment system that revolves around randomly added statistics and the possibility of ruining your equipment. This is where you will find the most referential content in the game.-Absurd enemy types (think ""mustache golems"") that randomly spout out movie references and generally hilarious dialogue.-Absolutely every item/skill/enemy/random dungeon furniture description is worth reading. This is the strongest part of the game, in my opinion, and it make you chuckle even after playing for dozens of hours-It has 3 difficulty options and toggle-able permanent death (please use this dear god why would you even play a roguelike without the perma death). Generally the game is pretty difficult and intentionally so, but you have options and that's a plus no matter what.-Very cheap, the whole game and all DLC can be bought for less than $5 and that is incredible value in my opinion.Cons:-Some skills and skill combinations are just too reliant on finding good items or are outright too weak. While this trend is not uncommon in roguelikes, in a game that presents itself as a silly RPG, sometimes you just want to do something silly and make it work.-There is a lot of RNG, ei random chance, involved in the combat and the acquisition of more powerful equipment which you have to get in order to progress to later levels, and so the game can f**k you over pretty bad if you are not prepared to deal with unexpected situations or you just don't get any good drops.-The capabilities of the enemies and their AI are fairly limited throughout almost every level of the dungeons; 90% of them either avoid you and throw out random spells from afar or try to brawl with you at melee range no matter the circumstance (every enemy has a melee attack of some sort, fyi). The last 10% consists of the very few enemies that casts spells while also slowly advancing towards you and the mechanics that are unique to any bosses (which may or may not exist) that I have not encountered yet.

The animations are cute and detailed at the same time and the gameplay itself is quite complex, and can be extremely hard even. Even though the game presents itself as a humorous turn-based dungeon crawler.I just love exploring every part of the dungeon. Until I get myself in trouble that is, which usually doesn't take all that long. You'll die a lot in this game so it's advised to safe often. But somehow dying never frustrates. You'll just load your savegame or start an entire new game. Both choices can be fun. So... Like I said; excellent game. Highly recommended ![Rating: 77/100]			"

												This game was recommended to me by one of my friends. He absolutely rants and raves about how much fun he has with it... I'm not sure that we should be friends anymore. This game is extremely boring. The enemies are simple recolorings, the combat is not challenging other than trying to stay awake, and the levels are bland.The humor in the game is slightly funny at first... But this is not enough to keep anyone interested on this alone. The battle mechanics are repetitive and the only real strategy is to funnel the enemies into a hallway where they can't attack more than 1 or 2 at a time and hack away. The graphics are HORRIBLE. A few floors in the background/floor/wall/everything looks like a gravel driveway with vomit mixed in.At some point, I stopped playing the game, and just started seeing how many characters I could create with some form of ""eyebrow"" in their name... And then I shelved it....  Overall, I'd say if you've never played a top down turn based roguelike, or if you want a reason to never play  another top down turn based roguelike, maybe pick this up when it's on sale. If you want a game that will keep you interested for more than half an hour without feeling like repeatedly clicking on an icon in windows 3.0, pass this up completely. "

												Dungeons of Dredmor is an excellently done Rouge-like RPG game. With the huge ammount of different skills, all of which are completely unique, all the references in the game and also all the humor that is in it, the game feels like no other one. All the expansions (DLCs) are really well done and it feels that they are actually a big part of the game. My favourite DLC (or expansion) is ""Conquest of the Wizardlands"", adding the ability to customize your pocket dimension, find magical graffiti in the dungeon and use the codes from the magical graffiti in your pocket dimension to open ""Portals to distant lands"", one of them being the ""Diggle Hell"". Dungeons of Dredmor is one of the best RPG games I have ever seen. It is addictive as hell, you can play it always and it never gets boring, because every time you play, the dungeon is completely different. The reason why it's not a 10/10 is that I would like to see the gear I wear on my character when it is equipped. That feature feels missing from the game. Final Rating: 9 / 10MUST OWN			"

SummaryTo get the basics of the game out of the way, Dungeons of Dredmor is a hilarious turn-based dungeon crawler RPG with optional permanent death (if you play without it you're missing the point in my completely subjective opinion) and brutal difficulty. I frickin' love this game and I will organize my more detailed thoughts about it in a Pros and Cons list:Pros:-Consistent(-ly silly) visual style throughout the artwork and sprites, which is retro-ish but doesn't go too far and compromise on necessary artistic detail. (Honestly, I really hate looking at a game with ""CLASSIC RETRO NOSTALGIA GRAPHICS"" only to feel like whoever made the art was just being lazy)-Charming audio design. The music is a bit repetive, but the sound effects of the enemies and spells are sometimes as silly as their descriptions. The real beauty of the ""sounds of Dredmor"", though, is in the announcer, who has a deliberately inconsistent and ridiculous tone of voice which reminds me in a good way of the announcer from Gauntlet Legends. Much like the artstyle it is simple but funny and effective.-Functional UI that adequately accommodates the many complex systems of the games. It's not perfect but it gets the job done.-A fair number of skills to choose from and combine to make new characters, with many unique playstyles able to be experienced. I've heard that past roguelikes have had more deep character building and stats, but I think what DoD has is perfectly acceptable and still gives a lot of replayability.-A very large amount of equipment and consumables available to collect, with an enchantment system that revolves around randomly added statistics and the possibility of ruining your equipment. This is where you will find the most referential content in the game.-Absurd enemy types (think ""mustache golems"") that randomly spout out movie references and generally hilarious dialogue.-Absolutely every item/skill/enemy/random dungeon furniture description is worth reading. This is the strongest part of the game, in my opinion, and it make you chuckle even after playing for dozens of hours-It has 3 difficulty options and toggle-able permanent death (please use this dear god why would you even play a roguelike without the perma death). Generally the game is pretty difficult and intentionally so, but you have options and that's a plus no matter what.-Very cheap, the whole game and all DLC can be bought for less than $5 and that is incredible value in my opinion.Cons:-Some skills and skill combinations are just too reliant on finding good items or are outright too weak. While this trend is not uncommon in roguelikes, in a game that presents itself as a silly RPG, sometimes you just want to do something silly and make it work.-There is a lot of RNG, ei random chance, involved in the combat and the acquisition of more powerful equipment which you have to get in order to progress to later levels, and so the game can f**k you over pretty bad if you are not prepared to deal with unexpected situations or you just don't get any good drops.-The capabilities of the enemies and their AI are fairly limited throughout almost every level of the dungeons; 90% of them either avoid you and throw out random spells from afar or try to brawl with you at melee range no matter the circumstance (every enemy has a melee attack of some sort, fyi). The last 10% consists of the very few enemies that casts spells while also slowly advancing towards you and the mechanics that are unique to any bosses (which may or may not exist) that I have not encountered yet.

												I must say that I have been eyeing this game for a while, seeing it and its low price and thinking ""wow, that game doesn't look that bad and it's only five dollars."", but let me tell you, its worth way more. This game is so captivating and fun to play that I can just get lost in it, even though I have only been playing for roughly 4 hours. Today, my aunt told me if I watch her dogs until she comes home, she will pay me $10 an hour that I am here and I get to bring my computer. This game was a LIFESAVER because I have been here since 3:00 and its almost 11:00. One of the dogs is blind, so nothing to worry about there, and the other is a cripple, so nothing to worry about there either. Neither of them move and I would have been so bored but this game was so interesting with its skills that let you do a wide variety of spells and other such abilitys. If you like turn based RPGs, then this is the one if you want to know what an original classic is like. By the way, the Diggles are the best enemy ever they are so CUTE!			"

By the time I got to character level 10 on dungeon level 5 I was so incredibly bored with the gameplay that I accidentally didnt watch my health bar and died.The difference between my experience with this game and others is that when I accidentally died I was glad that I didn't have to play any more because it was so incredibly boring.If you like this game, just go download Nethack or Zangband for free.

												I love it. If you need a roguelike rpg fix, this is it straight up. If you prefer your roguelike a bit on the ""lite"" side you can turn off save deletion after death (thus no permadeath). There's so many elements that you get to chose when it comes to creating your character. Want a sword weilding mage that can smith and knows some alchemy and goes berserk often? Sure! Want a martial arts healing necromancer that can lob some fire around? Done.  I give this game a perfect score but also would reccomend some minor tweaks, they don't detract from the game in my opinion but would be nice. First off I would like more character graphics options. Hairstyles, colors, outfits etc. And perhaps a music filter so we can make sure our favorite of the game's clever soundtracks play. Best 6$ I've spent on here otherwise.			"

												A great entry level roguelike with a good sense of humour. Just as most of the games of this genre, it's fun as long as you're striving for survival. Once you find a self-sustaining skill build, get lucky with items AND don't do any mistakes, it becomes easy and kinda repetitive, but those are circumstances some players might never experience and therefore they could enjoy the game even more. I only wish monster zoos were either implemented differently or removed from the game. Other than that and some skill explanations being cryptic at times, it's a really good, polished game that I highly recommend.			"

												This is by far one of, if not the, best roguelikes. It's got all the staples; permadeath (optional), difficulty levels, dungeon crawling, randomised level layouts, and different skills that let you customise your build. The skills aren't the typical RPG '+1' stat boosts, they're actually interesting and unique, and they combine with skills from other trees to make a huge variety of ways to approach the game. And you have just one objective; get to floor 10 (or 15 with the DLC enabled) and kill Lord Dredmor.It's challenging, but not essentially impossible like so many roguelikes. Because it's turn-based and offers plenty of different skills, there's plenty of ways to tackle this one. I love that the weapons, trinkets and armour (of which there are many) are static and not procedurally generated. This means you can go hunting for a particular item you need for your build or to deal with a given type of enemy. And when you come across that super rare, super powerful weapon...An amazingly good game. On top of it all, the game has a great sense of humour. Sure, it's a little rough around the edges. I'd love a bit more variety in the level randomisation. But as they're an indie developer I'm happy to cut them some slack. And it's so cheap; just give it a shot!			"

												It's a roguelike game....OK let's be more specific: Dungeons of Dredmor, I believe, is a perfect gateway into the roguelike genre, which is normally populated by games that are massively complex and nearly impenetratable to normal gamers, since those mainly used minimal graphics, user interface mostly designed for machines that are 20 years old or more and massive complexity which several games don't bother supplying adequate tutorials (and lots of newer roguelikes still opt to follow that tradition, though recent trends are going against that). Dredmor, though, evades all the above shortcomings pretty well, with good graphics, humor and good introduction to the game combined with complexity that is not too deep but is still deep enough.And after this maybe you want to try more roguelike games!

												The best game I have ever played in twenty years of computer gaming, bar none (and I have played a LOT of games). Eight years on I can still recall how profoundly that game gripped me, and I am not an overly emotional person. You will care about the characters, you will be moved, you will make choices that tell you more about yourself. It sounds trite, I know, but it really is that good. If only someone would make more of these...insightful, intelligent, devastatingly creative. Fallout is the only RPG to come close. A word of warning: You MUST read all the text, explore all the dialogue options, if you are to gain the most from the game. A decent intelligence and wisdom score is recommended.....although so is a decent score in everything else....the game does the best job of making usually superflous statistics genuinely useful that I have ever seen. Still very much worth playing.			"

												Dungeons of Dredmor is the Lighthearted Roguelike for people who love Lighthearted Roguelikes. The loot flows like waterfalls, and about 50-60% of the things you find you'll have no use for. The dungeon layouts are random, but always feel just varied enough between floors that it doesn't get stale, and the sheer amount of content, even without Steam Workshop, is a sight to behold considering the $5 pricetag.The UI can be unintuitive sometimes, and the Autosave function can really mess with the flow of gameplay, but it's a solid buy for anyone who wants to kill some time, have a few laughs and occasionally go ""I understood that reference!""

												What makes this game stand out against other DnD hack and slash, is crafting.  I admit I've only played a few hours.  But the crafting provides more motivation to keep playing than just finding loot or doing quests.  The 2D map layout with hidden corners is very nice, and now and then some puzzles (so far very simple - maybe they weren't intentional and just how the map generator works). The stats are quite funny.  Wielding an enormous axe will boost your character's ""caddishness"" trait.This is turn-based RPG - the screen freezes between moves allowing time to plan what to do next, which slows the game down and makes it Uberwunderschoen - take your time, relax, figure out what you want to do.  There's no timer running.Early game without any good equipment ""run away from emenies while you heal for the next attack"" is a real strategy.The tone is humorous and light.  Acceptible voice acting and the artwork occasionally touches on the relaxation nerve just right.  Good stuff.Mostly this is it's own flavor of all the other DnD games out there - it does a good job and it offers enough to keep coming back.			"

												One of the best rougelikes I've ever played. If you are new to rougelikes, you will have a real easy time playing this game since it has a mouse interface. The game even has a sense of humor, which is rare for rougelikes. There are a lot of references in the game also, but these things don't make the game any easier if you think it does. I still can't beat the game even though my experience with the rougelike genre. So, the bottom line is, expect to die. A lot. It's a fun and humoruos game and a hard one at that. I recommend it highly.			"

												If you long for the old days of pixel graphics and dungeoneering or just like turnbased, really entertaining RPGs in general, you should definitely check this one out. It's intended to play like a classic Roguelike, but you can also turn off permadeath and just have fun with it as a normal RPG. The selfaware humour, the different character builds and the random dungeons will keep you entertained for quite a while! As of this writing, the game still has a couple of bugs that can be quite a nuisance, but the developers are very active and responsive about issues, so that's also a plus. The game also has very good mod support and a healthy community providing new content. For what little money this costs, you get quite a lot of value. Worth a look for sure!			"

												It's a roguelike game....OK let's be more specific: Dungeons of Dredmor, I believe, is a perfect gateway into the roguelike genre, which is normally populated by games that are massively complex and nearly impenetratable to normal gamers, since those mainly used minimal graphics, user interface mostly designed for machines that are 20 years old or more and massive complexity which several games don't bother supplying adequate tutorials (and lots of newer roguelikes still opt to follow that tradition, though recent trends are going against that). Dredmor, though, evades all the above shortcomings pretty well, with good graphics, humor and good introduction to the game combined with complexity that is not too deep but is still deep enough.And after this maybe you want to try more roguelike games!

												I'll say this: it is a fun roguelike, you'll have tons of fun trying to survive in it.My gripe is that the Diggle Gods expansion makes it gamebreakingly long. It's game breaking because once you get to the final levels, your skills cannot be upgraded anymore, which means leveling up becomes essentially useless and is only a way to achieve full hp/mana. Also it makes Dredmor not twice as hard, but TEN ♥♥♥♥ING TIMES HARDER THAN HE SHOULD BE, and ends up dragging the game not to a crawl, but to a crippling, sliding, agonizing limb-shaking slide across the floor. It's ♥♥♥♥ing terrible. I get there are hardcore gamers out there but this is just ♥♥♥♥ing ridiculous. It's like turning your bicycle gear all the way down and then going up hill. It just gets more more time consuming and tedious than it should be.Overall really fun and fantastic game. Loads of fun, loads of skills. The rest of the DLC is a must have, wizardlands pocket dimensions will save you LOADS of grief and makes your life easier.			"

												I got this as part of the Humble Indie Bundle #4... I had no idea what a ""roguelike"" was, but I thought the art looked pretty silly and decided to give it a try.  Within 10 minutes, I knew I was in for a long haul of booze-fueled spell casting and Diggle whipping.  On the surface, the game seems rather unappealing: Stricly turn-based; very minimal animations; dry, flat, squared-off environment; absolutely simple controls and mechanics.  And it is hard -- very hard.  I died, and continue to die, a lot.  And death is permanent for your character and his progress to that pointBut beneath the surface, the game is a refreshing and compelling peice of work.  The instrinsic randomness of nearly every game element means that each replay is its own truly unique run filled with delightful surprises and totally unfair que-sera-sera situations.   I'm out of room.  This game is a bargain - buy it, love it!			"

												When I started playing this game, I liked it, but the more I played the more I realized how boring and uninteresting it is. First of all, there are many technical problems with the engine. Crashes (with an achievement), bugs and input lag are always part of the experience. I never bothered with the non-permadeath mode but If you play this mode, the game is completely broken due to crashes corrupting the save file.The humor in Dungeons of Dredmor is something most people seem to be in love with but I found it to be uninspired, unoriginal and not funny in any way. The more hours I spent playing, the less patience I had with the game's poor performance and input lag. These two issues are simply awful and unbearable after a while. Worst of all is the crafting and lack of a decent enough inventory system. If you make a character build focused on crafting, you will be in for the most frustrating, annoying, cumbersome experience in any crafting related game. It's so poorly implemented and backwards that once you go through the troubles of attempting to keep ingredients/items, organize them and finally begin crafting, you will never want to craft another item in this game again. The negative combination of the awful inventory system and the hideous crafting system is enough to quit playing and never go back to Dungeons of Dredmor again. Sure, the game could certainly be played using other builds and you don't have to craft anything to beat it, but the horrendous inventory system is still there and there is no way of making it less painful to organize, keep and use items. Dungeons of Dredmor could have been so much better if the developers spent more time polishing and tweaking many of the major issues the game has.Dungeons of Dredmor is mediocre.			"

												Very well-written dungeon crawler. The dev obviously has a good sense of humor and put together a pretty interesting game. No fancy graphics or elaborate quests/puzzles, but entertaining nonetheless. If you like the type of game that makes fun of itself, then this is for you. Some of the skills/classes are a bit...overpowered...while others are practically useless, but they still offer a ton of replayability and I'm sure that there are lots of build combinations I haven't even come across yet. I'd pick it up on sale for sure.			"

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a turn based rogue-like game.Interface/Menu/SettingsGood main menu music.There are some different resolution sizes available.You can play the game fullscreen or windowed mode.There is colorblind mode.There is a music volume slidebar available.There is a sound volume slidebar available.You can use mods.There are alot of tutorials available.There is perma-death available. You can Toggle this.You are able to toggle small floors instead on playing on a big floor.There is a difficulty settings available.You are able to do a random role on the perk selection.About the game.The game is pretty easy to understand. You get thrown into a dungeon in order to defeat the evil final boss. But before you are able to reach him, You will have to face plenty ammounts of floor with alot of different monsters. Monsters will get stronger on each floor and will be different too. You will encounter random events, quests, challenges, vending machines and alot of other things. Monsters are always able to spawn, even from behind in the fog. You are able to level up, getting new items and you are able to safe the game at all time.Could crash at times.Gameplay could be repetitive and is not having alot of variety.Music is pretty bad.Graphics is okay.It has a perk and level system.Each floor and run is randomized.It has events, quests and mini-bosses.You are able to change the controls on the keyboard.It has some jokes.You can mix a variety of different skills together at your own choiceOther things.ONLY THE MUSIC AT THE MAIN MENU IS GOOD.-------------------I Give this game a 6/10			"

												Fantastic and very humorous homage to the classic dungeon crawlers. It plays as a ""just try to get as far as possible"" type game, instead of being something you're supposed to be able to beat. Death is meant to be permanent (although they don't completely force you to abandon old saves), difficulty is meant to be insane, and each experience is meant to be unique. Randomized dungeon layouts, TONS of items and monsters, a ridiculous number of skill trees to choose from, and a very addictive style of play. You WILL die, and you will die a lot... but every time it happens you'll want to play more. The DLC is definitely worth it too, as it adds quite a bit of new content.			"

I will note, though, that if you generially like the idea of ""rogue-likes"" but are mostly turned off by lack of feedback/graphics/music, this is a good game to get into the genre.Quick review:Pros:-Varied builds-Lots of loot-Very good music-Good graphics-Standard hard rogue difficulty curve-Cute mechanics like monster horde roomsCons:-Very repetitive, imagine a single player only diablo-Catastrophically bad inventory management-Grindy as heck, even on the no grind game option (lol)-Not very well balanced-Surprisngly simple for a rogue gameDetails:Possibly the worst part of the game is the inventory management.  This sounds like a weird gripe, and I've played lots of games with terrible inventory management and just dealt with it, but this is definitely the worst inventory management in a game I've ever seen.  Basically you've got somewhere on the order of 1000 different item types in the game, and all can be used to craft stuff, but you can only hold onto 60ish items at a time.  Sure you have a dimensional stash that you can visit any time, but with that many item types, you'll be visiting it every 3 minutes.Even choosing a no-crafting skills build, which seems to be the only option, its still surprisingly annoying to deal with given you need food and booze of which there's like 100 types.  So then it comes down to choosing builds that don't craft and use vampirism (no food), and don't use throwing or crossbows,  just to play the game without going insane.Next up is the repetitiveness.  Most roguelikes have unique enemies with interesting abilities, enviromental hazards, and their own brew of general randomness to spice things up.  This game is mostly just stacking on various resistances and bonuses and dealing with your enemy's resistances and bonuses.  You look at the forums, and most build discussion is even just about choosing builds that let you stack certain stats.  This kind of munchkinery is super fun for about 15 hours or so, but it gets old really quick.  When you combine this with the fact that a floor takes about an hour (half an hour on ""no grind"" lol) and there's fifteen floors, and you're mostly just spamming the left mouse button, I think a lot of people will just get bored.  Even with the builds that implement some form of strategy, it's going to be the exact same strategy for any situation.There's some major balance concerns as well, although since it's single player, you can just opt out of using the overpowered crap or choose random builds.

												I love rougelikes but I do not like this game. It's graphics are cluttery and impede play. It's sound is repetive and boring. Its attempt at humor is low key and only stands in its way. It's enigine is uninspired and any attempt to gloss it up fails. If this was the only game I owned, I would stop playing games.			"

												This game is opposite from most games I played in a very nice way. To begin with, every time I die, and that happened frequently, I’m happy that I can start a new game. Because the game is fair and always when I have to start over, what is certainly a pleasure, I know it’s my own fault.The music in this game is exactly what I want to hear in a game like this. It’s a way too much orchestra song kind of music what really give the feeling of a middle age castle period. Call to arms and conquer!! Tadadum tadum tadum…Very good choice!The interface and menu is very detailed and clean. Compared to the graphics of the dungeon itself it’s modern style. The dungeon is old style, but with enough diversity and eye candy to not feel boring or repetitive. Even that the dungeons are randomly generated every game plays like his own story. Every random set up is like handcrafted by an experienced level designer. The placement of monsters and goodies is a surprise every time, but always very well balanced. Behind every door you open on a gigantic random map is a whole new game generated before your eyes. Within every room dozens of monsters to fight and dozens of pick-ups to find. Every character you build, chosen from tons of skills yourself or totally randomly, is unique. But really unique. Not unique because the skill you are good in blocks your access to all other skills, but because the skill you develop really makes sence. Every skill point you spend for a skill is game play changing in real time.Another very good balanced, well designed aspect of this game is that for the first time (I played hundreds of RPG’s and TBS games) you can use all your skills on many, many places of every map.The fighting is fun, fast and rewarding and it’s even turn based, so you really have time to make every turn and every action you make count. Also it’s very easy to understand and again perfectly fair for the AI and for the player. Fast because every action is just one point, so your turn or the computer’s turn doesn’t take more than a second to make. What is also groundbreaking is that the turn based gameplay in battles and the exploring part of the map is seamlessly. So you don’t have to push the end turn button a thousand times if you are not in a fight but exploring the map.It was running flawlessly the first few hours after installment and without any glitches, lags or crashes on a three years old laptop with a build in video adapter.The only bad thing was that one time I had to kill my own summoned monster, a golem, myself because he was blocking my only way out. This was done in a second, but it was just horrible to kill my own loving pet with my axe.This game is also original in many ways. The art, the item and spell description and the subtle, delicate jokes all around the game. Sometimes just written on walls or as little text balloons above NPC’s or monsters. But again it is done so balanced and it fit so naturally in the rest of the game.The last time I walked from my PC to take a piece of paper to write a secret code on it to gain access to a secret portal was 15 years ago. Cést magnifique!This game is just brilliant in many ways and I can only thank the developers to let me play this game for a few bucks. It’s really worth more! "

												A strange but potent combination of humor and dying, both of them in immense quantities. DoD is a whimsical, sometimes downright sadistic game, throwing you into startling deathtraps at a moment's notice, while perpetually referencing and parodying roguelike genre conventions in most wacky, even disturbing ways. DoD does all this while being remarkably fun and addictive. It's superfluous mentioning replay value in here as it is staple of the genre.			"

												It's slow-paced, brutally difficult, and not very pretty.And I love it.This is a throw-back to Castle of the Winds, NetHack, and any other rogue-like you can think of. This will not be a game that you're on the edge of your seat playing. It requires much more methodical planning and strategy. With the combinations of skills you can use, it is incredibly deep. Some combinations of skills make the game borderline impossible, but once you get your feet wet, you'll have a good idea of which skills work with which other skills. Don't forget that permadeath is the default, so if you don't want your save files to be deleted when you die, make sure to turn that feature off.I love this style of game, so this gets a 9/10 from me. If you like this genre, you can easily sink 200 hours into this game and still not see everything.			"

												I love the game to death, but all the bugs that cause it to crash and close are rediculous. I've lost so many adventurers to crashes it's not even funny. Speaking of bugs, there are also bugs that force you to move in one direction after closing the skill tree or closing the window you get after beating a zoo, and there are times where you can't load any previous auto saves, or..hell, any save at all without it just taking you back to the title screen. Great game, just plagued by awful glitches that need to be fixed. Please.			"

It's silly nature and entertaining gameplay make this a must have for any rogue-like fan out there.  The thing that really shines in my eyes are the skill tree's. They are fun and zaney and some of them will modify others and some work so well together.  I only wish there were a little better animations associated with the fighting. IE I have a shield but it doesnt show one.  A few little things like that, but just that little things.  This game is well worth the small sticker price.			"

												Solid roguelike game but still has problems from 2012: Mysterious Portals are an ingame feature that port you to another dimension where often the exit portal is missing or blocked.

												I don't recommend this game. For a roguelike, it drags on too long, like, WAY WAY TOO LONG. When every floor and every encounter feels so samey, and all the encounters just blend together eventually, your eventual death at the end of slogging it down for hours and hours will come from making a dumb mistake just because you're SO BORED that it's hard to pay attention.Nothing else in this game even needs consideration, it's all overshadowed by that one point. I just want to see the ending, but the incredible patience required to slog your way there is the true test, and it's one you DON'T WANT TO PAY FOR.			"

												I don't understand why this game is so popular.  Sure, it's cheap and is good-humored, but it just didn't do it for me.  If I had to put my finger on it, I think it's that it relies too heavily on the random number generator.You have no control over what items vendors are selling or what quest rewards you'll get or what crafting materials or recipes are available in any particular run.  You just repetitively kill enemies and get strung along for the ride hoping that the random number generator is kind to you.  Not my idea of a good time.			"

It's a real shame the devs no longer support this game, since it really is very fun.			"

												Not recommending it may seem a bit harsh. The game is funny, the graphics nice for the genre, there's plenty of depth and it is original in many ways. For the price I paid (part of a Humble Bundle) and the £3.49 it is on Steam, it is very, very good value.However it is flawed. It is so slow to play and there's so much repetition of doing the same thing i.e. fighting - which is a problem common to many turn-based roguelikes but overcome by most with instantaneous response enabling quite large battles to be resolved quickly. Sadly this is not the case with Dredmor, making the early levels quite laborious on repeat play throughs. Since it is a permadeath game, I soon tired of trudging my way through the early levels and soon put the game into my archives.You won't be wasting your money buying Dungeons of Dredmor, but if you want a game that will draw you in and keep you coming back for more, I'd be surprised if you found it here.

												It's cute and charming, but rather shallow. There are so many better quality rogue-likes out there. This one has better graphics than most, but they're not that great. The only thing it has going better than most is the crafting system. Other than that, everything seems a poor imitation of real rogue-likes. If you are new to the rogue-like genre, this could be for you. But for experience players who like a little more depth, this doesn't cut it.			"

												The forgettable adventures of whateverYes I know rogue-like games are light in the story department, but this game is so severely and conspicuously lacking a story that I have to mention my disappointment somehow. It would have been so much better if it was accompanied by a whacky story to fit the mood but, as good as the mechanics of the game are, the soul is not there.Diablo had a consistent mythos that sucked you in the atmosphere of dread and more (yeah just wrote that). Compare it to this game which breaks the fourth wall so much that it is like it’s calling the player an idiot to his face and expect you to like it.I tried several builds to find some redeeming factor to my wasted time on this game and FORCED MYSELF to finish it after wasting many hours in it and I must say that I did not get any satisfaction from it.If you are looking for the fleeting thrill of leveling up a character and looting some treasures, then this game is for you, just be aware that there is not a world to immerse yourself in, just a forgettable experience. IMHO this game is not worth the time invested on it, the aftertaste is bitter and disappointing. "

												Dungeons of Dredmor is not a bad game; instead, it's an amusing, well-intentioned game that lacks the polish and ease of play which we have come to expect from games.  The play style harkens back to the earliest dungeon crawlers, featuring randomly generated dungeons, punishing combat, and a wealth of customization.  It's charm lies in the witty, inane humor sprinked in everything; my personal favorite joke were the shrines littering the dungeon, where you could pray to the goddess of side-quests, and receive a random task.  I swear, it's much funnier than my lame description implies.  Nonetheless, it's difficult to reccomend for you to buy the game, as the gameplay is extremely clunky, especially item and spell management.  For items, you must click and drag every single thing in the game.  That means that when you come across a trove of 9 pieces of Lutefisk, you either have to click and drag 8 times, or get lazy and leave them sitting there.  It's simply frustrating.  Additionally, stats and related systems are poorly, if at all, explained.  It becomes a burdon to try to compare one piece of armor against another.  All-in-all, Dungeons of Dredmor is an entertaining series of jokes, that lacks the polishing necessary for today's game market.			"

												Humor. Dungeons of Dredmor has plenty of it. Item descriptions are absurd, enemies are bizarre, damage types are ridiculous, and the monsters frequently spout flavor text that will elicit a chuckle. The game takes nothing about itself seriously, and I LOVE that.Dredmor also has an amazing class selection system, being one of the most varied ones I have encountered in a game. You are given a plethora of skills to choose when you make a new character. Mixing potions, dagger adeptness, vampirism, communism, emo magic—the list goes on. Each of these corresponds with primary stats (burliness, nimbleness, and sagacity to name some) and secondary traits (dodge chance, block chance, and enemy dodge reduction to name some). With the vast amount of skills that you can choose, there is a near infinite amount of variation in primary stat and secondary stat intensities as well as attacks that you can use.However, these two things cannot save this game from the abyss.The humor is fun when you first play, but it gets old after you’ve seen and heard everything.The combat is grindy as ♥♥♥♥, feeling like a hack-and-slash game even though this is turn based. There is no strategy. Fighting is heavily dependent on RNG and the game does not force you to diversify how you approach each encounter. All you have to do is use your three favorite attacks, run, wait for them to cooldown, and then repeat. Nothing is stopping you from fighting this way, so I cannot help but fight this way.The developers claim that there are “hordes of monsters never-before-seen in a video game” to be found here. Don’t be fooled. Only two enemy types exist: melee and ranged. The difference between each enemy in these categories is what types of damage they deal and what types of resistances they have. To top it all off, the creatures you fight are only reskins of things you already have seen with their stats changed slightly.Inventory management is horrible. To make this even worse, there are so many different variations of ONE item (bleu cheese, grated cheese, cheese log, etc.) that your inventory will quickly become cluttered with crap.Crafting is complex, but perhaps too complex. As with consumables and wands and ammo types, there are just too many different components that you can acquire and they are randomly generated. This will frequently make it difficult to craft anything meaningful.Only the first twenty to thirty hours of this game is fun. While that might sound like a lot, trust me, it is not. I should easily be able to squeeze at least a hundred hours out of this before I get bored, because the developers clearly say “Infinite replay value: choose from a selection of mind-boggling skills to create your character. A new gameplay experience waits every time!” The only reason I have played this for sixty eight hours is because I like to pursue challenges. But all while I played I could not sit still. I was bored—I knew I was forcing myself to keep going.If you still want to get this game heed my warning: complete it only once and leave with a good taste in your mouth.Verdict: 65%			"

												Long ago, the Dark Lord Dredmor was bound in the darkest dungeons beneath the earth by great and mighty heroes. Centuries later, the magical bonds that hold him in place are loosening and his power grows ever stronger. The land cries out for a new hero, a powerful warrior or a mystic wizard like those spoken of in the prophecies of yore. What they have, unfortunately, is you... Step into the Dungeons of Dredmor! Embrace your destiny! Face evil of the likes the world has never known - the terrifying Swarmies, the undulating Thrusties, and the adoreable nest-building Diggles. Worship Inconsequentia, the Goddess of Pointless Sidequests, or try your luck as a devotee of the nameless Lutefisk God. Cast powerful magic learned from the dark business warlocks of the school of Necronomiconomics, or summon the Viking Runes of your ancestors to blast your foes with thunder and lightning! Discover the power that can be had by wielding a bizarre armament of devastating weaponry such as the Interdimensional Axe, the Plastic Ring, and the Invisible Shield (if you can remember where you left it). Wield shoes decorated by the Dwarven Glittersmiths, all of whom have now committed suicide because of their shame, and embrace the joys of destroying giant moustache-wielding brick demons with a mace decorated with tawdry, delicious bacon. While you’re at it, be prepared to die. A lot. In hideous, screaming pain that makes you throw your keyboard out the window. The Dungeons of Dredmor await. Are you ready for them?			"

For example: clicking on a found item does not add it to inventory, but picks it up with the cursor so you have to click on the player character to add it to inventory, but if you don't click on the square your standing on the item will drop on the square behind you. Also, you have to open two separate windows (character and inventory) to equip items.			"

												Normally I like roguelikes. One of my friends gave me this game as a Christmas gift saying it was similar to one of my favorite games: Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup.Dungeons of Dredmor... basically works. That's about the only nice thing I have to say. It never crashed on me. It's... competent. It's also a boring slog with little else going for it.The enemies are all a series of boring palette swaps that work basically the same and never forced me to switch up my tactics even a little. The only challenge to them is the massive health pools they have for soaking damage.Discovering new regions is never interesting, unlike Stone Soup where new regions like the Orcish Mines, Slime Pits, or The Swamp actually had unique qualities, here I never look forward to moving on to a new floor because I know it'll be exactly the same as the last floor but with different wall and floor textures.The sense of humor is immature and won't stop bashing me over the head with how insipidly edgy it all is.The one saving grace of this game - the one thing it has that Stone Soup doesn't have and likely never will have - is the crafting system... and even THAT falls flat. On my main character I took all of the crafting skills in order to make the most of this system, saved up materials and built myself some badass weapons and armor.... only to find that if I'd just waited an hour I would've found the exact same thing (maybe even with some sweet random artifact powers) a few floors down just laying on the ground waiting for me, and then I could have put all those points into actually useful abilities like fireballs and axe maneuvers. About the only thing crafting is actually good for is getting easy access to crossbow bolts, potions, and other consumables. That's it.My advice is log off Steam, go to Google and search for Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup. It's way better than this game, and free too.Knight's Rating: 3/5: MEDIOCRE "

												I would be lying if I didn't say this was fun at the start. At first the game is charming. Then the charm wears off and you're left with a randomly generated cluster♥♥♥♥ that makes no attempts at even being winnable.How long this takes depends on how long it takes to roll an absurd unwinnable game, which doesn't take that long.I don't mind roguelikes, I love the genre - but Dredmor is the perfect example of what's wrong with the whole randomly generateed nonsense everyone loves to make. From the game actively mocking your loadout by generating completely useless equipment and items, to discovering that any and all elements you can use are actively negated by just about every enemy in the game. But heaven help you if you get hit with the ""Hidden Element""  , because nothing you have will -ever- defend you.On the bright side, it's a FAR greater step up than the likes of Hack, Slash, Loot which is an even worse roguelike.

												Dungeons of Dredmor is a cool concept, but unlike other roguelikes, the game isn't very challenging, and even outside that, the game is extremely bloated with way too many items. I didn't get very far in the game, but my experience with it was that the early floors were very easy and didn't require much thought, and it started getting really obnoxious having to manage all the items the game throws at you. You'll probably like the game if you don't mind those flaws, however.			"

												So yeah. To start...This is one of my favorite Roguelikes. It's funny, smart, easy to get into, hard to master, has tons of replayability, and has a great, vibrent moding scene. If all you care about it gameplay, that's what you should take away from this review.Sadly, the developer, Gaslamp Games, has recently come out with VERY strong anti-gamer rhetoric. They have decided that not only is there no reason to fight for ethical, honest journalism in gaming, but that they, as devs, should take it upon themselves to silence all critism, censor all honest discussion, and side with people saying things like ""Gamers are dead"" and ""All gamers are mysogonists.""It is sad to think that a company I once held in such high regard has secretly always held such anti-consumer, anti-customer ideologies. I am grateful that these tendencies have come to light, but I am sad to say I can no longer support their company financially, no matter how much I love their games. At the end of the day, if you are comfertable giving money to a company that actively dispises you, as a consumer, please, buy this game. But if you feel that your money should go to companies that actually value you as a customer or treat you, as a customer, with even the slightest shread of human decency, take your money elsewhere.

												Dungeons of Dredmore is funny, it has a lot of wit to it and deciding what skills you want to bring into the game is always a blast.But the buck stops there.- The game is poorly optimized often lagging on machines no matter their power level.- you cant change many options once the game has loaded- important options like being able to scroll through the battle log are not in the game (hope you didn't need to know if your attack did any damage, or who out of the 8 monsters on you hit you the hardest) Change the ui on the screen? Nope, you get to fear walking down in this game because you ui blocks anything below you so you will never know what's there until you walk headlong into it.- game has little annoyances that slow it down into a slog, like constantly having to pick things up manually (yes there is an auto option for pickups but its lackluster) or having to watch your screen like a hawk for traps because even though your character  can see them, he will happily walk into them like an idiot if you are not paying close attention.and finally the most damning problem of them all- THERE is a RIGHT way to build your character, and if you built them any other way you cannot win! At least not fairly.The final boss has only one real weakness so I hope you chose one of the skills at the start that let you capitalize on that, else your dead. Restart and try again from the beginning chump.This game has great potential but it lacks common sense and a large amount of polish that it needed it ever be worth your time. "

												I want to recommend this game, as it's a really nice roguelike for people that don't want to deal with the more nuanced classical roguelikes, but it requires constant saving due to crashes.And it can crash while saving.Further, the game seems to corrupt through play, so things you use will arbitrarily stop working.

												Has an interesting graphical style, but really falls short, if you're a roguelike fan. No diagonal movement? Can't attack enemies simply by moving 'into' them? A not-quite-top-down perspective that causes walls to obscure the row above them? Animated movement you can't disable or speed up (a big one for roguelike 'vets' that don't want superfluous 'sparkle' that slows them down)?Sorry, can't recommend this. Even Hack, Slash, Loot, which I got from the same Humble Bundle, was more enjoyable than this, and it's arguably much simpler overall. The game is silly (I wasn't /cringing/, but I never actually laughed either, and there were plenty of jokes in even just the tutorial), but that does not nearly make up for its shortcomings when it comes down to actually /playing/ it.I have no problem with a game pushing the traditional boundaries of its genre, but it has to be in a way that /improves/ the experience, otherwise it just feels like the game is missing things. And that's how I felt the whole time I played.I know my total playtime isn't very long, but my problems are all with the core mechanics, which are present from the first minute, so I don't think this was hasty.The more you love roguelikes, the less I recommend this game for you. It's a decent My First Roguelike for those uninitiated into the genre, but that's about it.			"

												Pretty much the worst game I've ever owned... and I've owned a LOT of games.Not even the above-average attempts at humour can save the game from horrifically tedious gameplay. I love roguelikes but this one felt too random - as though my actual gaming ability was inconsequential.

												Call it a player experience in extremely bad luck, but ultimately, I feel that the time I've invested into Dungeons of Dremor has been an utter waste. Having raised three characters, and having every single character's life end with random abrupt inescapable and arguably unfair situations has really soured me on the game. Just be aware before going in that when things go wrong in this game, it'll in all likelihood be unfair (swarmed by enemies out of thin air, overleveled enemies just randomly appearing and one shotting you, etc) and ruin any amount of fun you've had prior to that character's untimely demise. That said, Dredmor is an approachable roguelike that handles its systems nicely. It can seem overwhelming at first, but when boiled down, all those skills, items, and crafting come into play, there's nothing complicated about it at all. I just really can't recommend it myself given how abrupt and unfair every play through I've had has gone.			"

												This is a rogue-like type of snack, the kind that you eat occasionally to fill in the time.The packaging goes for a different kind of vintage style, rather than merely slapping together a potentially ugly looking primitive style, it goes for the sort of old freeware aesthetic.It's chock full of jokes and humor, rather than trying to look bland and serious.It has a cute taste, although with complications...You start off enjoying it, although it's sometimes uncomfortable you enjoy it anyway, but if you dig down to the bottom or read reviews, the taste begins to sour. It still kind of tastes alright, but you just can't seem to enjoy it as you have before.Steer clear, before buyer's remorse kicks in.			"

												Dungeons is a slow, repetitive slog through a series of large, characterless, procedurally generated maps. Character progression is severely lacking in depth. The skill system boils down to unlocking one active or passive skill per level in a sequence of linear offerings. The crafting system is unapproachable, excessively time consuming, and unnecessarily cumbersome due to the inadequate inventory management system. I regard this game as an inferior version of ""Sword of the stars: the pit""			"

												Game #3 - Dungeons of Dredmor (PC)November 4, 2014Where to begin... Well, I guess let's try and figure out where and why I bought this game. That may shed a little light on how Dungeons of Dredmor (Further referred to as DoD) came to be in the 1K Game Stream Challenge.As best I can guess, DoD came with a bundle of games. Either some HumbleBundle or one of the other ""Value Bundles"" being sold by one of the flavor of the month Steam Key re-sellers on the internet today. See, the Indie Developers tend to get their games lumped together, because the consumer of PC games seems to like value above quality. This is not always the case, but unless your dealing with the likes of HumbleBundle, then you're probably going to find a few games in each bundle that equate to a happy meal toy.Let's start at the beginning. For the record, I knew nothing about DoD coming into the playthough. I literally couldn't have told you anything about the game. After playing it for 3 hours straight on cast, I can tell you it's a Rogue-like RPG Game, and that's about it. From the point I started playing, I was confused by the mass amount of loot just lying around. Some may find this interesting and want to pick up every little thing, but honestly it seemed more like a videogame about hording than adventuring. There is so much crap lying around that you spend far more time messing with the tiny inventory screen than the tool belt where you store important spells and skills. This seems boring and tedious, neither are what I consider a gaming experience. Even trying to figure out the crafting system was cumbersome and not intuitive.Now, I am a supporter of Indie Games and when it comes to Rogue-Type games, I love them!  Spelunky, Crypt of the Necrodancer and Rogue Legacy are amazing. The difference is they are mainly platformers, and this plays well with the Rogue style of death machines. You care very little in most cases that you have to start over. In DoD this can be a nightmare if you leave the Rogue option on. Starting over each time is hell if you've just lost an hour of crafting work. One final note, that may be just a gripe,  in the game the characters always look the same no matter what armor you equip them with in the menu. Metacritic's average complete argues against my finding with a 79 for overall reviews. I would probably have put this more in the range of 40-50 based on the issues I've stated above.The one area that DoD wins in is price. Being an Indie title, the cost of the game is going to be on the lower side of the scale. When I say the lower part of the scale, I mean less than $5 on steam everyday. The complete edition is $6.99, and has a decent offering of DLC. The other advantage to DoD is that it supports user mods from the Stream Workshop, which can really extend the life of any game. To be fair, I did not install any files from the Workshop. I can't say that I would recommend  buying the game, but if the opportunity arises that some bundle has the game, give it a try and see if you can find anything interesting from user generated mods.

												The slow sometimes mundane combat speed of this game makes me want to wish it wasn't on my game list. I usually give most games the benefit of the doubt and barrell through sometime annoying or frustrating mechanics to see the big picture, Dugeons of Dredmor is not the case. The character art in my opinion is kind of bland and not that special. The combat was not very inticing making moving around the map a chore.

												Dungeons of Dredmor is a roguelike. So you have random level generation, tile-based graphics, turn-based gameplay and permanent death. I'm not a fan of the turn based gameplay most of these games have. Although Dungeons of Dredmor can be played fastpaced, but you missclick a lot. Unless I missed a option you always need to play with a mouse beside the keyboard.The atmosphere the game creates also doesn't really click with me. It tries to hard to be funny. Which end up in lame enemies with an art style I don't like. The dungeons look fine and with better characters the game would look a lot more appealing. The music also doesn't help. It's annoying and repetitive. Dungeons of Dredmor isn't bad game, but it doesn't click with me.			"

												Dungeons of Dredmor is overrated. I'm not sure why it is, but one thing's for sure: It's sure offset as hell.The gameplay itself is average compared to other dungeon crawlers, except for the fact that the game is almost impossible to play without taking the tutorial first. RPGs are usually easy to learn to play on your own, but DoD just flat-out crosses the line. To give you an idea, it takes you about 8 seconds to simply place a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ item in your inventory. There's an option for a quick place, but it barely makes a difference.The camera is offset to the point where it's risky to just move down. The GUI is in the way of almost the entire bottom screen, and there are no options to move it somewhere else or even just lower the size.Don't even get me started on the graphics. The graphics are as if Doom and Oregon Trail II had a baby and then proceeded to puke all over it. Maybe that's an exaggeration, but the screen is blurry, it's hard to make out what the monsters even are, and the main character. Ugh! Why did the developers make his eyebrows the size of the Titanic?Overall, I rate Dungeons of Dredmor a 4/10.			"

												When the bug fix log starts with the update, 'FIXED: n-dimensional lathe was, in fact, a giant game-crashing exploding bomb,' you know you've got something special.  The rather unassuming looking Dungeons of Dredmor is an astounding game, although it might take a few minutes to click.  If you go in expecting some sort of retro themed action-RPG, you will probably hate this game.  If, however, you start with the tutorial and look at the game as a sort of Disgaea-flavored randomized Demons Souls playing by old school, turn-based calculations and rules, it should be hard not to fall in love.  Easily more enjoyable than half the full priced retail games I've bought in recent years, you would be remiss not to give this game the time of day.			"

You then go into the dungeon, fight monsters, gather treasure, level up (gaining new powers within those skill sets with each level).			"

												If you like rogue-likes or Diablo type games, this is brilliant.It's far simpler in terms of gameplay and UI than a rogue-like, but all the fun is still there. And you can still get killed in many nasty hidden ways.I only just picked this up and already pumped many hours into it.A few minor bugs (changing level while fighting creature zoo doesn't give the elimination award, + a crash with no save game) but nothing that stops me from loving this.If you like this kind of game, check out DoomRL (Doom Rogue-Like). FANTASTIC rogue-like game.			"

The game fills your nostalgic little head with every rogue-like cliche in the book. It also has a TON of video game pop-culture references everywhere. It's fast and perfect to play inbetween games.

												This is a roguelike for people who normally don't care for them. It's very fair and tactical, so rather than being screwed by the random number generator, deaths are usually well and truly your own damn fault. It also has longevity: the variety of skills and steam workshop integration ensure you'll always have a new way to play the game. Lastly, the writers have a very silly and enjoyable sense of humor, which helps give the game a quirky flavor quite unlike anything else out there.			"

												Dungeons of Dredmor is something you get when you take an appropriately brutal Rouge-like game and mix it with not only the offbeat comedy of an RPG a la Earthbound but with geeky shout-outs strewn into a pile on the murky floor. It'll take you roughly 20 hours to finish the game since you'll need a LOT of experience in order to take on the final boss whom is mixed amongst his followers on the final floor of the dungeon (so you can either find him right away or be forced to search every room, in either case it doesn't end well). You'll need to grind to survive, especially on later floors. Thankfully there's an option for those who don't live on level grinding like myself so I can recommend this game to just about anyone who likes a good RPG. In other words, expect to die a lot but not enough to make the game unfun.If I were to sum up Dungeons of Dredmor to an emotion, it would be that of finding a Monster Zoo in this game: complete surprise followed by fearing for your life.

I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised. I've never really been one for roguelikes, but I've really enjoyed this game. I understand it's pretty entry-level for this genre, but it's still difficult nonetheless, and has some nice humor thrown in as well. I still haven't beaten it, and I actually had one run where I died in the very first room, but that's all part of the fun.

												Dungeons of Dredmor is an excellent roguelike that takes place within a large, vibrant dungeon filled to the brim with smartass creatures, quirky equipment and massive eyebrows completed by very memorable music. Customization is found in the character creation menu and then in improving your selected abilities while hunting down the right gear for the role you have selected.  Replayability is high in this game thanks to the random dungeon format, multitude of character skills to mix and match and downloadable content. Kick the game into overdrive with options that limit the amount of floors in the dungeon (thereby reducing the experience you gain and decreasing your chances of finding rare equipment), increase enemy levels and HP and store purchase prices while also reducing sell prices and health/sp regeneration among other things, and permadeath. The game is well worth its full price.			"

												A fairly solid and less hardcore roguelike than most. I would recommend this game to people looking to get into the genre but are looking for a more gradual learning curve (also the ability to disable perma-death). The game has a good bit of depth to it for those looking to dig, but a fairly casual player should be able to triumph on the lower difficulties if their character is properly focused. Those looking for a more intense experience are also rewarded here, the game's higher difficulty levels can be punishing and will quickly crush those who aren't playing to peak efficiency.			"

												You know how some people say ""I really want to like X, but no matter how hard I try I can't""?  Well, for me, Dungeons of Dredmor is the opposite.  I really don't want to like it.  It's a 2D rougelike, top-down, turn-based-ish dungeon crawler with an odd sense of humor (it's hit and miss) and a 90's feel to it.  While each floor is randomized, each room is a template of sorts, so after a few hours of gameplay, you'll start to see the same rooms pop up over and over (just with different loot sometimes).  It doesn't feel like there's enough content for a game like this.  And yet, I can't stop playing it.  On normal, the game is easy enough to lure you in until you find yourself suddenly dead (health is mostly gained by eating food, but it replenishes 1 point per turn (usually for 10 or so turns, depending on the item) so you need to be careful when getting into combat.  The enemies are unusual, yet somewhat bland, but they will sometimes insult you (via text above them) that is actually pretty charming (""You smell like diggle pee"" or ""I hope they nerf your playstyle"").  The biggest draw for me, though, is the item collecting.  There's all kinds of random loot to find, better equipment or something to sell for money so you can buy better equipment.  It's actually sort of relaxing.  All this on top of crafting (which could have been done better, to be honest), leveling and basic (go here and kill this mostly) sidequests that are there to parody the RPG genre.  Plus, you regain magic by drinking alcohol.In the end, I suppose Dungeons of Dredmor feels like a poor man's Torchlight, but I find it to be a little more likeable than Torchlight.  The music is good, the graphics are decent and it's pretty easy to pick up and play.  I recommend this game!			"

												As roguelikes go, this one's definitely very approachable. It's got a great sense of humor, and a nice amount of depth to it that doesn't overwhelm you. When I'm in the mood for something that doesn't require twitch reflexes and allows me to plan things out at a casual pace, I load this up. There IS a slight learning curve to it though, so the first death or two (because yes, you will frequently die since this IS a roguelike) will leave you scratching your head... and while the tutorial will give you an idea on how the controls work it doesn't really give you any ideas on exactly HOW you should be playing.If you're even vaguely curious about the roguelike RPG genre, give this one a try.

												I watched the trailer and I was like, ""Meh."" I played the tutorial and I was like, ""Meh."" Then I tried actually playing through some games, and it turns out this game is surprisingly addictive.In particular, the skill trees are actually a lot of fun. You pick a set of skills when you start out, and you get to gradually advance them, which is very satisfying. And depending on the skills you choose, the game plays significantly differently, which is some serious replay value. Seriously. So much replay value. It's insane.There's a lot of visceral pleasure in exploring the dungeons, uncovering new rooms, beating the monsters senseless, and stealing all the treasure. It's much more fun than I thought it would be.			"

												Dungeons of Dredmor is a pretty good rogue-like. It's a pretty solid game with a lot of depth, a lot of replay value, and a lot of appeal. And it has a great sense of humor.It nails everything down and doesn't make it complicated. The only thing I can find with Dungeons of Dredmor is that it doesn't do anything different. That's not necessarily a bad thing. Why change what isn't broken? Overall, Dungeons of Dredmor is still a good game. You'll have a lot of fun min-maxing your character and trying to find the best loot. But sometimes, during the grind, you might ask, ""Is there more to this?""If you're looking for a good rogue-like and you have a lot of time to burn, get Dungeons of Dredmor.

												I love games where the players get to pick their own poison on how they plan to take the game on and that's an area this game really shines on. There's a lot of different combinations you can slap together to make a class. Want to be a mace dual wielding vampire who summons golems? Sure. Or a crafty rogue who can steal items from vending machines and uses egyptian magic? Why not. There's a lot in here that's fun. The gameplay isn't difficult but the game is, if that makes sense. There's an in-depth tutorial that explains everything you need to know to play the game, that's optional, then you're off and playing. Taking on monsters and disabling or avoiding traps gets pretty hectic at times and as of yet, I've not felt cheated in the game. Intestingly enough, as of this writing, my first game has been my highest scoring and best game! Wassupwitdat?!			"

As will those of us who are members of the Big Eyebrow Master Race.Full disclosure though - like many roguelikes there is a LOT of luck involved, and the starting skills aren't particularly balanced... as a result it's more of a casual roguelike, so all 2 of you hardcore rogulike fans can probably pass on this one - for everyone else however, it's a great way to try out the genre.

												DoD is stupidly addictive and clearly made by people who love the roguelike-turnbased-dungeoncrawler genre. Many of the enemies, items, and skills are genuinely weird, but if you read the descriptions they're often funny and clever too.Much of the replayability comes from the 35 different skillsets (51 with all DLC) of which you pick 7 each game. These range from your standard Sword & Archery specialties, to Piracy & Archaeology, to originals like ""Fleshsmithing"" and ""Mathemagic"". I'd recommend starting with standard weapon & shield skills along with Promethian Magic and Psionics. Leave the Necronomiconomics and Killer Vegan skills for a later challenge :)Oh and there's optional crafting (weapons, traps, potions, magic wands, etc) with pretty big loot tables too.My only criticisms: the randomized sidequests are somewhat indecipherable and lame (but hey, treasure), and there's no way the game could be played well with a gamepad due to inventory and hotkey management.If you're still not sold, hey, the game has at least 9 types of cheese and 13 kinds of fungus for your character to eat.

												A merciless and unforgiving rogue-like with a rather riddiculous (which is a good thing) sense of humor.Randomly generated dungeon floor layouts, a sizeable choice in skills and a modding community only add more and more replayability.			"

												Fun little rogue like that stays were true to its ancestors. Playing on the Medium difficulty, the first random mini-boss encounter was with a mindflayer that was the master of coffee, running away to a fountain I decided to drink it, getting my self poisoned and suddenly die. Those who have always wondered what nethack would be like but couldnt get past its countless interfaces, remakes and graphics; and those who by default like rogue-likes should definetly try this game out. The game feels like a modern version of nethack. Unfortunately, It does not have the major element of identification, and I have yet to discover traps that would spell instant death to my character: However there appears to be random encounters with fairly difficult mobs. It also apparently does not feature the gender or character customization as in nethack as well as pets (or well, I havent discovered any yet after a dozen of attempts to keep my character alive after level 1.

												I am pretty picky when it comes to roguelikes (though I love them), from all the roguelikes I've ever played, Dungeons of Dredmor is most likely the most content rich. Deep character ability system, an interesting crafting system and some fine comedy to boot. The game has leaderboards so you can compare with your friends how far you've gone through the dungeons. If there's a game worth your cash that runs on nearly any computer you can throw it at, I would highly recommend this one.			"

												One of the best games I have played on steam. Its addicting, fun and hard. The wide variety of skills you can choose from gives each charecter its strengths and weaknesses.The DLC Realm of the diggle gods inserts more skills and more fun for the game, plus adding new floors, monsters and Items. Each time you play the game it is diffrent and fun and many exciting adventures await.Now it has been added to the Steam Workshop you can play many mods which add even more content!Rated: 10/10			"

												While it does suffer some minor issues, and some major ones (perhaps I have been spoilt by dungeon crawl, but that's a free game and lets you go places by clicking on the minimap, rest until healed and autoexplore, all of which Dungeons of Dredmor could do with) it's overall a decent rougelike with humour, customisable skillsets and with the level of graphics and animations rougelikes mostly lack. If you aren't familiar with rougelikes, this one is more appoachable than most, but maybe try some of the more accessible free ones first to see if you like the genre.			"

												Dungeons of Dredmor has amazing music, about a billion different items, and floors galore. It's a really fun game that has a different outcome every time you play. With a bunch of different classes to choose from and combine with other classes, this game gives a different experience every single time. I have to personally say that Dungeons of Dredmor is up there in my top 10 list of games I love.			"

												This game is like digital crack. It is a Rogue-like dungeon crawl, but with nice tile-based graphics, a 2D Diablo or Torchlight. The levels are procedurally generated, so every game with a new character is different. Each new game you choose a difficulty level, you can turn off Permadeath (if your character dies, you have to start a new game), and you can select to generate more compact levels for faster play-throughs. Then you select your 7 skills. There are only basic descriptions (half the fun is figuring the game out), but there are several Wikis devoted to detailing the inner workings. ""Just one more room and then I'll save and quit!"" Hah, 16 hours later the birds are chirping and I have to go to work in an hour. The humor & treasure are what keep me coming back. There are many nods & winks to other games peppered through out. And they added user mods available thru Workshop. The game just morped into digital meth. Skol! ""Lutefisk for the Lutefisk God!!!""

												It's the next generation of 'Rogue' or 'Angband' or 'Nethack' - still turn-based, but beautiful graphics, and with the bonus of unique and quirky skill trees that can customize your play experience, as well as several forms of crafting to fill up your pack with all manner of junk since ""I might find a recipe that uses that!""The best part, however, is the tongue-in-cheek sense of humour pervading the game, from the descriptions of the skills and attributes, to the random conversation 'barks' of the mobs.  This is a game that remembers that it's supposed to be FUN.			"

												Modern rogue-like. This means better controls and ui, great inventory system, steady combat, and difficulty options. You can choose an easier mode and also choose a mode that lets you keep a save file to reload after death. Or you just play it the old fashion way, with permadeath and on highest difficulty. The options make it quite nice. There are plenty of skills to play around with. Tons of items. Each floor of the dungeon is unique. The graphics and writing are very playful. The little descritptions of everything are written with great care. Great game, kudos to Gaslamp(the developers) you guys knew what you were doing.			"
