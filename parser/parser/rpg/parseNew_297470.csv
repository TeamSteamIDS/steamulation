								This game is like a 3d ultima online,  with about less than half the skills and items as ultima online.    Its interesting, but not worth the price per month....   The graphics are par at best,  the animations are barbaric,    There is no missile weapons, so its all hand to hand fighting.   I got bored after a week, and abandoned my last 3 paid weeks,  Cause it just too dang boring!!!			"

								I know is early access. I did buy the game. I was not aware of monthly payments. I was regretting buying the game, much having monthly payments. I guess everyone loves monthly payments, I would too.  Some things are very frustrating in this game. Since I just left long message in forum, I will keep it short here. I went throught most the tutorial. Some things are easy to find, some things I do not have a clue. I am not impressed with what others have built and gave up on I guess. Looks abandoned to me. I am bored to rashes. I went in all excited, but came out withered and contorted. I can't even recommend this game for $29 much less monthly payments along with with it. I bought one of the Dev's lunch, unless they went to a Taco Place, then maybe I bought the whole staff! I maight try about one more hour and see. I can always change to a positive report. At least if I could made a new leather bag in decent time, it would be a plus.  I got tons of leather, but I cannot find a needle to sew with.  And running is too slow, get very tedious. Other than that, that fishing was fun, finally caught a huge shark!!! (wink)			"

								The screenshots make it look a lot better than it is.Played this with a friend, the options menu for video settings is horrendous, you have to cycle though 720x360x10-20-30-59-60HZ options to get to the next resoltuion and when you finally do, the gui doesnt scale in size nor appears to have an option to, so if you want to read it, leave it insanely low.The PVP server we tried was completely dead, engine was lacking, (jumping was just... wut?).It reminded me of another somewhat similar game that was mildly confusing, didnt help you out much, but there were populated servers. This is completely dead, not a soul. There are SOOOO many options, buttons, etc. I've played many mmorphs like WoW, Tera, RIFT, etc. They all have a pretty straightforward setup, there was a terraforming skill I managed to find and everytime I went to atempt to use one of the abilities I got the response 'YOU MUST HAVE A SHOVEL EQUIPPED IN YOUR LEFT HAND' well I had already dragged a shovel to said hand, even tried switching it and my dagger, no luck.Just insanely confusing, GUI was not much better, graphic wise it looks better int he sceenshots than actual gameplay. If it's just one guy, it's pretty cool, but compared to all of the other games out there similar to this that have come out, it's not even in the same ballpark.			"

								I find myself really wanting to recommend this game, but i cannot. Stay far away from it if you're looking for something that it is actually worth your money. The month you get with buying the game is fun, if you find some established players you can enjoy being around. After that, the $15 monthly fee is really hard to fork up.Saying the combat is crude would be a complement, and you are punished for completely filling up your food and water bar. If you can get around these playing elements, as it is still early access, then I would love to hear even one good reason to lump this with any other subscription based game that asks for that kind of money. I hear some people boast the terrain is pretty. I would say its more like a pretty big pain in the♥♥♥♥♥and the best graphical quality still pales in comparison to any other subscription based game.""But the subscription is optional"",  you might say. It really isn't. All your skills are limited to 30 instead of 100. Are you okay doing 30% normal damage and taking 330% more damage. Because thats what low quality stuff you will be stuck with. That, or you can leach off someone else for high quality items.			"

								Absolute blast. The community is very helpful and friendly.  The crafting system is very, very, in depth. This is true sandbox. You looking for a theme park experience? This is not for you. Quests, carts, tools, buildings, roads, docks, bridges, everything is player built. If you can see it, use it, walk on it, someone took the time and effort to create it. Bad community? absolutly not. those bridges you are crossing, somone took the time to build them so you're journey is unobstucted. That fire lighting up the road... somone built it and cut firewood so you're way is lit.  Sick of all the good sandboxes being PVP? no problem. It offeres both PVP and PVE servers.  Like to group play? No problem. Someone is always looking for a tribe memmber to fatten the ranks.  Like to play solo? No problem. Find a piece of land to call you're own and begin that settlement. So much gameplay I cant possibly mention it all here.                                                               I would like to share a couple stories that I feel express the soul of the game. About two years ago I played this, I was lost. Decided to join a tribe, took a few minutes to find one. I did well we got along. Life took me from gaming for a bit. Logged back in and the tribe had vanished. Picking up my belongings, hungry, thirsty I decided to trail my own path. Eventually I found my piece of land to call home.  Life was ruff. My shovel was worn and my back was sore from carrying so much timber. My old Tribe leader noticed me in chat and sure enugh the tribe was still kiking and had simply moved. I explained that my time and effort was imprtant to me and I would continue my work on my settlement. Several hours later my Tribe leader showed up with my old cart. She had dragged that cart all the way around the world to ensure my shelter would be up before winter. Inside the cart was a good supply of tools and food to keep me going. I never asked, she simply did it.                                                                          My first real multi-story structure was started on a Saturday morning. By Sunday evening I was about to ram Xsyon up somone's a**. that building caused me more grief than the IRS.  I was flustered and agitated. I asked in global chat what was I doing wrong and being that no one was accually there to see my issue it would be difficult to determine. I simply had a melt down in chat LOL. Seriously, I was mad. I was about to log off. Closed my gate and began to log off. I turned around to go into my cabin and there stands a GM. I did not hit any help buttons. I didn't scream for GM help in chat. She simply showed up. She did'nt lecture to me about my attitude or threatened a ban, she simply helped me. After a few seconds of education my tower was complete. The issue was so simple.   Wessendale is now populated by 14 people and thriving. Our land mass is vast and we house many multi-story buildings, and holdings that would impress even a king.                                                                     The game is buy to play. It's umm 30 bucks? No monthly fee. No in-game store or micro payments. What are you waiting for? just get it. Thats about the cost of a bad movie and some popcorn. You will get far more than two hours out of this. Don't show up thinking you will run the Xsyon world in twenty minutes, not going to happen. It's the hardships that make this game what it is. Show up with determination and perseverance. Be steadfast and study. In the end you earned what you created.See you in-game!Wessmyre			"

								The short version:Xsyon is a great game and if you're a fan of player made worlds, interesting crafting/building systems, or post-apocalyptic survival games, it's definitely worth checking out.The long version:I started playing Xsyon back in 2011, before the game was available on Steam. The game is early access, but don't let that scare you away - in it's current state, the game offers enough content to keep you busy indefinitely. Early access games have been known to contain game-breaking bugs and unfinished features, but that's not the case with Xsyon, as the features that are in the game work. I have encountered bugs from time to time (as in any game), but I have to say that once reported, they are fixed - fast. I've seen the game's dev come into the game and talk with me personally to fix one. The game's team of moderators (guides) are active in not only helping players out with any issues or even questions about the gameplay, but they also hold events and generally seem interested in what they're doing. There have been many major patches rolling out important new features since I've been playing.There is a skill system in place leading to the gathering, crafting, food and building systems. The crafting system allows you to create a ton of different armors, weapons, and utility gear (carts, tools, etc) from materials gathered in the world. The building system allows you to take crafted and gathered objects and build structures in the game (other players can see and interact with the structures, and you and even let them work with you in building them). The building is extremely interesting and has a large array of pieces available, allowing players to create anything from small tents and huts to immense palaces and castles (I have to admit that I personally spend a LOT of time building with my friends in the game - by the time I finish 1 project I have 5 more ideas that I want to try out). The food system allows players to hunt, fish and grow and forage lots of different things, and cook them to make food - it's easy to do the minimum, but players that really invest themselves in this system can create very powerful food items that can help in every day things. The skill system as a whole works well - it's easy to throw yourself in one skill and master it, but harder to master 2 skills, and so on. Playing solo is possible, but the game is much easier playing as a group, allowing you to focus on your chosen skill(s) without worrying about the others.The game is definitely worth checking out - I know I've spent a lot of time playing it (I only connected my Steam and Xsyon accounts a few months ago, even though I started playing in 2011, and am at over 600 hours on Steam) and will continue to play it for a long time.

								If you're a hardcore crafter the buck stops here. Grind to your heart's delight. I put off getting this game and tried Albion, Elder Scrolls, Shroud of the Avatar, Wurm...none of them did me any good. I'm an old school player, and enjoy open world/sandbox play with no questing or linear gameplay. This game is about as sandbox as it gets. I'm already addicted! If you like action MMO's this is not up your alley, but if you like unlimited freedom and a complex crafting game with a little combat thrown in, this one's for you. Also, anyone reviewing this game with less than a couple hours played hasn't even finished the tutorial and has no business commenting on it. Yes the tutorial takes that long - longer actually. This game is NOT for those who want instant gratification and think graphics make a game. The graphics are more than good, they're just not cutting edge. If that's what you want spend your money elsewhere.This game makes you work hard for everything you do. THAT's the challenge. Can you handle it?			"

								As you can tell I play this game alot. I love sandbox games! I can agree that this game is not newbie friendly as the tutorial is just something you read. I reccomend to any new player to ask the community for help as we are very friendly. Don't let these negative reviews turn you away from this game. Xsyon is a game kinda like WURM in the sense of grind a skill to lvl it up. The terraforming is better I believe than WURM. I have tried to plau WURM and just cant get used to the controls. Where as Xsyon controls are a little more easily understandable. The Devs are awesome! Time to time they will talk to the community in-game and ask for oponioins. Literally that alone is amazing! Come on to Xsyon and see for yourself. The graphic requirements are low enough for a laptop to handle with hardly any issues. If you decide to play follow these small tips1,) I reccomend googling ""Xsyon Map"" (You will need this)2.) Try to get into a TRIBE (Guild) as soon as possible)3.) DO NOT!!! Make a Troll Charater-- You Height and Weight does effect your gameplay, so playing a short and fat midget means you will be able to carry a little more but run out of endurance faster.			"

								I played this game years ago when it first came out and all you could do was terraform the landscape. It quickly lost my attention. I picked it up when it came out on Steam and outside of the low server population, this is a must have game for those into survival/building games. If you like crafting, gathering supplies, exploring, and building structures you will find plenty to do. You can build roads, terraform the landscape, farm the land, cut down trees, build everything in game, and all of this is visible to other players. Everything in game ages and/or gains xp. That Reverant that killed you an hour ago, stole your clothes and shovel from your corpse and now struts around with those items on him, taunting you to come kill him to get it back.Amazingly this game is ran by a single developer; yet, has more thought and work done to it then most MMO's on the market today. If you are looking for a game where twitchy fingers wins the day, this is not that game. This is a survival game, with what could be an attempt at a Trading simulation game. Although there are many aspects of the game that remain unpolished, it is extremely playable and stable, and simple in many regards.The learning curve is somewhere in between WoW and EVE online. It does not appear to have the same depth as EVE Online, but give this game a full staff of developers and it could easily come close over time. The next UO, probably. The next WoW, possibly. It just would depend which direction it went. Of course, neither matter if the graphics do not keep up.The immediate downfall of the game is that the communications systems in game are horrible and most people are into solo gameplay. A new person joining the game is dropped into the middle of a huge map (literally can take hours to travel from one part to another). The server population is so low that I have only seen other players when I requested to meet them in person and travelled to their location. However, everyone is extremely nice and friendly. If the developer moved in the direction of an EVE economy I think this game would have serious staying power, and be able to expand rapidly. However, if one cannot view at distances items for sale, then one might as well be playing a solo or cooperative game, not an MMO. This game needs some way to allow a greater sense of where you as an individual, as a tribe stand in relation to others.Overall, I recommend this game, with the reservations noted above.			"

								First of all, the community in this game is awesome, amazing. By and large it is the most mature, friendly and helpful in-game community I have experienced. There aren't very many people playing but there are enough active tribes that would love to recruit you and you won't have to be isolated unless that is how you want to play it. Pros: The community. The unique and quirky style, which is a post-apocalyptic- zombie- low fantasy - Native American inspired -with brightly colored mutant animals that want to eat you - combo. It is a bloody mental mix but I really, really like it. There is immense variety in crafting. The world is beautiful and pretty huge. You can farm and build mind boggling structures. Fully player-driven world. Development is ongoing with new features coming in occasionally and fixes regularly. Cons: low population. Crafting is somewhat grindy and a clickfest. There isn't really an end-game, you really have to take responsibility to create you own experience because the game is player-driven to the extent where you need to self-motivate 100%.  PVP isn't really a thing, I mean there is the PVP server, but no one actually PVPs because 1) combat system is not very good, 2) there aren't enough players on the PVP server to feel justified in killing those few brave souls who care to show up because then you'd be all alone, and 3) there isn't much reason to PVP... most people play this game to roleplay building their town/ mansion and explore the world. This last one isn't really a con IMO.Over all, quite a few cons - but those pros carry much more weight for me. The unique style and feel of the world along with the chance to be really creative and build up amazing looking communities with some really great people - that is basically what I want from a game and so rarely experience. Not everyone will appreciate Xsyon so research thoroughly before you buy. If you are like me you'll be stuck. I have played for over three years (most of that time I didn't launch through steam so my hours played are misleading) and though I am too busy these days to find much time for games, I keep coming back.

								For fans of sandbox MMOs Xsyon is a must.  This game has A LOT of character and offers a very unique experience than your dime a dozen mainstream MMO.  I played it for a while before it came to steam and for a fan of Ultima Online and SWG there are a lot of familiar mecanics here, namely a skill gain by use system.  Everything you do from walking, swimming, crafting, lumberjacking to foraging has a skill attached to it and the more you do that particular thing, the better you get at it.  So everything you do has meaning.  Like real life Xsyon seeks to create a virtual realm where you can basically learn and improve on whatever you wish.  There is also building and terraforming.  You can claim a plot of land, shape it and start building on it - completely open world, where everyone can see it happening.  Guilds can build veritable towns.  You also have the option to choose either a PVP or PVE server, so those who hate ganking will find a very enjoyable and casual gameplay experience on the PVE server along with a very friendly community.One word of warning though.  If combat is your main thing then you might want to give this game a little more time to develop.  The hunting is also a work in progress since there are no ranged weapons/bows as of yet.  Chasing a squirrel through the woods when it's at a fraction of health just to have it jump in a lake and run off because your stamina got too low to persue it is not my idea of fun.  But if you like building, crafting and resource gathering like I do, you will love this MMO.			"

								Im not one for writing reviews.....but i will write one for this game. This game is a rare gem that i have been looking for a long time. Extremely in depth crafting system and just plain fun to play. It has its share of negative reviews but I find it to be a well thought out and implemented game. The player population is pretty low....but I believe that will change. Give it a try.....if you....like me are looking for an in depth crafting/survival/mmo....you wont regret it. It has a steep learning curve but it is worth it once you have learned how to play it properly. The graphics are not triple A....but they are good and unique which creates an a great atmposphere for the game. The community is warm and friendly....(at least on the PVE server....I havent played on the PVP server yet)...and willing to help new players. In my opnion....the developers of this game have done a great job....and they continue to improve it. This game does not deserve all the negative reviews it has gotten on steam in my opinion.....these reviews mostly come from people who bought the game and got something different from what they were expecting and didnt know there was a sub to keep playing after a month. I dont know if the sub warning was there when it was first placed on steam....but its there now and you can also keep playing for free if you wish but with a skill cap or 30. Don't judge this game til you've tried it....it is a very refreshing take on this kind mmo....that i havent see in years and i've played a lot of mmos. And for those of you with older computers like me.....it does work on Windows Vista Home Premium and runs fine. Lastly....my opinion on the sub: paying a subscription to play an mmo doesn't bother me if it is a good game that I will enjoy spending some of my free time on. ""Game On People!""			"

								Hello there Gamers!I didn't really play this game very much because of the skill cap(no monthly sub penalty) but recently it has switched to no subscription!!!!!!Right now there is a disscussion going on if they should add an option subscription for $4.99 but that isn't confirmed yet.So to everyone that turned down this game because of the monthly sub I recommend giving this game a try! For new players there is a lot to do in this game. You can go out collection resources for the many different crafts like the Armors (Cloth, Grass, Leather, Bone,) there is toolcrafting weaponcrafting and a pretty cool building system.If your like me and like to hunt for food and crafting matts then there is that to. You kinda have to ""hunt"" out your prey to get your food and crafting matts. Make sure you have a knife and enter combat mode by pressing C before attacking! :PAnyways this a pretty great game. Very sandboxy you just go out and do what you want, can explore and check out all the big tribes around or whatever you want.Hope to see you in-game!			"

								I tried it for a night because I was bored with Minecraft for a bit. It has now been a few months and I don't think I've played much beside Xsyon. I'm a long goal person. I can work on something for days on end, this is my paradise. Combat is deadly. Rats may kill you. All this passes. It may take a few days, weeks, or months; but you'll get there if you want to get there.  I've been on 6 months or so at this point and I have found so many helpful and fun people to build a community with. It isn't about raids, but you CAN go kill a revenant camp. It is about surviving and thriving in a huge open world.			"

								At first I was a little hesitant to spend the money on Xsyon. First, I’m cheap. Second, it takes a lot for a game to hold my interest and I haven’t had success with MMORPGs for many years. I’m so happy I took the risk!I’ve been playing on the Peace (PvE) server for several weeks. The community is small enough where you get to know the other players and everyone is friendly and helpful. They’re very welcoming to new players and you can tell from how they talk about the mechanics, that the players are dedicated and really love the game.My favorite feature is being able to pick out a place almost anywhere on the map to create and customize a homestead. While many of the aspects of Xsyon aren’t entirely unique, they’re executed in a way that is rewarding and a lot of fun. If you enjoy crafting focused sandbox games, I suggest giving it a try!			"

								Hello!I am writing this review to let everyone know just how much I like this game.AND It seems very odd to me that Xsyon is so underrated and unknown! This game has so much to offer a player like me. I am older, in my 60's but have played mmo's since they first came out.I have played all the major old school mmo's like Everquest, and many of the newer class of games like Allods, terra and the like. Im a huge fan of seamless 3d environments, and really like the feel of Xsyon.One thing I really like, is that I don't have to rush to the ""end"" here. With so many skills to work with and so many things to craft and build, I reckon i'll be here for years. Oh, and speaking of building, you should see the amazing things people build in this game! I have been on a walk about all over, and have seen things like full sized castles, indoor swimming pools, paddocks for animals, and cool little villages. I have not don't much building yet but from what i gather from players, its a module style building system, with things like wall, truss, and roof parts that you can put together in many different combos. Plenty of styles to choose from as well. I've done a fair bit of crafting so far and it is pretty typical of other games. I do like the way this game provides the baski tools you need to give it a go. I learned the hard way that the first thing you should do with your starter tools is make more starter tools!  I reckon my next project will be to make me some armour.The community in this game is true blue. Always helpful and willing to keep ya going. Like, they warned me not to mess with ""revs"" yet till I was a bit more experienced. Once I found them at an abandoned homestead, I know what they meant. Imagine sick starkers running around trying to kill you and you have the picture. Most had twice the hit points I had and I had to run away not to die. I have'nt even tried animals yet, but I'm sure that day will come. All in all, this game may not be your cuppa, but if you enjoy a good community, and time to make your mark, then you are gonna love this game. Please don't take my word for it though, just go all in and try it mate!  You won't regret it!   "

								~~Positives~~Its making a comeback.  From what I heard it hit a point where the servers were almost dead and then they removed the monthly payments.You buy the game.. then you own it.  Thats how games worked for years and thats how games should work. No in-game stores, The gameplay is a fun survival crafter that puts a big emphasis on teamwork and working together as a tribe.Its not action packed as the combat system is in the proccess of being revamped but the Dev is actively polling the players on the Forums for input on how they want the game to be created which for me personally Is a huge draw. -Dev listens-No Uplay-The crafting Systems can be a bit complex and overwhelming at first but the player base is extremely friendly and always willing to help which is another plus. - There is no griefing either unless you are inactive for an excess of 6 months I believe is the current time frame you get before people can start dismantling your things or take over your tribe lands.  -Your storage units like bins, carts, and tents can be locked be given different privacy settings.-No botting is also a +-No in game currency or set prices. While their is dollars they have no use so for some that kind of currency is not accepted.  The economy is completely driven by the players.-Huge map-Tons of skills and ways to make your niche that Level up with use. Even Jumping is a levelable skill-Lots of flexibilty with your skill point gains which comes in to play as you work towards Specializing your character.~~Negatives~~-Overwhelming at first-If your someone that wants to be awesome at everything that is not possible with one character.-Lots of items that youll find that are more of a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to try to save up than its worth(terrible for us packrat types)Xyson is one of those games that isnt out to make everyone happy, just the people that like sandbox survivals.If you ever need help just ask in chat or whisper me on the PvE server IG: Fwick.

								Xsyon is a post apocalyptic MMORPG.  In Xsyon, you will craft various things to assist in your enjoyment of the game.  That is the overall premise. You spawn in the world with very basic clothing and weapons.  You must then find a settlement or tribe, which is the guild system in Xsyon.  If you're lucky like I was, you'll find a good tribe that will hook you up with all the tools and gear you need to survive.  In just 1 day of play time, I was given a cart, bags, and better armor for my travels from the tribe I joined.  So my experience was handed to me initially.  If you don't get all that stuff, the game can be quite fun as you grind skills to craft better stuff.I think if you aren't given everything, the game is more enjoyable as you feel like a true survivor.  As for the combat, unless you play on a PVP server, there's little point in combat.  Right now, it is pretty terrible.  You get screen lag, bad hit detection and the mobs will usually glitch all over the terrain in front of you as you haplessly run after the little critters in an attempt to slay them.  To do any action in Xsyon, you must first equip the required tool in your ""right"" hand.  For some reason everyone in the world is right handed.  I found this a chore.  You have to open your inventory, drag the tool to your weapon slot, foregoing your weapon, then do the activity.  If you get attacked, you must then quickly open your inventory and drag your weapon to your right hand.  It's cumbersone and clunky.  As I stated above, the performance is an issue.  Looking at massive structures will cause most people to lag out.  I dropped to 8 fps from 30+ just looking in a certain direction.  This problem is noticed by the dev, and I've spoken to him about it so I know for certain.  He's trying to fix the code for this so it doesn't force the user to process everything in the base even though they aren't in the actual base looking at all those assett's.  So why am I recommending this?  It is a unique game.  I can say Xsyon is a one of a kind experience.  It is grindy as all heck though.  You'r skills, unless you have a high intelligence, will go up at a snail's pace. So this requires you to sit in one spot for hours a day and grind one specific resource to mass produce items to level up one particular skill.  If you enjoy this, then you will enjoy Xsyon.  The survival aspect is moderately difficult.  Once you find out where to find animals, you can quickly find meat and cook it.  Water is everywhere in the center of the map.  Going out further you will have some trouble.  A waterskin solves this problem however.  In fact, I was given a waterskin as my first item when I joined the tribe.  So my experience won't be like the average noob.Stick with the game.  The ONE dev there is, is trying to fix broken features right now, like combat.  You will probably never see things like better performance or seiges on tribal bases because there is alot on his plate right now.  If the dev team was 9-10 people, you probably would.  But this game doesn't make enough money to support that size.  At least the subscription is gone now.A few things I'd like to see added to Xsyon:- Being able to mine just about anywhere.- The ability to build small houses even if you area already in a tribe.  This complaint comes up because the tribe I joined was well established and already had their base.  So, gone is the ability to really terraform and create the world I want to live in as the game tag line suggests.  - Torches to carry around.  - Posts to attach said torches to so you can have some decent light at night.I'd say if you want a truly voxel based terraforming MMO with other players, you should look to 7 days to die, Life is Feudal or Minecraft.  Xsyon was never meant to handle full player buildings all over the map.  If you want to build your own house and cultivate crops, you need to create your own tribe.  Here is my video review for Xsyon:

								I originally played for a month or two back in '11, and recently came back when they removed subs- the changes they've made since then are amazing.Not for the impatient or those seeking instant gratification, Xsyon has the feel of Minecraft-meets-Everquest  (or maybe the other way around...)  Once you get a feel for the many features of the Xsyon world, you might find yourself lost for hours doing anything from building to hunting to a myriad other things.			"

								i have just started playing and have found the small community to be very helpful.  I will say the jury is still out on wheather i think its worth buying.. i am still playing it.  It is very difficult to get started, i was lucky and an experienced player came from a far distance and spent over an hour with me teaching me the fundamentals.  he probably saved me many hours of trying to figure it out myself, as the tutorial was not very helpful.I am now having a problem that im sure will stop a lot of new players from playing.  the came is a crafting, building survival game.  you start with a basic set of tools to do the crafting.  these tools wear out in a little while.  you have receies to make some of them but not all.  im at a point where my two of my main crafting tools have worn out and i cant make new ones because i dont have the receipe.  I have found a tribe ldr that is willing to give me tools if i join his tribe (he might give them even if i didnt join).  This problem nearly caused me to give up playing because you cant play without the tools.  all the basic tool receipes should be there, and make you scavenge or harvest the materials to make them.  more advanced tools could be hard to get but not beginner tools.I do thank all the experienced players for all their help when i ask questions in chat.

								Great game if you love gathering, farming, and building either by yourself or with friends.Combat on the other hand isn't so great. It's clunky and takes even more work than everything else to raise your skill in it, with the running and chasing of prey. Even the smallest of creatures can take you down if you arn't careful even with a boosted starting skill in combat. (Nothing like being killed by a Hamster on your first hunt haha)Very helpful and friendly community. I've been playing for a while now and seen 1st hand a lot of people more than willing to mentor any new players who are having a rough time.I will warn you though, it does move at a very slow pace rather your gathering, hunting, farming, or building.All in all I highly recommend this game if you're looking for a builder to sink your time into			"

								To me this is a refreshing change of pace from others like Rust or Ark, I keep finding myself return to the world of Xsyon to fill the void I can not seem to find in no other. If your looking for a survival to hold your hand your in the wrong place. I like that the scrap piles never regen what is gone is gone, Old tribes decay and some of there members turn to revenents (zombie) and will equip items they find or loot from your corpse, It's a harsh crule world. I like that ;) If you want something abit more hardcore this just might be for you, I just got my steam key a few days ago as it  just went sub free, meaning one time buy which is great, I played this years ago when there was a sub and much less content I'd still pay for a sub today, So yes I do recommend this game to pay less for more is always a win win in my books.I'm excited for the future of this game.

								so my thoughts on xsyon - I'd rank it a solid 7 outta 10 in its current state - it is playable and enjoyable - the graphics are solid for a early access indie game - for a sandbox game the grinding is not bad - compared to similar titles its down right pleasent - the game revolves on a end of the world scenario where people try to survive alone or in tribes while rebuilding - terraforming and building structures finding scrap metals plastics and other goods in rubbish piles or cutting down trees and getting rocks - fishing hunting or farming for food - all in all a pretty standard sandboxso why should you buy it? The community while small (semi average for a sandbox indie) it is a polite and dedicated group - the 15dollars a month keeps most angry children and trolls from really being a threat to your gaming exp and to me thats worth it after having been trolled in dozens of games (didn't work but still is a waste of my limited time) with them randomly attacking me or blowing something up for no reason and taking hours and hours to repair (far more hours then it would take for me to earn the 15 dollars) so as such the monthly fee keeping the game going me not having to buy 25-40$ a month/week in cash shops to keep up with people and no paid expansion packs or DLC means I am exactly the same as everyone else in the game complete and total fairness - yeah skill based put into the game and be stronger not paid to win - the xsyon style I do enjoy the tribal indian post apocalypse blend, the several choices of buildings tools weapons and armor was very nice as I'm able to really create either a scavenger society of metal and tires or a pioneer camp of logs or even a grass and twig town allowing for large customization of my settlementso now time for the pro and cons- great sandbox building set with structures being as big or as small as you need with several varities of buildings fences and - lots of choices for clothing weapons and tool styles each needing different resources- limited grinding for resources or construction - moderate to average on skills high level skills actually making you work for them instead of being given to you.- good blends of skill selection - starting kits tailored to your choices at start up - select axe as your weapon you get a axe select pick you get a pick ect ect - no starting short sword and shield generic kit- solid community willing to talk and help cons-the games a bit confusing out of the gate - and needs a new tutorial / upgraded wiki majorly but after a week its not bad- limited decorations for inside a house - outside a house plenty of choices but not allot of furniture rugs ect- no current taming system - its in the works and I will remove this once its in- combat is a bit hit and miss atm - you can kill most small animals (squirels hampsters bunnys) but they tend to run from you and the actual click to hit system is a bit sensative meaning you have to hit a small animal running through the grass and its a bit difficult at times - they are supposed to be increaseing the hit detection area on small animals to remedy this and will be removed when added- no ranged combat - only melee weapons sorry- limited pvp - as the core game everyone uses is main job atm pvp feels a bit left out and the pvp server has very few people spaced far out on it.the pro/con - this is the section that could go either way for you - some like these options some don't - and some I just have mixed feelings toward -few to no trolls - might not be a big deal to you but I have a job / family / and life away from computer so knowing I won't have to log in and deal with some angry child blowing up half my town cause his parents told him he couldn't go out with friends is major bonus for me- low player base - this is a game of hundreds to thousands not hundreds of thousands it is ment to be a small market game catering to the people who enjoy this kind of game not to the masses - to me this is big as finding a unique game mmo not just a mini run your own server game is a big pro for me as I feel like I know those around me at same time people get a bit quiet at times which can be a turn off for others- many features have not been implamented - the current game is solid but allot of those I would really like features are coming but not yet in the game - while I can't wait for them to get in game I also can't wait. . . . seriously I want them now lolsso would I buy this game again? Yes - Will I play this game hard core for years? probably off and on yes like any sandbox this is a game you will keep coming back to once you have had your fill and keep enjoying it			"

								I've had about 1500hrs in Xsyon before it hit steam. I enjoyed spending time doing projects like grinding skills up to 100.00 and polishing my crafts and stats to be able to craft some of the best gear and the tools to make them. Traveling around to spot dangerous animals, find and loot abbandoned player tribes and trespassing on people's turfs to see what they've built (and if there are any bins they forgot to lock).PROs:- Survival gameplay (eat, drink, scavenge, farm, manage inventory, run from everything untill you can fight)- Tribe/village/homestead construction with many options (pvp/storage safety in home tribe)- Cosy, postapocalypse environment (the graphics adds to the charm)- Honing skills (if you like grinding)- Intricate crafting system- Entertaining melee combat system (if you can fight and got the equipment)CONs:- Few players to interact with (does add to the postapoc feeling)- Lots of grinding (if you dislike it)- Steep learning curve (most newbs need to ask questions to learn the basics, but there is usually someone online to help)- Recipy system (requires grinding to randomly unlock crafting recipes, or scavenging/buying schematics/blueprints frm others to learn how to make most things)- No firearms in a postmodern apocalypse, currently only melee combat (archery is planned, eta sometime before never).

								I really want to like this game, the potential is off the charts, but at the moment summed up it is just a watch a progress bar deplete slowly simulator. Want to make a fire? click every 5 seconds to gather granite x10, fail making your fire 3x so you have to repeat that 4x 200 seconds gone... want to make a pouch? Well gather up about 5,000 grass piles (about 5 seconds each) Craft them another 5s each. So if you're willing to throw away literally days of your life to be able to do basic things in the game than give it a try.Feels like a Mortal Online met with Life is Feudal, but on a 'safe' minecraft server. There is garbage (backpacks,carts, random loot) everywhere that can't be interacted with because : magic? Found a cart that says it hasn't been interacted with in 30 days (inactive) but I can't destroy it or open it up or do anything with it? I'm on the pvp server what gives.Seems like it good be a good game at some point, but not right now. You can swim in freezing water naked np, like Wim Hoff.There is a lot to like about the game but ultimately the animations (ghoul I faught) ruin the combat (seems like it could be great like mount and blade with time) and the magic protections on abandoned structures / carts kind of ruin it for me.

								NO MORE SUBSCRIPTION FEES: BUY ONCE PLAY FOREVERXsyon is a open world post apocalypse sandbox set after some unknown event that wipes all traces of technology off the face of the earth. The game is set around Lake Tahoe and use the USGS Geological survey data of the surrounding area between California and Nevada. You have the ability to terraform the terrain to help you build a small shack or a large city. You can’t dig tunnels or go underground.Xsyon Features a fairly good skill system that allows you to craft weapons, tools, armor, clothing, buildings and baskets. You can fish anywhere there is water and cook at a campfire, there is also a recipe system that allows you create food which has buffs.You're able to place totem poles which allow you to control land, protect your containers and prevent players from damaging you(pvp server). This also gives you a place to re spawn.I was a big Star Wars Galaxies player back in the day and this game checks a lot of the SWG boxes, yes i'm aware of the emulator.For city builder/planners this game is a lot of fun, there are some bugs its honestly a very relaxing game to play (on the pve server). The playable area is only about 20-30% of the actual game world map itself. If the population ever grew the game world is ready to expand to about 3-4x the current size once the game leaves prelude(i think ea and prelude are the same thing now).PvP is fun if your able to join an existing tribe, I'm mainly a crafter but i do like PvP, i have a character on both servers. Make sure you get into an existing tribe on the War server if you join that server. (dont cry if you get jumped and lose all your stuff thats the point of the war server).It gets a lot crap because it was created by 1 person, with only some contractors here and there helping out. But with any bugs or flaws its better than most of the junk that is coming out today. People complain about the grind because honestly your NOT supposed to grind your skills to level 100 on day 1. If you join a community of players on the server and help out with building a small city you level your skills the intended way. (sorry generation tumblr) I level upped about half of my basketry skills on my character just making the grass components for our tribes architect. Who in turn was building our starting house. Xsyon is a better RPG than Fallout4 & The Division :DIv'e played this game off and on since the 2011 launch. Common question: Game has been out since 2011 what gives?Xsyon is a MMO, much like EQ, RS, Wurm and WoW; WoW took 4-5 years to create and had the disposal of the Blizzard staff. Xsyon doesn't have the luxury, It was created by 1 person and some contractors off and on that have tried to help. Much like when minecraft was released, features aren't completed and wont be completed until a time only the developer knows.Building is hands down the most solid feature of this game and its one of the most time consuming. PvP does have problems but it is still fun.Feel Free to check my recent games history when your wondering if this game is worth it:http://steamcommunity.com/id/xyberviri/games/This isn't even my main character at this time, ive put in more play time than steam can show because of the other account i use. Then ask your self, Do i own any of those games? Are they just not doing it for me?I bought the gold edition of the division because i though it would be fun.... i should have just bought 3 more copies of Xsyon for my friends that wanted to try it.Iv'e been wasting a couple of days in Stelaris but i think im mostly done...

								(Warning, the following review is my first impression of this game for the first 4 hours) (also, please don't be misleaded by the negaive reviews because 90% of the issue has been fixed including the monthly subscription as it has been offically removed).Joined into this world, asked for help and people instantly replies and invited me to join their tribe while teaching me everything about the basics of crafting and survival. They answer every single question I've asked and stayed with me for 2 hours to start me off. Just purely from my experience it defines that this game has a great community, now let's just take a look at other popular MMORPG games, WoW or Runescape, the community is simply toxic. Unlike this game...My ratingCommunity = 10/10Grinding = 10/10Releasing Dopamine = 10/10Atmosphere = 10/10Gameplay = 8/10There's only 1 world in PVE and PVP just like our old planet earth and only we can shape the world we wanted.Ever wondered what your life would be if you were living in a world without technology? well here it is! like an alternative dimension in the theory of quantum physics because it feels like we're living in a different dimension as there's only one world. Also, similar to our world resources could run out. EG if everyone is recklessly cutting trees without planting the seed back they could potentially be endangered because for certain trees you have to wait for a entire real time month for a full tree to grow back. There are also seasons which rotates every 2 weeks IRL time and actually plays a huge role in this game. For instance, during winter if you farm you would actually get less resource back because its cold and night would last significantly longer. (Vice versa for other seasons). Did I mention that I haven't even barely scratched the surface of this game?!#When a community unites, nothing is impossible...Now... Let us create a world only to be ever dreamt off in this alternative universe...			"

								I love build and survive games and I give this one a 7/10 score. The game has long shifting seasons and day/night cycles. I find the world pretty, although it could use some more wildflowers and berry bushes to color things up. I like the gathering resources and work on crafting skills part. I have not done much base building yet, so no opinion on that, right now. The most negative thing I have to say about it is that the game is too dark. Other then camp fires there are no lightsources in the game. Where are the torches, candles and lanters? I want lit up settlements. I want to see other players pulling their well lit carts at night. I want a candle-hat to wear when I go scavnge garbage heaps in the dark!			"

								This game is a breath of fresh air from your stereotypical MMO. 2 server options - PvE and PvP. Go it alone surviving in the wilds or join one of the thriving player-ran frontier towns. Slow skill progression, but a friendly community. Not for the type of player who likes non-stop combat, but I for one fancied a change to constantly slaying insignificant bosses. A good step up for anyone who has played on a Minecraft server with skills and town plugins and enjoyed taking on the role of a survivalist in a world of other players. So pleased I found this game, no subscription fees once you buy now.			"

Great gameIf you love these kinds of games (as I do), you really should consider looking into this one. I share my more detailed thoughts on Xsyon in the following video for those interested ;)


YouTube™ Video: Xsyon Gameplay 2016 - The Game / Xsyon Review-ish - Prelude Let's Play [EP5] 

			Views: 5,181		

			Xsyon Prelude is a post apocalyptic sandbox survival MMO RPG - let's get started! Enjoy the video? Give it a LIKE! Xsyon centers on the Lake Tahoe region in a post apocalyptic period.		

Some Special ThingsIf you play these kinds of games, you will understand many of the things they have in common, from Crafting gear, to building up your home/settlement/tribe. But here are some things I really enjoy about Xsyon you won't see in most (if any) others like it (so not an exhaustive list - just stuff I really like)...+ Quest Creation - Make a quest... what are you looking for and what are you rewarding someone with for completing it? Add these details to your quest, and anyone can complete it!+ Terrain Reforming - When a settlement is abandoned, the structures left behind can be torn down easily. More importantly, when the supported structures are gone, the terrain (any terraforming done) returns pretty quickly to its natural state! How awesome is that?!+ Skill Up by Doing But Also... - Not only do the skills you use increase as you use them, but at the same time you are doing things (crafting, etc) you are filling an XP bar. When full, you get points to spend on ANY other skills as well. It's a nice combo giving you some options without it being a straight free-for-all.+ Setting - This takes place in post-apocalyptic Lake Tahoe. The ""world"" is the mountainous area surrounding the lake. Things get more dangerous (and rewarding) the farther you explore away from the lake. Native American influences are heavy here and the combination of that with the apoc setting give this really cool ""return to the old world"" feel that is really compelling for me.			"

								I have been with Xsyon from the start. Back in the day it was very promising. Then it turned plain silly bad with no trees around and gankers roaming wild. So it kind of half died and I gave up on it. Years later Xsyon comes to Steam and offers one time purchase and codes for old players so I jump in. And WOW! What I find is one of the most in depth sandboxes around. Crafting is really deep, gathering and architecture amazing and trading has reached finally useful level. Combat still need a MAJOR rework but I heard its under way. And since it's one time purchase only, what is there to lose? If I was completely new to Xsyon I would jump in for this deal straight away. This is not early access title, this is very polished game (not counting combat again) that has a long way to go if community grows to few hundred dedicated people.			"

								Great game!   One of the best sandbox crafting survival games i've played.  Keep in mind this is from a very small developer (one person) its awesome how far this has come.  I've been plaing this game on and off from the original beta.  While its been a slow road the developer has always kept at it and has made good on many of the promissed features.   I would recommend this game to anyone that is looking for a rich crafting and architecture experiance.  Combat is still a bit wonky at this time but the developer has started a discussion to revamp the combat according to what features the community likes from other combat systems.   If its anything like how other aspects have been implemented i'm sure its going to be great!			"

								Decent sandbox game once you get past the technical difficulties the game has with Windows 10. Reccomend running the game in Windows 7 compatability mode and as Administrator in order to avoid Windows 10 long load times, crashes and failures to shutdown the process when you close the game. That being said, it is a interesting survival/sandbox game similar to Wurm with better graphics. It has slow progression and gives you the feeling of real progress and the satisfaction of success with hard work. This game is definately worth a look if you are in to sandbox/survival/crafting/building games. It has a Native American feel to the culture in game ( the guilds or settlements are called tribes and you place a totem to mark your land).			"

								This is a great game for people who like a sandbox to play in. You can shape the world, build, craft, hunt, cook, and socialize. It's a bit like Wurm Online but with and American Indian motif and much better combat. The map is based off the Lake Tahoe area and the cities are reduced to trash piles for you to scavenge for items needed for crafting. You can start a homestead with a 25m x 25m area with only one member or add your friends to your tribe to expand your boundaries. The game has a lot of features so far and I hope they continue adding mroe to it as time goes by.			"

I'm going to be coming back and giving the  game another shot, so for now, you get a switch over to a Recommended from me. -------------------------------------------------------------Previous Review Content:I first played this shortly after it came out. The features were pretty limited and it was buggy, so I didn't play for very long, especially since it's heavily pay-to-win. I kind of got excited when it was launched on Steam, so I bought it. It was around $30 at the time, and it was far worse than it was the first time I played. Despite paying so much for it, I still didn't have all the features, the playerbase had completely diminished (this is a game you NEED others to play with to be fun), and it crashed constantly. Tons of bugs, and support was not helpful at all.Don't waste your time, don't play it.			"

								Ok first the game has potential i like the idea behind it but after giving the game 4 hours i don't think i'll be back for awhile if at all. i enjoyed the variety that the game offers but that is quickly overshadowed by the grinding. the player comunity on the pve server was friendly and helpful for new players but that community is so small and so scattered that if you don't spawn in one of the tribes right off the bat you will find it defficult to find any people near the default starting location. admitedly i probably have not played long enough to fully apreciate the game for what it is but frankly i can't get past the grinding with what seems to me is very little pay out. if the game is on a big sale i would say buy it and decide for your self if you like.

Early Access Review
								New Xsyon player here, and here is what I think of this game in just seven hours.  I will update this review as I continue to work in the game.Simple question: ""Should I buy this game?""General answer: if you like sandbox free-to-do-as-you-please types, then yes.  It's worth the investment.  You can tell a lot of effort has been put into this game, though it's fairly underdeveloped.  The developer still seems actively involved in the community, but the community is lacking.  Nice people, just few of them on.  Expect to solo while you learn, and that's totally fine.This game is crafting heavy, but it takes a lot of time (and boring clicking and clicking and clicking) to get what you want done.  I mean a lot of time!  Not even so much that it's a lot of time, but that it's super slow-going, and very little instruction in-game, with a fairly generic tutorial.  To have the best chance to start enjoying this game, I advise you make basket making your primary starting hobby.  This will help you get to the baskets you'll need to start developing resources without spending ten hours figuring out that you need to do this, and five more leveling it by farming grass and making thread and so on.  Once you have baskets, you're golden to start working the land.My advice further:  Safely navigate around the lake.  Find an area off the lake that has trees, rocks, and access to the lake.  Set up a tribe.  Start developing your totem area (aka learning your crafts).  Get to know the ten players in the game at any given time.  Eventually join their tribe just so you have something to build onto.  Or keep developing your own.By doing this, you will be in a safe zone for learning the basics.  You will be near a source of food (fishing), ability to develop tools and masonry, have baskets to store your stuff while you get started, and eventually be strong enough to get going on your own adventure or join up with others on a mmo adventure.Cons:  This game is still clunky.  Poor in-game tools.  Poor explanations.  Poor interface that is arduous and annoying.  Not intuitive at all.  But as you get the hang of it, it starts to make sense and works out.  But it's still clunky as all getout.  I imagine the developer is still trying to get this thing rolling, but it's been in dev for going on ten years.  Don't expect much.  Get it for what it is and play it accordingly.  It's worth that much.  Maybe by 2050, he will have it working as fluidly as minecraft.			"

								So this is a great game in my opion, yes there is not a huge group(over 1000) playing on it currently, part of that is it use to be pay to play, it is now buy the game and you are set. it is a game where you advance your skills over time to be able to make bigger and better stuff. So those of you out there bashing it remember it is a game that a lot of people lost interest in it because it was a pay to play and it no longer is. Most of the new eople I have seen playing it have been coming back to it quite often as I see them when I am online. It does not have a huge following like WOW but I think the game play is a lot better. you as players can set quests for people to do, you can build your own structures, you can manipulate the land under most circumstances. So while it may have a low following now, partially to still being in early access, I think this game will go far especially after it gets out of early release which the Dev has stated should be happening in the next month or two. As is it is a great game to play in my opinion, mindful that I a on the PVE server not the PVP server, so I cannot comment on that server as far as ow fun it is.			"

Early Access Review
								Highly ambitious and promising, I havnt been this excited to see a game grow in a long time. Now is the time to buy, create your settler, and find a place in the game. It's amazing to watch this barren wilderness being settled by a growing number of player tribes, everything from trading centers to small campsites. The game world is already quite large, so I can't wait to see what the full map holds when the game exits early access.Can't recommend it enough. Have some patience during your first few hours, take the time to familiarize yourself with the different skill options and crafting menus, join one of the many tribes who go above and beyond to help new players learn and settle in, the game will suck you in.EDIT: While I am still excited for the possibilities of this game's future, some of the initial enthusiasm has died down. The devs have been worryingly inactive in the steam community and xsyon forums. Exploring further in the game world has also let me see just how much the player base has lost some major players. there are several extremely large tribes that have control over huge areas off land, have built and terraformed massive settlements, and then vanished, leaving behind these ghost settlements. While it could be cool at first to see the ""ruins"" of a lost tribe, these areas are locking down large plots of land, making them unusable for active players. even more so, many of these old super-tribes were very destructive in the way they gathered resources, meaning there are less forests, valuable junk piles have been used up, and all these resources are just sitting on these old tribes' lands, useless. On the opposite end of the spectrum but equally annoying is all the random ""tribes"" scattered around that were created by 1 player who played for 1 day then quit. these lands are also unusable for active players, often having not a single thing built on them besides the tribe totem pole.I have read elsewhere that tribes are removed if they are inactive for over 3 months. this needs changing. this is far too generous for a single-person tribe, and is useless to help against the large old tribes, which may have 200+ members gone for a year or more, but 1 person keeps logging in, which means that tribe gets to keep all that land. players should be auto-kicked from their tribe if inactive, so that way the tribe will lose that extra land and be reduced to a size that matches the actual number of active members.

								The game is pretty good, as I previously stated, and It's definitely a lot of fun if you play with friends (Or make some, the community is really friendly.).They dropped subs, which is great. I recommend getting this game, or at the very least trying it. It's not much to look at, but the gameplay is pretty solid.-Old review-I haven't played in a long time. But when I did play, the game seemed alright. Looked a little old (Not that that's a bad thing, I liked the way it looked). The gameplay is good, and I enjoyed the scavenging/building. Combat seems alright, although simplistic, but I live in Australia so I couldn't do the whole combat thing.Only thing that dissapoints me is that it's sub based, instead of pay once. I'd like to play and not be shafted, but whatever.			"

								I’ve been playing over a year, mostly off Steam and having a blast! The game takes some time to get into the action but once you do you can really get sucked in. Highlights include….. Awesome building system. Lots of parts to work with and an immersive method of construction. Makes you feel like you’re really building a town from the ground up. Unique and interesting cooking system. You combine any ingredients to make your own recipes which give you additional buffs and powers. You can save your recipes in your cookbook when you come up with something good. Well developed farming system with crops that grow in a few days based on your tending practices. You can water and take care of your crops for good results or do the bare minimum and still benefit. In depth crafting system. The materials you choose determine the results and I like how you can choose the armor you wear mostly based on looks since each armor set can be crafted to have the bonuses that you want for your character. Carts are cool and something I haven’t seen in other games. It’s fun to haul your stash around! This is a good one to play in a group with friends, especially if you’re planning on some serious town building. "

								Back in the day, this game was great. The graphics were good, features were nice, and there was plenty of developers building this game up. This game had an actual fighting chance in the game industry when compared to others in its genre. It was known as Wurm Online 2. I even purchased the game when you had to buy it and pay a monthly subscription with it. Speaking of the payment model, many times the player base and myself talked about how the payment model was bad idea and how it can potentially kill the game or not allow it to get anywhere. I continued to play anyway because I liked the game’s ideas, the genre, and so on.What got me to quit was that I had a guide spawn hostile mobs near me and get me killed because of it, basically abusing their powers. When I confronted him, he said he didn’t do anything and just teleported away. I then afterwards got into an argument with the forum manager who was trying to censor my criticism of the game when providing feedback. At that point I just didn’t want anything to do with the game anymore. The game developer was alright, never seem to cause problems besides making overall poor choices when it came to staff hiring and the payment model.After a while the game went free to play using Wurm Online’s payment model where you had restrictions until you payed somehow, don’t remember exactly if it was a subscription or what. I gave it a try and little to nothing changed. Years after not playing, almost nothing changed, no amazing features, no mounts, no improved combat, just nothing exciting and worth playing. Now the game went to the payment model I wanted from the beginning and so I gave it a try. It’s still the same thing. No real changes, graphics are now outdated, and it appears there is only one developer on the game.At this point, there are two competitors, Wurm Unlimited and Life is Feudal: Your Own. This game just simply doesn’t stand a chance with them, where they’re fully staffed, have better graphics, are more stable, and have far more features. I wanted to like this game, I tried to do my part. The player base is tiny, because the developer made overall poor choices like having terrible staff and having a terrible payment model. The damage has been done, maybe the developer can dig himself out of the hole he’s in. I hope he does, but this game doesn’t appear to have a future. I hope I’m wrong, but I wouldn’t be surprised seeing this game die off soon enough.			"

								I am very new and havent played a long time, but i just wanted to say that I really like this game.I am burned out on all the current games out there where you can pay to win, or everything is easy to get. I guess I'm tired of the lack of challenge.  So far in xsyon, I can see that some people here have done really kewl things, like built cities.I see from my few hours here, that its going to take some time just to build a nice camp here to keep the animals out.And that's exactly why I would reccomend this game to anyone. It's a lot like those old games where you had to do everthing for yourself, only it's even better than those since nothing can be bought from vendor npc's.This game does have a tutorial that will give you the basics, but you still have to do it all yourself.  The population is a bit low, but there are people to chat with, everyone has been very helpful, but so far nobody has been pushy or demanding like you see in so many games.I have finally found the game I was looking for. I am home. "

								I love this game. If you are looking for a strong quest system and a lot of hand-holding through an involved plot line, this is not the game for you. But if you enjoy making your own goals, enjoy foraging and crafting, you may find you'll love Xsyon, too. The subscription fee is very reasonable and I prefer it to microtransactions.The people in Xsyon are friendly, helpful, and good company. After the first few crafting tutorials, crafting makes sense in a way it often doesn't in other games. The possiblilities are endless, expecially for building incredible elaborate camps and strongholds.I can't say how pleasant it is, after a hard RL day, to stand by Lake Tahoe fishing and watching the sunset.  Peaceful, relaxing... a great way to end the day.			"

								This game was a really pleasant surprise.  The post-apocalyptic survival genre seems full, yet this game stands out from all the others.  It has a perfect feel of rebuilding civlization without all the franticness found in other games.The other players are very friendly, and althought the game is technically an MMO, the game is not crowded at all so that the survival feel is retained.The skill progression occurs at a healthy but not punishing rate, and there are many things to craft and do in the game.  I highly recommend this one.			"

								This game held my interest for about a week. I was really liking it then it slowely just became very repetative and more of a grind than fun. There are very few players still online so starting/joining colonies and thinking you will have people there to do it with you is very unlikely. I see rare events being held in the game to keep some people interested, however I would rather have seen some of the time go into more updates for making the game funner. I have owned this game for several months and have not seen a single update as of yet.			"

								I like this game, even thought it is a little grindy,  but a lot of the grind can be alleviated by joining a tribe.  I chose to go the solo route, though. Initially it was annoying since I didn't have a bunch of needed tools. But, the recent additions of tradeposts makes being a hermit  a lot easier, since you can set your trade post up near larger tribes and trade while offline. Also, I made a few friends online that helped me get started.Building in the game is pretty nice. I have run across many nice multistory buildings, bridges, piers and more. I've read that the building got an upgrade recently and i'm looking forward to trying it out.There are seperate PVE and PVP servers, so that's a plus. Super quick response time for the Dev and the Guides.Traveling isn't bad, but it would be awesome to have mounts.  There are carts to craft, though. Friendly and helpful community.The cons are:The game is pretty grindy and there are not many other players. Trading posts make life a bit easier, though. But, it would be nice to have more people to chat and trade in real time with.Monthly fee. Not really a con, I just wish it was about $9.99 or so month instead.Combat isn't really that fun. I'm not going to lie, I suck at most combat and is one of the reasons I don't really play PVP. Anyway, I don't really care for combat here. "

								I bought this game over a month ago and have not regretted making the purchase.  Please note that although my playtime record on steam is low (0.7 hours at the time of writing), it does not give a true reflection as I prefer to use the main Xsyon client - as do many other players.There are a couple of issues that I have noticed that have crept up on the forums.1) Subscription. Yes this game is a subscription based model. I know a lot feel its silly to charge a sub for this game. But actually having written in the official forums about possibilities of being free to play, the developer has actually tried testing out different pay models (including changing the sub fee). It was found that free to play created a destructive element in the game, in that it brought players who were not good for the game. Some of the players resorted to exploits, botted and even caused a lot of tension/drama in global chat by being rude/abusive (hence the reason why the majority talk in tribe chat and not global). The Cash shop idea. Wouldn't be good, Basically you are asking the developer to concentrate on making things for the cash shop rather than developing things for the game or patching bugs etc.2) It's Alpha. Well the developer has already commented on this. Basically it's on PRELUDE. So no, it not Alpha or Beta but the next step beyond that. I'm not paying to test a game. I am paying to play a game that is playable and published. Fact is that a majority of MMO's are never truly ""finished"" on release, hence why there are patches and expansions.3) Player numbers and community. Steam stats do not reflect true numbers. Majority of players still use the Xsyon client via the website as it was the default thing to do pre - steam. It's also a fact that a majority only speak in tribe chat. In the past a lot of drama was caused in global chat which became really problematic and had to be sorted out by GMs in game. The community overall is very mature and helpful. There are many vets who are happy to answer questions. Do understand though that timezone may affect peak hours for this game. I believe the majority of players are in the US/Canada timezones.Now onto the gameThe game tries to be as realistic as possible i.e. meaning you wont be able to kill bears until you have honed and got your skills really high. I believe people have high expectations from the get go and get disappointed because they cannot do the things they want to from the off. Sorry folks but this game is slower paced and longer longevity type gameplaying. Meaning be prepared to put in some hard work before expecting to be able to tackle some of the high end stuff.1) Crafting and resource gathering. Lot's to craft with many more crafting skills planned for the future.  You will need to either trade or gather resources to be able to craft. Be prepared to spend a lot of time gathering resources so you can grind your craft. Crafting and gathering also have a bonus in that each craft skill has a primary and secondary attributes. The more you use the skill, the more likely that the associated attribues with the skill will raise. For example, doing logging will increase your strength and agility. Making you a better fighter.2) Hunting and combat. Yes you can hunt stuff but you have to start off small i.e rats and chickens. You also need to locate them first before being able to kill them. After you kill critters, you can improve your hunting skills by skinning, gutting, decapitating etc. Don't expect to move up quickly as it will take a while to climb up the hunting ladder. There are also zombies called Revenants. Do not mistake these for players. If they kill you, they take your gear and use it. So for every critter that kills a player, they ""grow"" and increase in strength.3) Thirst and Hunger. Yes you have to manage these. You can fish, forage or farm for food to eat. For thirst you can drink from rivers or fill and carry a waterpouch with you. There is a balance though as overindulging will give you penalties. Become hungry or thirsty and you don't regenerate health and energy. You can die from prolonged thirst and hunger just like in real life.4) Health, Energy and Encumbrance. All of these can be improved as you keep grinding the associated skills. For instance grinding on a skill that increases your strength will help improve the amount you can carry and therefore your encumbrance levels. Health is self explanatory. When it reaches zero, your dead. Energy is basically like stamina. When you perform actions, it uses stamina. For example you can only sprint when you have more than 50% Energy. Once it reaches 50% or less, then you can no longer sprint, just light jog. When you run out of energy you have to rest or stop your action.Encumbrance levels is your carrying capacity. Basically if you are carrying a lot if items, it will be harder to run and uses more energy doing so. One of the ways to make this less of a problem is by using a cart to transport goods.Death has no real penalties at present.5) Tribes. I was lucky to find a nice tribe. Personally I think it's helpful to get into a tribe early on. You can solo but expect to work a lot more. Tribes give you an advantage in that they can give you tools and food so you do not have to worry about it and can concentrate on your skills. Also having someone to give you advice or answer your questions is nice to have. Also large scale building projects is very demanding and much more easier to complete within a tribe and fun too!Like I said I'm still having fun but it's not a game for everyone. The game requires patience and work before you see any progress  - just like in real life. People who have high expectations of being uber in the least amount of time and effort need not apply!I wish people would try the game and give it a chance before turning a blind eye to it. You never know, you might enjoy yourself. "

I was always a PVP server guy. With Terra-forming, PVP, Building, and difficult hunting - this is another game to add to the survival string. It's an MMO though and a true MMO at that. This game isn't on easy mode, so be careful and ask for help.			"

								I have to edit my review of this game. My initial review was positive. The game was fun to play at first, but the developer has given up on this game completely. He had promised updates and more content but never delivered. It's been over a year now and there hasn't been anything notable added to the game. I understand the game is made by one person but that isn't an excuse. If you are on Steam and charging money for your game, you need to keep it real with current and future potential customers. Early access means the game is being worked on constantly. If you are going to stop working on the game or it is going to take over a year for each and every single update, you should say this in big bold print disclaimer.I can't recommend this game anymore.

								Like a few have said beofre less events more updates.. Icant recomend this game and its sad because i love survival sandbox and when i started it was great.However when i finally got to the point of crafting new weapons and armour i found the biggest flaw in the game by far.They all have the same fing stats! i can craft the final leather armours and there only cosmetic?! are you kidding me? same for weapons except there slightly more durable.. wheres the reward? wheres the stats of crafted armour that seperate new player and veteran?Make advanced weapons and armour have better dmg and protection or i will never play this again that is total hogwash. the only thing that seperates them is what material you make the armour out of merly giving a (bonous stat) there should be base stats for crying out loud if ive been crafting leather armour to master the hardest ranking things that take the highest lv of crafting skill should be better why this is not a factor blows my mind and im sure is the reason why no1 is playing this game after they find this out.. like i said change this save your game people cmon! other than that you could easily have the best rpg survival crafting sandbox out there.

								Not what I expected from a survival MMORPG.   Well kind of.  The premise is good, but the controls and graphics are horribly dated.  The right click to access som commands like to eat something doesn't work all the time.   Checking there forusm this is a bug they supposidly fixed a long time ago.   The overall graphics and feel of the game reminds me of the old game Vanguard, witht he same quality graphics and attempt at a zoneless game.   Now while admitally I couldn't got past the fact that it did all this in a forced small window, if the game uses the same engine as Vanguard, which it likely does.  Then it's not truely zoneless.   Vanguard relied on loading things as you approach a new one to make it look zoneless, as moving from one zone to aother mae it load and link it in the background.   This was greate before DSL and Cable, but since then your character could move faster then the game could link in a new one, making it pause to load the new zone you just walked in to.   Now as this game looks and feels exactly like the old Vanguard engine, I am betting it has the same issue.   Still all in all, not worth the price they ant for it currently.			"

								WHY DID I DO IT???? What a HUGE MISTAKE!!!!!Ok, I ended up paying for this game 2 times. Once from their websight. Once from steam. BOTH times were a mistake. I purchased the game because I wanted it back in 2013. I played for a while and it was pretty bad back them.I bought it again yesterday. Wow was that a monumental mistake. ITS STILL CRAP!!!Dont expect anything resembling helpfulness from the admin team. They damn near will not respond to you unless you do something that ANYONE in the game deems offensive. Including having an opinion that is NOT theirs. You will be ignored. Or MUTED if you say something they don't like. Which is pretty much WORDS.God forbid you have anything negative to say about the game.  MUTEDSecond. The websight is a JOKE. There is no option to use your steam login. You HAVE to go to their sight to register.THERE IS NO PASSWORD RESET BUTTON. You litterally need to put in a ticket to get a password reset.For people like myself this is pretty much required as I have more accounts than Fat people have chins. (Im a fat guy, i can make all the fat jokes I like) DEAL with it.On to the game its self. Yeah is pretty nice sized. So what, its 2 servers. PVP and PVE. Which mean ALL the good building locations are TAKEN. And if you DONT join another clan, you are pretty well ♥♥♥♥ed. This is NOT a solo friendly game. NOT AT ALL.You are thrown into a world with basic tools and expected to survive in a worls where a HAMSTER can kill you. I am NOT kidding. You will DIE if you see a hostile animal. Or god forbid the Item steal revanent things in the game. They will kill you then steal your♥♥♥♥♥♥NO SINGLE PLAYER!!! For those like myself whom LOVE survival games, and sometimes just want to be in the world with just the NPC's this is NOT the game for you.  Sometimes i just want to experience the world. The mechanics kinda blow in some aspects. Ill only mention the one that REALLY REALLY pisses me off and needs to be fixed. the ""/UNSTUCK"" mechanic. It is a massive joke that give you hope in hopeless situations.Say you fall into a hole, it works fine.  Say you fall into a ditch between a player wall and a rock ledge. It wont work. You cant use it when near OBJECTS. like fences or walls or buildings or BASKETS or Carts. Pretty much anything that is player created, you can't use the unstuck command. I have been playing survival games for years. And this game is a practice in patience. Its NOT worth it.  DO NOT waste your money on this garbage. I will be doing a video for my youtube viewers on my Main youtube account. Be prepared to warn your friends off from this.			"

								As an older player, one that is tired of the theme park easy button style games out there, Xsyon is a very refreshing change . I would highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a game where you need to put in the effort to get the rewards. Unlike many of the other sandbox survival type games, Xsyon  feels more realistic. for instance...To build your camp, you have all the basic knowledge to survive and make your self safe from roving animals or revenants. To make better fortifications, you need to continue learning which you do by building. Eventually you can make a very strong fortress, or rustic compound of cabins to start surviving in style!To survive, you need to either learn to farm and cook your own foods, or fish and hunt to stay alive. Eating and drinking water are critical to this like in real life. You can also forage for berries and other food plants. Of course things like tools, armor, and weapons wear out, so you can either start trading with other players or learn to make those yourself. The more effort you put into it the better those items will become.I have been playing this for 3+ years and have made tons of friends in game and had steady entertainment all along. Each new improvement the Developer puts in has only made the game better for me.If you are looking for a game with long term play that you can grow in, making your lasting mark on the game world, then this game will be right up your alley. If though, you want it all handed to you, or need to rush to the ""end"" you may not like it. There is a very helpful community in game that can show you the ropes and give you tips. However, may I suggest that you do the tutorials, setup a homestead, and check it out for yourself. Once you are proficient, maybe then join a bigger tribe to have the opportunity to do even bigger and grander things!I really think you are going to enjoy the experience! "

								Great game! Minecraft with Skills! Low Population but VERY awesome ppl that is more then happy to help. The stats are very slow to level so it gives you a lot of gameplay to invest into your character. I got this game 5 days ago and already put in 49 hours. lol.This game is Sub. once a month. Great game to play with sub though. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Pros -1. Large World, a lot of custimizing from cloths/armor to weapons.2. Create your own house, cabin, town, city, castle. whatever you can think of!3. Skills and a lot of em, from running, jumping and swimming to crafting skills like tailoring and leatherworking and MANY more!4. A lot of different types of monsters. Zombies, Bear and the Deer that will beat you up in a heartbeat!5. PvE server and PvP server!6. Tribes, like a guild you can join a tribe and then build a large base with your friends.7. They are STILL adding things to the game as we speak, i heard they are adding Bows and Arrows.8. Low population, giving you a lot free space to create a tribe and build.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Cons -1. Low Population making it hard to get help sometimes or to just chat with.2. I can get repetative, like if you have to get like 200+ limestone to make into Prepared Lime, collect tons more sand to turn the lime into Mortar.3. Some of the Crafting skills are hard to get started even with a little help.4. You can't exactly max all the skills.5. VERY large world, can get lost. Also when exploring and you die, it can take 5 minutes or hours to get back to were you was at.6. Still a few bugs to work out.7. This can be part of 6 actually but still, The game isn't new but it's still getting new features but that also means testing it. that creates bugs, yay, we all love those! he he			"

								I can't even log-in. I made an account and now it wants me to pay another $25 after already having bought the game on steam to link it to an external account for the game. I have even seen that the monthly subscription was done away with last year so I really am at a lost as to why I'm being prompted to pay for a subscription. In the mean time, I'm going to look to see if there is away to refund the purchase.			"

								Graphical quality is etremely poor. UI is difficult to read and not intuitive. Gameplay is lacking. Community is borderline abusive in their responses to people. Game doesn't appear to be interesting, and the gameworld lacks things to interact with if many people are not logged in. This is a particular problem since the gameworld doesn't seem to have very many players in general.I would not recommend this game in it's current state, it has some lovely concepts, but seems to lack any serious follow through on strength of features.

								I'm suprised this game has a mostly positive review, I haven't played in a while but when I have it was a laggy mess. Originally I played on a laptop and I thought it just couldn't handle the graphics but even after I got a good gaming pc it still runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥ I eventually concluded it was server lag and I don't have slow internet. I feel like Notorious games is cheaping out on the servers because this game doesn't have any long term cash flow. If you haven't played the game for a long time and don't have a group of 5+ friends the game will be very boring and all of the good spots to build are taken over. The worst problem with building is there doesn't seem to be any sort of decay, if someone builds a large base then quits the game and you want to build there 6 months later? well too bad you can't because they're IMMORTAL ♥♥♥♥ING WOOD SHACK IS THERE FOREVER! It is nice that they try to make everything intricate I appreciate it however it just ends up being a clunky mess and grindy as ♥♥♥♥.			"

								I'm really enjoying this game for the reasons that others downvote it for.  I'd always chose a subscribtion based game over a free to play one, as free to play games usually are the greater rip-off if you really want to get into them. Almost all games i know of that are advertised for as being ""free"" turn out to be pay to win after a while. Here you buy the game, pay the monthly fee (you dont even have to do this if you dont mind the skillcap), and that's it. Keep in mind this is a sandbox, not a theme park. This game is what you make of it and strongly encourages team play. If you like grinding for skills and crafting, you can do it. If you like exploring and hunting, you can do it. It's also totally valid to just fish, farm and cook and never leave your homestead. It's totally up to you.You wont start with all off the games posibillities revealed to you, you have to work on your skills and talents to find out what you REALLY can do. Speaking of skills, what you do is what you get, chopping wood will get you logging skill, preparing meals will raise your cooking, clubbing rats will get your fighting skills up. On top of that you can spend some skillpoints rewarded for active gameplay to speed up the process. That's a brilliant concept to me.About limited character customization... that's just not true. There are so many different armor and cloth pieces you can wear, i dont even dare to guess a number, it's hundreds at least. This game is tagged 'Early Access' not for being new but for being in constant developement. It may not be what you expect from a 'Early Access' game, but this one at least is totally playable and enjoyable with a huge area to explore and countless options for crafting and building on two persistent servers. This isnt vaporware like all those other early access games that never leave alpha or are abandoned by the devs after a year or two.About the graphics: I cant stress how much i hate the korean manga style graphics of all the WoW copy games that are out there. This games graphics may not be state of the art, but at least it's very solid with the animations and environment and get's the job done pretty well.Oh, and no magic! No 300 different buttons for this spell and that buff, attack combo here and there and such nonsense. Buffs/debuffs come from food and environmental conditions. that's it. Very refreshing approach!Speaking of combat, it's non target free for all. Swing your weapon and make sure the stuff you want to hit is where the weapon is moving to. That's how combat is done!Not click a target, then have some keyboard macro spit out your favourite attack combo with fireballs and sparks and flashy things until the target is dead. Bleh...so TLDR, this is a special game for special people. love it or hate it, but for the correct reasons. "

								I’ve been playing this game almost since the beginning, it has changed a lot, adding tons of new features, improvements and so on, but the concept and gameplay has been always brilliant. It is a game to discover little by little, exploring, figuring out how the mechanics work, meeting people, having fun. I’m not a good review writer so let me show you some other players sentences describing Xsyon, which is my felling as well about this game:-  If your a serious role player, you might of just found heaven. This game, in its current state, offers the most robust role-play mechanisms I have seen to date in a mmorpg. It is the definition of a good sandbox in the making for sure.-Tthis game is possibly the best sandbox ever created.  - Been playing themepark mmo's the past 6 years or so, found this game and jumped the gun and haven't regret it any bit. This game is brilliant. Lots of fun to be had with a creative mind!- The videos don't really do the game justice IMO. The graphics are not that exciting to me. But the gameplay and the concepts are brilliant. Like the other guy said, its addicting as hell. I played the rift beta (and pre ordered) and enjoyed it. I played the Xsyon beta and was hooked almost immediately.-Looks like Freedom & Roleplaying is back in mmorpg's. Awesome.- I'm not worried, i think Xyson is already a breath of fresh air, once your in the world it lures you in with its charms.It's the little details like eating and drinking or wandering of to gather some resources so your friend can craft you that new backpack that make Xsyon shine and its these little details that the MMO giants always over look. It's been along time since a game has charmed me like Xyson has and that was Ultima over a decade ago.Xyson will appeal to the type of person who prefers that cup of coffee in that back street cafe or would rather walk that extra mile to buy from a small grocer rather than taking easy street for a cheaper, faster but ultimately inferior product from a big company.I personally love wandering in the snowy peeks exploring and then running for my life when a big grumpy bear decides i look tastier than the local fish... Xsyon has a great feeling of freedom, at no point have i found myself being pushed in any direction i didn't want to go in, i love it. :)- I'm liking this game more and more. It is really growing on me.- Xyson certainly seems to be bringing the RPG element back to MMOs!- The Building in this game is by far the very best I have seen in any game. Along with terraforming, it provides the right amount of freedom with the right amount of challenge. The simple fact that I can shape the land in a permanent way is a truly amazing accomplishment. Even though a few other games may provide something similar, this one beats them all hands down. Crafting is quite fun, and requires lots of different items, making the items made feel like an accomplishment. Well done. “For me, if we also had Zombies, and decay the game would be almost perfect...”  When this last player opinion was made the game had not Zombies or decay system yet, now it is ingame Anyway I recommend this game if you are looking for a breath of fresh air.

								This game is awesome. I love the initial point of logging in and creating my character to buggily walking around and not doing anything at all. Hopefully in 20 years or so they finish it and completely change everything so it doesnt resemble runescape and other such up to date games. 10/10 would highly recommend so people can do literally nothing in game but run around and get the feeling that you are still on Windows 98!

								This game is the best MMO sandbox game i have ever player. You can do alot of stuff and its not easy to play.  So it take time to level up and to create items. You need to pay $14.99 month. But that is totaly worth it.If Xsyon get more players then this game have something that can be compeard to World of Warcraft.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I started without reading about the game and got some of my friends to start to. We are still learning the game and its a bit hard to find out how all the things work. The game have a PvP and a PvE server and we are playing on the PvE server atm. Its take some time to find out how to play the game but after a while its start to become alot more fun to play. I recomend to play with friends. Start a  tribe and make your own city. it take some time to do it but its alot of fun.			"

								I have been playing this game longer than my steam counter indicates. It is an awesome game. If you like crafting, building or survival, then this game is just made for you! You can make the most amazing fortresses, towers or cities if you have the right dedication. There is combat in the game (Hunting or occasional PVP), but is more of a secondary activity. The community is tight, but oh so helpfull to all new players that ask questions or need help. This game deserves the attention of the sandbox community! Come on and give it a try, if you like sandboxy games with a focus on crafting, survival and building, then you certainly wont be dissapointed!			"

								Ive always looked for a game like this and now ive found it.  I really enjoy the building and being able to shape the very world around me even took up planting trees which i didnt expect. Endless hours exploring the wilderness, hacking down zombies, and raiding abandoned tribes for loot.  Farming, hunting, and cooking are a necessity or you starve. This game is not Warcraft nobody tells you what to do surviving is the quest you make your own adventure. Great sandbox that is still adding new features and moving forward.

								Have not found another sandbox that I have enjoyed like this one. It has a lot to offer and a lot more to come. It has been out for years, however most games are done by a team and take years before ever released. This was released years ago when it started to be worked on. So those of us that have been with it for that time have enjoyed it and all things to come. You can build from grass to wood to stone to metal. There is no limit on what you can make other then what you want to put into your own place. You see people talk trash because this has a sub...so many people who play many other sandbox have payed beyond so much money to get maxed land size and more on them so they trash talk this to justify to that fact.

								Don't let the 0.5 hours fool you.  I played this game prior to steam many years ago for a very long time (probably 6 months or so).  This game may have additional content since then, but it is the same game.  This definitely shouldn't be in early access and is clearly an abuse of the early access system.  This game has been a subscriber based game for years; however, it is a fun game with a good community.  I would love to get back into the game and see what they have added since I left, but now there is a new bug with the mouse.  The mouse skips around on the screen preventing me from clicking buttons very efficiently.  It took half an hour to set up a new character because of this.  I have applied a few microsoft fixes, which didn't help.  This also affects player mouse-look in game.  [UPDATE]:  Full screen fixes the mouse issue, and at least for me it is no longer buggy (full screen used to crash a lot).			"

								So far the game is enjoyable, well thought out and detailed. The stringing of stats to skills and gaining from crafting is very cool. Not entirely my type of game as the pace for gathering and crafting can be arduously tedious at first. Highly recommend finding people to play with as it makes everything much, much easier.The one negative thing that I find most annoying is the run skill. You are slow as molasses at the start and as you run around you gain more and more skill. It should not be called run skill, it should be called Travel Speed. :-)I highly recommend it if you like crafty type games.			"

								Well, what can I say. This game is the best I've seen of the open world variety in quite a while. Real gamers don't want to hear this, but to have a clue what you are doing, just do the dang tutorial. But if you don't, and have to ask questions, most of the players I've come across are willing to help...on the PVE server that is. Yes, 2 Servers, PvP and PvE, so if you want to peacefully go out, and build your homestead, without worrying about that guy across the river taking your hard earned grass stack(grass, not weed) after he bonks you on the head, then you have a server to play on. About the gameplay, I myself find it to be very similar to WoW, but without the NPC's. Crafting it rather well thought out, and building has it's quirks at times, but it works, and it works well. I hunt for games like this, and like I have said, it's the best I've seen in a while.It is a big help that there are guides(admin) that DO help, run events, and keep you updated as to scheduled patches and updates. They tell you when new things are on the test server, so you KNOW, because other players go check, that new content is soon to be available.All in all, I give this game a 9/10. Few minor bugs that are irritating, but in no way take away from the fun. "

								I've been playing the game for over two years, Xsyon has a lot to offer that others games lack or haven't fleshed out the same systems.The game takes a little getting used to when you first start playing but quickly you'll learn and figure it out. I remember when I first started there was no tutorial and what wiki that players had started was severely lacking for information but the community was very helpful and didn't shoot you down when you did have questions. Today the game has a in-depth wiki and tutorial when you log in to the game. This is very helpful to new players entering the game needing guidance. The game in its current state has a lot to offer with in-depth crafting systems, hunting, farming, and cooking. I'm looking forward to seeing the current round of development proceeding forward and trying it out once it makes it in game (pets, mounts, etc etc) you can find current round development under the game section on the main site to see what is next in line. In game I spend a lot of time on weapon, tool, architecture, and bone crafting. These are the things I enjoy doing most and have put my effort in to be the best at. I really like going out from tribe and hunting, I take pleasure in it and also I need the mats for bonecrafting anyway but I get to explore the server and all the while I get the supplies I need while doing so. I love the sense of adventure the game offers, I'm really looking forward to some mapping skill eventually, as exploring what is out there and seeing what players have built, gives me joy, as it's really amazing some of the things that come out of the player base. It's also neat running around seeing things change over time, whether it be a new tribe, or watching the terrain revert back to how it once was since, we have terrain reversion now.Scavenging is by far the one thing I enjoy most out of the game because you never know what recipes or items you will find and I like mapping out scavenging piles. When I say mapping them out, I'm talking about marking which give recipes more so than another or blades, nails, rivets, and the like. I've spent countless hours just running around the map scavenging junk piles looking for the best materials or recipes I could find. It's sort of like playing the lotto. The farming system is pretty in-depth and I'm looking forward to seeing more and more crop types as development goes on along with more cooking recipes. Cooking alone is by far the best system I have seen in a sandbox MMO, having primary ingredients along with seasonings to boost the buffs you get from the meal your eating is awesome to say the least.Terraforming in Xsyon is unlike any other and very precise if you need to be with it. Changing the landscape is one thing I look for in a sandbox so that I can shape the land to the way I want it to be, if I was so inclined to do so I could have a terrace system on a mountain top with ramps leading to each section. You can really do a lot with it and the architecture that is in the game really fits the look and feel of Xsyon. There are a lot of design options to choose from along with designs you can do with laying everything out. You're not limited by skill alone to make a certain sized house, if you want a massive structure 8 stories high and have the materials and time to do so, then go for it. There are no limits other than the ones you set for yourself.The combat system is one reason I like hunting so much, the variables, and directional user input combat like mount and blade is what draws me to it. I have full control over how combat plays out, yes there are random variables that take place but I can race in and do a charged blow and speed away or circle around a opponent. I'm not sitting in one spot watching text scroll and hitting at a determined speed based on skill, stats, and weapon. I determine the combat based on my interaction and yes stats and all that do come in to play but I could lose a battle with a player or creature by miss steps on how I do the combat on my end.I would recommend this game to anyone, Xsyon is exactly what I want out of a open world sandbox MMO game.

								I have been playing this game since the original launch, so disregard my hours played on Steam. One of the things that hooked me on Xsyon is its setting and theme. I am a fan of post apocalyptic sandbox games. What sets Xsyon apart is the cool way they mix post apoc themes with a hint of native Americanism. The game is based around Lake Tahoe. Lake Tahoe is rich in native american history.If you love to terraformIf you love to scavenge huge piles of junk for usefull itemsIf you love farming and cooking to surviveIf you love battling mutated animals or other players on the pvp serverYou will love Xsyon			"

								I have been playing this game since it was released and I love it. The commmunity is not massive but what community there is very friendly and helpful. This is a sandbox by very definition, you aren't taken by the hand and show what to do. You are dropped into the world and told to go and shape it the way you want it to be. You can shape the land build massive structures, every item in the game is found raw in nature or is crafted by players. Join a tribe or survive on your own. Build yourself a hunting lodge in the middle of nowhere, or a small walled home near others for group protection and trading. Give it a chance and you will love it as much as we veteran players do.

								Well, this is a game still in development, early access so it says, and done by one man. That, in itself, is pretty impressive. The graphics are pretty good for a true sandbox with full terraforming and piecemeal building construction system as well as trees that are actually removed when chopped. All these are rendered obviously which requires a balance between graphics and game performance. It does a good job on that.The building aspect of the game is very versatile and completely customizable. I have seen rustic cabins, tent villages, stilt village areas over water, tree houses and full on castle like structures as well as mad max looking scrap metal compounds. It allows a great flexibility in customizing your tribe to your liking.Nice scavenging system where it almost feels like a lotto each scavenge trying to find those rare blueprints folks pay good money for to get the rare architect plans. Robust and fairly complex cooking and farming system recently introduced. Good asset protection with gate permissions, storage bin permissions and cart permissions. We recently saw the first unique use specification for buildings, a commissary, that greatly reduces food decay rates when stored in it. This hints at a lot of great options forthcoming.The game has some very addictive qualities in certain areas if that is the type of thing you like. The PvE server, the one mostly populated, has a very welcoming and positive community. Helpful to new players and really isn't a lot of griefing or such on their. The PvP server is left alone in that regard allowing your weapons to deal with griefing although I will say that there is not much of a PvP community currently. This Steam release hopefully will breath life back into that.Is it perfect? No. It functions well, the things it has are decently done, the developer is constantly working to correct bugs and issues brought forth by players and has a lot of very interesting things listed to be upcoming.With a completely player driven in game economy, no cash shop or credits or other 'currency' to buy and use in game, it really is a player driven economy. No NPCs besides animals and revenants, which are essentially zombies of abandoned tribes that, if they kill you, will take your equipped weapons and armor to fill gaps in what they are currently wearing or wielding. You could come back and be killed by your own weapons. The combat isn't my thing, but a lot of the players have told me the key is to learn the system.Cooking actually can end up consuming 12 ingredients to make the top end recipes and can buff various attributes, add to healing rates and other things. Pretty complex in that area. Also, you can starve to death of die of thirst, so planning ahead for such is important. Of course, you can drink from any river or the lake. Foraging for food can be done but provides minimal sustenance and making kabobs is a much better way to go.All and all, a fun and creative game with what could well be a very bright future. I would gladly, and have, recommend this game to folks that are into sandbox games and enjoy building or, like me, hoarding. You can end up with a lot of stuff. Also, when tribes become abandoned and the totems decay away, their goods are open for looting.With a focus on tribe (community) building and a fully player modified landscape and only player driven economy (with no cash shop) it is a refreshing game that can suck you in for hours on end without you noticing.Skills are 'grindy' so to speak, leveled up by utilizing those skills. There is no level system. There are experience points that are earned and can be used to level up skills and are often used to level up the more grind intensive skills or just the ones you may not enjoy doing as much.Currently, I would say the game shows it is in early release and thus I would give it a 75-80 out of 100. Hopefully the changes the developer intends to make can up that a bit.			"

								The game doesnt make any fun. The survival aspect is very high. It is hard to find any eatable plants. I doesnt has any boats to craft and not even bows. Ok you can craft many clothes and few melee weapons. It takes ages to build something if it is equipment, cart, or a building. No worldmap is included so the last time i play i wasnt able to find my base i have build.			"

								Xsyon Xsyon Xsyon...What can I say to persuade you to play this game. Lets be up front... Xsyon isnt for everyone. This isn't a mainstream game. It's a niche game. A free world, open ended sandbox. Not sandbox themed. You get what you put into the game. There is alot of ambiguity, and alot of hiden mechanics that even the veteran players don't know. The learning curve is steep. If you have ever played any large space-based mmo's before their tutorial systems, you know what a daunting learning curve that is. This is no short-termed end-game. Here is what my personal opinion of the game is:Pros:Open ended, there is no end.In depth crafting system.Sandbox, full customization of tribal areas.Very helpful player base, not alot of drama.PvE or PvP Server option.A VERY willing Developer who listens extremely close to their player base.Big ambitions for future expansions.Cons:Currently a low player populationSteep learning curveHard to solo in the gameSlower developmentWhile there are alot of reviews on the billing of the game, I am not fixated on subscriptions. It costs money to make a video game. Time = money. But to be a part of the metamorphasis of this game has beeen awesome. I have enjoyed this game solo and as a large tribe (guild). It is tough going solo unless you are near a larger tribe or willing to travel. That is what I ENJOYED as one of the challenges. The transparancy of development is a refreshing change and I truly feel the maturity level of the existing players is a welcome change. For those that are looking for the ""next best thing"", do your research. There are alot of apocalyptic games out there, this I would truly categorize as a survival game against the elements more than zombies, rogue bandits or space pirates. Watch your video clips, check out the wiki. I reccomend you overlook this game if you do not want to commit to a long-term game. If you want to be challenged, explore, and enjoy that liberating walk in the wilderness, then this game is definetly worth a try. There is alot of fixation on billing. Dropping cash on any steam game is a gamble. If you put that money on an impulse you will always have it, yet it just takes up space on your hard drive. Do you actually play those 200 games? I have put my focus on the actual game play. I see it as an investment, and as a player in this game I make damn sure that my investments into the development get heard. It's ultimately up to you. Frankly, I enjoy a polite, helpful global chat over epeen sword swinging egos boxing back and forth over who has the most testosterone. Steep learning curve? So what! That to me is part of the challenge. Experiment, ask questions, discover the game for yourself. You want this on a siver platter? Not going to happen. Solo play? Been there done that. I found spending time on the road to trade took too much of my time, but it was my choice to live in a place over 45 minutes real time walk from the nearest tribe to trade with.Again, this game is not for the elite players. This is a casual game, a challenging game, and one worth getting into if you enjoy something outside of the mainstream survival genre. I look forward to seeing you ingame.			"

								NOTE: just following the core of the tutorial and generally figure out the UI will take about 2 hours by itself. You may or may not come to a conclusion about it within those 2 hours; I didn't.This review is based on a measly 4 hours of play. My normal ""likes"" are Fallout 4, 7 Days to Die, Empyrion:  open-world sandbox games with a strong creative/builder component.So I should love this game, right?In a nutshell, it just wasn't fun for me. As they say, ""your mileage may vary"".  I champion the goal of the game, but the implementation just doesn't work for me.Yes, I read the reviews that cautioned that this game is Grindy^11, but I didn't fully appreciate that. You start with a 20-slot backpack, which is already about 2/3 full with the starter stuff, and which quickly fills. You see you have slots for other containers, but you don't generally get recipes for creating them. You have to (for example) level up your basketcraft by picking about a thousand pieces of grass (I don't think this is an exaggeration), and making grass thread, grass string, grass rope, etc. until you unlock the grass container recipe.I cannot emphasize enough how DULL that is. It sounds acceptable in the abstract, but it is pretty painful.Many other sandbox/builder games, like Empyrion and 7 Days to Die, have skill unlocks and prerequisites to be able to make better things; Xsyon is a whole 'nother plane of existence in that regard.The UI doesn't help in this (or any) regard: you'll regularly need 3-4 panels open at any time to accomplish anything. That grass you're collecting? You can only hold 4 bundles at a time, and you can't for some unimaginable reason transfer it to your backpack, so you have to stop every 4 bundles and craft something with it, which of course requires several panes to be open.I ultimately, uh, sad-quit because a humanoid NPC killed me and took my starting weapon and clothes. The clothes I can replace, after a fashion; the weapon would probably take me dozens of hours to make, or have enough cash to buy.I've been waiting a long time to get into one of these types of games (along with Life is Feudal and a few others on my watchlist); I was willing to take a chance on Xsyon since it was on sale. I regret my purchase.THE GOOD:On the PvE server (Peace), the community seemed friendly and helpful, if not small.The movement controls are pretty standard. The map (there's one for PvE and one for PvP) are huge, but everywhere I went seemed very rugged and mountainous (apparently based on the Lake Tahoe area).Let me add one final note: I can see why some people enjoy this game. Building a simple hut is a major accomplishment, and you feel you've accomplished a lot in doing so; I get that, I really do. But the journey is really, really long and tedious. If you want to follow that long road, and some subset of you folks WILL enjoy it, you have my admiration.			"

								I have enjoyed playing this game. The player base is a very close community and everyone is willing to help new players.I do not like to compare games to each other as each game has it's own identity. Xsyon is a true sandbox where the player community truly creates the world and the economy. Fishing, farming, cooking, foraging, hunting, scavenging, and building are all integral parts of Xsyon. The develper is very engaged with the community and responds to all concerns and requests for additions to the game.For new players I highly recommend the game but it comes with this warning: This is not a game that you can conquer instantly. There is no pay to win. This game will require dedication, determination and help from your tribe mates or the community at large. I promise if you stick with the game and ask for help when needed you will be hooked. Come join us!			"
