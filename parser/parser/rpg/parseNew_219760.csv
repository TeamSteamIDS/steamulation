												I have a confession - a lot of my enjoyment of this game was out of spite. To get more information about this game, I decided to look at a Let's Play (http://lparchive.org/Beyond-Divinity). Some information is good - for example, sneak is absolutely invaluable. Some I'm unsure of, like all the skills he calls useless. One thing I know for sure he's dead wrong about - magic. Magic is wonderful. Magic is incredible. Magic can break the game in half, especially with the wonders of Hammer. Summoning dolls I'm less sure about, but I think they're worth more exploration.To me, this game really hearkens to Warcraft 2 - the music is really reminiscent of something you'd hear during the Orc missions and the cartoonish graphics are similarily familiar (maybe Warcraft 3). It's got RTS-lite gameplay where you control two party members, each with their own skills and stats, with the option to summon more temporarily. The comically bad voice acting is comparable in tone although not in quality.I do have one big problem with it, though. If you click on the wildlife by accident, -all- wildlife of that type aggro you. There's a lot of wildlife. It gets tedious. Overall, I'd say give it a whirl. It's a fun adventure and continuation of the Divinity plotline. I'd also recommend finding the Novella, Child of Chaos - it's a short read that sets up the plot of the game and makes later events make a lot more sense.			"

												Beyond Divinity is mechanically better than it's predecessor.The menus are better.The loot is better.The class system is more meaningful.Your choice of skills is WAY better and more varied than before.The setting is far more interesting than the ""Medievial Western Europe"" of the first game.However, too much is wrong with it to justify a buy.1. The loot system's coding is broken (""Rogues Rags Gloves Blue of the Magus"", anyone?)2. You can, at ANY TIME, teleport to a safe area to buy/sell/ID/Repair items.3. 90% of the subquests, which do nothing to drive the plot, are MANDITORY. It's busy work.4. The steam version does not come with a copy of the novella ""Child of the Chaos"" that was packaged with the game.5. The last 1/4 of the game is a five-story maze where you do nothing but puzzles, read books, learn complex magic rituals and do a lot of extra backtracking. This KILLED the remainder of the game and by the time I got through to the end I just did not care.TDLR: It's not bad mechanically speaking, but the manditory subquests and the last 1/4 of the game just kill the fun.That, and the novella that's supposed to come with the game, ""Child of the Chaos"", does not come with the steam version. How else will you know what the heck is going on? (I hunted down a copy on Amazon since I run a youtube show ""D&D Stories"" to do reviews of stuff like this) I figured out the ""ending twist"" less than 1/4 of the way through the game. :(RATING: 3/10			"

												Just finished it and I feel it deserves an additional recommendation.Worth it (especially on sale) for the humour in the game's writing and 'quests' or rather, 'actions' you can do. A lot of very amusing moments, one or two that made me outright clap.The very end of the game and the thought behind it blew me away (although the last fight was a dull potion chugging simulator).Be mindful of the flaws, however:Most of the voice acting is terrible.There are many bugs (nothing major or game-breaking though as I've evidently managed to finish it). Quicksave often with CTRL+S (load with CTRL+ L), and make manual full save checkpoints frequently, though.Skill system is deeply flawed, there are not enough skill points for both combat and utility skills, while some skills are also useless (luckily unlearning skills for gold is an option).Unique items are almost all outclassed by random drops and are very disappointing.Tips: Google for ""Divinity Child of Chaos"" and read the brilliant novella by Rhianna Pratchett.Battlefields are a timewaster and can actually be skipped entirely to experience the story content quicker (battlefield merchants are nifty though)Unlike in Divine Divinity, you can find keys for every story related chest or door so lockpicking is useless (the random locked containers it allows you to open are not worth the skillpoints).

												With already playing Divine Divinity, Beyond Divinity was a game I had to lay my hands on. As DD was one of the best games I've ever played on PC, the expectations were very high.    Once again Larian studios offered us a BIG game. Elder scrolls Oblivion was big, but I could say that this one is EVEN BIGGER. With hundreds of quests and vast worlds, BD has one of the BIGGEST worlds in gaming kingdom ! You get to play with your companion right away and can tune him nicely. Also, you can later summon four more companions and then BD looks like a decent RPG. The only flaw is that the skills of characters are horrific. There are too many skills on the menu for every character, but 70% of the skills are useless ! This is not the way you should develop a good RPG. Refer to Diablo 2 : Couple of skills, choose this or that and everybody's happy. That's the recipe to success. Larian tried to get BD very deep in every term and got lost in the half way.    However, with good story, many non PC's and vast world, we got ourselves a great RPG. With good graphics and decent sound, everybody can play it if they have a good amount of time. On the other hand, technical issues are over the edge. I don't remember that I have ever played a game with some many bugs ! The more you play, the more bugs get along the way. I even couldn't finish the game entirely because of that and that's why I'll give it79/100			"

												It's really rough around the edges and the voice acting is completely atrocious and the battlegrounds are a bit TOO repetitive, but the core game is pretty amusing at least.  The ending threw me a curve ball that I never saw coming and I felt immense satisfaction from it that was made all the better from playing the first game.  There is no reason to play this game without first playing divine divinity, however.  So if you don't want to play divine then don't play this either.			"

												The tutorial/learning curve is the only hard part about this game. It is frustrating in the beginning and you die often. Here is my tip to get past it. save alot, and RUN if it seems impossible. At first, you need to click on top right icon to select and play as the death knight. Now near top right is option to ""Select all"" You can now fight and control both people at once. You can right click items to send to opposite character if it suits them better. Also click on potion symbol to access all the potions you have, but you have to click it for the corresponding character to heal them.Also near top right is option to set your secondary skills. I set the human to lockpicking and skills can be upgraded via vendors to either add new skills, or in essence increase the max level your skills can get to. If you skip one of the imps, it may not let you get skills to +10 as the imp allows. (Thief skills like pickpocket, sneak, lockpick, etc) I would make sure to talk to him and get enough money for atleast lockpick 10)The torture chamber master seems impossible. Just backtrack after getting some keys to the burning area that you started at where you first meet the death knight. There should be a small bow in top left area beyond previously locked gate. In battle press space much like dragonage origins, and make sure to click select all and then click enemy and unpause. I control the deathknight to hold aggro and have human archer stay back. Your bow will eventually break, but as soon as you can warp back to base camp from the key you can buy repair skill up to level 6, drag the basecamp key into your inventory and topright skill menu, you will see ability to warp to battlefield, which is an area with many shops but also areas to level up at. Skeletons won't level you up so skip the long dungeon full of them. Once you get a little further where you fight deathknights in chambers, you will soon find another battlegrounds upgrade to lvl 2. You can now access new dungeons around lvl 7 area (Keep crossing bridges to the right of battlegrounds to reach these crystal staircase like places) You can only reach the new ones as you get higher level battleground keys. Look for levers around, hold ALT to see items. Make sure to find a large key that allows you to travel to battlegrounds. SEE ISN'T IT EASY TO FIGURE OUT_ OF COURSE IT IS! I recommend playing divine divinity first, i got to lv33 in divine divinity, and want to play through both of these before i get into divinity original sin further. Great game, but not as good as divine divinity, but it feels like an accomplishment to get into this game and overcome the learning curves, to get a new experience much like the previous game, but with gameplay that reminds me a bit of dragonage origins.

												Having this game as a kid i remember the opening part very well but sadly never found my way out of the prison .15 or so years later i make it out to an even dark wold then the prison. that being said this game has a real dark stary to it. Filled with illness people (imps) dying everywhere. You can choose to save the imps or massacer them. I went this good guy way and i am currently attempting to save them. I have obviously not beaten this game yet so i cannot say to much but this is a diablo clone and a good one. I have heard divine divinity is better but i have not played that (yet) so again i cannot say  You are playing as a prisioner and you have a dark night as a companion. You are both under a spell where your souls are connected meaning If you die so does the other at least until the spell is broken. It puts a nice touch on gameplay and makes keeping both characters alive a top priority. If you find your self in a tight spot and cannot heal fast enough there is an in game pause feature where you can still interact with items and your inventory character sheets ect. This puts a touch a stradegy in the game which is a nice thing. Exploration is also a key factor in this game. You can actually move in game items like boxes and things on the world. somethings maybe hidden underneath like keys potions ect. Not a whole lot of games do this which makes finding things a bit harder that you may need. You can also make map notes to help  you remember things you may forget later like entrances to areas, where someone is ect. your weapons/armor have a durability status as well which adds an added effect of keeping things well kept.   I do plan on beating this game so if i have any more to add i will update this.   Last updated 3/11/15Definitly worth the $6 you get more then $6 worth of gameplay here.As always this is an older game so keep in mind that it may have issues running on newer hardware I probebly will not get updated any time soon to run on newer hardware now. So far i have had no issues with it. Even though it warns me that i am not running on a 16 bit color mode  :3  gees i feel old now  just saying that  ...			"

												The Death Knight failed to mention a horrible side effect of being soul bonded, you see, if you become utterly overencumbered, your character's spine hits the ground so hard it destroys the multiverse if you are so much as a nanogram over the limit.10/10 Cured my usual ARPG greediness.Also I saw spears with the appearances of rings in a battlefield dungeon, and I could also equip them as rings. And several female NPCs throughout the game had male voiceovers.I'm scared.Serious review:Let's get the bad out of the way first:The voice acting is inconsistent, the game is coded like a pile of bricks, so it runs like♥♥♥♥♥and there's bugs crawling out the walls everywhere, and savegames like corrupting sometimes (mainly in the last 5% of Act IV), so make many different hard saves every now and then. The skill system got even worse, yet more varied (too varied, really.) and you can't backtrack after completing an act, and probably twelve hundred other things. Now for the rest:It seems they decided to randomly pull a Fallout Tactics, and make the game squad based. Well, sort of. You've got your avatar bloke of choice, and the Death Knight who's armor is literally superglued to his♥♥♥♥♥ So he can only equip half the stuff your character can put on, like a belt, and jewellery. As for more party members, you get these summoning dolls which temporarily summon something like a skeleton, or a demon, and have varying stats and equipment restrictions and whatnot. But they disappear if they move too far from the area they were summoned in, so I only use them if something really needs a beating, except not really, because my summons die in nanoseconds because I can't be arsed to spenda single point in doll upgrades and would rather murder everything with heavy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ swords instead. So basically, portable stash monster.Although, this game didn't suddenly go turn based, it's still realtime like the first Divinity game, with the exception of the MMO thing where your characters attack in intervals, instead of fast-like, like in Divine Divinity, Diablo, etc.You and your Death Knight companion are soul bound, so if one dies, the other one dies as well. It's basically what the Commandos games should have done, wire the whole team's hearts to flatline if any of them die, cause you can't lose any of them either. So you basically have to nervously keep your eye on the tiny health bars in the top right of the screen and keep your hand on a potion when screwing with tougher enemies.The skill system got a major rework, you can unlearn skills and get points back AKA respec for gold, they swapped the glorious character sprites for weird 3d models, because lazy- I mean, because animating sprites is hard, son. And the game got a bit more linear. The game decided to do the Diablo II thing and have 4 acts, except be more linear and throw waypoints out the window. When you reach a new act, a FMV plays, and you cannot backtrack beyond that point, and it deletes the previous battlefield and gives you a new one. Aside from that, there's still at least 2 pretty big overworlds throughout the acts and plenty of sidequests.The battlefield is a town instance of sorts, once you click a giant magical key at least once in an act, you can enter and leave the battlefield at will anytime, until you reach a new act and have to find at least another key in that act. There are 4 NPCs here which sell and buy stuff and can unlock skills for you to put points into for a fee, as well as 3 dungeonsthat have several floors each connected to sidequests the battlefield merchants give you unlocked by touching more giant magical keys, or the last key of the act which unlocks all 3 anyway.This game has a silly RNG system in where the second you hover your mouse over a container for the first time, the contents are randomized, or should I say, the pocket of air is randomized, because sometimes nothing, and can result in some serious cheese if you save and reload a bunch, which I seriously do not recommend, because you'll probably murder your hard drive slowly with the 20+ MB saves, and also it makes the game a bit too easy, and you a bit too rich.So if you go in this game not expecting a super great sequel, can look past the horrible bugs, instabilities, and other game breaking things, and can enjoy a big dumb semi-tactical squad based-sort-of ARPG with varying inconsistencies in it's sometimes hilarious voice acting, then you won't be very disappointed.I also literally found a developer note ingame past a locked door in black nothingness saying there would have been more to this area if their boss would have payed them more.Explains everything.It looks like this game is... Beyond Their Pay Grade.			"

 Oh my God Its Finally Over It's nothing like Divine Divinity and all of the negative reviews that you read, they are correct. But some of them can be ignored like, bad voice acting, week story, poor character levelling up etc etc...What cannot be ignored is frequent crashes and also you cannot run this game on high resolutions. To make it even playable you have to decrease the resolutions to 720p. I did finish the game, but it required a lot of patience. I just wanted to complete it.

												Rating: 4.5 / 10===Played on Hardcore difficulty===Pros & Cons+ Pros ++ Better animations compared to Divine Divinity (from now DD)+ Good graphics / art style for an isometric+ Hardcore difficulty, on which i played, is very challenging during the first act of the game- Cons -- Boring and uninspired storyline- Bad voice acting, even worse than DD- Dungeons are almost all the same, even in LAYOUT some times, aand do not provide any interest beyond going down to grind XP mowing down enemies- Quests are repetitive and useless in terms of rewards and XP- Some skills are ridiculously overpowered and will make, after a few levels, even huge mobs of enemies and Bosses easy to kill- Skill system is one of the worst i've ever seen in a RPG- Possibility to teleport to a safe zone (BattleGround) at any time, even during combat, to restock on consumables, trade, identify and even sleep- Even at Hardcore difficulty, when reaching around level 20, enemies become very weak with the skills the player has at its disposal===It is very rare for me to not finish a game, but this time i just couldn't make it. Repetitivity, general boredom, and no challenge at all provided by enemies after some levels and skill points spent in overpowered abilities, made me quit before ending act 2.Battle grounds teleport kills any challenge, as you can restock and resupply at any time even during combat. Abilities, especially Mage / Shaman one are totally OP and can destroy hordes of enemies with ease.This game is repetitive and boring, it does not stimulate the player to progress in the right way, like DD did. The devs tried to innovate with extravagant gameplay additions that resulted in failure.Not recommended. "

												I got this game during the winter sale along with Divinity II: Developer's cut, I thought it might be fun I already had and beat Divine Divinity and I thought why not complete the rest of the games apart of the Anthology package since Divine Divinity was such a great game and I wanted more?I wanted to beat this game before moving onto Divinity II. But I don't think I can do it, This game is bad.It feels clunky and broken, If you load to many games in one sitting be prepared for when you will need to access task manager to close the game or else you will need to restart your computer just so steam will stop showing that you are playing the game when the game is closed off and crashed when you just want to start it back up to continue playing.Or when the music starts to repeat the same note after you spent 5 minutes selling all your junk because that is a sign that it is about to freeze and crash so save quickly.I cannot recommend this game, I feel like I am forcing myself to play if I continue. At this rate I am probably [force] playing at least 1 hour of it every month and a half. At this rate I will not be able to beat it before this year ends but that is why I think I am going to uninstall it after posting this review and so I can stop thinking about completing it and just move on to Divinity II.It does have many other problems. One problem being the voice acting, I will not call it bad for a game this old but there is a part where they just used the >exact< same voice recording for the same sentence on the storyline repeated through the dialogue about 5 times. It got really annoying. I can still imagine how it sounded and how annoying it got in my head (/ -.-)I am quiting this game in the middle of act II. I am sorry but I must give this game a thumbs down to warn any who planned to do the same thing as me. Some people might be able to look past all the flaws of this game with the price it is at on sale But if you do plan to get this game ONLY get it on sale. It is defiantly not worth $5.99.			"

												While the gameplay can get iffy at times and has some serious lag issues in certain areas if you own more than 3 GB of RAM (there is the workaround of telling your OS to not see more than 3GB of RAM while playing), this game is a worthy successor to Divine Divinity, and a must-play if you want to understand the connection between Divine Divnity and Divnity 2. The plot is this game's strength, even if it may not be apparent at times. I suspect this game is what inspired Larian Studios to make the upcoming Divnity: Original Sin co-op compatible.Beyond Divnity is probably the weakest link in the Divinity series, and it is still at the very least worthwhile.Kirill Pokrovsky remains the composer of this game's music, and the additions to the  collection of Divinity soundtracks it brings are between good to awesome. For me, the music really enhances the game's value, which is a very rare achievement for a non-japaneese game.I wholeheartedly reccomend the whole Divninity series, this installment included.			"

												It's a good game. I was enjoying the story but the game is so broken. I wasn't even able to finish it. The farthest I got was Act IV. I was in the Academy Level 3. After the rift race my save files keep crashing when I try to load them. I got tired of trying to fix it since I'm not an expert so I'm left with an unfinished story. I hope others didn't have such extreme problems like me but my experience was bad. I don't mind a bug here and there but when it starts affecting the story itself? I have a big problem with that. So I don't recommend the game unless you're prepared to get a headache from it with constant crashes and bugs or if you know your way around programming.			"

												Beyond Divinity (sequel to Divine Divinity) takes a step away from the first game. Instead of being a purely old-school isometric RPG, this game adds a bit of action RPG elements to create a different kind of experience.Back in 2004, this game was actually decent, however it doesn't have the elements to make it reach classic status that Baldur's Gate (or other D&D-based games) holds in this category. You may enjoy it, as there is a lot of content in this world, but when you play it, the game really feels old. Especially since the same developer has now created Divinity: Original Sin (Enhanced Edition) that lets you experience a truer old-school role-playing experience with many modern day conveniences.6/10 ""Okay""			"

With the twist of playing 2 characters at once. I kind of found that annoying as in certain parts it was so easy to die because of this fact. But I will admit that it did make me work on stratagy  a little haerder than the first. All in all the graphics are the same, which are good for this type of game and the time frame that it came out. Story is not bad...don't believe it was as good as the first but still keeps you interested. If you can get this on sale or in a bundle then do. The first was a great game that I have played more than once through and I enjoyed playing this one more than once.			"

												Beyond Divinity can be a very fun RPG if you can forgive some of the issues with overall design. Unfortunetly It is a downgrade to Divine Divinity in many aspects but it does not make it a terrible game . Voice acting,controls,skill animations,models,boss fights and quality of game in general is not as good .All games in Divinity series have very creative side quests and hidden secrets that you may find by interacting with enviroment . Beyond Divinity is no exception and if you like games that reward exploration then you should definitely give it a chance . Also on a side note this game has good sense of humor and you never expect it beeing caught up in some evil plot ;)Let me just say that I do like this game for its immersion but I do not recommend if you looking for casual RPG. The party system controls are execetued very poorly . Switching between skills of 2 characters during combat is akward even when you get use to hot keys . Skill Systems and RPG portion of this game is not very self explanatory ( you may run into trial and error when it comes to skills more than once )You will have a choice of 3 classes Mage,Warrior and Thief but you can reset skills with gold . In my opinion certain skills were obsolete like Damage Spells that do not scale well into late game . Also this game will allow you to level 2 of same masteries but they do not stack *I want it to be very clear that this game has a very steep learning curve and I did not like the game for a long time myself . This game is a Diamond in a rough . If you hate it on first impression , give it more time and it will win you over .There are some major glitches ranging from FPS loss , enemies not spawning and doors not opening . It may make game broken depending on how compitable your system is with old games . Make a lot of saves .Score 6/10 . I personally really like this game for creative sidequests,humor and high difficulty but from a critical point of view there are many issues with gameplay,controls and glitches .			"

												This game is a follow-up story to Divine Divinity--although Larian never conceived of it as an actual sequel.  It has much in common with DD, but is less ambitious in scope and not as open (two of its four acts are quite linear).  I guess I'm one of the minority who like it about as much as the original title.BAD- For me it was a bit glitchy--occasionally crashed entirely, with other (non-game breaking) bugs, such as a quest log that wouldn't scroll down and would go wonky on occasion.- Some of the things it tries with the builds don't quite come off.  For example, some of the skills simply don't have their advertised value.  (Advice:  do your research ahead of time, and this won't be painful.)- As others have noted, the voice acting ranges from mediocre to bad.  But sometimes the badness is amusing.  (My favorite was when a single character was voiced by two different actors in the same dialogue, with different accents and everything.)- The balancing isn't always quite right.  The first act is a bit too difficult relative to the rest.DEBATABLE+/- Battlefields are pretty boring if you actually go through the tedium of clearing out the dungeons.  But I actually think the mechanic of having these optional areas works out well--you have merchants whenever you need them, and if you feel like grinding for levels, it's there for you.  (Note:  I did the Act I battlefield dungeons and skipped the rest.)+/- Unless you really want to tackle those battlefields, this game is smaller and less open than DD...but for my money, that's not really a problem.+/- The overall story makes a bad first impression (it looks at first blush like a haphazard mess), but a very good last impression (the pieces end up fitting together).  Unlike at least one other reviewer here, I think the last act is the best part of either BD or DD.GOOD+ Good ol' Larian goofiness is back.  The subquests still have that flavor.+ I think the puzzles here are often pretty clever, and they come at you a bit more quickly than they do in DD--especially in the (more linear) first and fourth acts.+ Having two characters to control adds another layer of strategy missing from DD.OVERVIEWIf you want the finest of Larian's stuff, pass right on by and look to Original Sin.  But if you're on a Larian kick, there's really no reason to skip over this title--it's perfectly enjoyable.			"

												very first thing you hear is some dickweed talking in a really stupid voice. your heart sinks when you realize he is going to continue for the entire game. Controlling two characters at once is pretty awkward, they made the skill system really bad, there's like 5 songs in the game (which all suck), and the game is padded relentlessly with giant empty maps that take forever to navigate. You can almost hear the designers asking ""what can we do to make this game longer?"" Combined wiith having to wait around for your characters stamina to recover, you'll spend way too much time getting around these areas and it will annoy you.its actually kind of amazing that they managed to take a perfectly good game and ruin it. so i suppose if you imagine they did it on purpose, you might be impressed with how great a job they did. doesn't mean the game itself will be much fun, but.. Bottom Line: do'nt play unless you are DESPERATE to play a bargain-bin Diablo clone, or if there is a man with a gun pointed to your head that wont let you play anything else			"

												I was released from my prison cell by a unnecessarily stern bloke. I tried to chit-chat with him, but he made it quite clear that he was not interested in any of that. He said some stuff about watching my eyes, or whatever—I wasn't really paying attention because my cat fell off of my drawer which made me laugh. About 2-3 minutes later I bumped into a prison guard who didn't seem too thrilled by the fact that I was wandering around the prison just doing my thing, so he chased after me with lethal intent. I ran back to the guy who set me free, assuming he would protect me from the bloodthirsty guard (he cared about me enough to set me free, so it seemed like the smartest move at the time), but to my surprise, watching me getting stabbed repeatedly by the guard did not seem to move him one bit, which made me realize that the guy must have been a sociopath—I highly doubt he released me out of altruism. Maybe I was better off just letting myself get executed by the guard, I mean, I met two people in my short time there and both of them seemed to have very diminished empathy and remorse, which leads me to believe that thats the way things go around there... I may be jumping the gun with that assumption, but I was not alive long enough to reach another conclusion.8.2 / 10EDIT: Nevermind that last part, just found out you can start over.			"

												Played for about 4 hours, gave it a fair shot. Here are my first few impressions before I decided to throw this game out the door. Might be some spoilers belowFirst, I loved DD, however BD at first glance looked like it was going to be fun. It didn't last too long though, some of the first few fights literally steers you away from the game. The DK party mechanics are so horrible, it makes you want to turn the game off. I felt like I was playing a poor mans version of starcraft micro managing 2 characters. So you would think ok, so build this DK tanky and be a wizard or a ranger. Assist your DK while he tanks, nope....its literally a cluster of healing, attacking, and healing some more while you try to kite in a circle.The skills system is a complete mess, offering slash? crit? accuracy? to use your skill points on? Isn't that what your character points already do? not a fan...of this...not going to even go into the ""how to obtain skills""The worst part of the game for me? was the Dark Knight mechanics/party system. I mean this is game killer.  Reloading the saved files 10x because your DK simply is not smart enough to do anything other than die. He stands two miles away while you are running away from the fight. Healing two characters at once (perhaps there's a better way to heal later in the game or I may not know of) from the drop potion icon.  My final thoughts? perhaps if you went a warrior/warrior combination it might be more enjoyable. I went wizard with a warrior DK. Some people on the forums mentions archerDK/warrior.  I got it on sale, for a couple bucks, even at 5 bucks its not bad for a old school game if you are capable of dealing with bad mechanics			"

												After finishing Divine Divinity for the first time, and saying to myself ""Oh yeah, there's a sequel! More fun!""... I was disappointed.Beyond Divinity is a joke, it's got nothing going for it, and it's a bother to play.Who the hell wants to drag a death knight along with them?Maybe if it's a summon that acts on it's own, yeah.But a live one, that if it dies, you do too?What the ♥♥♥♥? I purchased this game thinking it'd be just as fun as DivDiv 1, but it turned out to be a pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ from the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 3d models to the new overcomplicated spell system, and the huge nerfs to almost everything. (Seriously, how do gloves REDUCE your stats by %?)I do not plan on finishing this game, because this game is terrible, I haven't even managed to get out of the dungeon I started in, because I have to control TWO characters at once , and take care of both. This is in no way, shape or form a diablo clone. DivDiv was, this is not. The ♥♥♥♥ing death knight keeps dying, and I die right away because we're ♥♥♥♥ing linked, I'll never find out if I can get rid of him, and from what I've read and seen, your party gets even bigger! If I wanted a party-based game, I'd play neverwinter nights. Seriously, in diablo 1/2/3 , do you ever have to take care of any other character than yourself? NO. You kill♥♥♥♥♥♥ get money, cast spells, S I N G L E   C H A R A C T E R .Larian, You ♥♥♥♥ed up. This was the last diablo clone attempt too, the next few games are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ up-to-date high quality engine third person and other view games, so the only good game is Divine Divinity.Do NOT purchase this game, as it is in no way a sequel to Divine Divinity.

You both have a common goal to undo the soul forging. You and your unlikely companion quickly figure out that the only way to rid this curse is if you unlock the secret of riftrunning an ancient art that allowed the prison universe indigenous population to travel between universes.

												Not a bad game, but a few problems make it difficult to play.  Basically this is like Fallout 1, but in realtime combat instead of action time points.  The humor is funny and the puzzles can feel good when you solve them.  However the combat is clunky, hard to click on the target, and using items mid-combat is a hassle.   I found myself yelling because I couldn't seem to click on a switch on the wall and my 2nd char kept dying.I played about 10 hours and got about 50% the way through the game.  I enjoyed my time up to that 10 hours, but once it was kind of an open area with lots of imp quests and being teleporrted around by a magiciain... I found myself wanting to play something else.I could see this being a niche game that people discuss on forums and really dig into the details, but I found that 10 hours was about all I needed to satisify that old school RPG gameplay.

												I've never tried divinity before this. Boy, was this an awful way to get into the franchise. I just hope this game doesn't reflect the other Divinity games. Though, to be fair, I did get warned by the reviews that this was one of the worst ones when I bought it. You start off at the character creation screen. And right off the bat i'm jaw dropped at how awful the graphics are on my character. So I note that down and go about creating my chracter. The classes are Warrior, Wizard, and... Survivor? I think you mean *Thief*, Divinity. Anyway, the character creation is pretty bland. I think you have the choice of like 5 or 6 hair styles and you can't really change your appearance at all. So I pick my stats and my generic character, and I think: "" Okay now I'll spawn in. "" Nope. Without explination, they throw you into ANOTHER creation screen for some guy called the death knight. I thought they turned my character into this guy. So naturally, i'm like: "" What the hell divinity? I wanted to be a thie- er uh.... a *Survivor*... Not a knight?"" So tack on an additional five minutes of fumbling with the menu before I realise he's your companion. Could've EXPLAINED that to me. So you start off in a jail cell ( The elder scrolls called, they want their plot back ) and the knight that I had trouble with in the menu comes up to my cell, to speak with me. Real quick, have you ever played a new game and something bad happens and you think: "" Oh No.... It's gonna be one of THOSE games... "" Well this was one of those for me.  In the next 60 seconds, two things about this game became crystal clear. 1: The voice acting... Is some of the worst i've ever heard in a video game. 2: The story is REALLY bad. I'm not even gonna talk about the story. Just google it if you're curious. I played maybe 10-20 more minutes of this game. It's isometric, which is fine. I love the clasic fallout games so i'm used to isometric. In fact, the isometric combat is the only SINGLE thing this game did decently that I can name off. And it's only decent. I also should mention, the backgrounds suck. They're ugly. And why is this dungeon that looks like something from the 9th circle of hell being gaurded by dumb generic soldiers that adress you with "" HEY UHH ERRR HOWD YOU A GET OUT OF YOUR A CELL YOU'RE ONLY LEAVIN HEAR IN A COUGHIN (I know it's coffin Lol)"". Just awful. The exit was locked so the knight recommended I search the cells for a key or something. I try, and something comes out and one hit kills me. Thus marked the end of my adventures in ""Beyond Divinity"". Honestly this game was awful. I got it for like $1.49, and i kind of want my money back. I can't recommend this game to ANYONE. Sale or not. There are better isometric games, and better RPG titles. Every little thing in this game is either a HUGE flaw, or a small flaw that adds up when put together with other flaws. This game SUCKS. 3/10 Simply because the game functions. Hopefully the other Divinity games are better.			"

												This is a sequel to Divine Divinity, so you'll need to check that out for a starting point first. Basically it's the same except the characters are 3D, you control a party of two characters (plus possible summons), and the skill functionality has been reworked into a needlessly bloated gimmicky FUBAR system. The writing is as stupid as DD was, and voice acting is bad.Fans of DD seem to mostly either outright dislike BD or consider it meh. I was not too impressed with DD either and I'd say this would pass your time if you liked DD enough to want a bunch of similiar (if not exactly the same) gameplay in that setting.			"

												I loved Divine Divinity, so I tried this one, too. And for a short moment it felt good: the story, the idea, the background - all of it is well done. So where's the catch in my case?Poor optimalization. And by poor I mean terrible. No way this game could run on minimal required system. 256 MB RAM? Like hell! Got Dual core and 2 GB RAM and the game is (barely) running at 800×600! The main character's running feels like watching slow-mo impalas on Discovery channel O.oFrom the little I've managed to experience by now, the controls (character selection, switching inventories) are not really clever, too. The strength of DD was in its single character mode. BD tries to get as near to Baldur's-Gate-type games as possible - but it simply doesn't work with the engine and all. It's broken.			"

												Wow. Definitely one of the worst games I have every played. The voice acting is bad, I mean, really really awful. You also get basically chained to an annoying death knight npc because you and he share souls. You can't be apart and niether of you can die, so you have to babysit both characters. It's pain to micromanage them effectively, because added on to all of that everything about the game (including attacks, enemies. damage, etc) moves ridiculously fast. Another thing is that this game is stupidly hard. I died about 5 times in the first few minutes of the game. This is because my first guy was a wizard, but for some reason you don't start with any spells. My second was a thief but apparently stealth is useless because enemies automatically see you if you get to close. Basically, I got beat to death in a few seconds. It's possible to keep your main guy seperate, so I probably could've beaten the first dungeon, but that means you cannot use the ""select all"" button, meaning you have to switch back and forth to move both characters over and over, which is so tedious. Also, the death knight will just get beat to death if you try to send him in as a tank, so it doesn't solve the problem. This game just gives me a headache, so I decided to forget it. It isn't worth the meager payoff.			"

												Firstly id like to say i love Larian Studios, and Divine Divinity is my all time FAv game...... Beyond Divinity... the sequal. A brilliant idea...although a little weird...being partnered up with a deathknight.... i was told most of this game is a based  in a dungeon ...but this aint quite true.... A lot of the game will be spent outside (all be it a different planet) There is much more focus on quests and puzzles in this game rather than mindless clicking combat (which i love) from the first game. The stats screens have been changed into a single window to make it slightly easier to use and a very strange system for your skill set...(choosing your own icon and to be honest a bit confusing. First game was better laid out) The game play is very similar to the first game...although there is now 3D characters which to be honest makes little to no difference. The other big change is the battlefield addition. Where you find keys and you can leave whereever you are...and goto the battlefiled (there are 4 acts and 4 differenct battlefields..1 for each act) once you leave an act you cant go back and use the old battlefield.... anyways these are used for small side quests and to boost your stats and find treasure...  I found these boring after a while....as every dungeon is roughly the same layout...(and there are 3-5 dungeons for every Battlefield in every act) so you can imagine getting pretty bored doing the same thing nearly 20 times!  Regardless of a bit of treasure......Ok now to my biggest complaint about the game.... they must have launched this game in a hell of a hurry... they were moving faster than a nuns first curry! There is SOOOOO many F$%^& bugs with this game..... and im not talking just the original release... Im playing the Steam version...but I also have the DVD version and played years bacl with similar bugs....  The game is almost unplayable at points...... The menus in game (quests) the scroll button never worked for me... so cant see whats been done.......cant read conversations either or game crashes...... When you complete a quest .... unlike Divine Divinity where you were given rewards and SHOWN what they are...... this game it just says... ITEM ACQUIRED and if your carrying a lot of stuff which in this game you will.....uv no ♥♥♥♥ing idea what u got and where it is!!...... Then theres the charms..... why in christ would you make a game with charms and absoultely no information about them wotsoever... just a stupid name like...  PAG-YDRA ...and a colour.... so you dont know what your charms mean... manual says ♥♥♥♥ all! so you have to then♥♥♥♥♥♥about online to find out about these things....Also you can use charms from word go....but they are all crossed out.  weapon colours ......again no info, although you figure it out over time...but why cant they just have it all down in the manual and make life and the game easier...battlefields arent marked...so you can have 5 dungeons and 2 keys (2 unlocked dungeons) and uv no idea which ones are unlocked so you have to go round them all..... just these annoying little things missed, for me ...really bring the game down.. making you work to enjoy the game....... I could go on but to be fair the game is still enjoyable even with all the bugs.... the storyline is fairly fun, will keep you ammused til the end.  Overall Beyond Divinity is Divine Divinity on magic mushrooms....It has A LOT of bugs ive only mentioned a few...and if i didnt love Divine Diviinty so much i wouldnt recommend this game... but if you like the first then its defo worth a go... i wouldnt play this one first though.

												This game isnt as great as Divine Divinity but still holds its own. For the first time you control two characters but the world is very linear compared to DD. It uses a lot of locations , characters and lore from DD. Beware buying this as the game has had an Equipment  bug since vista that still isnt completely fixed.			"

												A classic isometric top-down style dungeon crawler.Following on from the ultimately replayable Diving Divinity , you now go Beyond in terms of storytelling width, you are now truly on your own.Simply playable, even though really dated, but at the same time hours and hours of exploring to do.

												After several hours of playing this game I couldn't find the motivation to finish it. This game has some severe bugs that killed all the fun I was having:- If you “alt-tab”, the NPCs move around the map, sometimes even getting stuck behind objects. Thus, you can no longer interact with them.- Many monsters in the dungeons spawn on unreachable areas beyond the walls.- On many quests, I got stuck on the cutscenes, effectively preventing me from finishing those quests.- The quests on the battlefield are always the same, they just change the name of the monster you have to kill. Even the name of those quests is the same.In addition, the soundtrack of the battlefield is really bad. Who seriously listened to it and thought “ok let’s put this in the game”? it is like a bad joke, you laugh, but you know it sucks.			"

												As a very story rich and even fun opening game sequence. This game definitely feels like something different and not your old style kind of RPG type. The characters and the dialuge is engaging and the overall gameplay and balance of the game is fair and rewarding if you understand how to properly fight. The later stages of the game even challenge you still. Power-farming isn't exactly something you can do here. I would recommend the game substantially. I even like the story concept. :D			"
