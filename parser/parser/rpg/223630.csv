												I don't think this game gets enough credit. It's unique, inspires team play, is kinda funny, and it's enjoyable. It's downfall is that it's entirely PvP and not enough people play it. Good fun, if there are enough players.			"

												AirBuccaneers is different than your usual first person shooter fare. That scores it bonus points in my book for innovation alone. An interesting idea alone doesn't make a good game but AirBuccaneers is executed, not flawlessly mind you, but well enough to make for a very enjoyable gaming experience. It has come a long way since it started as an Unreal Tournament mod in 2003.Before I go into the details I have to tell you my main gripe I have with this game, it will most likely be a dealbreaker if you're considering a purchase. It's multiplayer only and the community is pretty much dead, if you login today you will most likely find all servers empty. A problem far too many old, indie or non-mainstream multiplayer games face.Try it with a group of friends or join a Steam group that is dedicated to organizing AirBuccaneers sessions.AirBuccaneers pitches two teams of air-balloon crews, ""Vikings"" and ""Buccaneers"", against each other in exciting ship-on-ship battles. Each player assumes a role of his or her choice, a role that can be switched fluently during the game. Pilot a ballon and order yor crew around as a helmsman, man a cannon as cannoneer, repair damage done to your balloon, engage in ranged or melee combat (yes, enemy ships can be grapple-hooked onto and boarded), set up floating mines or support a teammate (for example one of the cannoneers to allow him to fire at a faster rate).Cannons are far from accurate, so skill in this regard doesn't matter as much as in many other first person action games and if you consider your aim still not good enough that's not a problem either: Just assume another role that suits you better.As you may already have guessed, teamwork is everything. The fact that you're totally dependent on your fellow crew members simply doesn't allow to play as a lone wolf and leads to almost organically developing teamwork very fast.The only persistent element of the game are the skill trees, a different one for each role. Which path you take is not entirely up to you but progression is assigned automatically depending on your actions during matches. To me, this feature feels superfluous, I never had the feeling that it influences the outcome of a match at all. Maybe that's because every perk is evened out with a debuff and that's probably better than having new players start at a disadvantage.Instead, the game allows for imbalance in another way: Since players can switch teams any time they want in absence of an autobalance system it leaves it entirely in the hands of the participants to form evenly sized teams.In conlusion, I'd recommend AirBuccaneers to everyone if it weren't for the lack of a player base. It certainly is a game that deserves to be revived, I still hope that it will at some point but wouldn't hold my breath.			"

												It's hard to give airbuccaneers a fair review. It really is. Why? Because as of writing, both servers up right now have 0/32 players.I really doubt anyone will even read this review, only because this is a game time forgot. I bought it when it first came out on steam, and since nothing has changed since other than going free to play (with no bonus for people who previously bought, something that would anger most people but I had my fun with it so I feel it's only fair) all I can do is reminisce on previous times I've played this game in 2013 when it wasn't horribly dead.I feel like AirBuccaneers is a game that if it had a thriving playerbase it wouldn't be at ""mixed"" of 60% positive ratings. It's rough around the edges- but not in a way that negatively impacts the game. The game works like most air combat simulators, you fly around in airships and shoot different types of weapons at the enemy while the pilot tries to steer you out of the way of projectiles incoming so you don't horribly crash and burn to your pitiful death. What makes AirBuccaneers different than guns of icarus? Ground combat. It's a lie to say you can walk to your enemies base and kill them via one on one fistfights as the ground is covered in poisonous mushrooms, but in AirBuccaneers you spawn in your home base and can choose what ship to board either by walking onto a docked one or using an hangglider to get to one in the air. But how does this equate into ground combat? You have free movement and aren't locked onto your ship, meaning it's a legitimate strategy to either dismount your hangglider in mid air and jump onto the enemy's ship or to jump from your own and engage in proper swashbuckling- or just take their helm and drive their ship into a cliff. You can also use one of the diverse ship types like the Kamikaze ship that instantly destroys anything when touched (but it horrendously underarmoured) or the massive, immobile fort that has a huge cannon on it but can only move via air maneuver which takes a long time to recharge.Another great thing about airbuccaneers is the perks and flaws system. I found this very unique at the time, and it still sticks out to me as one of the only multiplayer games that has something like this. There are very overpowered perks in each level progression tree that you can pick to make yourself better suited to one role, but there are negatives in that tree (or other trees) you must choose from as well. This would be just OK if the perks were something generic like ""move 10% faster"" or ""repair 20% slower"", but they're all mostly fun stuff like ""you're drunk and your screen is tilting"", ""you don't take fall damage"", ""you have an eyepatch over half of your screen"", and ""your gun works like russian roulette and has a random chance of killing you"". I didn't get that far in the perk tree as this game died pretty quickly, but it was the main thing that kept me playing and I really wish another multiplayer game would pick up something similar.So all that positive said, do I recommend AirBuccaneers? Hell yes, if you can find players. It's free to play now, and is a great arcadey game with an interesting character creation system. I just really wish it wasn't dead.			"

												An amazing game, I loved every bit of it and I have over 50 hours logged into it. The only problem with the game is the lack of players. Sometimes theres a wave a people from a sale or event but others there are no people at all. If the community is active at the time of purchase you will enjoy this game.			"

												Nice concept, team vs team in the skies.Air Bucaneers VS Vikings (Blue and Red) battling in different airships in the sky. Shoot down and destroy other airships using things like cannons.This was an Indie Online game Greenlit by the communtiy to get on Steam, it doesn't look great, is decent in terms of fun gameplay but missing a lot.Since servers are always dead, there isn't bots and I didn't play for long I don't recommend this game.3/10 "

												In brief: Great idea, unfinished execution. Good game but no players. Free demo available. Free to playThere are many FPS games with vehicles these days, but not so many that are all about the vehicles. There is also many that are supposedly about teamwork, but people end up lonewolfing anyways. AirBuccaneers emphasises the teamwork alot. You can fly a ship alone, but usually you are much better off with a crew. Compared to the other game with similar premise, Guns of Icarus Online, ABu is more sandboxy and free while GoIO feels like it's more ""serious business"".The game does have some problems, however. Even though there was a lenghty public alpha and beta testing stages, it feels like the final features implemented in the release were rushed and not tested and balanced properly. This would have been fine if there had been proper post-release support, but the few patches after release have been relatively minor and not about gameplay issues. The developers were communicating at first, but now have fallen silent and seemingly moved on to other projects. This has caused the community to wither and die. Great as this game is, it's not so fun with just few players. There is bots, but with just them it's barely fun at all.To go into more detail what the unfixed problems are, first of all there is the perks and flaws, which should have been tested and balanced much more. I don't think the idea is bad in and of itself, a sort of ""build your own"" class system, but the implementation is poor. There is some combinations of perks that are very overpowered and there are flaws that you barely notice and some that can be used to your advantage. Then there is the exploits that should have been fixed soon after they were discovered, but have not. The somewhat awkward team selection system, which often leads to uneven teams, is also a problem, as is the team scoring system, which could have used refinement. One of the more annoying problems is a some sort of memory leak issue with the Unity engine they couldn't solve and instead made the servers reboot periodically. This is bad because it breaks down matches that have been snowballing and gathering players.A great concept that would have been great game with some more work. I like the original Unreal Tournament 2004 mod's atmosphere better, and there is some minor things I'd like to have seen recreated in this game, like UT's ""don't walk over the edge"" code, but overall this standalone version is better. I still recommend it despite all the problems. The lack of players brought by the other issues is a serious problem, though. Beware. If you can try it with a group of friends, you can at least avoid being alone against bots.Some other notes:- This game is quite different from the usual FPS's you might be familiar with and you will have to spend some time to figure out how to play it. There is no real ingame tutorial, but there is a manual, video tutorials[www.airbuccaneers.com] and Steam Community guides.			"

												You will have a hard time finding players. You will rarely have more than 8 people on the entire planet at any given time. This alone should be warning enough. You need human players, there are no bots.I do not know why so few players stick to the game. While I like the gameplay, it requires more patience than action. It's about airships, and ships move, turn and fire slowly.Only buy while it is on sale. Not because of the money, but a sale gives a temporary rise in players.			"

												Airbuccaneers is an amazing, great concept. I would absolutly buy and play a full out console version. This game is about two teams, Vikings and Buccaneers, in a sky battle. I love the thought that the creators but behind each ship. The ships that you can control vary from hang-gliders to 1 person ballons all the way to a huge command ship. Each base is well defended with ground cannons and gametypes include a king-of-the-hill and normal points battle. The characters have great items that can be equiped.The main problem is THAT NO REAL PLAYERS ARE EVER ON THE SERVERS! They have bots that fill a few spaces on each team, but nothing like the game play shown in the trailer. I would not recommend this game until it becomes populated, but I have little hope that this game will make a comeback.			"

												Very enjoyable game when the servers were busy - however nowadays the most you might get is a handful of people thrown in with the bots. And I've got to say, I think it's a complete shame, really and truly. It is an innovative and exciting premise a breath of fresh air from the litany of Terraria clones, army FPS's & FTPMMORPPGS♥♥♥♥THATSHIT.The problem seems to be that the dev's seem to no longer support it, as it's had no updates in a long while.To make thinks worse the game still retains a fairly hefty price tag of €13.99 - which I think is idiotic. What the devs should be doing (if they have no intention of supporting it properly) is to be flogging it off cheaply in steam sales on a regular basis to increase the player base and breath some life into the game. Currently as is, with so few people, I can't say that I'd recommend it for the price - however the game itself is brilliant fun and the level of co-operation I came across with strangers was amazing. So in short, I am going to recommend this game on the games merits, but would either wait for it to go on sale or for the price to drop.			"

												This review will be short as I have not a lot to say about this game, plus it's completely and utterly dead.AirBuccaneers is a Guns of Icarus type game where you fight in airships. You do this by either piloting or shooting cannons at enemy ships, or you can fix up your ship.Graphically this game is not that impressive, but for an indie title it looks really good.But as stated before the only reason this game get's a bad review is cause it's absolutely dead. There's no reason to even install this game cause all servers are empty which is sad. Just save up your money and buy Guns of Icarus Online which is a way better game.Final Rating:3/10Pros: + Graphics are alright Cons:- Game is DEAD			"

												As someone who backed this project back in it's earliest stages, it has been in the 'never again' section of my library for the majority of the time since then. Day one was great, with updates strolling out and plenty of people playing to fill up multiple servers. Pretty much immediately after the game was 'done' and this went into development limbo the playerbase dropped off the map as well, leaving me with a useless game with (every time I came back to it and checked around) 3-5 players online, if any at all.For me, going f2p and offering not a dime to those who had faith at the start is an insult, and their damage control in a vain attempt at reviving a long lost relic is too little too late considering there are other, more interesting (Blackwake) or much more complete (Guns of Icarus) team-based vehicle PvP games.

												Tired of the same old shooters? Then AirBuccaneers might be something for you.AirBuccaneers is a slow paced Action FPS (yes I said slow...). You pick one of the two teams (Buccaneers vs. Vikings), afterwards you will spawn on land. From there you're able to walk towards one of the few airships and take controll of them. There are a few different airships for you to choose some are big, some are small. Just to be clear; you are able to fight on land but this rarely happens.After you've chosen one of the Airships and up in the air, it's time to search the enemy. You can walk freely on your airship and switch between steering and controlling the cannons.  When steering you are able to boost your ship into any direction you feel like, after each boost you will have to wait a while to use it again. Because the game is slow paced, strategy and timing are the most important aspects. Flying the airships is slow, even aiming/firing your cannons is slow. If you are too close to an enemy ship they are able to jump on your ship, kill you and hijack your ship, which can be pretty fun. There are various weapons for you to use aswell like melee weapons and grenades. If you've played for a while you're able to level up your character, pick different perks and also gain new clothes/armor.Originally being a Unreal Tournament 2k4 mod, AirBuccaneers feels and plays like a mod. The controlls are a little bit clunky and the graphics are not up to date anymore, it did not bother me much personally though.Overall, AirBuccaneers is a refreshing and original game, something you've probably never played before. Will you play this game for 4 hours straight? Probably not, but it's a great game to return to every once in a while. At the time of writing, I found out the game is Free To Play, so there is no reason not to try it. I would've recommended it even if there was a price tag, just try it! "

												AirBuccaneers is a free to play game that has first person shooter and flying primative airships into combat mashed up together.  It worked on Win 10, looked ok, sounded ok, played ok.  Was suprised that it worked given it was recommended only for XP or Win 7.  This game was a paid game at one time but have recently been set to Free (2014).  You have 4 classes with a skill tree system.You need more than one player manning just one airship, and requires teamwork to fight effectively.  There is single player kamakaze airships and there is 3 person 1 cannon airships, and there is airships with 4 cannons.  Has steam trading cards and badges.  The game is Multiplayer PVP only.  Cannons are a challenge to hit something with them. Check the forum for guides and manuals, and check the Internet for info on how to play.CONS:- Does not have a scripted tutorial or training mode, but does have a contextual tutorial by pressing F1.  - There is few or no servers running for this game, at time of this review i found 1 server with a 190 ping.  - There is a few players left in this game, mostly a few die hard veterans or f2p noobs trying out this game at any given hour. - Mostly a Russian, Finnish or Polish playerbase, but the game has a emote command system that provides basic communications between players. Has been localized to English. Try it but don't expect much.  They need MOAR players.For more info:

												This game is awesome, I really do enjoy playing this. Needs more players!There is another this kind of game (can't recall the name) but I haven't liked it nearly as much as I like this one.This is based on teamwork but you can go all alone and do lots of damage to enemy ships and capture them. Which brought to my mind that using swords is pretty hard, I don't yet know how it works but all other mechanisms (flying, shooting etc) works fine and it is lot of fun!			"

												A really awesome and original game where you and your team fight the other team in an epic battle high up in the air. The leveling system is great. You can level in four different classes. Cannoneer, Defender, Guerrillas and of course the captain.You are not bound to a class but can choose what you want to be during the game. Maybe you're a defender trying to shoot out incoming cannonballs when a cannoneer suddenly dies, you need to take his place and shoot down the enemy ship.The battles can get really intense, and when you find yourself a good team the game gets really fun, and most players are nice and doesn't spam the chat with annoying and mean words. It's an indie game and is therefore not that expensive, so If you're looking for a new kind of game, I highly recommend this one.			"

												I've never been big fan of shoot and run, so it looked something different. And it is!There's RPG mentioned in description, and it works perfectly in the game. I've never been RPG fan either, but it sits very well and expands main goal of the game - shoot to other ship.It's teamwork game, no teamwork - no fun and wins also.Yep, it's a little problem of the lack of players, but I never felt very lonely, because I always found somebody connected and playing. And remember to read instructions about how to play it, before playing it! After reading it you can find a lot of things you even couldn't imagine it.Nice game, I love it!			"

												I'm going to give this a recommendation, because excluding the fact that the community appears to be dead, it's a good game! It's very fun as a very unique multiplayer 'shooter' in a steampunk setting with cannons and several secondary weapons available at your disposal, in a game that requires teamwork to survive. It has good graphics, fun gameplay and simple and easy to navigate menus (including a well thought out in-game tutorial). If you can get this on sale and you have a bunch of friends to play it with, go for it! I wholeheartedly recommend this title, just please note that the community is currently dead, it certainly needs a revival or a group (which I'm sure exists) to schedule a play session for you to be likely to see another player online. So yes, the game itself is great, but the community is non-existant - buy at your own risk!			"

												Fire cannons at the other team's airships. There's a good number of strategies and roles you can take on.The perks/flaws system is a great idea too, where picking a new perk as you level up means you have to pick a 'flaw' as well. The problem is, going up in levels is far too slow - a terrible grind. The game starts to get repetitive well before you've unlocked most things. Lack of any auto-balance feature is real pity too.Overall it's good fun though. One thing you will definitely get used to while playing this is falling to your death with the accompanying bloodcurdling scream!			"

												Air Buccaneers is a game in which you and your team of vikings -or buccaneers- take to the skys aboard rickety looking airships to blow each other to bits. Well, it could be that game. Unfortunately, nobody plays it.I've been [trying] to play it for the past couple of days and have had a grand total of 2 populated sessions. With a few exceptions, it was the same group of players each time. I'm not really surprised that this is the case, have you heard about Air Buccaneers? It was featured on Steam when it released, but then it just sort of vanished. The developers seem to be neglecting it too – when I first played it near release among my first thoughts were “wow, this will be great with a bit of polish and some content updates.” I don't think either have happened. A quick visit to the Steam community forums would show you that the small player base echoes this opinion. It's a crying shame, really. Air Buccaneers could be a really fun game. During my time playing I met a player called Keel and truly were we the gods of the wind! Single handedly we held off barrages from. . . AI controlled airships because only one other person was in the game. While I'm glad that bots take over when there aren't enough players, it's just not as satisfying. Especially since AI ships can't be boarded and captured – which is one of my favourite aspects of Air Buccaneers.Seldom did me and Keel get a chance to clumsily weave through a barrage of cannon fire, pull up to the enemy and leap through the skies – swords in hand – to claim an enemy ship for our own. But when it happened, it was glorious.Air Buccaneers has 3 game modes: Deathmatch, Domination and Protect The Golden Ship.In Deathmatch you blow up enemy ships to score points, in domination you blow up enemy ships to score points and in Protect The Golden Ship you blow up enemy ships to score points but also have to blow up the golden ship – One team defends and the other attacks. So there isn't much variance there.There are 3 roles in Air Buccaneers. Captain, shooter and Everything Else Guy.The captain pilots the ship, shouting out orders to the crew and calling out the locations of enemy ships. The shooters man the cannons, manually aiming the cannon and trying to predict the ball's trajectory [there is no aiming reticle]. The Everything Else Guy does everything else, if you aren't behind the wheel or behind the cannon then you're fixing the ship, spotting enemy ships, firing off air-mines or supporting the cannons by reducing the cooldown time on their shots.The roles are flexible, at any time the captain can ditch the wheel and hop on the cannons or the shooter can decide he's had enough of missing shots and instead just leap onto the enemy ship to engage in an exciting battle of who can click their sword the fastest. Melee combat leaves much to be desired, which makes boarding less exciting than it could be. But is melee combat really important in a game about piloting an airship to shoot other airships?There are 4 types of ships in Air Buccaneers. As before I'm going to make up their names because I don't think the names of anything are mentioned anywhere in game.First up you have what I call the Classic. Not particularly fast, four cannons and hardy enough to soak up a few cannons before dropping out of the sky. Then you have the Speedy McGoFast; only one cannon, fairly small and weak, fast enough to get close enough to an enemy ship to initiate a surprise boarding party. There is also the Flying Fortress. Very slow, very big, I think it has a strong defence? I've never actually seen a cannon hit it. It's an incredibly long ranged cannon platform that nobody really uses. And finally you have the OH COME ON. A speedy little kamikaze ship fit for one person. No cannons because you are the cannon. Pick a target and smash right into them, sacrificing yourself for the good of the team [only to respawn a second later to do it again].I took a break from writing this to see if I could play Air Buccaneers. Nobody was online.So, would I recommend Air Buccaneers? Well it depends on how many people are listening to me. A couple of friends? Probably not. The servers are too empty. But if I had an audience of enough people to populate servers? Heck yeah. It's a fun game that's worth checking out if you have a large enough group of people to actually play.			"

												This game is one of my favorites of all time. The only problem I have with it is that the developers seem to have dropped it and there are no more official servers. Also there are some incomplete perks in the skill trees. But despite all this it is still great fun. You now have to find people that play it though, and organize a game. No more just casual AirBuccaneers. A few years ago I wouldn't have recommended getting it. But now it's free-to-play so there's no reason not to try it out.			"

												REAL teamplay required, if that's not your cup of tea or coffee - don't touch this.You WILL BE dependant on the performance of other players on your team. This can be the most rewarding experience ever or horror hour of downed ships one after another. I myself enjoy this sea-style battling happening in air.all ship related functions are made by playesr themselves.Pilot pilots, gunner guns, someone needs to fix the ship with the tool while another blocks incoming cannon balls with musket. All this ballet, when it clicks, is the most rewarding feeling you'll ever feel in online game.Definately worth it's price.			"

												I recently discovered that AirBuccaneers went free to play so I gave it a try. I have got to say I love the idea. The concept of this game and the style is pretty darn great. You play as either vikings or Buccaneers and fight on blimp like airships with a variety of weapons. Overall its somewhat hard to describe. I like the idea and style a lot. I do have some negative input as well though. The combat, movement and mechanics are very clunky. It is very obvious this game has an indy feel. If you are not bothered by the rough around the edges gameplay this is a good game to try! I can only imagine the game that could be made from this idea if it was made ""better"" (ie. had a bigger budget or something.)  At this time You have to search for AirBuccaneers to find it is free to play, as it does not appear on the list of free games yet. Hopefully this will be fixed soon so more people will try the game!			"

If that's not enough there is a total of about 7 people that play this game ever and shockingly they're even worse than me at fumbling around the broken controls this game implements.

												There are not so many games that really demands one into team-oriented play. AirBuccaneers is one of those diamonds. Ludocraft's old Unreal Tournament 2004 mod has got its facelift.Although a bit rusty from the edges, the basic gameplay in AIrBuccaneers is worth it. Two teams, Vikings and Buccaneers are battling for the domination of the air space with different kind of balloons differing from little kamikaze ones to big battleships and floating bases.For a new player it can be a bit hard to get into the game, though compared to the old mod, AirBuccaneers is much more gently. There isn't really a game like AirBucs, especially in terms of gameplay.There's perhaps only two flaws in the game, for me at least. One is the not-so-big player population. But, eh, that can be fixed, because AirBuccaneers deserves more players. The second flaw is a bit clumsy melee action, but one can live with it.I recommend this game for everyone from the bottom of my heart!			"

												Aerial combat with wooden ships suspended with hot air balloons. Cannons and ugly men grace every deck, and drunken screams fill the air. It's a wonderful and unique game, marred only by a perks system and the removal of cannonball loading. Back when this game was in beta, there were no silly perks system to grind through. Skill and teamwork were bigger factors back then, especially when you consider that every cannonball had to be individually loaded by cannonballs, rockets, or gunpowder before firing. Now, after release, it has been dumbed down quite a bit with a simple ""click to fire, right click to change ammo"" system. I don't know what the hell Ludocraft was thinking when they put this in. Despite those two negativities, everything else about the game still shines. Great graphics, fun gameplay, but less focus on teamwork this time around.			"

												If and I do me IF you can find anyone on the servers to play with this is a fun game to fire up every now and then and blow ships out of the sky in. However The most I usually see on the servers these days is maybe 1 or 2 other people. this game is designed for a lot of people and it gets a bit dull when the servers are empty. So in short give it a try but dont hold your breath when it comes to finding people to play with.			"

												It's sad and unfortunate that AirBuccaneers was not a successful game. The theme, ideas, mechanics, and aesthetics were somehow not enough to bring in the players. As it has been since launch, no one plays this game, and playing alone isn't any fun.AirBuccaneers is mediocre.			"

												A game which potentially could of been really good, unfortunately it suffers many flaws. The tutorial is useless and isn't a dedicated one just some tooltips in a normal multiplayer game.The ships are the same colour for both sides so its hard to tell who to fire at.As far as I can see there is no single player campaign so due to the low server population you are likely to find yourself alone.Finally the controls for steering the ship, aiming the cannon just don't feel responsive.Altogether give this a miss, unless you see it in the sale and then it may be worth it purely for the trading cards.

												This game is pretty cool in concept and I enjoy the class system but buy it from SBM or get it in a bundle because you won't get much out of it. You'll be lucky to find anyone ever playing. There are groups that schedule events for matches but due to life a lot of poeple can only join up for a good game or two before there are so few people you can't play. I like it but online only is like wtf. Once you play it you'll see why it probably doesnt have AI, you can't fly and fight at the same time, you just can't. I fell out of the sky constantly just trying to use the airships cannons. So I just stuck to flying mostly, gliders are sweet and such. I only paid $1.35 for this on SBM but... but it sucks.			"

												A sloppy mess of a tactic-less nonsense. I'm sure if a bunch of the air ships teamed up and organized their attacks better there might be more fun in it, but in all the servers I played there was nothing like that happening.Don't get me wrong either - I had some fun. It was fun for about an hour or so and then I was tired of it. Kept telling myself to go back and give it another try, but it's simply just not that enjoyable of a game.			"

												AirBucc has always been a LAN party favourite for my group of friends, and we've been playing since it was a UT2k4 mod. Having missed a few of our yearly LANs and having only played the updated version the other night, I figure it's time for a review.So, this version --Yeah, the servers are kinda dead.Yeah, the RPG elements don't add a lot to it.But oh my god, there is nothing more fun that screaming at friends to turn that blasted balloon starboard 15º so you can launch a cannonball at some scurvy skallywags. Folks who are giving it bad reviews simply haven't played it in the right environment.It's also a TON easier to play since the UT2k4 version, since you don't need separate people to load, aim and fire the cannons. Although I liked how much teamwork that required (Making it especially great for LANs), I definitely like how the focus in now much more on flying (Which is also WAY less finicky now) and shooting.

												I'm a huge fan of this game, I've had hundreds of hours of fun out of it, but unfortunately it has some issues which result in it being worth less than the default steam price. Firstly the developers are not updating the game. There are numerous bugs and balance issues which could easily be fixed, but haven't been in the year and a half I've been playing. In addition, the playerbase has dwindled, probably because of the lack of developer interest. This is a multiplayer game and the bots just don't cut it. Finally, it has a very steep learning curve and has no tutorial, this means that, even if you do get a good game going with a few people, newbies tend to be left clueless and not knowing what to do.Overall, I'd say wait for a sale and pick up a copy on the cheap. Anything under €5 is reasonable. If there's a strong game going, join in and try to pick it up. A good AirBuccs match is a week's worth of fun, but be prepared for the possibility that the game will die entirely.			"

It is, in fact, a well designed game, and looks (and feels) like it can be fun.  It's just that lack of people who want to play it (as far as I know, it's online only).

I breifly tried this when I saw a standalone was FINALLY released some 10 years after I played it.  unfortunetly the problem it had back then is the same on it has today. there arnt many people online to play with.  im not sure why it doesnt catch on more I think its amazing, even down to the art style.  IMO it needs a bigger publisher to get it out there and advertise it. I think that simply most people dont know what it is. If I had never played it back 10 years ago I most certainly would not of found it today.  advertise this game and add more content, ships, stats, ext and this would be a real winner.			"

												The concept is underdeveloped and suffers as a multiplayer game with practicly no players. Most your time is spent waiting on a slow airbaloon across the map. Not to mention fire times for the weapons are slow. Slow movment with slow firetimes and lack of players doesnt befit ""Action"" games.The game could be improved by having a fast way for players to get from one ship to another to do FPS PVP while the slow airships try to destroy eachother. Think of the baloons more like destructable contol points, each team needs at least one ship to survive and loosing all your ships eather by being destroyed or loosing control of all your ships would be considered defeat. It would be likable to games such as Unreal Tournament or Team Fortress 2 but with its own unique spin on gameplay elements. Such a mechanic could solve the issues regarding game speed and add an extra insentive to players in that there are more rewards involved than simply being the last baloon floating.			"

												They made it free so there are more players, and made it a mockery for many of their player base.The game was expensive enough, but only the people who pre-ordered early for a few bucks got some stuff, taunts, and so on, they happily spam ingame. One of them is a rather powerful battle cry. The idiots like me who bought later for the full price because they wanted to support a project they thought was worth it got - yes, excactly nothing. Basically not even the game, because it was dead and it doesn't ever seem to get real improvements.  Also nice strategy - take more money, deliver less content.The game is wonky and unpolished, imbalanced, unfinished, and is one of the reasons why I will never support alpha projects like this anymore. There's a too high risk you pay developers who don't see the need to deliver after taking the money. Other players complained as well and started to argument in the developer's forum about not being able to use all functions even though they paid more than others who can use them, but the developers didn't care. Now you have slots ingame you can NEVER USE because only the pre-orderers got the content. Your (ugly modelled) character only says NAY when you press the button, and the game tells you content is required. Content you can never get. Ever. Way to go! Make it free but withhold the fun stuff. Their argument was that they want to reward the early supporters. Well, great support, driving the player base away. In the end the early supporters couldn't keep the game afloat either, and the rest jumped ship. Hah!Now the game is dead, deservedly. And stay down, you scurvy lan'lubber!			"

												I was not able to play Air Buccaneers for very long since like other countless games in my steam library that dislike working.The short amount of time I did manage to play it is a very interesting and what could've been an enjoyable game, I can see teamwork playing heavy on this game with the need to communicate the way the ships facing and where targets are. My only probelm is that gameplay with the cannons is very slow and clunky, aiming is a hit and miss procedure with 0 guide on how to aim and having the aim offset a bit throws off your aim.Tl;dr could've been good back in the day.

Had I done so, I would ahve found out that this game is an online multiplayer game to that of which the multiplaying community is dead. I am sure I did not spend a lot of money on this game, but still was a little let down to see that it was dead. The graphics are nice and the gameplay mechanics seemmed fine. I wish I could offer up a little more information on this product. Hoever, it really doesn't matter... the community for this game is dead. The only reason to pick this game up is if you and your friends would liek to play it as part of a LAN party or you have all the games you could want and want to blow money so now you are just adding games to grow your Steam collection.

No one else in the world was playing when I tried, twice, and there are no bots, confusing UI and mechanics, well.. perhaps not confusing just more ""I don't care enough cause the base game isn't fun"". It seems to require other active people or friends. Maybe it DOES offer one of the ""most rewarding co-op multiplayer experiences available"".

												This is a... Guns of Icarus for those who want something for nothing. And as a result: I can only recommend this game on the grounds that... Well. Before I start, let me explain.I chose to play this, on the grounds that it has physics on the projectiles, full on boarding, and general airship goodness, which is seldom followed by developers, aside from Guns of Icarus.However.This game is.... FAR. From finished. It needs a good deal more work before it could be considered complete, and we'll leave it at that.The airships themselves (once again, mentioning guns of icarus) seem more realistic from a physical standpoint - the deck is very small and minimum, regardless of what vessel you jump onto by... doing barrel rolls on a railtracked glider, that I hasten to add, becomes a very unhappy if you switch rapidly between the ships when you attempt to fly to one.The combat is... Slow. Very slow.This is down to the fact, the ships fly themselves. Yep. You don't have full control - The airships list slowly through the air on a pre determined speed, with the only imput being whether you move up, down, or turn. There are ""boost"" options, but they're on a cooldown that makes them difficult to use reliably, and ultimately a pointless addon, other than to give a momentary boost to the otherwise snailpace gameplay.I could go on. I could talk for a long time about the bad. But wait, I hear you ask, you're recommending this game? But it's so bad! Why?Simple.With some of the absolute insanity, caused through glitches, mildly broken animations and issues that were laughable at best, the whole experience was worth the asking price of nothing. *IF* you have a group of friends you can drop in with to ♥♥♥♥ around for a couple of hours.So yes, you should play this. If you have friends. And you want to laugh at an ultimately broken, and.... nonsensical monster of a game. The fact it's free to play helps, because I wouldn't pay for this game if you dared me.Hae fun!(Or play Guns of Icarus. It's more fleshed out, and less buggy.) "

												First of all this game makes no effort to explain anything of what's going on. I had no idea what I was doing, there were no objective markers and everybody was just kinda shooting their cannons at anything that moved.Secondly this game is slow as hell, taking a ship to battle takes ages and when you're there you have no idea how to fight.Thirdly, this game is dead. There are no players anywhere even though the game is now free. My guess is that people try it once, don't get it and abandon it forever.And finally, this game is ugly. A five year old could have done better.I'm sorry devs, but the fact that you charged money for this is horrible. Even now that it's free it's not worth downloading. This kind of gameplay will never be the most popular game on steam, but if you give a damn about getting your game out there make a damn HUD at the very least. Show players what to do.			"

												The game itself is an interesting concept with poor execution. It doesn't know whether it wants to be an FPS, a third person game or an RPG. When it tries to do all three of these things, it does them poorly. When shooting you snap into first person and when sword fighting you snap over to third person view. It can be slightly disorienting when there is a lot of crap going on in and around your ship. Fighting is slow but more importantly it's not that exciting. Combat consist mainly of missing with a crap load of cannon shots. Of course when you do land a hit you actually do feel like you accomplished something for once during the round. The steering of the ship itself feels clunky and clumsy at times almost as if you blindfolded a fat drunk guy and told him to walk to the other side of a room without crashing into anything.But the thing that was really discouraging about this game was the tutorial (It was painful and unhelpful). Red flag #1- They give you your first tutorial during your first live match up against other players (Bad move)As they were giving me the basics, I hopped on the nearest ship and got going. A prompt came up and said ""Use the mouse to look around to the left and right on your ship. You want know what happened after that? I turn to my left and a cannon ball hits me in my face, explodes my ship and I go plummeting to the ground like Wily Coyote. Red flag #2- They gave me vague answers as to what my equipment does. You start off with this wooden spoon/lolipop looking thing in your hand (Found out later that's what you use to repair your crew's ship.) There's literally no animation that shows you repairing anything but you'll know you're fixing something when plus signs start coming out of the floor. (I found that quite strange.)Red flag #3- The game gives you the option to go kamakaze on enemy ships so if the enemy feels they are in a loosing battle, the next best thing to do is kill themselves and take as many of your crew with them. Worst case scenario it could turn into a giant kamakaze match. Red flag #4- As mentioned before by others there's not a lot of people on here so there are times you might be greatly outnumbered during a match or you may not find a match at all.Even though I don't recommend it, I can definitely see this game becoming one of those cult classics with some people. It has a kind of charm to it that if you got a boatload of your friends into a match, it might actually be quite goofy and entertaining. This is definitely a team essential game so make sure your crew at least knows what to do and how to do it if you're thinking about giving this game a try. This game still has potential and believe it or not I really hope this game does better than what it's doing now.			"

												Here's what i think of the game after playing.Cons:1. Bad Gameplay2. Bad movement3. Really ♥♥♥♥ing annoying HUD4. More lame movement5. You can't control the glider just select the ship you want to go to and spin 360 degrees for minutes.6. Cannons have really ♥♥♥♥ing slow movement7. not much players8. Cannons don't even have a crosshair9. Sword is probably the most useless weapon ever10. you fall in the water you die, but the game warns you about stupid ♥♥♥♥ing mushrooms, like seriously?11. The tutorial doesn't really show you anything, like how to operate a cannon, or how to operate a ship.Here's the tutorial in short. look around > Move > bring out your sword > put down your sword > Go to the glider > Go land on a ship > GO DESTROY A ♥♥♥♥ING SHIP WHICH YOU HAVE NO ♥♥♥♥ING IDEA HOW TO ACTUALLY DO IT BECAUSE YOU'RE A NEW PLAYER.12. Only multiplayer.13. 3D models look like ♥♥♥♥ from up close.14. That tornado. Is it just for show?Pros:1. Good idea and concept of the game2. Great environment3. Really nice scenery, You can view some of my screenshots in my profile.4. Free to play. Yippe.5. THE ONLY THING THATS BEAUTIFUL ABOUT THIS GAME IS THE SPEC MODE.6. Nope. Thats pretty much about it.Hope Devs fix this game because i will not play this game because i want to play this game. I would probably just go for a spin in the spec mode and take a few screenshots lol.6/10 because of the good scenery. If it didn't had that i don't know how low i would have rated.I would only recommend if you want to download 600mb to get some great view of battleships in the air with viking pirates and a freaking giant tornado in the middle of the battlefield which pretty much does nothing.

												Welcome to the ancient North, once the cradle of culture and peace, but is now corrupted by magic and inhabited by nasty bandits sowing destruction in airships. Choose to be a vicious Buccaneer or an infamous Viking and take a glider to the skies. Your goal is to drop enemy vessels and secure dominance of the ancient North. Fire cannons, help others, board enemy ships or be the captain – whatever it takes to get your enemies out of the way. The success, as well as the bitter defeat, is solely dependent on how well you co-operate with your crew mates. Finding the right kind of battle strategy is not self-evident in the merciless winds and twisted magic of the North...			"

												AirBuccaneers is an interesting PvP game that I havent played before. It takes place in aerial combat where both teams work to destroy the other teams ships. You do this by shooting cannons from your airship or trying to invade their airship, creating a feeling of being a pirate in the sky. You roam the skies freely on gliders as well, adding to the aerial craziness. The biggest issue is lack of community. I do not have much time because most times I log in, no servers have people in them. It is basically dead. It is F2P so it is worth a shot if you are willing to wait for the right time to play.			"

												The idea is pretty cool; buccaneers versus vikings. You pick either side and head for the sky with your airship.In the air you'll have to co-operate with your teammates; someone needs to steer the ship and another person fires its cannons. With the small ships it is possible to do both of the tasks on your own; but it's pretty hard.Ofcourse you could also just grab a kamikazi-baloon and steer it into the enemies' airship.The in-game combat system is pretty good. Cannons are slow and hard to aim, but their impact is devastating.It's also possible to board the enemies' ship, but you'll be at such a close range already that either ship will sink in seconds due to mutual cannonfire.If you manage to board the enemies' ship without it getting sunk, prepare for a chase and catch game.For a game released in december 2012, the details on the characters and ships are horrible. The maps themselves look okay, but are very limited in number.Overall it's a game that has potential, but it's not worth € 14.			"

												The game itself is quite fun. The major issue at the moment (late 2015) is that it is nearly dead. With a larger player community, which it once had, I would play it more.			"

												It is one hell of a lot of fun; it involves a bit of teamwork, navigating the ships so as to allow the crew to fire upon the enemy,  but there is a gleefull sense of insanity to the proceedings :)			"

												I remember playing this game back in the days when it was an Unreal Tournament mod! Mabye not as fast paced and exciting as Guns of Icarus, but on the other hand it's really chill and a nice game to play and just shoot the ♥♥♥♥ on voice chat without needing to worry too much.			"
