												This is a poorly balanced mashup of FTL-like exploration with HOMM-style turn-based combat.  It hides its incredibly unforgiving randomness behind the disclaimer of ""Roguelike,"" yet it provides little sense of progression or accomplishment.Grinding is the name of the game here.  You'll spend the first several hours fighting the same 3 enemy types - wolves, guardsmen and thieves - over and over as you run through the same scripted scenario over and over.  The environment becomes tiresome and repetitive very quickly.  The points of interests that you'll come across aren't interesting at all.  Most of them provide some a generic text description before presenting a single ""Search"" option.  They'll either provide loot or do damage to your party.The mechanics of combat are simple, and there is very little depth to the tactical nature of the combat.  This makes each run-through (and eventual death) flat and uninspiring.  I do not feel as though I have learned anything from that run-through which will aid me in the next.  I am left with the feeling that I merely ground out a little bit more xp to become numerically stronger, to get a little bit further when I play the same series of events and combats over again.The made-for-mobile interface is reasonably polished and makes this experience less painful than it could have been.The idea of FTL with turn-based party combat is a good one.  Unfortunately, this is not the game to do it justice.			"

												I wanted and tried to like the game, but it's too firmly up in the 'true hardcore only, no girls need to apply' treehouse, and not in a good way. I'm a big fan of roguelikes (both Dungeon Crawl, ToME and FTL, Spelunky variety) and have spent hundreds of hours on HoMM/King's Bounty series, so Crowntakers looked right up my tree. I like the art style and the stripped-down resource/inventory management/crafting systems work surprisingly well. Actually, it has all the groundwork needed for an excellent game. And then it kicks you in the balls and runs away.What do I mean? Well, for one, bosses tend to have gimmicks and gotchas. It means that you're unlikely to win a boss fight on the first go, because while you figure out what to do with him, you're probably lying down on the ground already anyway. So it's more Nethack than DC:SS.The choices you make in exploration seem to be mostly based on luck, like FTL. There's no way to know beforehand if you should observe the snails or dig the ground in a cave, so there's no risk/reward mechanism, just guessing and being punished or rewarded. At least now you have a vague idea of the threat level of random mobs on the map (but not story encounters or strength increases... until you've died and learned from this, because there might not be any way to recover from a mistake).In battles everything is dependent on keeping the main character alive (you can revive mercenaries, but once the main guy goes down it's Game Over), which makes you play the battles in a very conservative manner. Even if you have concentrated on building up nothing but health and dodge skills for the main guy, he can easily die in one or two turns (at least early on) if you've made the slightest error in the positioning. It is 'classic roguelike', but goes against everything that the genre has learned and moved towards to in the last decade. Especially in games with permadeath mechanic there has to be some way to ensure an error margin for the player, and one-shot death doesn't allow for it.I'm particularly frustrated, because there's lots to love in the game, but playing it makes me feel as if I'm in an abusive relationship. There is an easy mode, but it relies on grinding more than anything. The skill in the Crowntakers comes not so much in mastering its mechanics and making informed choices, but learning its patterns and 'gaming' the mechanics. I'm sure there are people who are into it, but I'll be looking forward to the developers' next game. They do show a lot of promise.			"

												If you want a medieval FTL then this game is fit for the job, but it doesn't excel at it. I'm going to break this down as simple as I can because there is a lot to chew.[Lazy Version] The sound is pleasing. It looks like an old disney cartoon. Characters are distinct but distinct enough to warrant more depth. The enemies are cool but lacking variety. On sale it's a yes, full price it's a maybe.  The sound is fantastic in this game. Not just the music but the way it softens when you're in a menu or how it changes tempo at the end of a battle. Something about it is just very pleasing to the ears. The music in each stage is also great without being so memorable that it gets repetitive.The visuals are very reminiscent of the days of VHS tape cartoons. Think disney's robin hood or the fox and the hound. So if you're into that sort of thing, there you go. Another thing to note is the way the map folds out in little hexagons as you travel. Whenever you go to click on something the hexagon pops up and back down with a little wooden thump. Like you're playing a game with miniatures.The characters are a little bland, which is disappointing. In FTL (my only real comparison to this game) you grew a little more attached to the hirelings. They were bland by design so you put a little something into them, but the mercenaries you use in this game are give distinct features and names. It just isn't early enough to warrant individuality. You only get a handful of them so the very least the designers could have done was give them a little flesh. Which isn't a huge problem until you think of longevity.The Combat is fun, but not as diverse as it could be. Each zone has different mobs, with their own abilities and such. By the time you figure one out and get the hang of it, you get to another zone and get rocked all over again. Which I love, it keeps you on your toes as you advance, but there is no mixing. Which seems odd for any unit based strategy game. It's not repetitive, at least as far as I've played, but it would make things a lot more interesting if it did. Other than that the combat is a chess match of positions and unit abilities and chaining attacks. If you love strategy you'll like the combat.I think that's enough information for anyone on the fence, so I'll stop there.			"

												So I have about 15 hours logged in this game. I've unlocked all of the characters, and all of their seperate loadouts. I did all of this on easy, which is the only game mode available to you until you beat the game once. This game is actually a lot of fun. I really enjoy a lot of aspects of it.  It does a good job of blending the resource managment that you find necessary in roguelikes with the meaningful strategic choices that are present in any good tactical RPG. The engine works pretty well, I've only had one freeze, and one sound bug. But it autosaves before every fight, so no crash is every too big of a deal.My biggest problem with this game is that it feels, mechanically and systemically, unbalanced. It seems to work at first glance, but the more you play it the more you find yourself consistently frustrated by stupid things.A perfect example of this is their equiptment upgrade paths. In the game, you upgrade your character's equptment by using upgrade materials (Iron->Steel->Gold for Weapons;Cloth->Leather->Gold for Armor). The upgrade itself doesn't add any stats to the equiptment, but rather adds a slot to it. That slot can be filled with a rune to grant various bonuses. The important thing to note here is that any upgrade is, by itself, useless. Without a rune, there is no reason to upgrade, These materials can be found in the world, or bought from the blacksmith. Now here's the thing: Each character you recruit into your party needs to start with iron before moving onto steel, but iron stop showing up in shops or the world around zone 3 of 8.  So unless you horde enough iron to upgrade all of your future recruits by the time you leave the third zone, you can never upgrade them. And this directly goes against what a good roguelike player would do. They wouldn't waste money (which is used to do pretty much everything in the game) on materials that they can't use for another 50% of the campaign. Its locking away valuble gold in useless assets.This is an EASY problem to fix. Just have certain events have an option to drop iron/cloth in later zones. Boom. Done. But this level of imbalance persists throughout the game across a lot of little mechanics.My other big concern is that the difference between 'easy' and 'norma' is the difference between night and day. The difficult jump is so large in fact, that it qualifies as a design flaw in my opinion. Not necessarily how hard it is, but the fact that you force the player to play easy mode, a lot, before unlocking normal, and then expose them, with no transition, to the insanely more difficult normal mode just seems silly. Not only that, but the differences between the two modes isn't actually explained. They mention that your characters will all start from level 1, and you are foced to fight the bosses at the end of each level, but that's just a small part of what makes it so different.The differences I've noticed are:Characters start from level 1Fewer rewards from battlesSignificantly faster enemy growthMust fight bossesMajority of objects in the world are now locked, and require a lockpickLockpicks no longer sold in storesRes scrolls no longer sold in storesMercenary selected is restricted to 2 ranom mercs selected from the roster of 9 at each tavern (biggest and most significant change after the level honestly)I am going to keep playing normal, but as of right now (especially considering how luck dependant the combat can feel sometimes) I fail to see how it's beatable.TL;DR REVIEW:Good game. Needs a few patches. Don't get excited about Normal mode though, just play and enjoy the mandatory Easy mode when its still beatable and fun.			"

												I liked this game until one of the tiles I moved to was a portal to DLC that I didn't have. In a game where you have a limited amount of time to balance exploring vs. getting to the end before your time runs out they wasted one of my turns to show me somewhere I couldn't go to push the DLC on me.

												This game is fun. It's challenging, you will die and start over again and again. But you keep all of your experience when you do, so it's not like you're starting over from scratch each time. Randomly generated levels keeps monotony out of the game and you can control how long you want to spend on each level. The gameplay makes you put a lot of thought into battle strategy, money/item management and character development.Each chacter class has unique skills and equipment management/upgrade is very simple. Gold can be hard to come by and to go along with the randomly generated levels, all merchandise and item pick-ups will be different every time. It's like starting a new hand of poker, you can get lucky or you can be screwed from the beginning.A good game to have for any lover of turn-based strategy games.			"

												First impressions - a thoroughly enjoyable hoot of a game. The gameplay is fluid and instinctive, the music is superb and even with only 40 mins of playtime under my belt, it's had me grinning several times with some wonderful humour. One thing, easy mode does NOT mean it's easy to beat.. easy to pick up the mechanics and play certainly, but a challenge to beat without a doubt. A brilliantly executed and fun game that I suspect will have me going back for ""one more try"" for many hours to come.One thing.. there has been a slight hiccup with the pre-order DLC that the devs have responded to and sorted with haste. Full marks :)			"

												The game feels very much like a mobile game, and a quick google says it is also coming for android and iOS. So it is not surprising. But unlike many mobile made games the PC version works well and the game itself is good fun if you liek the rogue-like genre. Tactical and challenging battles keep you on your toes as you try to advance through teh random gen maps. You will die allot as you leanr the ropes.  Gold is a little hard to find, and i seem to get lots of locked chests early game but then non once i get hold of lock picks, maybe a bug or I am just extremely unlucky. Put a couple of hours into the game first time out, time flew by which is always a good sign with a game, would definatly recommend for fellow rogue-like gamers.			"

												I can recommend Crowntakers on sale. It just doesn't have the longevity to justify the full price. Pros:- Turn-based combat on a hex grid. It functions as you'd expect and is largely entertaining. - Good aesthetic. Roguelites aren't always colorful or easy on the eyes, but this one certainly is. - Strong upgrade system. You can find some really cool stuff that has a huge impact on how you approach battles. This ties into a con below, unfortunately. Cons:- Not balanced. Drops and store items are randomized, but not remotely equal. What you get and when has a *huge* impact on the difficulty of the game. One item (the book of bluffing) allows you to skip almost all of the combat in the game and gets you out of nearly every negative random event. - No need to rush. The game claims enemies get stronger depending on how long you take, but after a deliberately slow playthrough, I am unconvinced. It does not seem to have a counter for taking your time and grinding powerful items. The attempt is giving you a ""bad"" victory if you take more than 18 days, but considering I won easily at 20 days making absolutely no effort to hit the deadline, I don't think it would be terribly difficult to reach the ""true"" ending with a similarly laid back approach.- Enemy AI is moronic. It targets your units without regard to the damage incurred from doing so, for which units are likely to die if attacked, or for setting up its own counterattacks. Enemies love to set up overwatch in areas you'll never enter or guard on their second turn for no reason at all. - Huge repetition of enemies. Ignoring bosses, there are all of 4 units in the royal army (of which I only saw 3 multiple times), 5 animals (3 recolors), and 2 alternate factions, both of which appear to only have one unit with minor variations. It's not enough to stay interesting over 7 areas. - Few interesting random events. Crowntakers is clearly inspired by FTL, but where that game had different events at nearly every stop, this game instead offers you the same choices at nearly all stops, and Search (2h) is almost always the right one. What events there are have often entirely unpredictable consequences and lead to fights or damage for no reason at all. The characters and items required for special choices are often unclear and are never shown unless you have them. Crowntakers is a great idea that unfortunately did not translate into a great game. My three hours played were enough to beat the game once and see *many* of the random events multiple times in spite of how rare it is to get one.			"

												There is no content here. Anyone that has some basic grasp on turn based tactics will understand every broad implication or nuance of gameplay in the first few hours. At some point, you meet theives. Every level with theives there are invisible enemies you cannot damage or expose from their invisibility and will just kill a member of your team.The only element of skill involved with this game is inventory management, picking complimentaty either or options for character level-up, and correct placement of units on the board.That is all there is here. I can't believe I paid 15$ for this. Please, don't make that mistake.			"

												Yes, the size and scope of this roguelike fantasy tactical FPG does feel a bit mobilely; however, it's full game with no pay-to-win hooks. The closet relative of which I'm aware is FTL in the sense that it's a game of multiple stages where the objective is to gather enough resources to beat the final boss, and most of the time (even on the Easy setting) you will not be able to do so because of the RNG. I defeated Easy in about 20 hours, and took about 8 attempts to do so once the other stage bosses were clear and I am thoroughly lame. (For instance, I did not even realize in over 8 hours of play that you could at any time in battle select of any your characters to use the next action point in a turn, and, thus, was limiting myself to the random order that the characters were selected by the game.) Each of the 9 available characters has two unlockable forms (each with one unique skill) in additional to its starting form, and so it's worth paying attention to what it takes to unlock the additional forms as you work through Easy, because otherwise you will probably have to grind a bit on Easy to do so. The additional forms are not necessary but do add variety to the available tactics.Normal is much more challenging, and I cannot imagine with my poor play skills the kind of luck that it would take for me to beat it. The bosses reset in every run on Normal, and every character starts from level 1, and so experience and food become much more relevant resources. Like Nethack, it's a fun challenge even if you have no resonable expectation of ever defeating it. It's quite a bit simpler and shorter than Nethack. (No item testing required in this game: once you know what an item does, it will do the same thing in all games and so you can safely sell the 4 poison kinds of muchrooms, for instance, once you know which they are.) You can easiliy get through even a comparatively succesful run attempt in less than 2 hours. I thoroughly enjoy this game.			"

												Lets just get this outa the way, first 15 mins of playing I run into an in game sales pitch to buy a DLC.  Having wasted my time & turns to get to a dead-end just to be hit up to buy the DLC to proceed further, in an already small content game, is F*CKED...however I was liking the rest of the game so far so decided to keep playing.Bottom line...This game is yet, another un-balanced example of what could have been a good game.  Woulda, coulda, shoulda sums this game up.  At first this game seems really good all around...on the surface.  Then you play for 1-2 hours & you start to see how unfinished this game is as far as game mechanics & balancing goes, like they didnt have enough testing or didnt care enough to make the needed changes that have already been mentioned in other negative reviews here.  I wont re-hash what some others have said.  Just take my word on it from a long time gamer & do yourself a favor & take the time to do some research & look at some of the other top rated negative reviews, as some of them sum up very nicely & succinctly, why this game deserves a negative review.  Really is a shame, cuz yes, to this games credit, it does a lot of things right...but in the end, the balancing issues are just too much & pretty much make the things it does do right, pointless.DEV, if you even bother to read through these reviews & LISTEN to your customers, take to heart what some of the nay-sayers are saying about your game.  Youve got a great game at its foundation...but you really need to tweak & redo some fundamental core game-play mechanics.  The people that like what you have here but cant stand the unbalanced game play will thank you.  And so will your bank account...& take that God-forbidden DLC sales pitch out of your game.			"

												I really wanted to like this game, but the reality is that while there are some good concepts here, it's really quite an annoying piece of a rogue-like RPG.The good:1. Once you unlock them, your hero and any mercenaries you hire have up to 3 different possible configurations to start with2. The graphics are charming3. The equipment upgrade system is interesting to a certain point4. The combat system is quite good to a certain point...The bad:1. The game is an incremental upgrade system that basically means it's impossible to finish it on at least the first several attempts.  I finally managed to beat it on easy after about 5 or 6 run throughs - but only because you and your mercs can keep your experience points between restarts.  I can't even contemplate how it would be possible to defeat this game on Normal, where you and the mercs all start at level 1!2. The combat can be brutally difficult, with some of the encounters you face nigh on impossible - with mobs often doing absolutely impossible stuff that your characters cannot do.3. The sheer randomness of most encounters where you just don't know if a choice is going to give you something positive, negative or otherwise.4. Random combat starting positions, often meaning that you're caught spread out with enemies all around you and no way to get into a defensive postion.			"

												Mind you, this is a relatively gentle not recommend. The game does have several positive sides - it's rather pretty, and contains a variety of characters to play with, but I feel that it fails as a roguelike. gameplay is quite repetitive - there aren't a lot of interesting decisions to be had on the map, and the tactical combat isn't very interesting. Most enemies operate almost the same, and those that don't do it by breaking one of the rules of the game, instead of building on top of the ruleset. It feels like the rules and limitations of combat apply more on the player than on the enemies, which a. rather limits the ability to plan ahead and b. gives a feeling of an unfair challenge. This becomes worse when you think about the randomness of game - the strategic map feels samey, while the random locations at the beginning of combat can really screw you up.Add to that the fact that the game is somewhat obscure in it's mechanics, takes a significant amount of time and effort before the player has a full party, and I just don't feel like it's a recommended game.

												A light rogue-like runs the risk of being too shallow for some while still scaring others with its depth. Crowntakers is a splended little game that serves up randomised battles across 10 over world maps in your quest to take the titular crown. The art is fantastic, the sound is great, the game plays very well. The enemies are fairly smart and even easier fights usually have some intregue. This game does not deserve to have tons of down-tumbs reviews. It's a really solid game and if you like these types of games like I do, you will really love it.			"

												What a gem! Crowntakers is straight up 7/10 in its genre. I bought the game for during 25% off sale, and I must say I wasnt disappointed. On average you would probably spend about 10 hours in game anyway.Pretty graphics and somewhat easy to understand game mechanics take you in pretty quickly. It takes about 15 minutes to understand how to fight and not lose and maybe about an hour that there are actually ways to beat the game in efficient way. All comes down to how random this game is, your strategy will depend on it and it will eventually decide the outcome at the end. Fighting mechanics are very easy to understand. Game mechanics are pretty simple too, all you need to worry about is how many turns you have left. Now, I have actually never finished a game in normal mode ( it was actually called hard before) and only won ( saved the king) on easy. Modes are not so different, but on normal you can only rely on yourself, you can hardly build strategy on the go, unless you get very lucky. Yes, a lot in this game comes down to how you will get lucky or unlucky with the choice of items, skills or mercenaries. The sound is really well made. Very simple music fits the game just right. I will not spoil you experience. Other sound effects good too, everything makes the sound its supposed to make. Graphics are simple yet very attractive. I am not sure if this game was ever on a tablet, but that is the kind of graphics is has. Simple and effective and everyone can run it on their low end computer. What else do you need from a game like this? Now, what really has me going is how random this can be. I understand that is a part of the game, but boy does it make me mad sometimes. You will be enraged on occasions when things just do go your way. Fighting can be annoying too, you will be misclicking quite a lot and that might cost you dearly. Oh, and no saves, you die - you lose! The game has some basic story with its plot twist at the end, but thats about it. You dont expect a story from a board game do you? This is just the same. In the end, this game is worth buying almost at a full price. Replayablility is high as every character has 3 different sets of abilities. The game is not extremely addictive, but you would not expect that. This game will let you do simple strategy moves and relax at the same time. If you are up for challenge in both game and yourself, then this game is for you.			"

Tactics around hero abilities start fleshing out as you work your hero to 10 and unlock mercs.

												Overall, this is a fun little game. The graphics and interface are colorful and sleek. The music and sound effects are good. The gameplay is easy to pick up but more difficult to master. The battles can be challenging - in a good way - and require a some thinking and strategy to maximize your hero and mercenaries' abilities.  You also have to very carefully manage your resources, mainly gold, to upgrade your units effectively.As far as down sides go, the game feels like it was developed for mobile platforms. Content-wise, It feels shallow for the pricepoint ($15). Even though the levels are randomly generated, every time I died and restarted I still felt like I was playing the exact same level. There isn't much variety even if the grid is arranged differently. I would suggest picking it up on sale unless you have cash burning a hole in your pocket. That being said, I paid full price and don't regret it.			"

												Can't say I reccommend this game at full price. It's relatively short and while it's a rogue-like game and has lots of variability in the instances and a very enjoyable enviorment, it lacks variety in combat, which is the  main focus of the game. thus losing replay value pretty quickly.I love the environment of the game, the tiles flipping over, revealing the surroundings as you move along the roads is fun and the music is pleasant, but the exploration of encounters like the hovels, caves and watch towers that you can come across aren't particularly deep, most of the time you only have one or two choices, so theres no deeper pull into the story through the use of the enviorment.The combat is also super frustrating. there is no set-up phase in the game so your characters are tossed around on the field seemingly willy nilly. I can't tell you the number of times I've lost my archers because they were placed next to one or two enemy units and they were slaughtered before I could move them away or kill the units surrounding them because my melee units got placed in some random place on the far side of the map.Inspite of these things I've replayed this game many times and still enjoy it every now and then when I go back to play it. It's amusing and if it's on sale for 5-6 bucks it's a good five or six hour game to fill your time.			"

												A quirky little Roguelike that reminds me quite alot of FTL in the sense that the world map is random with nodes while you go through 'sectors' to build up your party of heroes. Though no where as deep as FTL (at least not yet!) It can be fun and addicting to do hexbased tactical combat. A bit like Final Fantasy Tactics Lite. Though if I had some complaints of the game it would be Bugs, Price and Depth. ( Launch of the game puts you in a stuck screen, relaunch it.). The price of 15$ is a bit steep for what the game gives you. The Pit costs 13, FTL 9, Issac relaunch 15.  Unless you are a fan of roguelikes and already have those or really want a medieval game those might be better buys for the price at the present time			"

												Crowntakers is a pretty damn good game. It’s quite difficult, even for a rogue-like, and will definitely challenge you. Even playing through on easy can be fairly tough depending on your luck.The art style is really nice, and definitely suits the game itself, which is always a good thing. The gameplay is certainly interesting - it’s a fair bit of fun and does take some learning. There is no tutorial so you have to learn the game for yourself, which personally, in a game like this, I think was a good thing, particularly since it’s not overly complicated and I did enjoy working things out. The combat system is well thought out and quite easy to understand, but does have some little intricacies to it, such as the opportunity mechanic. Also, it’s clear what you’re doing before you do it, so you can’t really blame the game if you screw up, particularly when it comes to combat, which is certainly important in any rogue-like. (for example, the game displays whether you are at risk of taking damage from opportunity strikes, while also clearly displaying things like directions units can hit, where you need to be to backstab etc. It also shows if a ranged unit will be able to attack a certain unit from a new position before you move it – something not enough games get right).The levelling up and equipment systems complement each other nicely and would allow for a variety of possible builds for a character. The rune system is a really cool idea – when you upgrade equipment instead of getting just a flat bonus you get spots for runes which give things like crit or dodge chance, lower cooldowns or armor. It combos nicely with the stats you can pick when you level up, giving you a degree of freedom when it comes to So, while normal mode will certainly be the favourite of all of the hardcore rogue-like fans, I think the easy difficulty is a welcome addition, since this game is very hard, and letting you keep that little bit of progress really does give you that motivation to keep trying, because you get a little bit closer to winning every time. It also means newer players who may not be particularly experience with rogue-likes aren’t just thrown into the deep end and scared off by the difficulty.If you are looking for a short video to show you what the game is, here’s a 2 minute one:

												An underrated little turn-based strategy rogue-lite, don't be fooled by my low in-game time, I've sunk serious hours into this game on iPad and enjoyed it so much I got it for Steam too. Pros:- Loads of replayability, like FTL it takes many, many playthroughs to come across all the game's many events and unlock everything.- Decent customisation, once unlocked, you can choose between three different versions of each merc, plus dozens of runes, you can come up with some pretty satisfying combos.- Battles are fun and challenging, boss fights are still tricky even once you know the best approach.- Great soundtrack, medieval but catchy!- Solid art style.Cons:- Story's a bit meh, it does the job of framing what you're doing and paints a nice picture, but don't expect to care about the characters or world much.- The audio suffers from bugs, occassionally the music will cut out, leaving eerie ambient noise, other times it plays two pieces at once, very annoying and the fantastic soundtrack deserves better.- Once you realise the timer doesn't really effect the gameplay, and the ending even less, it becomes irrelevant and can be ignored, which is a shame as it could've added another dimension to the gameplay.- Depending where you are on the learning curve and what the game throws at you, can be too hard or too easy, thankfully the game's enjoyable enough to keep playing either way.Lastly, not to write off anyone's review, but it's worth bearing in mind that the game received a hefty rebalance a few months ago and in my view made it work a lot better, so post-June 9th reviews may reflect the current game experience better.

												This is a fun little game. It feels a lot like a strategy game you might play on an iPad -- not too deep, but enjoyable nonetheless. Superficially, it seems like a mashup of FTL and something like King's Bounty. If you're looking for a casual rogue-lite, you could do worse than Crowntakers (though I'd recommend waiting for the price to drop below $10).			"

												Crowntakers is a fun different kind of rogue-like. They have provided some updates improving the stealthed thieves and other issues I raised in my review earlier.The combat is fun and fast with plenty of strategic choices to make. It could use more enemy unit types and some new hero classes. Its a rogue like with a randomly generated world but It still feels a little small. Worth playing! Solid turn based strategy game that blends rogue-like mechanics with SRPG.			"

												Crowntakers is a a casual, colorful tactical turn based game.  I thought I would give it a try...and was really surprised by how many great game design choices the developers made! Examples of great game design:+ Every map is randomized - not only the map layout, but also your units' positions!  + The fight is not going well and you're in a bind.  Do you use potions now or save them for a later fight?  + Mercenaries have different abilities, and choosing which mercs to use (and their variant skills) and building combos make it fun and replayable+ Normal is quite difficult, so the ability to carry over experience after defeat in Easy mode is a great option.  (I was able to beat the game in my 2nd easy playthrough, but it was close!)+ Runes for your fighters have good variety - enough to make choosing which merc gets which runes important for battles.+ A new merc can be unlocked with each playthrough, which incentivizes playing it again and again, even if you've won already (winning one time through might only take 3-4 hours)+ Your hero and each merc have unlockable skills. To unlock them you have to do perform various feats with each hero, which incentivizes you to change your tactics each playthrough.+ On the main map, at each cave/house/roundtower/etc, you can only choose to perform one action out of 2-5 options. Once you've done the action, you have to live with your choice!  On the next playthrough, you can choose differently...+ There is a trade-off between spending time searching all the houses, caves, etc, and progressing through the map.  Every night it says ""another night has past, your enemies have gotten stronger"".  It's another design element to force the user to choose a strategy.+ The user interface, menus and buttons have a good layout and are pretty intuitive.+ The encounter stories are entertaining.  They are short vignettes, entirely appropriate for the casual theme.Overall, very impressed with the design elements, as well as the bright colorful art.  I already want to play this developer's next game, too!			"

												Those who compare this game to FTL at all are mistaken.  FTL has way deeper strategic options.  This game is simplistic in concept and it strategic depth.  That being said I played 1/2  dozon hours of it today and I enjoyed it.  My guess is that I need another <4 more hours to finish easy mode.  On that level of play I am satisfied with my purchase because it met the goal of a simple game I could play with my daughter and I taking turns driving.  For those who like turn based strategy... I would agree it feels more like a mobile game than a pc game.  It is worth a buy at <$8.00 USD.			"

												Being that this game is at this time catogorized as having mixed reviews, I feel I should contribute and improve the review pool.  I bought this game for less than ten dollars and have thoroughly enjoyed 41 hours of it.  I felt it was well worth the money and is actually one of the better games in my 200+ game library.I love roguelikes.  I love FTL.  I love trying to survive random acts of AI cruelty, to beat the odds, to bring things down to situations where if I miss I am dead.  Forever.  Until I just restart a fresh try.  I also love fantasy, and being dissapointed with my Eador bug filled experience, am glad to finally have a satisfying fantasy The-Computer-Hates-You-Deal-With-It game.  If all of this sounds as apealing to you as it is to me, buy this game.  You will love it.  If not, there is an easy mode where your starting characters grow in power every time you play with them.

												Short but pleasant game.You play as a hero on a quest to save his father. Story speaks for itself. It's simple and generic but with a twist.On the map you go from place to place, looting, fighting, crafting and visiting taverns.The combat is fairly straight forwards. You move, attack, repeat. Skills, backstabs, guards, potions. All what you would expect from a game like this.The longer you take to get to the end, the harder the enemy gets though. And each zone has a boss...You recruit characters through quests and taverns. There's more than plenty to validate multiple playthroughs.They level, get new skills, upgraded gear, items, etc. As far as I can tell, they each are unique.There's an archer, a pikeman, a tank, a druid, a crossbowman, etc etc.Worth picking up for a small price. I enjoyed it and kept coming back untill I finished it.>>Approved<<			"

												Its pretty fun in short bursts. Just a simple turn based Roguelike with some persistent stats in the starting game mode. The graphics are neat, the art style reminds me of an older Disney cartoon movie, like the Sword in the Stone. The music is appropriate kind of cheerful fantasy style. The controls are entirely mouse driven, and easy to use. It has an option for a controller, but I cant get it to work, and I have no idea why you'd use a controller for this game. Trust me, I have a physical disability, and have to use a controller for most M&K based games that rely on realtime keyboard for movement and mouse for options/looking around. I'd be the first to be asking for controller support if the game needed it. This one doesn't, but has it.The full review:The help files suck and I still dont know what all those symbols with the hand and arrow on the right hand side does (Hold in inventory, give to someone, drop?)Theres not to much in the way of deep tactics, but its entertaining. Basically, you move around a hex board. You choose the direction you go, and then you walk to the next crossroads. Sometimes theres a place you can interact with (search a cottage, visit a merchant or blacksmith, an inn, cave , a fight ect). Random events happen at these places. Usually searching for small items, but other things such as HP or gold gain/loss, or nothing at all The blacksmith and inn are used to improve your weapon/armor, buy things, rest and buy food, hire mercenaries. To improve your weapons you need to buy or loot a certain item shown in your inventory screen then take that item to the blacksmith and pay a fee. The item is upgraded. Then you take armor/weapon runes and put them in the slots you get from upgrading. The runes have different effects, and are swappable but only armor runes work with armor and vice versa. Mercenaries are the people you hire at the inn to help you fight. They can gain XP and some of their their XP is persistant even after you die. So they get better and better as you go. Every mercenary is slightly different. I have found an archer and a fighter. Each character has 2 special skills they can use to help them in battle, and they are all different for each mercenary that Ive found so far.There is a day/night cycle and after every 24 hours (shown in the lower left corner) the enemies get stronger a bit. So you have to balance searching everything and getting to the end of the map. The maps are random for each playthrough, so you dont know where everythings going to be. Fighting is done on a turn based hex grid. Its simple. Move, attack, and choose facing. The arrow that is yellow instead of red is the chars back. Backstabbing does extra damage so facing matters. There is permadeath, so when the hero dies, you have to start again. Your mercenaries keep their XP (depending on gameplay mode), though, so its not like everythings completely lost.  Seems like itd be really fun on a phone if I was stuck waiting for something. I dont do the phone-as-gaming-device thing though.			"

												After reading some of the other reviews, I decided to post my opinion. Why this game is good:-Mechanics that are easy to understand but can be used in creative and various ways.-The art, music, and tone of the game is consistent and engaging.-The combat requires actual elements of strategy (considering your opponents move, your position, your resources)                 -on this note, the majority of bosses are a pleasure (a frustrating pleasure) to fight.-The random events can be interesting at times-Each play through has a good amount of varietyWhere the game falls short-The random events don't have much variety             -most of them are search and most of the time you'll get stuff, sometimes you'll get hurt-RNG sometimes doesn't make sense (Ex. a chest in the first area, but no possible way to have/get a lockpick)-While very interesting, playing through the whole campaign felt too shortNeutral points-RNG is RNG: while I have been rekt by it on occasion, sometimes its forgiving. It wouldn't be ""RNG"" if it were ""balanced"", RNG implies randomness which is not solely dependent on ""fairness"" ( you can flip a coin 50 times and get 50 heads).That being said, if there were ever a Crowntakers2 or DLC to extend the campaign (or institute a new one) I would buy it. -I also feel like this game could have an interesting multiplayer mode if developed.-Feels short, but then again theres a lot of content that justifies the $15 price tagRegarding some of the individual grievances against the game:Firstly, saying that this game is meant for you to fail before you succeed is incorrect.While this seems like the case in easy mode, easy mode is more of a way for you to learn and understand the true nature of the mechanics, specifically how the mercenaries work together and their individual skills. You can do a lot by combining the different skills of the mercenaries in different conformations. Another key aspect of this game is that it has a lot to do with positioning in combat. Often, people don't understand this and charge in meaninglessly. This difficulty isn't manufactured, it is intrinsic in the games design. Thinking of how you will position yourself for the enemy's phase is often more challenging than deciding what moves you want to make on your turn (which also is considerably difficult). Also, fighting thieves work on the former mechanic much more than the latter (and you can definitely win without losing anyone). While you will likely die because of your incorrect choices and on part because of the RNG, it is ultimately up to you to consider which choices are risky and which aren't. All that being said, it is entirely possible for you to succeed on the first playthrough if you fully understand the games mechanics and strategy. I won't say its likely, but it was designed so that you can progress (from level 1) all the way to the castle in one sitting, because normal mode is beatable. The game is not grinding based (once again, because normal mode is a thing) although you will need to if you want to unlock some of the different mercenary stages (which have no impact on your ability to beat the game, just your method of beating it).I'm not gonna address the QQ ""errybody conters cept me"" responses when the game hasn't been played for more than a couple hours.

												I was really pleasantly surprised by this game.  It's got a lot of charm, everything is really well polished, and it's decently challenging without being too punishing.  I'm a big fan of rogue-lites and tactical strategy games and this does both portions justice, although with only a moderate amount of depth.  Think of it as a really well-done, casual-minded rogue-lite.  8/10Starting off can be a bit rough, but once you unlock some of the 'good' characters, like the scout, the game becomes much, much easier.  Also 'easy' mode is the way to go while you're getting a hang of the game and still unlocking.  A lot of the problems I had in the beginning were from rushing and not exploring, thinking the time pressure element was more important than it actually is.  Unfortunately, once you get the hang of it, it's a bit too easy.  And if you get the DLC, the game is also substantially easier, but does have more 'fun' content.Combat is the major portion of the game and I'm glad to say it does it quite well.  Certain mercs synergize quite nicely.  The map is never 'too big' and almost always fits entirely on the screen.  You always start first, but don't get to choose positioning, which is a fair enough tradeoff.  Most battles will be over in a few rounds.  Only the bigger boss battles stretch out and try your resources and resourcefulness.  Stun is a bit overpowered, which makes the barbarian maps a bit of a pain, but there are multiple options for avoiding fights, so it's by no means a gamebreaker.There's a good number of 'fun things' like unlocks and achievements to keep you playing after you've won once.  A single run can last a few hours if you explore all the nooks and crannies.  I'm hoping they release some more DLC with an extended challenge.  Overall, it's a really fun game that I'd totally recommend for a weekend romp.  That said, $15 is a bit much, but during seasonal sales, it goes for much, much less making it an insta-buy.			"

												Undeniable Greatness,I must say, this game has been one of the top new games I have played this year. It took me several hour filled days to complete it on normal. Being a lot of fun and exceptionally challenging, this title was well worth the ride at every turn. It may not be perfect, but it is close. It has that old school edge where the game doesn't provide you with out of game information about its parts and you must simply test them out as you go and memorize them for the next attempt. It stands strong on a solid bug free environment. It has an obvious beginning, middle and end game, which you can plainly see by way of the map.You cannot get lost even though each stage is revealed as you go. It is mildly reminiscent of FTL in the way you progress and unlock content, play and replay, Feel when you have finally won for the first time on normal difficulty. Which, lets be honest, is all good…I did find the randomness in the loot drops to be strange at times when you are left holding tier 3 upgrades while no tier 2 upgrades drop. I think that the loot drop & shop inventory randomness may need a slight tweak here and there.I did find that the game could have benefitted from a greater variety of enemies with a wider range of special moves. I remember fighting wolves, thieves,  knights, & barbarians. Their may have been others but I honestly don't remember them right now. Even the boss battles, I wish had more variety on their moves and your options to win them. While fun and with much replay value already in the base game, I am very much looking forward to buying the DLC and playing through that as well.I truly hope they create a sequel to this game that is much longer and that has a wider variety of everything. Overall this game truly delivered a fun & challenging ride. I would surely recommend it to my friends and have already. I hope they move on a sequel right away and that it is simply put ""A larger cast of characters & enemies"", ""A longer less linear journey"", ""Less blindly randomized loot and more space to carry it all"" I would love to spend a lot more time in this game. I hope to see a larger and longer more content filled sequel very soon!  "

												[Spoiler-Free Review]Crowntakers aims to usurp your playtime with accessible, character-based, combat on a grid. While certain elements leave something to be desired, ultimately, it's a game better than the sum of its parts.Characters and game mechanics make the game.You start out with a single hero, and gradually recruit mercenaries you meet in your travels (up to four extras per run). The mercenaries come with skills unique to them, and part of the fun is figuring out their strengths/weaknesses. In addition, each character comes with additional unlockable archetypes (i.e. skillsets), something I really appreciated. It made for fun rewards, a reason to use characters you wouldn’t naturally be inclined to, and gave everyone the potential to become useful where their default skills might be lacking.The storyline is extremely light and just barely passable...I get that the game is more about proper resource management, the challenges you overcome, and the people you meet along your adventure, but a narrative consisting of two basic strings of storyline text (intro and finale), doesn't leave a whole lot of room for extrapolation. The story doesn't incentivize the player or encourage you to replay the adventure, it doesn't even help develop character.  It’s, summarily, placeholder text for a better story not yet conceived. Thankfully it’s also skippable (for the most part). Even the bits that come up when you investigate a new location are easily ignored, as the choices are basically, 'You wanna fight, or not?' (the answer is yes btw, always yes, and you don’t need to read through a snippet about an old woman begging for food to know it).Short in length, but highly replayableA typical run takes about an hour or so to complete (once you understand how everything works), and you will be required to run through the game more than once to unlock achievements and mercenaries. Where the story was lacking, the achievements are not, and provide ample reason to go back and play through the game over and over again.Rogue-light, an easy mode that actually works.Start with Easy Mode if you want to give yourself the best chance at enjoying this game. It’s a welcome entry point to the game mechanics and world. You play through the story the same way you would in Normal Mode, but with the added advantage that you don't lose experience and levels gained in each run. Failure never feels quite so devastating when you know your characters are going to retain their stats (for the most part) in subsequent attempts. By the time you’ve completed your Easy run, you’ll be more than ready for Normal. In either mode, the only thing poking and prodding you to go forward is that enemies grow stronger by the in-game day.Exploration and Battles remain fun.Collecting items and equipment, and taking on enemy mobs are rewarding experiences. The danger in a game so focused though, is that the game can become monotonous if the formula isn’t changed all that much from start to finish. Having special elements based around each area helps remedy this to a point, instead of fighting soldiers and thieves at every turn, some areas house natural threats/inhabitants and mysterious landmarks.The storybook art style works marvellously for a game like this.Exploring the map is enjoyable. Areas (in and out of battle) are vibrant and interesting. Each area has a unique look to it, and the contrast between them helps keep the game feeling fresh.The soundtrack is an argument for quality vs quantity.In a game you're likely to spend a considerable amount of time playing and replaying, 2-3 songs isn't really going to suffice. The tracks are good, and melt into the backdrop as you play, but even the best song is going to feel repetitive if it's the sole musical leg on which a game stands. The sound effects are satisfying though, my favourite being the sucking sound your cursor makes when hovering over items in your inventory.The world is always changing… I think.I can't tell whether the maps are randomized. I've played through the game 4 or 5 times across each of the difficulties and each time, the maps kind of mesh together in my mind. It's not that it's overly samey, it’s just not immediately clear to me how the maps are differentiated. It could just be a by-product of the fog-of-war and the small scope of each area. However, it might be saying something that the random world doesn’t feel very random.Final Thoughts.If I was to sum this game up in a word, it'd be barebones. Crowntakers is entertaining however, and I don't feel bad in recommending it to anyone. I just hope the devs continue to expand the offering. This game really deserves it.			"

												Very fun rogue-lite with lots of randomisation to keep each playthrough fresh. The difficulty (which a lot of the negative reviews seem to come from) is around FTL level, there is an easy mode which is rather easy, and a normal mode, where the actual challenge lies. Actually beating it on normal requires some skill, but also some luck. If you don't like chance and randomness, this isn't the game for you, but if you enjoy high replayablity and don't get angry if you can't beat the game on your first few tries, then you should check it out.Update: Turns out the game gets rather easy once you've figured it out. I can beat it almost every run on normal now, which is slightly disappointing and I wish there was a hard mode or something. I still have a lot of stuff to unlock and I'm still having fun, but the game itself not posing a challenge anymore isn't perfect for a rogue-lite.			"

												I accidentally lost an entire Saturday to this game. It's a strategy rogue-like with experience gain that persists for each character every playthrough (and each playthrough is just long enough). None of the characters you find as you continually play the game feel the overpowered OR the same.You are going to get a lot of mileage from the game for the price. I heartily recommend it.			"

												Reviews of the game say it is grindy and harder than FTL.However I thourougly enjoy the game and rarely loose on normal difficulty (where you start from scratch). In fact I find it easier than FTL and try to see how ridiculously overpowered I can get by the end of the party.To me it was a very enjoyable tactical rpg.			"

												To be fair I've only done one game - Crowntakers is a randomly-generated board/rogue-like game.Each session can take roughly 45+ minutes to complete. You're given a main goal, from the start, similar to The Witcherboard game and can take as much time as you want exploring until you feel you've leveled up your party enough to face the final battle. However the longer you take the monsters grow stronger with each turn and resources like rest spots and health potions diminish.From the start you can option to play Iron Man or carry over leveled-up characters into your next game. Frankly I think leveled characters would make each subsequent play through too easy and mundane - it is nice to have the option there however.I know this has had some other sour reviews but I found the game to very polished and appreciate it simply because this concept hasn't been explored often enough in prior years.Unfortunately all events within the main game itself have been done countless times before but CT features solid programming effort never-the-less.I paid $10 for the main game along with Necromancer DLC. I would pay as much as $12.50 for the combo.			"

												A wonderful streamlined spin on squad tactics, with simple-but-deep RPG elements and a roguelikelike philosophy.  Plus, terrific cartoon art.My only small gripe is how they integrated the DLC, which can cause you to waste moves if you don't own it.  But this is only likely to happen a few times until you learn what to watch out for.This was probably my overall favorite game for a couple of weeks in the early winter of 2015.

												Game is small fun for those who shun long adventures and seek shorter treks, or some change. For my taste, game's too short, yet I enjoy it. Archievements give some challenge, and without those, I would have got bored with this game in no time. With some experience with tactics, this game is easy once you learn how things work. But many random factors create challenge every time. This game aint too easy to begin with, however: I tried to start with normal difficulty, and got my butt handed back to me twice in a row, before I swallowed my pride and switched to easy difficulty. Especially with DLC, inventory gets painfully small. Game is still being polished, meaning that devs haven't abandoned it yet, so there's hope that few bugs here and there may get fixed eventually. Maybe even new DLC may appear some day? Current DLC expands the game a bit (one new optional map, one new character, new items to clutter your already small inventory), so it's nothing like a mere overpriced texture. Game has autosaving, so if you have to alt+f4/cmd+q out of the game during a battle (have done that twice due to a bug), you don't lose your adventure.I recommend this game.			"

												What an absolutely delightful game!The sound and artstyle are positively gorgeous and a superb fit for each other.Exploration is swift yet exciting, every stop can bring something good or bad and deciding what to do is a great part of the gameplay. As is deciding how to spend your gold as upgrades are very important and you can feel a real difference on each weapon or armour upgrade as well as potions in battle. Getting a hold of runes or rarer artifacts that boost your characters in different ways are a real treat too!Combat is great fun. It is also swift but has lots of depth. You really feel good whenever you dodge and counterattack an enemy. And having Halfarus the Archer on overwatch and snipe approaching foes from atop his tower is fantastic.With awesome design features like getting an action point back when killing a foe, you can do some spectacular moves if you strategize well.I'd say the difficulty scales well and the Mercenaries getting powerful along the way with even more to be unlocked makes for great replayability.I was very surprised as to how much i like this game and i heartily recommend it.

												Crowntakers is a fantastic roguelike.- Great gameplay. Very strategic, with interesting ideas and a refreshing originality, and with lots of variety.- Good music.- Very nice drawings and animations.- Funny and original characters.- Gives a real thirst for unlocking new content.- Several secrets that are pretty hard to find.I only wish it was longer. After 21 hours or playing, I feel like I have explored most of the game. There are still a few things to do, but I don't have any more content to unlock. I really, really would like it if the devs created additional content for the game, but I guess it wont happen - last update was two years ago. Don't get me wrong: the game is very good, and there are no problems with it. I just want MORE.I definitely recommend this game. It deserves to be successful. "

												An easy game to pickup and play for an hour or two -- great if you have limited time to learn and play a game.I bought this awhile ago, but never got into it until now.  There are four ways you ""level up"":1) Level up the characters -- you'll adjust one stat each level.  Really, relatively minor impact2) Level up weapon, armor and ring so you can add runes.  Beware, leveling the weapon has no effect until you add the runes.  3) Use of potions and buffs liberally.  Don't worry, they replenish quickly if you search a lot.  Huge impact4) Adding additional characters each time you advance a step.  Party goes from 1 to 2 to 3 to 4 etc.What I've been doing is taking it slow at the beginning, doing a lot of searching and leveling of equipment.  Then, when my backpack is relatively full, I start speeding ahead, using as many potions as I need to until the backpack has room again.For me, the skill is using the potions and buffs available to defeat the enemies at hand, hopefully with no damage to your characters.  You'll probably want to have the range characters with lots of critical damage and the tank/melee characters with extra armor which protects them from all hp damage until all amor is removed, one hit at a time.Read the combat tips.  I was surprised to discover that making a killing blow gives an additional action point, which can mean a ranged character can have 7 or 8 turns in succession if you are careful.  Backstab is 100% accurate and critical.  (Critcal is total strength plus 1 damage.)  Also , no heal on leveling.  Most healing has to be done with items.  Resting is its own mechanic, and if you don't rest, your strength (and therefore damage) can be down as much as 67% for some characters.Very simple rules, but you can't make any progress unless you read the rules carefully.Ironically, I have been playing on normal, (which means you start from zero on each restart rather than accumulating experience for each play-through), and this helped me figure out the game.Great little game.(I do agree that the DLC promotion should not be on the map or at least the moves refunded if you take the path by accident.)

												Masters the feel of the rogue-like genre while incorporating unconventionally refreshing cartoon-like graphics.Unfortunately it freezes about once an hour, always in response to a click. Sometimes it's when I click on a button in a location, like the button to go to the next land and the dialog never disappears and the game is frozen. Other times it's in battle, usually right after I click to choose a direction to face. Thankfully, the game auto-saves my progress so aside from the combat I may have been in, I can just hop back into the game.			"

												Let's see...how does the game go? Die, die, die, die, die, die, die. The end. No, I'm not very good at this game and that's the rub. I understand what Crowntakers is trying to do. It's trying to be a cute, short, rogue-like game. I just think it doesn't pull it off very well. I've played many rogue-likes and either this game is obtuse or the difficulty needs to be adjusted because it seems to be the same old thing. I get through the first map OK. I died probably 10+ times on the second until I cleared the Wolf boss. The third map? Not a chance nor do I see how it's even possible. The map is filled with enemies that literally just appear on the battlefield and stab you for a couple of points of damage before you can act. That might not sound like much but when you only have 7 HP to start, a couple of hits like that and the game is over because I almost NEVER find anything to heal with. So where's the fun? I don't even see how it's possible to win and that's where the game breaks for me. A good roguelike holds out hope of winning next time if things just go your way a little bit better. After an hour and a half, I don't see any opportunity to progress. Ok, I realize that sounds whiny. And I asked for help on the forums. The general responses were (from a very limited group of fans) along the lines of ""suck more noob"" and no developer response. That certainly didn't help my impressions of the product.That's too bad too. I find the art style cute and the music ok. I want to play in this world. But I'm not able to figure out the ""puzzle"" and repeatedly dying doesn't make for a good roguelike, it makes for a boring one. The real trick in crafting a game of this type is balance and I don't see it as being well balanced. Moreover, with very little variability from start to start the game quickly becomes tired and tedious. That's a fairly fatal flaw. In most roguelikes your next game is very different from the last one. In this one it's just another go at a very similar map. This isn't a recipe for fun. Given the large number of roguelikes out there, this one can be safely avoided. I paid about a buck fifty for the game and I didn't even get that much enjoyment out of it. YMMV.			"

												This game is HARD!But this game is also great fun, every playthrough, you get a completely different experience. Although the game is the same, the playthrough never is. Still, there is no real random factor in between different games: you won't get farther than before because of luck, no you will only get farther because you are getting better at it.Of course luck is also a factor, and I don't know how they did it but it's a very small factor imo.The negative? Maybe one: after one playthrough (haven't gotten past stage 3 yet) I don't want to try again. I need to stop the game, do something else, and later try again. Maybe that's just me.Otherwise: no negatives! Worth the money!			"

												This is a quite charming looking game but it's pretence to 'roguealike' status is less because that's a good idea here and more because the game isn't clever enough to guide the player.It's ""roguealike"" because you have NO idea how strong your enemies are and no way of exiting a fight which is clearly unwinnable.Money is limited but what's available to buy is also limited (and seemingly VERY random) - and some upgrades seem to be completely useless (I had a main character with a Level 3 weapon hitting for 1hp against enemies with over a dozen!!)It feels, after a couple of runs, that it will be a case of learning what to buy, who to recruit and relying a on bit of luck to get through some encounters/areas.  Game's should be cleverer than that - randomness and permadeath are not there to make-up for poor signposting and limiting player information.  They're used as a punishment for players who don't realise it's there.This is all compounded by the game including a help system but which only appears when it feels like it!?Overall it's just WAY too random and just a BIT too dependent on luck.Shame - there's a nice idea and it looks great - but gameplay-wise it's a box-of-rocks with an RNG attached to it.p.s. it also throws a ""this is DLC - you don't own it - do you want to buy it"" thing in your face within 1min of starting to play - which is a♥♥♥♥♥♥move...

												Short, nice-looking turn based game.    Maps, item drops, and combat starting positions are all random to drive the challenge.  Good run-thoughs can turn bad pretty quickly.  Replayability is good because you can mix the four helper mercenaries from a group of about 10.  Two game modes- first keeps hero and merc experience [rogue] and  second always starts them green.   Most interesting thing about this game is that it achieves a sliding degree of difficulty without just wrenching the enemy health/number.  If you play easy with fully leveled up heroes and take your time you should succeed about 90% of the time and get a weak ending to the story.  If you blitz through to get the fast ending using unleveled crew that success rate will drop to around 5%.			"

The maps may be instanced, but it doesn't take long to figure out where to head if you don't want to explore. I'm sure I'll come back to this title to unlock the final 2 mercenaries I haven't found.

												Great little rougelike, grab it on sale. Nothing annoyingly wrong with it, and a lot is satsifyingly right. The grid-based combat is built around a ""reset rampage"" mechanic that makes the battles fast-paced (and if you set up your ranged hero properly they can often wipe out a whole encounter in one turn). The upgrade system works really well and it gives you a lot of chances to find ridiculous synergies (infinite range crossbow guy gets a ""deal and take more damage"" buff, you're pretty much set for life with that). Only real problem is that the game doesn't tell you when your inventory is full (at which point you start dropping things) so you have to keep track of that manually.This is a short game (10 hours and I've beaten it twice, pretty sure I've seen everything outside of the DLC) but it's a neat experience so grab it on sale.

Haven't gotten past step four or five (yet).ProsGame is stable, and should play well on a wide range of computers.UI is clean, and interface is well designed.Animations are clean, if a bit slow.Gameplay is simple, but still requires strategy for each move, both inside and outside of combat.ConsEgg and Chicken items are not documented. Gameplay can be a grind at times.Even easy mode will kick your hiney.My RecommendationDefinitely get this if you are into strategy games with mild RPG elements to it. "

												A fun and challenging strategy RPG.  Crowntakers takes me back to Vandal Hearts and Shining Force.  These types of games have been left behind, but I could play them over and over again.  And that's just what Crowntakers asks us to do... play over and over again.  The difficulty is brutal in the beginning.  Only through successive play-throughs will your party gain the ability to conquer.If you like the older RPGs, or want to try something different than what passes as an RPG today, buy this one.			"

												It's a fine little turn-based game. It doesn't rock the house in any aspect but is an enjoyable causal gaming experience. I nearly 100% the games achievements but got bored and gave up. The problem of the game is repetition. Still sunk about 34 hours into this title. That's pretty good content/dollar value.			"

												Short, nice-looking turn based game.    Maps, item drops, and combat starting positions are all random to drive the challenge.  Good run-thoughs can turn bad pretty quickly.  Replayability is good because you can mix the four helper mercenaries from a group of about 10.  Two game modes- first keeps hero and merc experience [rogue] and  second always starts them green.   Most interesting thing about this game is that it achieves a sliding degree of difficulty without just wrenching the enemy health/number.  If you play easy with fully leveled up heroes and take your time you should succeed about 90% of the time and get a weak ending to the story.  If you blitz through to get the fast ending using unleveled crew that success rate will drop to around 5%.			"

												Crowntakers is an amazing game but what lets it down is the depth and price. I would recommend this game on sale only.Pros:- Great sound/audio- Very well drawn characters & world- Interesting fighting mechanics (once you understand them)- Decent replay value (finished it about 3 times, failed a few more, still need to unlock some characters)Cons:- Game is too short to be asking for $14.99 USD- Game lacks depth (only 10 levels which you can finish in no time!)- Random events/drops lack balance which can make the game far too easy			"

												Crowntakers is fun and somewhat casual. It is essentially impossible to finish it in one shot on normal difficulty, because you have plow through several times to unlock all of the mercenaries. Once you do this, though, it actually becomes pretty easy.  It's a perfect turn-based strategy game for those who don't want to devote a lifetime to the niggling details of games (see Civ 5 and Europa Universalis) or who don't need a lot of plot (Dragonfall). I've beaten it over and over while just listening to my own music.			"

												It's a small but decent rogue-like.Tl;drIt's a fine small indie game (5-7h core gameplay length), but I'd only recommend getting it if it's 30% off or less. You start with one hero, and as you progress through the rather small maps, you will get the option to hire one extra hero at the start of each new map.You gain XP, advance the heroes' stats, equip them with gear and mod the gear with crystals.I failed a handful of times, before I managed to beat the game (too slowly for the achievement); This took me roughly 5 hours. I then did it again a couple of times before I managed to beat it well within the time for the achievement.The game gets progressively easier each time you restart, which both works and feels fine, but it's still annoying to think that your first time is the hardest possible scenario.On my first couple of attempts, I could only hire 3/5 heroes. When I beat the game the first time, I had 4 heroes. After the next retry, I was given the option to fill all 5 available hero slots... and the mods I found were also getting progressively more powerful with each new game I started...I think what annoys me the most, is that the game is build like a rogue-like, but it gets easier each time you play it. It's as if they made the game as a single-playthrough experience which lowers the difficulty automatically each time you fail (which would be a fine small game IMO), but then they added the replayability unlocks to it...There are unlockable heroes, which are limited to unlock only one new hero per playthrough, as well as hero-variations if you have used each hero well enough (i.e. kill 30 enemies with Hero A1 to get A2. Get Hero A to 10 strength to unlock Hero A3)If you ""just"" want to complete the game fast enough to get the achievement, this took me 7 hours.If you want to try all the different heroes as well as each of the 3 variations of the heroes, then I'm guessing it might take 20-30 hours.I suspect it will start to get rather repetitive if you're trying to unlock all the heroes though, but I was not bored during this first win.Conclusion:I'd say this game has 5-7 hours of effective gameplay, followed by an optional grind of roughly 10 hours to unlock everything (maybe less).I bought the game on sale, so I'm quite happy with the amount of entertainment I got for it.I'm not sure if I would want to pay 15 EUR for it (normal price for my country), so I recommend getting it on sale (30% off or less).

												This game. This game seemly takes RNG to it's absolute limits in what can happen to your party. One second you could be doing perfectly, all your party members are full health, and full power. The next, you find an event that does something horrible to you that can screw your entire run up. It can be annoying, it can and will frustrate you, but this game has such a nice charm to it that I keep coming back.It's not the easiest game, it's a Rogue-lite, you WILL die, but all your characters will keep their experience and level (when playing Easy Mode). Some runs will just be to level up newer characters you unlock. I've done quite a few runs like that so far. The art style is fantastic in my opinion. Everything looks nice and fluid and the soundtrack, while not amazing, does a good job of fitting the game.Overall, I definitely recommend this game, but only for people who enjoy Rogue-lites and a bit of a grind to get characters up levels and for the final boss (which can be a pain in butt if you're low levelled). PS: If the Devs read this, I do have one big complaint, and that's the way you deploy into battle. The deploying is randomized, and more than half the time, my ranged characters would ALWAYS be right next to one or more melee enemies, which means they would be useless. If you guys can fix that, or at least make it less random for the enemy to spawn right on top of you, that'd be nice. Great game overall though, kudas to you guys!			"

												Crowntakers is a light tactical RPG played on a hex grid.Accessibility is good.  The game is fully playable with only a mouse (or in my case a pen tablet) and the left click button.  (There are some keyboard shortcuts, but it's not possible to play with the keyboard only.  I can't speak to the gamepad support.)  It's also fully playable with the sound turned off.Replay value is high.  One playthrough typically takes a few hours, but the idea is to replay several times while you unlock more party members and alternate skills for each of them, and pursue achievements.			"

												I'll be honest.  I'm not sure where I got this game.  But I have it, I played it, and it was fun.  I started it on a whim, and ended up playing it for several hours.  It's kind of a combination of grid-based, turn-based strategy, role playing board games, and rogue-likes.  You traverse the overworld by choosing paths, which lead you to taverns (where you can buy healing items, recruit mercenaries, and rest; resting doesn't heal you, but if you don't rest you get tired), blacksmiths, houses/caves (which you can search for items, or use to rest), and enemies.  Fights are typical of grid-based strategy games.  Each side takes turns moving and attacking, with each character having a set number of actions.  You can use potions to give a character more actions, turn them invisible, strengthen their attacks, etc.  I'll also say I played on easy, because I like to make progress.  On easy, you and your mercenaries retain their levels when you die and restart, and defeated bosses become optional (though I still fought them).  You do have to hire the mercenaries again, though, and the weapons and armor go back to level 1.Now for the problems I had with the game.  First, invisible enemies.  Sometimes there will be invisible enemies from the beginning of the fight.  You do not know how many, where they are, or if they're even on the map, so you can't really make strategies for them.  They just appear on their turn and attack, usually all focusing on one of your characters.  I've lost many characters, especially my archers, to these types of enemies.  That brings me to my second problem with the game: items and money.  Both are hard to come by.  Really hard.  You can buy healing items, but you don't get much money, and you often need to buy the materials to upgrade your weapons and armor, too.  This is made worse by the fact that there's no way to heal yourself except those healing items, and your characters don't have much health.  Even at full health, it's easy to die in 1-3 attacks, so half-health is a big disadvantage.  By playing on easy, my characters retain their levels, which alleviates this issue slightly, but levelling gets slow very quickly.  My last problem with this game is pretty typical of this genre, I think, and therefore a very minor complaint.  Attacks, from your characters or your enemies, can do a broad range of damage (2-5, 3-7, etc), plus there's a chance for critical hits and a chance the attack will miss, and many enemies have armor that takes the damage instead of them (each attack takes one armor, regardless of its strength, and I've gotten to many enemies with 3 armor).  It's great when this works in your favor, but it's very frustrating when you have to attack a regular, common enemy 5-6 times to beat it, and there are 3 others just like it, plus archers.   Again, this is made worse by the rarity of money and items, which means you often can't supe up your own characters to match the stronger enemies, or even heal them when they get hurt.Despite my long paragraph of complaints, though, I did enjoy this game, and I'll probably continue to play it for a while.  P.S.- It runs well on pretty weak computers, like mine, so that's a nice bonus.			"

												game isnt bad, just short. needs more heros, bosses and just more stuf in general. ( only reason i wouldnt recommend, and its not a rogue like game imo either)saw a lot of bad reviews saying this game is too hard, and thats laughable. no offense but if you think this game is too hard i dont know what to even really say(you should beat it on normal everytime unless you just get totally unlucky)... you wont beat it on normal the first time thru just because you need to learn what everything does. i beat on my 3rd way thru normal, and only because the first 2 times  i didnt protect my hero like i should have. also seen where people say its too random, well i dont find that to be the case, and it there wasnt random stuff you would only play it once....  events can be random, but if you use potions or mec skills you usually have a good outcome or a very slight bad one, like lose 1 hp. items are random, but the father you go the better the loot is, its really balanced, never did i lose a game due to items i couldnt find.also people say you cant tell if you can beat guys or not.  unless you dont understand basic ideas and how the game works you should beat every guy on the map, unless you rush thru the game without upgrading. there is a little bit you have to learn, but it took me 2 play thrus and pretty much understood it.  would recommend it if it just had more to do in it, this is a game to play maybe when you dont have a lot of time. but didnt see any bugs and the game feels finished so if you like this kind of game then sure get it. so recap: its not that hard( i found it too easy to tell the truth), its not too random( you get everything you need) just not a lot of replay imo and too short.

												Random generated maps? yes. Random events, loot drops, enemies? Yes yes yes.And yet the first playthrough of Crowntakers fails to leave a lasting impression.Battles are interesting and strategic. Each character has a unique and valuable role in combat (Bravo on team diversity).But in-game choices are exceptionally uninteresting.A single step in Crowntakers plays much like Skyrim. Run in, kill everything, grab all loot. Events are repetative and lack impact. Your party searches a house, the floor caves in, Lose 1hp (or get loot). A moment of FTL, for example, plays out similar to this: I was given a choice, protect a fugitive computer virus or hand it over to ""authorities"". I decided to harbor the fugitive and in return for my kindness I stared at my screen in horror as the virus infected one of my crew members and... desintegrated them. The now angry authorities opened fire on my vessel in order to ""quarintine the outbreak""...  The music is fantastic and the art style has a Disney fantasy film flavor that feels both charming and familiar.It's still a lot of fun to grab a new party member and test out his abilities.In a word, the game is light but probably not the rogue-like you are looking for.I paid about $10 but probably should have waited for a steeper sale.

It has it's moments when the randomness hits and things don't go your way, but firing up another game brings new hope for the next attempt!The devs have done a great job and continue to tweak it per the players requests on balance issues.I picked it up for around $11 bucks during a sale and have definitely got my money's worth.Check out some ""Let's Play"" videos on YouTube if you're on the fence.

												It’s a neat little game. I like the art direction and the concept. Play a hero on a quest exploring maps, hiring party members and upgrading their stats and equipment. Problem with the hero system is you have to complete quests to get the heroes. You will die the first couple plays as you get your party of 5 together. Brutally hard in the start and then ends very abruptly with a fairly easy battle; which might be for the best because it gets dull. If the journey just had more depth and variety I could see it being worth playing through more times to see what other party members I could find but of course it would also need a stronger ending. Unfortunately I have no urge to play through it again after beating it.  To bad the game was not really expanded much with the DLC. I started off with the DLC installed, as far as I can tell it adds a new class and a new small map. Problem with the map is using it turns off the new party member quest making it take even more plays to get party members. I finished the game however once I could obtain 5 unique characters partly because this new class is over powered. If you do buy it I would recommend passing on the DLC.4/10 "

												Crowntakers is a really stong, cleanly made, tactical, pretty, simple, replayable, low stress, slightly funny roguelike fantasy DnD-type game with progression. I give it a A minus for visual style, A for being really round oriented, a B for interface (A grade with some serious negatives), A minus for goofy, A- for different characters with unique skillsets, C+ for ""story"", A for roguelike replayability, B+ for increasing achievements that unlock more stuff.  Overall somewhere in the A to A minus grade for a sub $20 roguelike with low expectations. If you want a low stress game that's tightly designed, drawn, and tactical, this is a greadistraction. If this game cost $50 pe player, it would be disappointing. Since it is very reasonably priced, it is well worth the cost and there are enough amusements, tricks, and tactical battle mechanics that increase over time to make it worth more than the asking price. On sale, it's a bargain.I hope they bother to put out another DLC. When I'm burned out, tired, ready to go to sleep, but too wound up to stop thinking about work, something like Crowntakers is perfect to focus me on a goofy DND game with light tactics, inventory management, skill choices, and map pathing -> towards a goal that's unachievable before playing a bunch.Not going to be to everyone's tastes, but I don't know any ""roguelikes"" (it's almost as fun to die in many cases as it is to 'win') that are suited to everyone.

												Buy this during a sale.It's a short lived rogue-lite turn based RPG. You have a hero and can recruit up to 4 mercenaries (1 after each level you have beaten) that will aid you in your quest to slay the evil king in 8 levels. Each level has its own enemies and terrain as well as places to search and a unique boss. Unfortunately most of the bosses are simply tougher enemies, but lack any distinguishing features. Rinse repeat until you've beaten the game. After every restart of the game a new mercenary will offer you a quest. Completing that quest will unlock the merc permanently. There are 9 in total.Apart from that you loot locations, upgrade your warriors and buy items to heal, etc. In between fights you have to rest to replenish your forces (but they don't heal automatically). You need to balance the time it takes to rest, loot and just walk on the map from point to point with your overall strength, since enemies will get stronger each day (any moves takes a certain amount of hours to complete). The hardest part is actually keeping your guys healthy after a battle, so you want to get armor for your guys asap, since this regenerates after every fight.If you play this on ""easy"" mode your mercs will keep their earned XP, meaning you get stronger with every playthrough. If you don't I think only the hero keeps his XP, but the hero is definitely not the strongest character in the roster. Play on ""normal"" if you want the real experience, but personally I've found the game too boring and repetitive to even bother with that. There are barely any random events in this rogue-lite. You will go through the same levels with the same mercenaries (if you wish), buying the same upgrades and choosing the same level ups all while fighting the same enemies (and amount of enemies) in every playthrough. There are only marginal differences in the half dozen attempts I've done so far and I don't see any room for more, since shops always offer multiple items, inns even offer the same items every time, so there's not much replayability once you've beaten the game (about 4 hours or so for me on easy).After you get 30 kills on a merc and after you finish the game with them you can choose a 2nd or 3rd starting layout, changing the skills the character brings to the table. This is actually pretty neat, but I would argue that some skills are plainly better than others.The DLC adds an alternative zone you can also access via the same means every time. This one introduces a new mercenary, which plays pretty uniquely and is actually rather interesting. Apart from that you can complete a new unique quest for each character in this zone (always the first merc you hire, since you can't get your hands on any more until you have to decide whether you want to visit Necropolis), which gives you the option to buy a special item for this character from the inn (available at the start of every level), which makes them far stronger.I got this for free in a magazine I receive every month, which might tell you a bit about the game, since usually it takes years for games to be included in a magazine, so I'm guessing it doesn't sell all that well. Like I said, it's neat for a couple of hours, but has no longevity or motivation apart from completing the quests for your heroes and unlocking them in the first place. And even that is bare bones. The story is quasi non existant as well. Still, it's not a bad game for the right price.			"

The game is quite simple, but once you learn the mechanics you begin to understand much better ways to defeat your enemies and progress further. The graphics create a charming atmosphere that lead you into the just as polished gameplay. While the game is simple and practically a flash game on steroids, its well worth the price tag, and if you're willing to put in the time and effort, a great joy to clear, stage by agonizing stage.

												This is a nice little strategy game. The combat is interesting and it's fun to try and put together a complemetary team. And the enemies have some variance, though aren't particularly smart. The adventure part of the game is pretty basic, hunt around and gather goodies in fairly random locations to level up. There's a timer of sorts, though it doesn't really impact game play much, but it does mean you shouldn't scavenge every last spot.For $10, it's a thumbs up. On sale, it's a great value. I've won 3 times and felt like I got value out of it. The replay level really drops off though, so take it for what it is, a fun 10-30 hours depending on how much the combat grabs you.If you like this game, you'd probably like Reknown Explorers: International Society.

												Short game - not much depth - I got through to the end (within 18 days as per the achievement) on my third attempt (on normal difficulty - there's no ""hard"" level)  Didn't make me want to get the DLC.  I haven't seen all the mercenaries you can hire as I had only 3 unlocked; and still managed to finish without a full party...  It's not super easy, but once I found the right tactics, I never once got scared of seeing my game fall apart.I'd recommand getting it if it's on sale AND if you're not a turn-based tactical game veteran.  Maybe.			"

												short version:  good but not great tactical game, better progression when you play on easy difficulty (consider normal a challenge mode)I like this game.  The combat is a fun little combination somewhere in between braveland, D&D, and X-com.  Comabt is very tactical, where slight mispositioning can cost you big.he overworld exploration reminds me of FTL in a bad way.  you go places and things happen to you.  you feel like you have a lot of choices, but mostly it's just random.  A lot of events have random outcomes so you can't really learn a ""right"" response, which is a double edged sword.I strongly encourage new players to start on easy difficulty.  The game is very punishing, and the ability to retain levels through playthroughs can help give you some buffer while you learn how to not die.  Treat normal difficulty as a ""challenge"" mode.  Once you beat the game a few times and really understand the mechanics, and have unlocked heroes you really like, *then* try normal modeOverall the game has a weird enjoyment curve.  At the start it's really hard and seems random and unfair.  It doesn't help that the designer has the route to the DLC in game, which can cost you a lot of very important time walking towards, which is very frustrating.  once you get over the DLC, and realize AAA studios do that skeezy♥♥♥♥♥♥to you *all the time*, and you die 3 or 4 times and learn some tactics... the game becomes pretty darn fun.  Now admittedly after a few more playthroughs, once you really understand things, there becomes one or 2 optimal solutions for every set of enemies.  I'm definitly getting tired of the game faster than I'm getting through objectives (like unlocking new characters, or new loadouts for old characters), but playthroughs like 3-7 as I really started understanding the game, and working on beating the final boss, were a lot of fun			"

												Crowntakers has far too many encounters/mechanisms that are simply poorly explained, visualized or simply far too brutal. You will rapidly find yourself facing enemies that the game says are far too tough for you if you ever make the mistake of clicking the 9H option, so why add it? The rewards for clicking 9H are laughable (+1 str that you can buy for 1 gold). Add in the random start locations taking any semblance of strategy out of the battles and you've got a game that just feels annoying rather than hard. 1 minute you're facing 5 health minions, the next you're suddenly facing 3 armor/13 health minions who can inexplicably counter attack. And the bosses who can teleport or can't take damage from melee, inexplicably, without any reason, without any warning.Obviously you're supposed to play it again and again, but other games the pressure is gradual, the challenge ever growing. This one it's, easy, easy, easy, STUPIDLY STRONG. Having played 4 games, the difficuly ramp up just isn't there, even on 'easy'. There's no balance, no finesse, no satisfaction. You simply feel like you wasted an hour of your time to get rofl-stomped against an enemy that doesn't obey the same rules and makes any sort of strategy completely pointless.I've played and loved FTL/Dungeons of the Endless/Rogue Legacy but this simply doesn't work.

												This game reminded me a lot of FTL; only without all the fun bits. Crowntakers is an indie turn-based RPG from Bulwark Studios and Kasedo Games. Let’s get rocking.The GoodI was a fan of the vibrant colors that are presented in the Crowntakers color palette (which is unusual for me, but hey.)The BadJust like the statement I opened with, Crowntakers reminded me a lot of FTL, but it lacked all the things that made FTL a fun game.Character customization is practically nonexistent. There are no other weapons or armor to swap out on your characters (which could have really helped fight some of the monotony that is rife in this game); what you see is what you get until you upgrade to a marginally less lame version of the equipment.The music is repetitive. Very repetitive.The main character that you are stuck with looks like some backwoods halfwit and it is almost insulting that you are forced to play as him.The MehThe most Meh thing about Crowntakers is that they want to charge you money to get the game.Verdict: NayIf you have been wanting to play Crowntakers, don’t bother. It is a waste of time and you could better spend your time and money on a far more entertaining game. As always, thanks for reading.			"

												let me take a small gander at this. I've played this for nearly 20 hours and I have to agree with most of the negative reviews, Dont waste your money. This had the potential to be a great game but it is onesided and often to predictable. the only thing you have going for you is pure chance during strategic map movement, and the only thing you have going for you in Tactical Combat is pure Time in game and high level character and mercs, otherwise you are going to lose. I agree , they could make this much more enjoyable, especially considering the continual re-run of the same monotonous crap in order to get your character and mercs to a high level.  It's enjoyable on a play one map and leave the game alone for a while level.  Otherwise I wish I could get a refund and wait for a similar game that actually makes adventuring not so dang predictable... Oh look a group of thieves that for some reason still have tons of Invisibilty potions... I can see how this fight will end up, them getting free back stabs while I try not to end the game through task manager.			"

												Not worth the time or money.  Extremely random with too few player choices and not enough information about the choices that are available.  The only rogue-like aspect to the game is permadeath.Maps are presnted as a hex grid  for no particular reason since map movement is point to point. Each of the several possible encounters can be met once & the player must make his choice without any suggestion of possible outcomes.  Few encounters well balanced.   Many cannot be avoided.    Once the player has exited a map he cannot return to it.  As a result, if the player encounters a situation which he cannot beat in his current condition there is rarely a way to improve the character and try again.Combat begins with players characters  deployed on a hed grid map, frequently with no opponents in view nor any suggestion of their location.  Nearly always surprised even though the text says that player is aware of opponents.  It is not uncommon for player's characters with seven or eight hit points each to face four or more opponents each with six to fifteen hit points, when played on easy.That the devs assume that placing the player into situations in which he has no chance of success makes for amusing game play is but one mark of their shortsightedness.Camping & inns do not replenish hit points and rewards for the rare battle victory are inadequate for character survival.  There is no sense of progress.  No feeling of having learned how to increase the character's chance of success in subsequent games.The entire game could be condensed to having the player roll a die at the beginning and then declaring him failed or victorious. All in all a poorly designed game utterly lacking in the elements that that would make it enjoyable.The game is not difficult it is highly random with an extremely restrictive choice basis.  That means that the player's chance of completing each level is very small.The first level has eight to ten encounters.  Each encounter has two or three options.  Each option may have up to a half dozen outcomes.  Since each encounter occurs once per game sampling each of the possible  options on the first level  alone requires between 64 and 512 plays.  It is relativly easy to reach the second map but highly unlikely that the play weill have gained enough knoweldge/experience from the first map to effect his chances of surviving to the third.The second map is a bit less random.  It has more combat encouters  but opponents are significantlhy stronger.  I place the probability of surviving any one combat between one-quarter and one-third call it 7/24.  There are four combat encounters, I believe.  The chance of surviving all of them would be about 1/140.  It takes 97 plays to have a 50% chance to complete this level.If you are willing to play the game a couple hundred times you might make it to the next map.Though there a many player choices on each map the outcome of each choice has a high variability.  That means that very little of the information you have garnered from previous game play will contribute to your choices in your current game.Since each map has few opportunities for character improvement unpassable roadblocks are common.It is these last two points where this game fails as a rogue-like.  The best rogue-like games present problems for the player and provide him with opportunities to surmount them.  The worst rogue-like games simple provide scads of random events.WazHack & Bionic Dues ae both good rogue-like games.  Crowntakers is not.			"

												This little game is actually quite repetitive. There are only 8 + bonus stages. In order for you to unlock your companions, their levels, items and steam achievements there are quite some randomness involved and enthusiastic music so it wouldn't be such a chore.The names of the ""difficulty levels"" (more of a game modes) are misleading. ""Easy"" means actually ""progression"" since in the beginning it is impossible to finish it with your level one hero. ""Normal"" means that once you have unlocked all companions and their items in the ""easy"" mode you have a chance to finish this mode.Conclusion: It's fun little game for some time. If you like RGP's with turn based tactical battles then you like this game as well.P.S. If they won't make the OST available as DLC soon then i have to rip it somehow from the game.			"

												When I saw trailer I thought that this game would be much more interesting but unfortunately I did not like it.

I hoped for that this game would be more casual roguelike experience and I would not need to die hundred times just to grind my hero and mercenary levels to beat the game and that is only on easy mode in normal mode your mercenary level resets too.I played rogelike games before like Z.H.P on my PSP and I liked it much more than this game.

												This was also like a mobile port. The levels go up as a you play it, which means you waste a lot of time starting out with no chance of surviving. It had even fewer choices than Braveland, which was much less expensive. The enemies also cheat, appearing on the board sometime out of nowhere after you've already moved. The listed price is crazy, but I must have gotten it as part of a Humble Bundle or something, because I can't imagine buying it even on sale. Play Spelunky instead for a game with roguelike elements done right.			"

												Yes I recommend this with all the DLC to avoid other peoples' complaints about in-game advertising.The game might be underrated because of the DLC complaints.This is a rogue-like TBS RPG.  The map is linear with tree-branching roads that form the overground ""dungeon"".There is turn based strategy on the battle-fields, and there is engine-building strategy at the blacksmith's shop for arranging how buffs are set up.  Tuning the party can make a big difference.The art-style is not too misleading - this is a relatively easy game.  It was difficult at first, but after several hours it starts to feel trivial.Because of the RPG style, dice-rolls (RNG) can add tension at times, which is good.Not a great game, but it's good - if you are a fan of the genre and you see it on sale, it's worth trying out.

												I would not spend your money here, yet. On easy level with all 5 merc's at level 10 and great weapons and armor upgrades you will get totally pawned by the final boss. He has 50 HP 6 Shields and regens shields every turn, does not take attack of opportunities when he moves or attacks and when you do kill him he respawns with 25 HP and 4 shields which rege every turn as well with no apparent cap. By then the other 6 henchmen, 4 of which heals him every turn really makes this unrealistic. I love a challenge but this goes far beyond that. I wish I had not spent the money. Hereo/mercs cap at level 10, HP from 6-13 max, the cost to upgrade dodge or crit take away too much from damage or health so not balanced at all. ie great crit % but you will get killed in one or two hits. The game has very little strategic value as everything relies on luck not skill. 80% hit chance is more like 20% hit, more often than not your 3-6 attacks will miss. All in all this has some great ideas but poorly implemented game mechanics that only server to frustrate the player.			"

												This game is okay.Not worth it even at $11.24 though, wait until it is cheaper unless you're bored. A simple but enjoyable game. The tactical battles are by far the best part! I like the sense of progression, and unlocking new archetypes is pretty sweet. The final boss is pretty terrible though - it breaks basically every single rule of the game that you've learned up to that point and there seems to be no real strategy to it. The way they handle difficulty is also poor - you are stuck on ""easy"" mode until you grind enough to kill that boss, then you can play ""normal"" mode where all of your progress is permanently lost forever and you are unable to make any more progress. Significant flaws, but fun for a few hours. I'm also having trouble seeing how the final boss would even theoretically be possible starting at level 1 every time as you do on normal mode, probably you need to find some kind of semi-exploit to beat it.

												It's a really great game, I highly recommend it.  It's basically medieval FTL, but quite a bit easier.  It could definitely use more difficulty levels (I think harder, but a lot of people apparently want easier ones too).  It can be too hard for some, and gets too easy after about 15 hours if you are the sort of person who loves FTL and can beat it on normal.  It would be as good as FTL or Dungeons of Dredmor (which are as good as it gets imho) with a selection of harder difficulty levels.The graphics and sound are both very charming and immersive.  It has great music for this type of game, and I love the look of it.			"

												For the mac, if you get to the map screen after starting a game, nothing responds!  Don't grab this if you have a mac until they fix this bug.Update:  They got the bug fixed, and things work now!			"

												Fun tactics-style game.Spent most of the time replaying it over and over again to unlock all the characters and their variants as the game itself was quite short.			"

												I liked it. Think of it like Banner Saga, but simplified. Just a simple turned based tactics game.Nothing fancy here.. just a solid game.  "

												The game is interesting , looks and feels like a mobile game. The graphics are very beautifull the mechanics arent bad or revolutionary , you get a hero, hire more heroes, use food to heal , upgrade/buy armor and weapons and some such. The problem i have with the game is that it can be horribly unbalanced , for instance i had 1 hero he deals 4 dmg and has 7 health and at the end of the 2nd lvl  i was up against some enemies which had the combined life of 25ish and all dealt 4dmg and since they were numerous they could atack me multiple times per turn , basically i atacked once and then died which results in gameover... Also i went up against a boss which was unhitable , i literaly had 0% chance to hit him with all of my mercanaries and hero. (there are ways you can bypass this by using potions , but since i only had 2 i hit him twice and then proceded to get killed which results in gameover).Its not a bad game keep that in mind , its just kinda wierd , i reccomend watching a few youtube videos before bying it just so you can see what to expect. Also ive played less than an hour and ive seen most of what the game has to offer. In my opinion its worth 5 bucks so get it on sale if you think youl like it.			"

												Its a realy good $5 game. But thats what it is 5-10 hours of playability. However, its got some real likeability, and some very much wasted $20 potential. I feel like there are a number of steps the producers of this game could take to make it into a real timeless classic, with minimal work, somehow I doubt they will though.			"

												Want to like this game? Play in Normal setting from start and try to open new merchaneries and their abilities through multiple gameplays. It is lots of fun when you are not trying to beat the game but playing to er, play lots of times. Sometimes you'll die in the second section and sometimes you'll finish the game easly.			"

												Pretty good turn based strategy game. Has a cool art style. This game utilizes an hexagonal tile based movement system. You'll enjoy this game if you are a fan of Banner Saga, Conquest of Elysium, Final Fantasy Tactics, or DOFUS.PROS---------------------------It's easy to pick up and play.Classes (each merc, and hero has it's own class)SkillsWeapon/Armor UpgradesCONS--------------------------Haven't really found any yet			"

												Very fun game. Good for a 20-30 minute session of fun. It felt like a very interesting table top game with random elements. I enjoyed the ability to unlock new characters and versions of them. Trying different strategies to win is very rewarding and leads to tons of replay value.The only downside I see is that after awhile you unlock all the characters and then there isn't much to keep playing for.Nevertheless, I found this game on discount and it was absolutely worth every penny.
