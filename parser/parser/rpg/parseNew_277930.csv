								As others have stated, this game is dead.What most annoys me though is that they play like they care, but they don't. I know it, and I will tell you how I know. When they started off, they had big ambitions, their intentions were great, but not over the top. The biggest thing was that they were going to make their own engine, for some reason. It made no sense because nothing they wanted to do couldn't have been done by unity or unreal. Their goals were way more reasonable than most kickstarters, and they got the money they asked for and more. It seemed like they had good heads on their shoulders. When it came to realeasing the alpha, they had to push it back a few weeks, they apologized in a mass email and did it by a reasonable date. At this point, I would have believed anything, because most kickstarters don't get that far or have the respect for their patrons to apologize for something so small. After the alpha began, problems were fixed on a bi-mothly basis, most problems were in scripting, and we were essentially testing the game and submitting reports like paid gametesters would. But we didn't care, we backed and were helping because we believed in the project and the team.Soon the updates slowed, and big breaks in between happened when the team needed a ""vacation."" No one complained, but it was like the calm before the storm. Soon, updates were rare and consisted almost exclusively of cosmetic objects, and most of them we couldn't even test because large portions of the game were not functional. The game had to go down a couple of times as they clearly were scrapping huge chunks because they were ""making their own engine."" They then started talking about releasing on steam, and for a while there was no new update. When they got on steam they celebrated like it was some great accomplishment, and started taking more people's money with the promise of something they had no intention to give. They then updated us that they needed new revenue, and had to cut a large portion of the team. Eventually they started talking about changing the game. making a pay to win or something. All the while, nothing of any value was happenning. They are still talking about it like it is ongoing, but it has been over 3 years and it is still in alpha.			"

								Firstly, I would like to applaud the developers at Nerd Kingdom on a great job in developing a terrific game so far.  It must be, I’ve logged over 900 hours since purchasing the game in September 2014. Apparently, I don’t have a life.  To put this into perspective, that’s about 6 hours of game playing per day over the past five months.Like most people, I enjoy playing open world sandbox survival games, exploring, crafting, mining, but mostly building things.  TUG offers all of these things, but with a very rich non-blocky interactive environment where you become immersed into your surroundings. The world ambient sounds seem to add to this immersion, leading you to start foraging for supplies right away to survive at least the first night.  The environment sounds have you looking over your shoulder for critters that might be sneaking up on you or a sound that stops you in your tracks wondering what is that?, is it going to eat me?, do I run away?Once you start the game, you immediately find yourself exploring or running away from a critter because you haven’t crafted a weapon yet and thinking that the rock in your hand doesn’t seem adequate enough to defend yourself, or just wanting to see what is over the next hill or to watch a spectacular sunrise or sunset.  Once you feel safe you notice that you are now hungry so you begin foraging for food to eat.  My mom always wanted me to be a vegetarian.  You now notice that your backpack of many things is full containing mostly different types of rocks, a few sticks and some vines. You begin throwing these items onto the ground to see what can be crafted. Now that you are armed to the teeth with stone tools and weapons; including a hoe and shovel, you are more likely to begin building something such as a hole in the ground to hide in or experimenting with the various available building materials (limited at the moment) to construct your dream home-base to venture forth from into the world of TUG. One thing I like about TUG so far is that there are no zombies, yet.  I don’t like zombies as they sneak-up on you while you are busy doing something and scare the ___ out of you, much like the forest children do in this game, the kinokojin. Although I have experienced many game crashes mostly with the indev version, lost files, and other game bugs, TUG is still a great game so far and knowing it will get even better with future updates.  Putting all that aside, the following are some suggestions that would be nice to see implemented into the game; however, some of these suggestions may not be possible:1.	Crafting a compass. This is not really necessary, but crafting a compass would be a cool way to explore the world of TUG for those who need one.  Based on your compass marches or hikes, you could craft area maps.  I found that knowing where the sun rises and sets in the game (east and west) and using landmarks, whether made or natural, you can navigate throughout the world quite reasonably. 2.	Crafting a bow and arrows.3.	The gathering and or crafting of new building materials.4.	Doors, windows and furniture.5.	Adding a smaller block size in addition to the two we already have for adding building trim details.6.	Once water is introduced into the game, will seedlings be able to swim?7.	Crafting a boat to float down that lazy river or to see if you can survive boating over a waterfall or white water rafting.8.	Crafting a fishing rod to go fishing on that hot sunny afternoon.  Crafting different types of lures or using different types of bait to attract different types of fish would be cool.  Fishing could also be dependent on the time of day and the weather.9.	Climbing trees to get away from predators when all you have is a rock in your hand to defend yourself.  The only problem with this type of defence is that the predator will not go away and you will eventually starve to death sitting in the tree, unless you can eat the tree leaves. Picture the scene from the Movie ‘Quest for Fire’.10.	Throw rocks, especially at tigers and the forest children. 11.	Pets, a dog like creature, horse or riding type creature.12.	Other wildlife critters to hunt or to just watch, such as ungulates, birds and predator type creatures.13.	Different mystical biome creatures, one for each type of biome.14.	More world ambient sounds, such as a hooting owl in the haunted forest biome, howling critters when the moon rises, etc.15.	Weather systems such as rain, snow, thunder storms, tornados, etc.16.	More uses for critter hides other than leather strips.17.	Crafting implements of destruction such as a trebuchet or canon to silent that noisy forest child, just kidding.In closing, all I can say about TUG is that it is an awesome game so far and has the potential of being one of the best open world sandbox survival games presently being developed.  All the best to the developers at Nerd Kingdom and keep up the great work.			"

								I'm one of the original backers from kickstarter. I've seen the entire process up to this point. Its been 3 years and this game is no more closer to completion than it was at the end of year one. Now the company is moving to change the engine and make the game free to play so more modders can have access to the game. Now they stated from the beggining the game was going to be modder friendly, but making the game free out in year 3 is simply because they cant just get up and finish the game themsleves. I love the idea of this game (thats why i backed it) however the company is clearly not capable of completeling the game.			"

								January 2016A quote from yesterday's AMA on reddit https://www.reddit.com/r/tug/comments/414taf/tug_dev_ama/""we so much dont want to get any new players, that we are going to stop selling TUG next week, and not give anyone new any access until 2.0 is ready.""Don't buy this version.  They're ceasing development on it, and there's not much to hold your attention for long.  Come back in a year and see if it's been fleshed out.  Follow it if you're interested.  But if you spend money on it now you'll regret it.			"

								I backed this game when it came out on Kickstarter thinking it had a neat premise. Then when I went to PAX South in 2014 and to my surprise I saw a TUG booth set up. When I met with the booth staff I asked, ""What happened to the game? I haven't heard any updates and I thought the game had totally died out."" The staff was confused at first asking why I would think that until they admitted that the project had failed and they had to find new financial backing. This is a year after the original kickstarter with barely any communication given. It is now 2016. Almost a full 3 years have passed since I originally was interested in this game it is no where near what the developers had promised when many other Kickstarter games I've backed are doing quite well (Stonehearth, Panetary Anihilation, Among the Sleep, The Long Dark). If you really think your money will be well used by the development team then by all means buy this title. But at this time I cannot reccomend this game to anyone.			"

								Make sure your Graphics Card is directx 11 compatible! I bought the game just assuming i could run it (didnt look very system heavy) but my graphics card is not compatible. Not really the developers fault i didnt read the reccomended requirements which is why i am not downvoting and the game from what i have seen does show a lot of potential and i hope that as they develop the game more they will optimize it and make it easier to run for those of us with older computers!

								TUG or The Un-named Game is a Survival/Crafting game. You play as a Seed. Seeds have a blue gem embedded in the back of their left hand and are genderless. This later will be an important part of the game. In TUG you can craft an assortment of different items to aid you in everything from farming to combat and even using alchemy and magic.Currently you have two status bars, Health and Energy. Doing various tasks will use up your energy and require you to eat to refill it. Health is lowered by creatures that attack you or eating poisen mushrooms.You have the ability to sprint, although not unlimited. Sprinting lasts longer in TUG than most other games and the Sprint Meter refills at a very decent rate.You can use such items as wood chips, mushrooms and bone meal among others, to brew potions.The growth potion will allow you to grow crops faster and even turn a baby animal into an adult. (Both of these take time).You can currently breed goats and cats and even breed them together to get the awesome cogat!TUG features the unique ability for the character to age, get stronger, faster and even fatter. This is in the very early stages and needs more time before it is finished.One of the more recent updates has improved biome generation greatly. Biomes feel real and authentic. There is a large assortment of plant life and natural resources. The game is decently optimized but is lack luster in some areas. You may experience lag spikes or a constant low fps unless you have a decent computer. The devs are working on this and will hopefully have TUG ready for a wider range of computers soon.Sound effects and graphics are fairly good and offers a unique experience. The higher the settings you can use, the better overall experience you'll have playing.Currently TUG offers stone age to the bronze age but lacks in content. You'll find it hard to keep going after 15 hours or so, some never make it that far while others make it hundreds of hours.I recommend purchasing on sale around $10 until more content and optimizations go into the game. Don't get me wrong, I like this game. I would even say I love it but if I'm going to be honest I have to tell both sides.Watch some videos, check out some reviews and heck, even try purchasing the game and playing for an hour. Steam will refund no questions asked if you've not had the game longer than 14 days or played more than 2 hours.If you're not comitted to playing an early access game with an prototype level of content and willing to deal with lost saves and bugs, I'd wait. Early Access after all is about helping guide the game to the finish line.I'd rate the following:Concept 10/10Graphics 7/10SFX 6/10Content to Price Ratio 4/10			"

Key supplied by developer for review.======================================The Untitled Game Read on for the full review!======================================TL;DR:TUG is a good game with a lot of potential, but there's not quite enough to do yet. The devs are good, transparent and working hard. If you like supporting a worthwhile Early Access game, give this one a buy!======================================Pros+Graphics: Good mix of cartoonish and realistic.+Gameplay: Sparse but good, with tons of crafting recipes!+Audio: Just enough sounds to be effective.+Workflow: Intuitive crafting/inventory management.Cons-Gameplay: Only so much to do currently.-Gameplay: Needs more things to hunt/enemies!-Audio: Some actions are missing sounds.Neutral+/- Crafting/inventory management can take some adjustment.+/- It may not exactly be obvious how to do things at first.======================================Introduction:TUG is one among many survival sandbox games. It features a fantasy setting and charming, cute, simple-yet-pretty graphics. In TUG, like many sandboxes, you will have to work your way through the tech tree from the ground up. TUG also has an amazingly upfront dev team whose main concern is their game and consumer. So what's it like?Gameplay:The first time you start TUG you may be alarmed by the long load time, but don't worry, only the first will take that long. When you get into the game, you may find yourself wondering what to do or how to do it. A quick bit of information gathering will fix that. The first thing you will want to do in TUG is gather objects for tools. To do this you have to tear down a sapling or small tree, leaving you with a wood handle. At this point you will need a properly shaped rock and some vines. Once you find said properly shaped rock laying around (usually near other, larger rocks) and some vines (easy to spot and abundant) you can put them all on the ground together and hit G to craft your first primitive tool!Hooray! That wasn't so bad, was it? From here on out your imagination is the limit.TUG, unlike many sandboxes, features a beautiful voxel terrain editor, allowing you to shape the earth pretty much however you see fit. Doing so is a quick and easy process, as you can use virtually any primitive tool. Filling the terrain in with wood or stone, however, is not nearly as quick. So for those of you who hate seeing servers on survival sandbox games where there are tons of halfbuilt or poorly built structures you can rest easy. You can also rest easy in knowing that your buildings will take work and will be an accomplishment.This leads to a startling revelation: building is fun. building with friends is more fun. Aside from building, crafting, hunting, and farming, there isn't too much to do in the game's current state-but what is there is fun, with more on the way. There is, however, an absolutely EXTENSIVE amount of things to craft, so if you're into making things, you're in the right place.Graphics:The graphics in TUG are a treat. Again I will state that they are strangely pretty, considering their simplistic and cute nature. You will find that there are lush biomes filled with dense foliage, as many types of trees as you could ever want, and various bioluminescent plants and resources scattered about. The colors are at times muted, and almost always earthy, but that won't stop you from finding sand or snowswept locales. As a man that appreciates variety, I was very pleased with both the amount and the look of the biomes available in TUG. Aside from biomes I want to take a moment to talk about the look of buildings. In TUG, when you place a wood block next to a cobblestone block, they will blend together, and this can make for both some pretty--and pretty interesting--ideas and aesthetics.The presence of fog, various cloud types, sky colors, moon and sun, darkness, etc. make for an overall pleasing and immersive graphical experience that I'm sure you'll enjoy!Audio:The audio in TUG is also a treat, albeit a sparse one, but this is a good thing. In a sandbox you don't want obnoxious music distracting you from you building, fighting, hunting, crafting. You want relaxing music with good atmospheric sounds, and audio cues that would be distinct a mile apart, and in TUG, you have that. The audio stays in the background until it needs to be in the foreground, and I appreciate that so much. While many games try to pull on your heartstrings too much with music and sound, TUG manages to make you feel things by playing the right sound at the right time. The sounds that are there serve their purposes well, although more sounds would be nice, for example, when swinging a weapon.Conclusion:TUG is a great sandbox with a lot of potential. It already has solid building mechanics and tons of crafting recipes. If you are okay with supporting a vision, give it a buy!======================================If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group "

								I'm Blown Away.  First I want to say THANKYOU to Nerd Kingdom FOR MAKING THIS GAME, and for releasing this part of it though it isn't yet finished.  I like minecraft alot, my son LOVES minecraft a whole lot.  The graphics in MC just aren't my thing.  I Love the TUG graphics.  With everything that is on the list to come I think my son and I will both LOVE TUG a whole lot!I'm perfectly happy to just build and get excited about every new little thing until January ;-)I do hope that what I build now will still be around once the final game is done (Dev's, will it??)And I'm truly hoping for a method for 3rd person POV; and by the videos, it looks like the PC's are individualized-- I'm assuming that there will be a character creation section for the game too?  Or will there be skins?  Just wondering.I haven't been this excited about a game since Skyrim!  Thanks again Nerd Kingdom!			"

								I bought into TUG during its Kickstarter campaign back in May 2013. It honestly sounded awesome at the time. The campaign pitched a ""multiplayer open-world sandbox-RPG using new technology and social sciences to directly involve players in the game’s design."" I thought wow that sounds like it could be something special! Fast forward more than 3 years later, and very little progress has been made. In January 2016 the developers sent out a message to backers explaining how they were scrapping the DX11 engine they had been working on and were now working towards moving over to OpenGL, further explaining that there would be no more game updates for at least around 12 months. That means we’ll be (hopefully) seeing the next engine update sometime around early 2017, in an early alpha stage, four years after the Kickstarter ended. In the same January ’16 update the developers also pitched the idea of making TUG a Free to Play 'game', with monetisation of user mods. TUG would no longer be a complete game in itself, but rather a base platform that others could make content mods for, and sell to other users.  That to me sounds completely terrible, and it is definitely not something I would have had anything to do with if I had known that's where things were possibly headed. Now to be fair the decisions of going Free to Play with monetised mods has still yet to be made, but throwing out the suggestion like that and announcing no decision will be made for a full year was quite honestly a terrible way to handle things. In the 8 months since that announcement, the community has all but disappeared (at least the current players on Steam), reviews have gone to hell, and community confusion has most definitely set in. Not a great situation for any game to be in. I’ll be keeping an eye on the games progress and will update this review accordingly, but at this stage I’ve just about lost hope that TUG will be developed through to completion and to a state that matches what was originally promised to early backers.  I have a feeling that updates and communication will continue to slow down, to a point where development is quietly cancelled. Time will tell though and I would love to be proven wrong. "

								I would like to state right off the bat, that I do not hate this game at all. I was actually going to purchase a copy of the game for my wife today to play it together, found out it had been taken off the store, and read the AMA and related info.This is a complicated game to review, but I felt I would share my thoughts so far. This game has has a lot of heart and love put into it so far, it's very obvious when playing it. It has a very immersive feel as well, via placing objects on the ground, instead of storing hordes of trash in numerous boxes. The feeling of digging out a mine, and having to dump the rock and dirt out the hole, is simple, but adds to that immersion. I also love the sound and effects at night time; That eerie wind and ambience is just mind blowing. Every update to this game, I update and play, as they had been adding tons of unique content. However, I have to put emphasis on ""had."" They did work on new biome generation and terrain generation as of last year, which was a big task to do, but there wasn't much else added in. They had a good reputation for releasing small, but potent updates to the game frequently, and highlighting them on their youtube channel, which I would reccomend following if you're at all interested in the game. The youtube channel itself describes what I'm talking about. A lof of the updates come slower than the last, and several of the ""in the works"" projects being worked on never saw the light of day.  The last major update involved adding a crafting journal, which was great, but those changes were far too small in the scope of what was supposed to be there. It was disappointing to constantly wait to see changes to this game, only to try it out again in a few months, and being disappointed, or bored after a couple hours. It just feels too ""barren"" for a game that has been in EA this long.I felt like the game had an amazing direction, of molding your ""seed"" and it's appearance, which reminded me of Fable in a way. This awesome feeling of exploring a survival world, with less focus  on survival, and more on exploring and progression in a sense and the players making their own ""game"" in a sense, by offering a diverse solid universe. It seems, and I may be wrong, that they focus more and more on the ""pvp"" community and pvp in general, rather than coop survival, which seemed like the original spirit of the game. This news comes on the heels of their announcment to make the game F2P, and nothing good rarely comes from a F2P model. While I have no doubt that they will do their best to make it a fair F2P model, if that is the route they choose, it doesn't seem like an idea that makes a whole ton of sense to me.That being said, the devs are a great team of people, and I have a huge amount of respect for their vision for this game, and have given it nothing but praise up until this point. They are very active in discussions about it, and interacting with the community.I still have the best hopes for this game, and look forward to the final product. I still am in love with that original trailer, and what I imagined it could be. Even in it's current form, it is a good game, to be perfectly fair. In some senses, I don't feel the devs give themselves enough credit, and are too worried about failing. We just need to see content that changes the game, and adds to it drastically. More pets, more mounts, more weapons and armors, more enemies, boss monsters, and places to explore and learn more about the interesting story they've put behind this game. It should also go without mention to how amazing the art is for TUG.The end note I guess is, that it's great they want to work in a new engine for the game, in a way. But it's a risky move, as we've seen what can happen with games like DayZ, wanting to 'redo' the entire game to make it better. I will still check out the updates from time to time, but it's sad to see that they almost seem to be damaging the game by taking it off the market, instead of trying to promote it more. I know these devs are a small team, and very talented, with a work load far above their numbers, but this just seems like a baffling move. I only wanted to write this because I had a lot of hope for this game. I wasn't a KS backer, but I did buy into EA very shortly after it came out on Steam.TL;DR Wait until the finished product comes out, and see what they have. (Not that you have a choice now, at least for a year.) If things change for the better, and there's actually content that keeps me invested, my review would change to a positive in a second.			"

								Nope, I would not buy it again.I got it pretty long now, never played long because it wasn't realy finished. I was looking forward for the completed game and felt, the EA was a good investment for a good looking game with active people behind it.Well now they are thinking about to make it F2P, so you could pay for stuff you like. *fake-cheer*Where will it end? First you future-buy stuff EA, to support the newcomers and their good ideas. A load of it never proceed or pretty slow like TUG. Then they change it to F2P, so the income keeps going (instead of hurry and start the next project, like big companies, because they already got their money) and then, IF they complete it, TUG will become what... monthly payment and with real-cash-store? Pay-to-achieve-anything?What was the kickstarter AND the EA for? Raising a budget to make a game, I thougt so at least. And now they can't complete it without a F2P System?Guys don't invest in that Game. Trust me. I'm♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ gameplay is naah, nothing special. There is after a long time still no danger in that game. Nothing that make the survival hard. You can just wander arround, eat nearly every plant you see and even if you see a big cat: run or kill. As soon as you got your first stone weapon it's easy.And if you think it will come, remember: if it come, it's pretty sure F2P then.Don't buy it. "

Early Access Review
								Update 4/21/16I still cannot give this game a positive review for the following reasons- It is utterly broken in its current state.- The game is currently not available to purchase.- The game is getting a complete overhaul  while it is down from steam.- Up in the air whether the game will become free to play or not after overhaul.	So why update my review you may ask?.  Its not because my view of the game in its current state has changed. It's because my view of the development of the game has. If you are into crafting/survival/creative/adventure game I feel this is worth following and here is why. The developers are creating the games engine with a set of easily accessible tools the will enable gamers to easily become modders. They are not just trying to make a game they are trying to build a community of modders that can easily create their own material. I very much respect this view and am excited to see what they come up with. So why should I believe what the developers say?, after all we live in a time EA fever and so many fail to deliver on their grand claims. Well the only reason I have any faith in this company is the willingness of the devs to ""throw themselves to the wolfs"" so to speak. Any developer that can't or isn't able to deliver usually slowly stops the updating then kind of fades away to rarely be herd from until the game is released with a slimey Plop!. These guys seem to be continuously prodding the community for involvement even when the reactions are hostile!. They have not faded out into the background but seem to be very open about what their goals are as far as development of the game. To me they are holding firm on their vision. Will it work out? IDK! It really depends on how good of a game TUG is when it is released. If it still sucks then no one will want to play it. If no one is playing it then nobody will want to mod for it no matter how good the tools are. If they really put in the effort to create a solid well thought out game then it has a chance. These in my mind are good reasons to keep an eye on this game.Totally Unfinished Garbage. Even the devs recommend not playing this game. That is why they don’t sell it anymore. It’s so bad they are considering just giving it away. Even if it does go F2P it would not be worth the download in its current state. NK still hasn’t even come up with a business model for this game even after putting it up for sale on steam. According to the developers they “still have years + time"" before they come up with a decision on how to distribute this game. Now we are all aware of the risks of making the choice to support early access but wishy washy nonsense is what truly drives EA supporters’ nuts. hopefully Nerd Kingdom and the rest of the world can learn from this train wreck and move on. However if NK make the game better and come up with a real business plan in their ""Years+ time"" I will definitely change my review.			"

								This game is to Minecraft what Godus was to Populous. How I utterly despise Early Access now. What we have here is yet another bunch of goalpost-moving meandering confidence tricksters who think that begging for money online means you can just coast around tinkering with stuff which never gets finished. I wish I had the luxury of puttering around doing whatever I feel like while strangers with extra pocket money financed it - but no, I actually have to produce results for a living. Turns out we all just chucked money at a bunch of hipsters to pay for their fun and frolics and now that well's run dry, they're talking about going Free to Play. Well, fool me twice.Added mid 2016: Turns out these stains actually lied about their funding. Two thirds of their company was bought up by a Chinese mobile gaming firm in late 2014. They said in their Kickstarter that they'd never turn to outside investment and that's what the Kickstarter was for, to keep themselves pure and non-corporate. And loads of suckers lapped that up and threw money away and then the hipsters nerds went and did it anyway. Lying, bottom-feeding scum.http://steamcommunity.com/app/277930/discussions/0/358415738194880387/ "

Early Access Review
								So here is how my experience has been so far. When I started the game, I first spawned in the desert. I had no clue what to do next. Some of the rocks were obvious they could be picked up and used and I liked when you hovered over it , you got a description. I had no clue what to do, there was no food, no trees. I think at some point of running around and not sure what to do, I went out of the game and tried to get some tips what to do, like what I could eat. Not much in the desert except the cactus, then I ran into a pumkin or the goard and ate those too. So I took off running ( after I learned how to run )  and kept going till I got into the forest. Yay!!! trees and more food. Of course I heard those little fairies or sprites, cool sound effects but wasn't sure what to do. ( At some point in my adventure I chased one down with my sword and killed it only to have it turn mushroom chunks- is that it? ) I started wacking things with my stones till I got a tree down, and then tried a bunch of random things to see if I could craft something. Nope, I'm too dumb, so back out to the web to see what I missed. Again Yaa!, I only looked till I could see some of the basics- didn't want to spoil it too much. So back in the game I went. I started gathering food, hunted some goats and got some meat and some hides, planting crops, building my shelter. ( What no doors, windows, bars no protection? If this was minecraft I would be toast. What if the tiger comes snooping around? Yes I saw a couple and even killed one with a spear. At this point in the game they seem to be easy ) Crap I can't make a fire and I can't make a bed. Back out to Steams discussion board to look up tips again. ( really could use in game references and tips ). So back in the game. Still other than stone I haven't started mining yet. A couple times I started to explore and I got lost, had to create some large stone pillars as a guide to get back. Okay now there are more things I want to craft and I can't remember how. Back out to the discussion board to look things up. (Awsome video tutorials BTW.. thanks for those Skaduush)  I was thinking it would be easier going back out to the desert for mining. Okay where was the desert again??  More big pillars to lead me back home. I also learned from the videos I just have to dig down deep to mine. At least I can stay aroung my base camp for now.Okay I learned a few more things on the main site. I am ready to craft more things and now start mining. See how good my memory is before I go back out to figure out the rest of the crafting.I can deal with the game getting laggy after playing long periods. I can deal with some glitchy AI with the goats and tigers ( right now that seeems to be it ) who on occasion will merge with their environment or run in place ( go around things you silly animals, go around ) I might need more protagonists in this game, keep it challenging. The game has a prehistoric type feel to it, can we add dinosaurs?? Pretty please? Can I tame and ride one? What does the blue gem on my hand do? So many questions. How about laddders and bridges for being up in the trees. Some looked huge where you cannot cut them down, perfect for a treehouse.I think once I am the master of my domain, I am gong to stock up on supplies and just head out exploring. ( Still haven't figured out how to make the backpack I crafted work so I can store more, the default inventory is small- unless you want to carry rocks, seems you can carry alot of cobblestone )Oh and don't be surprised if you go to look at your seed ( character ) and you change sex and size..haha  I was trying to make myself all muscular ( read if I carry heave loads my character will get bigger. I seeemed to be at a young man/boy stage, but when I jumped back in the game I was a young girl..funny.At this point I am keeping my thumbs up as far as my review. Things are going good. I am learning the game, not finding too many faults. I do hope with some of the upcoming updates I can get an idea where the game is going.			"

								If this had come out after the new refund policy, I would have refunded it. It's a broken mess and the talks of going Free-to-Play, the large gaps between updates of decreasing value,♥♥♥♥♥♥poor support, and the fact the game isn't even available for purchase on Steam now are all further reasons I wish I had never backed this. Since I'm outside the 14 day period for refunds, despite that policy not existing in 2014, I'm stuck with... whatever this is. If you ever get a chance to buy this, somehow... DON'T! The lesson learned here is: don't buy an early access game unless you have proof that it works from day 1, that the devs are competent enough to deliver on their plans, and that said devs communicate and hold themselves accountable. I have added this to the list of games I'm ashamed to have backed, which includes StarForge... yeah... it's that bad.			"

								Just forget about Typical Unfinished Game (TUG), it's a lost cause. I bought this game almost two years ago, thinking it has some kind of potential to be really good, but it didn't. The game crashed and burned, it's totalled, it's a ball of flame, and the developers are ""trying"" to put out the flames, but it'll never happen. It's too late, this game will never amount to anything. Development took WAY to long, their patches were months apart and showed VERY little progress. The developers should have some decency and give up so future people don't get scammed by them as did I. The $10 dollars spent on this game would of had significantly more value just by donating it to a charity, or even straight up eating it.			"

ATTENTION: The review below was last updated on January 12, 2015 and is sorely outdated.  I have not given further attention to this game and cannot update the review.  I'm avoiding deleting this review for the sake of maintaining a historical perspective, but to be fair to the game and the developer, please skip this review and see something more recent.While TUG seems to have some good ideas, I cannot recommend it at this point.  It shows promise and may be worth taking a look at later on in development.Building  There really isn't a whole lot to do at this point.  You can build, though there doesn't seem to be a wide range of blocks available just yet.    Also, while the texture blending on placed blocks is very nice in most cases, I'm not sure how suitable it is when building a house (ex: grass blending with wood or wood blending with cobblestone wall).  In my opinion, some of the tools should work a little bit faster.  Ex: digging up an area can be long and tedious. HuntingI've only seen two different sorts of mob so far, though there's supposed to be a third (some manner of predatory cat?).  The giggles/growls of the little mushroom imp are irritating.Crafting  IMPORTANT: Software should almost never make choices for the user.  In order to craft, we must throw our ingredients on the ground and press G.  If the ingredients match any recipe, the item will be crafted.  If the ingredients match multiple recipes, a random item will be crafted. No!  Just, no!  Take an example where I want to build two spears.  I gather two shafts, two spear heads, and some vines, toss them on the floor, and hit G.  Oops... I forgot that the vine wall takes two shafts and some vines... Instead, when there are multiple recipes available, pop up a small dialog which lists the available options.  For any recipe that is unknown to the player (ie: player has never crafted it), provide the option with an ""Unknown Recipe"" label.  I'm a little worried that the current crafting implementation will result in a glut of crafting components.  Compare to Minecraft where a grid defines the resulting item.  Without the grid (or without the option above), we need to have specific items in order to decide what the recipe will result in as can be seen with the multiple tool heads that are required right now (axe, pick, hammer, sword).  With a grid or the above method, we could simplify the recipe to ""a handle + a stone"".  This means players need less storage space (ie: chests).  Items which are not implemented probably should have their recipe disabled.  I was disappointed to craft the leaf backpack and find that it does nothing.  I was about to craft a chest and read that it wasn't implemented either.Inventory/Hotbar-thing  I find the inventory to be woefully small, but I understand that the character we're playing is a child with a tiny backpack.  This could possibly be mitigated by bumping up stack sizes for some things (ie: I believe wooden shafts have a stack size of 2...?  That seems fairly low)  I imagine those spaces at the bottom are some sort of hotbar, so I was frustrated to find that items get shuffled around and don't just stay put.  In my mind, if I set items in a specific order in my hotbar, they should always be in that order.Side-note/Request: I find the sound effect that gets played when the ""TUG"" splash is displayed during game load to be a little bit on the louder side.  Would be nice if that could get toned down a bit or follow configured volume settings.			"

								Early Access. Alpha.If you actually know what these means, then you know the caveats that apply.  If you think it just means a finished, released game before the first patch, then move along.Still here?  The game is pretty, the potential is there.  The devs are highly communicative with the play testers.  They are clear where they are going, are open to feedback, and incorporate it.So if you want a 3d sandbox building adventure game with a magical (alchemy, crystal and anima types) flavouring?  If you want a say in how it developes?  If you can tolerate the instability and impermanence of an early access ?  This is worth looking into.Otherwise, it's worth getting...eventually.			"

I am working to get this refunded by either steam or by the developers. Even thought i have been told there is no way to refund this blah blah blah, I plan to make it a point to go through every available channel to remedy this. It at this point isnt really about the money. I am just tired of people using the ""help fund me and my dream"" schtick to steal people money. People are not being held acountable anymore and the stream early access store reflects this. TL;DR This game sucks, the developers need to pay me. Steam hold these people accountable.			"

								Hi I've just downloaded the game and spent very little time on it so far. I am looking forward to putting in the time with this game tho. to start its in very early alpha, so. a couple of little things would help, to start maybe some kind of information regrading the items that are in your inventory straight away, what there for and there purpose. to start you are just plonked into a world and are given no hint as what to do, so you just dig and lay blocks. looking at the key bindings wasn't much help at the minute, its says craft but your left thinking ""craft what"". It looks as tho its going to be a great game in time, but for new players ie everyone I think a little help guid is needed for people to find there feet as it will get boring very quick wondering around a big world with no idea.

But now, they will make money with every bit of code they put in the game. If it's just a skin or a weapon, or whatever.

								Originally, this was a positive review. This was a few days after 8/11/2015. I bought this game on the expectation that new content would be added. It has been two months now. No updates have been added. The official blog hasn't seen a new post since the end of August. The Facebook page hasn't posted anything. This game seems promising, but I see no reason to suggest that anyone drop $20 on it right now.As of 8 October 2015, what you will get for your investment will amount to, perhaps, 20 hours of play time. The art style is great. The overall feel is pleasant. The game is more or less playable, though you hit something of a brick wall in terms of progression very quickly. There is no music, so the ambient wind sound tends to make the game feel very eerie. You will probably fall through the map a few times. The world also feels quite lonely as animals do not spawn often and are rather sparse.TL;DR, follow this game. Add it to your wishlist. Check back here in 6 months.			"

Lol.3 minutes later: Crafted a Slingshot. Don't know how it works but threw it. Couldn't find it.5 minutes later: Craft a slingshot again. Still don't know how it works, threw it by accident again, found it. Pwheew!7 minutes later: Started building my wacky house. I used different kinds of wood to make the house. Ew. Ugly.9 minutes later: Messing with the Hoe and planted some Apples! Awesome! Ate some seeds by accident.11 minutes later: Some how made a torch. It so cool because you can plant it into anything!14 minutes later: ... What now? I got a hatchet, pick, hoe.... let try crafting something else!15 minutes later: ... It not crafting anything I want.16 minutes later: ... I need to go on google to learn how to craft stuff. But.... will it save the game?Exited the game.Comes back. It saved it.Quickly Googles everything.1 hour later: Out of everything I looked at, this came to mind: "" AHAAAA! I KNOW HOW TO MAKE A TORCH! ""On a serious note:  Support the game if you find this game really interesting. Make sure you can use the requirement, and make sure everything is perfect because if one little thing doesn't work... the game won't work. Also, when I first started the game... I THOUGHT there was no Full screen. That is not the case, because full screen... you have to push Alt + Enter. Sort of like Dos-Box. This game is really nice and I hope the developers can make it more Pretty/beautiful textures to look at than it is now.I'm playing on Windows 8.1 (windows 8) and playing with no problems what so ever.

I found TUG from the 1.6.2 versions of Aether II, when Gilded Games was helping Nerd Kingdom. 2 years later, this game is -insert cruel phrase here-. The game is completely UNPLAYABLE, unless you have a super computer with Direct X 11 specifically. Oh, don't worry, I lied before, you can still run it..WITH AN INCREDIBLE 3-5 FPS!!! This  game seems fun, but due to the fact that 75% of the people who bought this can't run it, it's a waste of your money and an extreme dissapointment to everyone. NO, I do not reccomend this game anymore. If you are looking for a good, solid sandbox building game, look up MINECRAFT.			"

								Now I'm gonna be honest here: TUG had sooo much potential. When it was first asking for backers on nerdkingdom's website. Me and a couple of friends of mine, had it before it even was on steam. We wanted that money we put in to help go to the development of this game. We all wanted to see it become the next phenomenon of gaming. But instead, we watch it flounder.My recommendation for the customer:Save your money for Overwatch or something. Until we see results, my viewpoint doesn't change.My recommendation for the Developer, NerdKingdom:Listen to the community. See what you can change. If they want a crafting change, Overhaul it. If they want something removed, do it. If they want something added, do it. Morale, Listen to what your consumers want. You'll appear more friendly and caring to the community.			"

								Mediocre. Limited content. Terrible inventory system. Make that infuriating inventory system. Game switching to F2P for no apparent reason other than the studio simply can't finish the game. Devs are too focused on shiny new things instead of the game itself. This one isn't going to get done any time soon, if ever. IMHO the devs are incapable of finishing this product not because of talent level or skill but because they lack focus and direction.Come back in a year or so but do so at your own risk.			"

								Minecraftesque Sandbox game, there is some survival, but its not very difficult yet. Performance is great for an early alpha and so is the crafting.No containers yet but things look so cool on the ground like chopped wood, i love stacking it one by one.Great work on the most recent build, I was finally able to play multiplayer with friends for hours with no crashes, now that multiplayer is working this game will be getting hours of my time.

								I'll just add another thumbs down to this game.Bought it early access- seemed original and artistic and promising but wasnt really playable. I tried it again from time to time to check on the progress- developers seemed to be nice guys and seemed to be working on getting the game playable, then, well,  they stopped. Just like that. At least they said thanks for the money I gave them. I've supported other early access games before and felt like I got my money's worth even when the game crashed and burned but these guys never really even put out a playable game. The devs should done more before taking peoples money. Whatever. More dissapointed than mad because this could have been good.			"

								Currently very underdeveloped with lots of broken/unfulfilled promises. When I bought this game in 2014, so many great things were promised... enough to make me buy the game to support development. But now, nearly two years later, the game is still just as incomplete and unplayable. There was great potential with their ideas for the game, but with the current state of things, I'm not sure if we will ever see a completed game. Also, there's no point making a ""v2.0"" when there wasn't even a completed v1.0, It's just bad practice no matter what kind of software it is. Finally, to me, while monetization of aesthetics is better than that of actual content, it still tells me that they are just wanting more money as microtransactions have proven to be far superior to regular methods; microtransactions won't work when people don't even want to play the game in the first place because it barely exists.tl;dr: Stay far, far away (possibly another galaxy) until they get their act together			"

								2 years have passed, not much progress made at all, and now the game is or will be free with plans to remake the entire game from scratch, but way dumbed down and simplified. Apparently they plan on removing voxel / destructible world and allow the game to be played on mobile devices. Way to go dumbass. You couldn't just leave a good game with amazing potential alone and create an entirely new game or something?I paid full price for a game I will no longer be able to play anymore. I made a request for my very first refund and was denied... go figure.Old original review:Tug, in it's really, really early stage in development, is already a really interesting game. Within a 1/2 hour of playing, you'll see how early in development the game is. The scenery is already very impressive though, the quality in graphics is already really nice. The controls are easy and simple to work with and gameplay is pretty good as well. The AI is extremely basic right now though... it's easy to out maneuver the only enemy creatures out there, and they're also easy to kill once you have a weapon. There's a creature in the game in which is very creepy and can scare the pants off of anyone with their screams (I know this because it takes a lot to scare me even slightly), but they seem to be completely harmless. There isn't too much content yet to keep a person busy for a long time like other similar games which are further in development obviously, but there is enough to see and do to keep a person busy for about 10 hours or more depending on play style, and I'm sure as this very young game develops further, we'll see a lot more content making the game all that much better giving us hundreds more hours of content. There's plenty of glitches and occasional crashes here and there as well as the potential to corrupt the save file (unlikely though it did happen to me once while I suicided off a mountain clipping through the terrain upon death and spawning inside the terrain falling and dying again). The crashes are more than tolerable because the game automatically saves all the time and you can also manually save after doing something if you're nervous of a crash, though I kind of wish it had multi save files in case it corrupted itself again.One thing I will say is you WILL get permanently lost a lot while exploring because there is no compass or map and the foliage and terrain is very thick and difficult to see at a decent range while in the forest. I recommend crafting a bed asap and build towers everywhere around your base to help prevent yourself from getting lost (though you'll likely still get lost anyways if your base is in the forest, lol). The best place to build a base would probably be at the edge of a forest biome near another biome so you have that edge to follow and isn't hidden inside the forest but is near the forest so you can collect all the trees needed.I paid the full $11 for this game and I have zero regrets so far. The direction the game is going looks great so far, next big update potentially being multiplayer support? The only thing I can suggest is for ppl to research a little more into it before buying so that they're not surprised by how early in development the game is in.Will update this review as I play it more. Current review is based off of v0.6.5			"

								I'm torn about it in the present state. Really like the graphics/atmosphere, it is very refreshing in a way, especially with these mushroom man/spirit ones who poof into mushrooms if you manage to corner or face them full on. Very cute and the whole feels indeed much more like a world and living unit than most games, who usually feel like ""background setting vs. objects to interact with"".But without the dedicated server the attraction of it has been lost for me quickly, playing with others is what triggered my interest after all. That and the day-night cycle rhythm isn't working for me, most of the time it is too dark, either dusk or dawn or night. The game is at too early a stage to feel like there is much to do currently, especially if there were several people playing together. But I'm confident that is a matter of development time. The team is small after all.And the ""pile things to craft"" system is a bit annoying, physics having things topple is frustrating sometimes and I spend a lot of time switching between inventory and belt and sorting things back and forth so I have what I need to pile on the ground for crafting. It would be great if there was a button that would cycle between ALL slots (belt, inventory etc) putting things into your hand so one would overcome that tiring UI quirk.Overall though: I recommend getting the game if on sale, not sure I would pay $20 for it at the current stage even to support Early Access. They simply have too little output in its current form to make it feel like much development is happening. On the other hand I liked it enough to start a wiki on wikia (the other two wikis existing are either too confusing in page setup/editing templates for me or too rudimetary in wiki function, sorry, I tried) and updated all the recipes I could find. Have a look at http://tug.wikia.com .			"

There are far too many missing features (a map for instance) to make it really enjoyable and the devs don't seem to be keeping up with the development.

								So far I have about 20 hours in it and It's great. But be warned, it is alpha and could take a left turn at any time. Some of the negative reviews I have read have to do with the crafting system but I like it. You have to gather you items ang put them in front of you craft them by pressing the G key. To me it is more realistic. Some complain that if you are on a hill your things will roll down the hill. What do you think they would do for real.Anyway, the days are to short and you have to eat and drink to often but it's not much of a problem. At the moment there is only one kind of enemy and they are large cats. And I like that right now. There are goats and mushroom men { that are kind of creepy}. I know it's not going to stay this way but I like the idea that you have this whole world to live in a this one rival out there ready to kill you at any time. it keeps me on my toes and looking around wathching for him. I'd rather do that than have zombies running all over the place.They have a lot of things in store for the game, potions, magic religion, language, in depth crafting, mining, weather. I'm hoping for family, children and being able to carry on from one generation to another.So far it is a great game and I would highly recomend it. Let's just hope thwy don't get to far off the path.			"

								For what it seems, Nerd Kingdom have made a rather fun game. Dispite my graphics card whining and complaining that Direct X 11 is a pain in its backside, the game chugs along at what appears to be similar to  a similar pace to most survival games in the vein of Minecraft. You start with nothing, and you have to work your way up.You'll need to build a place or make a base as quickly as possible, and not to survive the night. The cats come out to play and the suprise of the giggling children know as Kinokojin(Those things scared the everliving daylights out of me).It features an interesting method of creating items. Without pointing out every crafting recipe under the sun, your basic tools use a stone of a set type, followed by one vine and a tool stickDoes it have potential? Yes, it definately does. Keep an eye on their Trello page for some interesting information as well as their YouTube channel. It is always intersting to see what they are going to add next.Edit: I've re-written the review after a few more hours of gameplay.			"

								TUG is a brilliantly crafted indie game with much potential. It is potentially focusing on human interaction with the world around them and letting people make their own choices with their own vessels/seedlings. This game so far is pretty much a survey, gathering information on how people play, their dislikes and fancies, what they feel must be added and what must be revoked. I have been following this game since early developement, eagerly waiting for the day that TUG would be released on Steam. So... F*CK YEAH!

								From someone who has spent a lot of time doing Surivial  and Sandbox games, as well as alpha and beta testing in other games, Nerdkingdom has done a fantastic job.I bought into the Early Access Alpha several years ago, and I've been rather pleased with the progress of the game. In its early days, we had no multiplayer,  we had no critters, just nice plants and trees and the ability to make some very limited tools.    As it is now,  there are many crafting stations that can be made to make more advanced tools,  there are  a handful of critters to make the lands more interesting, you can plant and grow many crops,  some of which can be used at a lighting source.   The game itself looks amazing.    I think it is welll worth  the early access and an amazing game.			"

But if you want an open cutscene and dialogue-less narrative like you were promised, wait until they finish it.Unlike a lot of early access games, Nerd Kingdom is actually working on this, and adds updates regularly, but they just have so far to go I cant possibly recommend it.lmao they trashed this♥♥♥♥♥♥br>give me my ♥♥♥♥ing money back			"

Early Access Review
								Re-review Edit (May 2015)The graphics currently don't look anywhere as good as they did when I first played six months ago. They've gone from a cartoony art style to a more realistic one but they're a bit ugly. So it's not ""gorgeous"" like I claim.A developer has assured me on their forums that the current graphics are only temporary. They shared footage of how it should look in a few months time and it will look awesome again.Gameplay-wise it's still much the same game but with some good new stuff. Traps are particularly cool.Original Review (Dec 2014)I'm so in love with the developer's plans for this game. Six minutes into one youtube video and I was sold on it.Like just the fact that you craft items by placing them on the ground, or in some cases on a crafting workspace, rather than it all happening in your inventory is charming. It's hardly revolutionary but design features like this (and future ones) are all oriented at providing a more immersive in-the-game rather than in-the-ui experience.At the moment it's slightly bare. You can build well enough and the crafting and farming systems are good. The game looks gorgeous. If you enjoy games like minecraft just for the pleasure of building then you could already get a lot of satsifaction out of this game. Otherwise you might to hold off a little. The devs say multiplayer should arrive soon. And presently you can't customise your character at all. It just randomly changes every time you load the same game. Bit weird that. But their ultimate plans for character appearance customisation are very interesting.So I'm very happy to recommend the game but it may not be for everyone in its current state.			"

								Where to begin with TUG? If your like me and have followed the game for a while you will kind of understand what the game is going to be about. At the moment its a very typical Alpha game and is fairly buggy. All you can do so far is build and explore in creative and play a gamemode called 'survival games'. Survival games is pretty much the hunger games of TUG. You spawn in, you find some materials, craft tools and kill other people. The map is VERY limited compared to how it will be.At the moment of writing this they are working on new terrain, water etc to make the game awesome!A lot of the community is focused around the survival server (when it arrives). There will be official servers with lots of people on. A ton of people on the forum have posted concepts for guilds, armies, empires etc? Thats one thing I love.. everyone gets into the spirit of becoming a civilisation and actually being part of the world. What can you expect?-Non blocky building-Indepth survival-More terrain tools and building tools-Offical servers-Proper survival-TONS more items. There is so much that is going to be added? So far the lore has been based around the developers (Merylisk in paticular) putting out runes for the community to decode and work out some kind of language for TUG. Eventually the lore will be much more involved in the game, such as finding old ruins etc. The lore isn't handed to you, you can choose to completely ignore it! Or you can go indepth and try to uncover and solve everything you find.One of the things I love is that the developers seem to understand proper survival! You can't just spawn into the world and create a perfectly made stone tool, you have to scavenge for resources and find materials to add together, it seems fairly reaslistic at the moment and the crafting is very diverse. If the basic crafting at the moment is the very basics of the game, the advanced crafting such as smelting, molding etc is going to be amazing!Should you buy this game? I dont know. It depends on what you want. If you want an open world, minecraft-ish (I really shouldn't say that but its the best way to describe it so far) style gameplay with large online trading and fighting, then yeah, buy this game. Buy this game if you like modding, buy this game if you like building. Just buy the game :DOne last thing! The developers are awesome! They always talk to you on twitter or the forums if you message them :D They quite often join in games with us guys aswell.			"

Early Access Review
								After playing for a few hours I think I'm ready to write this review.    First thing to take note of is that it's in early alpha, this means that everything could change. Another thing is that there WILL be glitches and crashes that you WILL experience throughout your playthrough. This game dips a bit into the minecraft environment but then goes into its own world.     Now let's talk about the actual game. When you first spawn in I had to look at the wiki. I had NO clue on how to get started, though once I found out what I was supposed to do I began to build up my resources. After getting mauled by Sabertooth Tigers I finally found my new home. At this point I was scared, always watching my back in case another Sabertooth Tiger was ready to pounce on me. Then above all that, I had little girls laughing at me, that's freakin' creepy man. To sum that up, I was REALLY feeling the intensity of the game, When I first heard the cave sounds I booked it out of there and never went back.     The crafting is actually a really nice idea, the fact that you're actually crafting on the ground, on flat rocks and then on workbenches (depending on the item your crafting) makes it more realistic. Another thing is that when you're actually looking at the recipe you can actually SEE how the cobination of these things will make the item you'll be crafting.    The building in the game is quite easy to do, the ability to see where a item will be placing is also a nice little extra for building. The blocks meld together which gives it a nice natural feel to your builds. Remember: If you have the materials, you can build anything you want.   Food is essential to survive, we all know that right? TUG allows players to plant crops varrying from pumpkins, gourds to cherry trees. Another thing you can eat is meat from goats. That’s all the food for now but I’m sure they’ll be adding lots more in the future.   The graphics are fine for the stage of development it’s in. Don’t expect some amazing top notch graphics from TUG, if you do that you have a high chance of being disapointed. Though, again this is in Early Alpha so everything COULD change. There’s some things they’re working on like better terrain generation, alchemy, and different things of the sort. Multiplayer will also help the game incredibly, once you bring in multiplayer the people who already have the game create a chain reaction. Player -) Friend -) Another Friend -) Another Friend -) ANOTHER FRIEND and so on.   Overall, I say buy it while it’s cheap.You get a game with a lot of potential and all of its updates for only $10 Once this game gets more and more features I can see it being sold for around $30-$45 easily.

								EDIT: After some promt help from the developers, thanks Auti0, I have the game up and running and am enjoying it immensely, can't wait to see what happens as it moves from early access into full release!ORIGINAL: As much as I am still looking forward to the game I would keep in mind that its still incredibly early in the development, everything I have seen looks great and the future plans look amazing but as is I would consider the $10 a pre-order and a donation to the TUG crusade, I can't even start the game, get an APPCRASH instantly, everytime, can't find the cause.

From the sounds of things, they are giving up on the game and making it free-ware?  It is another disappointment from the gaming industry for us to get yet another unfinished product.  Hopefully they will release sourse or whatever it takes for others to finish it or at least make it more playable.			"

								Uh, no. Just no. I couldn't even make passed 2 hours of game play. First off, I couldn't play with just one other person to safe my life. When I first bought and tried this game, you were being seriously forced to open up your router to some IP address of your friend. When so many other games on the market just let you play with another person and connect with so much ease. Not everyone has static IP any way. No thank you. I don't get this old type of stuff of doing things for games anymore.  Can't recommend this trash.Then nothing was really explained and I couldn't even get into the game since like 10 mins after playing I was randomly dead. WTF? Wasn't optimized well either. Ran like trash. Later I found out by the people who made this game that their 100% intention was with a bunch of ppl who were shrinks, etc wanted to make this game in particular to basically study human behaviour. How people responded, acted, and played together and to read all of your chat to other people. Meaning that you the player were simply a lab rat to them. The obviously failed at building and completing this game years later since it wasn't really their initial intention. Infact, recently a dev responded on the following link: https://www.reddit.com/r/tug/comments/414taf/tug_dev_ama/So 3 yrs later we get this post:[–]inoritewtf[S] 1 point 18 days ago Hugs are always welcome, regardless of situation.For a very brief moment, we discussed making DX11 TUG free (lets call that 1.0). But the reality is, we dont WANT an explosion of new players. Moving to openGL (2.0), gives us an opportunity to almost emerge with a fresh start, new engine, new art, more hardware usable than ever before, and no barrier to jump in and play, mod, or break things.edit: also, we so much dont want to get any new players, that we are going to stop selling TUG next week, and not give anyone new any access until 2.0 is ready.*****   "" We don't want new players "" but we are going F2P! LMAO! Lab rat, you:http://www.fredericknewspost.com/blogs/blogs_collection/weave_to_the_write/tug-a-study-in-gaming/article_575b4a7a-bbe3-11e2-b59f-0019bb30f31a.htmlhttps://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/05/22/making-it-with-science-a-tug-interview/Say no to TUG. They weren't interested in making a real sandbox game to begin with. They were studying you, the player cause they were frustrated adult MMOERS on MMOS and wanted to ""study"" you. That's why the game isn't done. It never will be. Skip this trash. Save your money. They will nver bring you the elements you want in a sandbox game or the ones you liked or missed from other ones. These ppl can't bearly handle the game they have in their hands right now as it is.TUG ALTERNATIVES:You can go play your minecraft or Creativerse that F2P but the devs don't penny you to death, or even ARK that's is fast rapid development with devs who care.They even say it here that they are not running a slot machine: http://steamcommunity.com/app/280790/discussions/0/490124466479381984/Or:Both diff styles of games for gamers looking for other options. Anything is better than Tug. Sorry for fan-bois but Tug is a no go. It isn't even a real game and was never meant to be one.Or: Space engineers, Medieval Engineers, Cities Skylines: also available on steam. Or: Minecraft.			"

								I have played a little bit in this game and it has its potential. Of course it is deep, very deep alpha and lot of things must be done. Yes it have bugs. Yes it do not have a lot of features. But i hope(and sure) that it will be developed in something great. So far system of crafting items present itself in some interesting process. Recipe? Forget about it. You just scavenge items and try to do something with that stuff you just collected. You feel like you just from the cave and try understand this world. Of course it needs a lot of things to craft(recipes), more survival aspects like poisoning from food(because i just eating all the stuff i found and it will be interesting to discover what i must to eat and what not), wild animals, maybe some weather aspects and so on. So to sum this i looking forward to see what the developers will add.			"

I love the idea they have behind it but there is a lot things they could do to improve the game and make it friendly to new people. You get thrown right into the game with no idea how to play or what your goal is in the game. There is no tutorial in game telling you even how to make your 1st tool.Hopefully they will implement some sort of guide in the game to make it at least a little more simple to understand in the start of the game.Also from what I've seen there is no way to make the game fullscreen. only change the resolution.

								After hearing about the debale of Yogventures, I was directed to TUG, which seemed to be being touted as the replacement, of sorts, as a game that would allow such a great deal of flexibility and freedom. I thought I'd take a shot at buying it. The first warning was when my usual PC wouldn't run it, despite it having no problem with things like Skyrim, bioshock infinite and other AAA titles. The game, it turns out, requires DX11, and a 2Gb graphics card, along with a whole host of other outlandish features just to run. That is, if you're missing any of those, it won't run slower, it just won't run at all. The recommended settings are even higher. My higher end PC doen't have the 3Gb graphics card it recommends, but at least it'd run. After this, I figured this must be a pretty incredible game to have such lofty requirements. I mean, I know it's early access, but they must be doing something with all these requirements, right?Starting it up, I can't describe how disappointing it is. This looks like a unity game someone game up with in a weekend. The graphics do not look good, for any stage of development. This looks absurdly bad. The really worrying thing is that this looks like the developers have an engine and are making a game in it, which is fine for an indie game, but it isn't fine when they are devouring resources like this. The state of the game doesn't give a lot of hope they are going to be able to optimise this to run on lower spec machines once there's something worthwhile actually there. I hope I'm proved wrong, and this becomes the sort of game it looks like it could be, but right now it feels like Yogventures part II. A developer that has lofty goals, a partnership with Yogscast, and an overreaching ambition it can't match. If you want a game like this to work, maybe take a lesson from minecraft, and focus on getting things to work mechanically before requiring a computer of the gods to run it.			"

								TL;DR version: Incomplete - can be played but feels unfinished, and falls far short of the Kickstarter plans. Company has changed funding systems a couple of times and it's doubtful they'll finish the game. PR announcements are very much ""please be patient"" without stating any specific goals or timelines.I wanted so much to love this game. I backed it on Kickstarter because of the charming concept video, noted the high hardware requirements (at the time) and made sure, over a year later, that when I bought a new laptop, it had the specs to run TUG. A few months after that, I tracked down my invite key (everyone who'd paid for access, even beta or later, got an alpha access key) and sorted out how to connect through Steam and use the regularly-updated dev version, and... bleh.Not only are the features I waited for not here, not only does it look like the features I'd love to see won't be included (music, for one), the company is so fraught with changes that it doesn't look like the game will ever be functional as originally advertised.It's playable now. It's enjoyable now, if you like a particular style of explore-and-build, which I mostly do. Crafting is ""unique,"" which is a euphemism for ""we decided to ignore a couple decades' worth of game development and come up with a system that's entirely non-intuitive and also prone to mistakes."" (To craft: you place items on the ground, next to each other, and press ""G"".) But it's woefully incomplete, and there's no evidence that will ever change; the dev team doesn't seem to have a clear plan, even if they had funding, which is shaky. What's missing:* Ladders - a way to change height without elaborate spiral staircases* Carts - a way to haul stuff other than in a very limited backpack* Hosted multiplayer - Nerd Kingdom originally planned to host ""Survival"" (PVP anything goes) and ""Adventure"" (which most players seem to think means ""easy mode"") servers; while multiplayer is now possible, there are no dedicated servers* About half the creatures mentioned in the Kickstarter (to be fair, there were fewer a year ago; progress is being made here)* Renewable resources - once you've grabbed the axe rocks and cut down wood trees from your local area, they're gone, meaning you really can't build sustainable communities - you have to keep traveling farther for basic supplies* Compass, or any other reasonable way to find ""home"" once it's not visible* Writing, or any other way to leave messages for yourself or other players* Several types of envronmental blocks and building supplies that are probably planned - lava, water, cloth, * Many kinds of tools* Golems (from the kickstarter), other NPCs, deitiesWhen (if?) TUG starts again - it's unavailable for purchase as I write this, which is not a good sign for its long-term success - I recommend checking recent reviews to find out if it's become viable.			"

								Devs are scammershttp://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-07-17-kickstarter-funded-yogventures-canned-backers-given-steam-key-for-another-game-insteadSo those people who got that game were refunded with tug as a game... it's a free game anyways.....if they make it f2pSorry we/they scamed you..... Heres a game for free cause we are sorry...................The game is free anyways so how the hell is this any good.........So if tug going to give us a game thats free and has no refund value at all cause the game they give is free.....Tug will most likely not refund you at all1 just look at the link. They will most likely give you something that is free and make you think it was not free.2. Like they would even give you your money back. If they were we would have our money now.why should we wait to be refunded when we want it now....The game is going to be free and if not then it would be on steam and able to buy.... if we get money back and they still sell game then we would have to rebuy game to play it.3 ya those are other devs that did that.........Or are they.......Some people put 300$ into Yogventures. $570,000 in all. The Dev talk with NK and tug was givin as a refund game key to backers.Tugs going to be free now so backers now have no refund.It's a win win scam that both NK and Yogscast took your moneyhttp://www.polygon.com/2014/7/25/5937013/yogscast-kickstarter-yogventures-tug-nerd-kingdomwhen tug dies I feel Nk will change their name and make another game and refund you will that fake free game like they already have done.There is a list of devs who use the name change scam and help the people who were con by conning them some more.-----------------------------------------------------Reveiw 1/17/2017So now tug 2 is soon to come.http://store.steampowered.com/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/84840457400260692So now people who bought a game got another game and those who got that game are now getting a whole new other game. Remember they said they are going away from F2P. So now you will have to buy another new game for new players(if old tug owners get tug 2 free)old backers (yog)Buy a game don't get it (yog)Get othergame you did not buy as refund (tug)Game becomes whole new game (tug 2)backers (tug)Buys game to play(kinda bare bone missing things(kinda fun but too naked))turns into whole new gamenew backer (tug 2)buys game... I wounder what could possible happen next(hit or miss...or another game I don't realy know)			"

That's my biggest complain.From what I can tell so far, developpement progress has been going slowly and game is not much fun (yet). Overall it's not bad but I can't recommend it right now for being an Alpha release.I have hope they will add more content, have working key bindings and easier gameplay (without having to look at all the tutorials just to do simple things). I'm not expecting much from this title and I regret buying this game in a Early Access state. I will change my review if they can fix my complains.			"

								TUG is the epitome of arrogance and developing in an epistimic bubble. What started out with all sorts of ambitions and promises to just get people to pay for the game or support it for a kickstarter was nothing more than a bait and switch intended to create a proof of concept for an angel investor once funds raised prior to that was mismanaged, squandered and dried up.This is why you do not purchase a game on ""potential"" or ""faith"".  And this is before one gets into the poor shape of the game's actual features and development. Just a shame and complete waste on so many levels.Do not support this game or this company. Steer very VERY far away.			"

								TUG's a Good enough game. I bought it early in its development and things were all over the place at that point and wasnt particularly playable.Since then lots advancements in texture and crafting but this game needs more! The world feels very empty, almost as if the world hass ended and only you a few goats have survived.  Terrain generation have improved dramatically...at least in the indev version but it still seems very samey and you fast run out of things to gather in terms of materials and well anything else. As far as survival game goes your unlikely to find an easier one, farms quickly produce you enough food (2 pumpkin plants will feed youy confortably) and leave you little to do but dig holes in mountains and the floor till you get a tired of it and turn it off , not to return for a week or more.Ive see nthe upcoiming development and I think its going the wrong way. Right now you can create potions. bronze age tools which is great... but for what reason? none you wont need them cause all youll be doing is digging and farming around your home as the game has no Map at all so stragy to far and you well loose everything.Instead of adding more to craft add more to do , Who needs a bronze axe when you cant stick it in another plyers face and tell them it was accident? , work on gettting multiplayer working for survival mode cause as things stand I cant play with my friends which is surely death for a build and survive game.These games all miss one thing for me eveytime which is purpose and choice of activity.  Never any kind of NPC Characters, towns, proper dungeons or fun. just dig block place block eat pumpkin!			"

								It could -potentially- be a great game.  It has all the right ingredients... it just needs a _lot_ more time in the oven.  The crafting bits are rudimentary at best, there are plenty of beasts in the way, but little means of defending yourself.  The AI of the beasts is so brain dead, if they don't kill themselves first, they'll just pop out of nowhere and kill you instead.The guides for this are fairly uncommon.  Receipes are NOT intuitive.  Day/Night cycle is too short, and while there's tons of great screen shots, half of the things IN them don't even function (chests, backpacks, etc. don't work).  You have a atrociously low inventory, and things that you think would stack easily doesn't.  For instance, you can only carry 3 Bamboo Sticks in a stack.  Need to carry more?  Use up more inventory slots for another three.Not to mention, the game updates for this are coming too slowly.  Little has been added in the last few months, and while I applaud the effort by the devs, frankly, at this rate this game won't be finished for another 2-3 years.Save your money and get this on a Steam Sale when it finally releases (hopefully before the universe implodes).

								Edit: I am not so much changing my opinion of the game as it is right now, right now I would not recommend this title as it is a bit rough around the edges and has a long way to go yet. However if a brief demo is available or you see the gameplay videos and like the idea of the game don't hesitate to support the devs as they work towards a finished product. As it stands right now I cannot recommend that anyone pay for this game unless they want to support the development. It is rough and very buggy but that is to be expected with something still in the early stages. I played for as long as I could stand to, It shows great promise once they refine it and work out the many thousands of bugs. At it's current level of development it is practically unplayable in any entertaining way. I can craft anything without harvesting resources, I can dig endlessly without even moving since aparently I have the world's longest arms. This game would benefit from a plot and campaign storyline to explain what you are and give you tasks to accomplish as a kind of tutorial. Overall right now this game is a 3/10 with potential to be much more. Keep your eyes on this game but unless you want to support the development avoid purchasing it until several dozen updates come along.			"

								Update - 17/01/16 ""Into the coming months, we will be focusing on what is defined as a 'minimally viable product,' that is to say, 'what does this game experience feel like, with polish, for a short play session,'""Because a short play session and minimal features is exactly what I look for in a sandbox.....jeez. (When you read that bear in mind the 8.5 million investment a year ago).UPDATE - 21/07/16  changed to not recommended.How very disappointing....No longer purchasable on steam. Once again we find ourselves here. A promising game, promising the world, slowing and then stalling in development which I can only assume comes about due to one of two things management of the money or capability of the developers to produce, take your pick (Same with all failed kickstarter/ea/whatever bs to grab some cash fotm scheme). We now find ourselves in a very familiar ""considering f2p"" and reboot/redesigning/starting from scratch with a new engine situation which will no doubt result in an extended period of no meaningful development.Shame. I suppose the last couple of years following the promises and hyped potential of the game in development is as good as it is ever gonna get.Reading between the lines in the review below the signs were there. So I leave you with this in regards to tug.  Its a failure. Eeking out its last few breathes while it tries to minimise the ill will generated by noone else but itself...Add it to the custom S*** list with the likes of the stomping land. Forget about it and move on fondly remembering its one time potential.....--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Very early alpha. It crashes, its poorly optimised and the keybindings/controls are an obstacle to actually playing, Saying that, its easy to see its going to be fun when finished.Its atmospheric, has an original crafting system and stylish looks when its stable and working.Currently there is no multiplayer and any implementation of pvp. (next patch apparently) On top of this, just in the news it was announced that half the team has been made redundant. (apparently a deal fell thro, but they had a big team for an indie dev)Seeing past the rough edges you can glimpse a gem in the working. As long as development continues I have no problem recommending this for its current price of approx £6. Time will tell.Important note - The current price is about to triple when the next patch arrives so now would be a good time to invest for a decent future title.  To be fair unlike a lot of early access games I think this was fairly priced for its current state. When the price does rise I will re-evaluate.Kherny.			"

I've owned this game over 3 years now and I've only seen maybe 5 updates. The devs are trying to decide to change the game to F2P instead of P2P after all these years of owning and all these people that paid for it. They removed the game for sale off Steam while trying to decide what to do. Just a bumber.			"

								Should you buy TUG alpha version 0.8.5? It depends:Do you want to be able to spend a few hours in a row playing a game the way you're used to? If so, DO NOT buy TUG during the Alpha stage of Early Access. You will be disappointed at the lack of content and features. Do you expect a polished and optimized engine? Don't buy TUG yet, it's just not that far along. On the other hand, do you want to talk with the developers about how things might work before they're added? Do you wonder whether people play games differently when game mechanics change? Do you just like discussing what you love about gaming? Then maybe you'll enjoy owning TUG alpha. (I'm having a blast!) Don't get me wrong, you will be able to play around in TUG. You can spend a few hours fighting friends, playing around with what harvesting and crafting is there, or building a huge base in creative mode. You can mod many aspects of the game, make fan objects, art. or textures, put up YouTube tutorials, and watch the occasional livestreams. But as of this writing, much of the gameplay just isn't there yet. That is just the way Alphas work. Early access development is pretty active: updates don't happen frequently, but every new release includes large changes, and several brand new types of gameplay. (Version 0.8.5 added the first version of aging and body morphing, completely revamped how the sky looks and works, and added some new clothing and building material recipes.)So, before you buy, check out the game forums here[forum.nerdkingdom.com], watch TUG's In The Works videos, read through the kickstarter update posts here. Do the features currently in place sound fun? Are you inspired by the vision and possibilities? Are you itching to talk about the ways you love to play? Then decide whether it's too early to pay for.			"

								Release=====> early 2015This Steam version is a gift for persons who supported the kickstarter campaign. Editors gave a playable version of their game.Really rough around the edges the game is not actually capable to entertain you for a long time. Many aspects are missing.But the game is promising, many planned features, very cute and at this moment it's an overall good work.You are some kind of gnome droped in a zone where you have to gather items to survive against other gnomes (players).You can choose the type of zone you where you want to play (you have five different zone with 3 sizes). Maps are quite cute and has a normal size, i hope they will increase the overall size of the lands.You can discover many ways to craft the few tools and weapons present in the game. There is not tutorial and it is part of the charm of it. There are no survival aspects at the time only a food bar wich is decreasing quite quickly (devs will fix that). The game seems pvp oriented, actually this is the only great aspect of the game because in single player you can't save your progress and it starts to be annoying quite quickly.I recommend this game for people who wants to support a cute little game really different from actual standards.For the others ( how's money is the main aspect) wait a bit but don't forget TUG ... because originals projects are in general a clue of well made games.TUG ! We haven't done with you !			"

								At the current moment TUG seems promising, an interesting crafting system, pretty good grafics, and it is enjoyable to play despite the fact that it is still in alpha. HOWEVER, I am a bit weary of the game. It could turn out to be something like ""The Stomping Land"" or ""Starforge"" where the devs screwed the community over. OR it could turn out like Mojang's ""MineCraft."" One can only hope for the latter. It seems to be leaning towards the way of Minecraft with involved devs and community created content. I recommend this game due to its potential, although I have no idea if it will live up to it.			"

								Although I had early problems getting the game to work, the devs quickly responded to my issues.  I've now spent several hours in game, and I can't wait for the next few updates.  TUG reminds me of the early Minecraft and Terraria days.  If you want to explore for yourself and figure out the various crafting recipes, you'll have plenty of opportunity to do so.However, the similarities between TUG and Minecraft/Terraria aren't complete.  It has a unique crafting model, where you place the ingredients together on the ground rather than combining them into a particular shape.  This game is still early beta, but it has a LOT of potential.  I'm looking forward to more.			"

								Very cool game! Love the idea. A bit buggy, it crashed a few times, but that's to be expected. Really looking foreward to seeing how it progresses!Would love to see a more clean cut presentation when building/mining. Was building my house with one big block of wood at a time, then half way through it decided to change to smaller blocks. Not too sure how to mine either. Wouldn't let me use the pick axe on surfaces other than boulders. Love the vairety in flaura! I hope there's as much variety in fauna too.			"

								Keep in mind, this is an early access game.Right now Tug has a stone age and a bronze age tech level and there is little to do, compared to similar games. The artwork is unique but isn't really polished yet.Navigation in the world can be really hard and you might get lost.At the moment there is no falling damage but that helps with tall constuction and exploration.If you can look past these issues that are a natural part of early access you will definately have a good time.Progress feels good and you Building a house, castle and garden is a lot of fun.The world seems endless but since Biomes repeat there is not much to explore boyond a certain distance.However the Engine is capable of creating beautiful landscapes and each biome looks unique and interesting.The game is relatively stable and has very little crashes for an early access game,maybe even less than some finished games.I bought the game for 9,99€ but i would still recommend i9t for the current price.

								TUG. This is a game that is definitly needs improvement and I hope it receives it. Being someone who is incredibly open to games such as these, I can't really say whether I was disapointed or not. If this game receives a proper lore buff and a story to why and what you are, then I can see it being an imaginative success. In the creative sense, its very unique and offers a sort of mystical atmosphere. Devs, please make the improvements you promise.			"

								TUG seems to have a lot of promise, but almost as many development ""bumps"". While the developers are being quite open about some of the delays (including building a new game engine from the ground up it seems), I've still got a some residual concerns over their long absence from Steam in posting news (given that the game is offered on Steam, it's not one of the channels I would have suggested they ignore).Still, there is promise in the game and what the Developers are trying to make it into. Whether they suceed in doing or so or not, is still up in the air, and so for the moment I could not recommend this game.Once TUGv2 comes out and the Devs pile up (to use an Australian slang term) ""some runs on the board"", hopefully I'll have good cause to change the review to a Thumbs Up, but for the moment, if the genre of this game is one in which you have an interest, I could recommend only putting it on your Watchlist and seeing how its development (which does now appear to be in full motion) proceeds.TLDR: Worth keeping an eye on, but not (yet) worth buying.

								I recommend it, though at this time you cannot acquire it. The engine has great potential and I personally haven't found anything ""broken"" or unplayable about it. You simply do everything that can be done and then you don't have much else but exploration and repeating crafting, taming, and resource get. The biggest problems are that the team hasn't been keeping in touch with the community and we haven't seen an update in several moons. I keep looking up their forums and still nothing. The last that was stated was they were updating to a 2.0 (versions are arbitrary so effall on that) but that probably means bumping up the technology to keep up with current-gen graphics and physics and it might be free. If they do make it free, good. I helped them make it happen. I'm not like all the extra nerds who felt like they didn't even get a game. It is a game... just a very short one and I'm used to waiting a year for updates on some of my favorite titles, so I get updates for one game each month and that keeps me busy and helps me enjoy each title more without distraction.

								It is too early to make a lasting decision regarding TUG. Ignoring all of the fairly irritating ""for science!"", the game itself does run smoothly and has a very nice aesthetic and feel, however it is still very early on. I have found my experiences thus far to be pretty similar in terms of excitement and interest for new and original ideas to when I purchased the very early Minecraft Alpha.			"

								TUG is a working game as it stands right now, the creators are rewriting the engine to allow it to run on more systems (right now its only directx 11) and people are complaining because the invested in an early access game and aren't getting excatly what they wanted. I followed TUG through their kickstarter and im quite proud of where it is now, of course I wish it was better but isn't that what you always want? When they are finished with TUG version 2, im sure it will have been worth the wait.			"

								I just feel I have to intervene since there are a lot of people who downvoted the game recently.The game is not in a release state, that is true and the devs are well aware of that.Because of that, the devs decided to stop selling the game, they have been looking for someone who shares their vision, both for the game and how it will be sold and made available, and who is willing to financially support them.They have managed to do so last year, and because of that it is not true that this project is dead, in fact it is nothing but alive.It is true that the communication with the fans has been a bit silent, but if you have followed their updates, especially the one from Jan. 15th here on steam, then you know why.These guys are still on the project and will finish it, I'm sure of that.And I'm also sure that even after finishing it, they will continue to develop it, since this is a project powered by their passion for it.Don't listen to the people that downvoted the game, give it time and it will live up to its promise.

								The best sandbox-survival game I've played. I typically don't like sandbox-survival games, but after watching the videos and seeing its potential, I decided to give it a go. I love it! Like other sandbox games, it focuses on crafting your own materials and hunting wild animals (such as tigers and goats) for resources. The difference, and uniqueness with TUG is a higher focus on who you are as a Seedling, that can grow, change, and morph based on what you eat, how much you craft, etc. You can tame cubs, raise them, breed them, and eventually ride them (I hope, given that there's a saddle in game). It's easy to build your own shelter, make farmland and grow your own plants, etc etc.A lot of negative reviews have low play time and state that it's ""hard"" to figure out. Well, yes, it's an alpha game. If you're having trouble getting going, check out the TUG Crafting Guide in the Community Hub.I would recommend it to everyone, really. This game has so much potential, and it's a lot of fun! "

								It is very rare that I post negative reviews.  it is even more rare that I post negative reviews on EA games because I know they are still a work in progress.  However out of a a fairly large number of surivial games I have in my Steam library TUG has so far been the least fun and for some reason the most complex to figure out.   While Steam is showing that I have only played for about 15 minutes, I have a fair amount more time in the game for some reason that are unaccounted for.  I would guess about 2 hours in the game yet I feel like I really haven't gotten anywhere.   Of the survival / sandbox genre I would say TUG is among the worst of those in my library.  Once again it is in EA so this may change but so far I haven't seen a lot of change that has made me decide it worth holding off reviewing any longer so I wanted to comment.  If things change I will certainly update my review to reflect progress in the game's quality and fun factor.  Right now I can not recommend the game.			"

								Giving positive review. I still have much faith in NK's ability to progress and complete the game, based on some very recent replies from developers themselves on their forums. For those complaining about it's ""Free to Play"" state or about it being dead or abandoned, read the forums and their many lines of communication stating otherwise. Ino, a developer, has recently stated that the game will be slower than people are hoping based on the sheer size of their task and the relatively small development team. Read his comments here (notably the last one) if you need convincing that it isn't dead:http://forum.nerdkingdom.com/discussion/2920/a-new-age#latestThe game is not likely going to be free to play. The game will be removed from Steam in preparation for Version 2. As far as microtransactions and free to play goes, read Ino's comment here: http://forum.nerdkingdom.com/discussion/2875/whats-going-to-happen-to-the-people-who-bought-tug#latestI am a firm believer in TUG and its potential, and I look forward to Version 2 in the hopefully-not-too-distant future.

								While I did not recommend this game I must say this. I continously support the game developers behind a project of this scale. Anyone who hopes for a ""finished"" product should ignore this game for quite some time. The developers released this game very early to the public in hopes to work along with the playerbase. Unlike most people who chose to buy this game, I bought it specifically for this matter, to give them feedback rather than to play it once, write a hateful review, and call it a scam. First off, let me tell you that in no way at all has this game been abandoned. They have been working behind the scenes on their new engine to dropkick DirectX 11, and welcome OpenGL for a much larger audience to enjoy. So far it has been pretty vague, but recently Inoritewtf (Developer) has released an EXTREMELY EARLY tech video of the new engine in the works that you can see here -> 


YouTube™ Video: Q3 demo 

			Views: 529		

			Below is Q3 demo for tech side work. NodeJS integrated 3d game engine, with various graphical functionality, AI + nodal tool supports		

 (Not even sure if I'm allowed to show that). So far it's not much, but give it some time (A long time) and it may be pretty amazing. As for the release of version 2.0, don't expect it to release anytime soon, my best guess is late 2017/ early 2018 but don't rely on that since i'm not a developer.Now it's time for some things I was not impressed with. Although I do like this game and the modding possibilities it has, I was not impressed with the gameplay elements. Part of it seemed good, but when several updates were cranked out, it all seemed a bit rushed with a poor look into what would become of that particular feature.This community just needs to calm down a bit and hold onto their socks for a little while longer. When this new version is out, It will more than likely be a completely different experience, but for now we must deal with this Pre-Alpha version for quite some time. That's all I have to say for now, I will update this review once we are closer to release.			"

								TUG is an exploration and crafting game with a bit of survival yet and a bit of horror (eg. ghost screaming).The world looks nice in TUG with a unique crafting system that has some good but also some weak sides. For crafting you have to put the materials in front of you and press G. If you are lucky you get the right item out of it. The game is almost one year in early access and it still feels very early in development. Currently it is not much fun to play due to the little crafting and building possibilities. In comparison to other early access games i can't recommend it for it's current price and state. There isn't much feedback that i could provide to the development team if there is yet just little to do. However i will come back later and have a look to the progress in playability.+ Beautiful world+ Immersive environment+ Easy digging, cutting trees and mining+ Different way for crafting- Reading Wiki or watching Tutorials is required to be able to use the crafting system (not just for the first time usage)- Random creation of items if there are more then one possible item crafteable from the materials on the ground- Unfinished User Interface- Minimal Settings (for fullscreen press Alt-Enter)- Very little inventory- Very little crafting possibilities- Requires high performance (moving was delayed for me even with above defined hardware spec and standard medium settings)- Feels often very dark with a short field of view- No stairways buildable (you need to jump for every step/building block), therefore you can't really build large buildings- Very good accuracy required not to pick up the wrong items or materials

								Wait until it hits Beta. It might be playable then. It being this poorly optimized and nearly unplayable just doesn't bode well for an Early Access game. This is basically how most real Alpha games play, but also most real Alpha games don't get sold for money. There may be potential, dev is present and forthright but it's far too early to support. Unless you paid a buck for it in its current state, maybe.			"

								Hard to tell this is alpha if your computer meets all the standards..  Great craft system that is far less annoying than any other voxel /  survival game yet.  Pile your stuff on the ground and hit the button & voila!  Item made.  Nice rounded voxels make building feel more realistic, digging even more so.  The world is gorgeous.  The night-time is especially enchanting with glowing crystals and fungus.  The ambient & sound effects are well matched, making for an environment that feels like you're in a storybook adventure.  TUG is a fantasy world easy to get lost in... Incredible potential.  As is it's already a very good game.  With a little polish & some more updates this could stand up to the Minecraft juggernaut.  The artistic style is just splendid.  A lot of heart is going into this one.  Not to mention, the Devs are some of the most responsive & honest on Steam, truly raising the bar for the standard alpha test.  TUG is well worth supporting & already quite fun.			"

In the end though, we seem to have a playable game that I can liken to an RPG I might see on a console, crossed with elements from ARK.

If you can play it for free...it's worth that amount of money, too.The amount that we played, I found the game to be very serene...peaceful even.  The environments are lush and alien and attractive to me.  There wasn't a LOT to do, which is why we only played 1 weekend and never came back, but it was definitely a game I wish we COULD have come back to and I wish the dev would have completed it.  I can understand the anger out there about it being abandoned, but that wasn't my experience, fortunately.  Never spend more on an Early Access title than you'd feel comfortable losing.			"

I would not reccomend to buy it right now but I'd say check back in a year, if nothing had changed then I was wrong but if it accually is something cool and awesome, buy it.Do keep in mind the mod possibilites for this game.

								Kind of dissapointing this game is only for Direct X11 cards, Hopefully it'll be changed soon, But it deffinately has quite a bit of potential, And for 10$ it's a great investment.			"

								So far, this is a fun and interesting game. It is meant to be played with...or against friends...and it does have a steep, and I really do mean steep learning curve. Getting started and crafting useful items is your first main challenge. Crafting in this game is not done on a grid as in most survival/crafting games... instead, you lay the items you want to try combining on a flat surface such as a rock slab and press G on the crafting surface. If the items combine to make something, you will see a crafting bar and then the resulting item afterwards. Take my word on this however...play around and figure out what to combine to make what on your own, don't cheat and look up the crafting recipes. The sense of acomplishment from discovering what makes what is part of the fun. This game has a way of making you feel like a cave man (or woman) discovering the basics of survival. The game is rough around the edges in the current state but this is also a very early build of the game...so keep that in mind. I can see this being a fun one to play with friends, seeing who is the ultimate survivor. :)			"

								if thing are done like The Nerd Kingdom told us , then this is THE game i have been waiting for.i bought the game because i want to support it and i liked the trailer so much that i wanted to see this tech demo as i call it.and see what it was capable off , for now it's just your basic "" minecraft"" esque creative mode with survival game that has probably been implemented for people to have fun while the development is ongoing.If you like the video and expect to do just what was shown to you in the video  DON'T buy it !But if you are like me and like what was shown to you and would like to support the devellopers and get involved in the creation of the game , then by all means buy it			"

								This is an awesome and detailed game that I highly reccomend. The goats are really stupid though XD That's just about the only thing they need to fix as far as I'm concerned. If you are the kind of person that likes being creative and adventurous, this is the game for you, no doubt! For the price, TUG is well worth it, especially for the free updates! We should all get the game now and happily wait for future updates :) Lots of love, nerdkingdom. Lot's of love.			"

								Not much to say at the moment, while it looks like yet another MC clone I think it will bring more to the table than MC did. Hopefully as new updates come out the hardware requirments will drop a little, as right now it wont run on lower-end systems.With a single core A6-5400K APU the game is just a slide show. Once I finish building my new rig It'll probably be able to run just fine.			"

								Even though this game is early in development, I believe it has a lot of potention to be a brilliant and fantastic game overallCurrently the game is very cluncky and it dosnt have very much that was shown in its kickstarter videoBut I believe in time it will come to be a bloody fantastic and awesome gameThis game is trying new things such as days goes on, your character will age from a child, in to a teenager and then in to an adult, the setting of the game is beautiful and I know so much more is going to be addedI recommend this game because currently you can craft and build what you want and thats it but in time so much more will be added and I know it will be worth the weight :P - waitIf you just want to kill a few hours then this is the game for youIf you are like me and you love to support indie developers like this and you want to watch them grow and create the best game that you believe they can, then by all means get this game :)One last thing, there is no tutorial currently so go watch their videos and it will tell you what to doThe game is a lot of fun and thank you all for reading this review of mine :)Take care and see you out there gamers :)			"

It has a beautiful world with many opportunities for exploration.  Even though at this time there is very little content, this game has the potential to be a great game.Do not buy this game at the moment if you expect something with enough content to keep you busy for hours.I recommend this game as it is now to lovers of the pvp survival genre who want to help support this interesting title.I hope that after a few updates I will be able to recommend it to all.

								This game is fantastic for an early access title.  The gathering / crafting / building / surviving all have a unique feel to them, and they're all great implementations.  I love the natural looking landscape, but somewhat rigid building mechanic.  I love that I can use smaller blocks to conserve resources, or build with large minecraft-style blocks.Once I had sorted out the basics of crafting my axe and pick, I was well on my way to building a nice little shelter  on a beautiful hill, overlooking a bamboo forest.Can't wait for more updates.

It is slightly barren at this point and interaction with the enviroment feels rough, but that is what should be expected from a game in its alpha stages. on the other hand, atmosphere and design are absolutely breathtaking. I see so much potential in this game and in the brilliant development team behind it. I highly recommend this masterpiece in the making.			"

Early Access Review
								I haven't played much of this game yet, but from what I have seen, I'm impressed.  I've played diffrent RPG and crafting games before and quite frankly I'm not easily impressed.  (This is after all the only review I have ever written for a game or intend to write.)  I will therefore lay out what will most likely be a rather long dissertation on a deserving game in blocks that can be digested at will in this format:Things I didn't like (short list and always take the bad news first)Things I liked (much longer list)Things I would like to see integrated.  (Based on researching the game wiki and the discussions I've seen on the game's direction.)Things I didn't like:Not much.  Most of these have been brought up by other people, please accept this as my own take and as purely constructive criticism.Game Speed: I use a fairly good computer, but this is the first game I've had serious latency and fps issues with.  I read up on the game and how to mitigate some of this but it is still somewhat of a system resource hog.  I've read other articles where this was brought up and I also read that this is something that may be improving as the game is refined.  It is my sincere hope that this is the case because it was the only thing the prevented me from becoming addicted and having several times more hours devoted to this game than what I have.Animal AI: Likewise something that was brought up in different review and I agree.  In my case I kept looking around for the goats I could hear that kept getting worse and found a ditch close to my base camp where they kept falling in and the number of them kept growing.  I assume this had something to do with spawn behavior, but for now I just promised myself to return later to cash in on easily obtained goat meat as necessary.Things I liked:Two size blocks:  I believe this is an improvement over Minecraft.  Don't get me wrong, I love Minecraft for what it is, but this strikes me as the next logical advancement.  More complex shapes, better environment texture, all of this benefits from a larger number of building blocks available.  I have seen the type of complex mechanisms offered by games like Landmark, and I believe that this is overly involved.  A good balance similar to what is seen in Space Engineers is more desirable to me.  Possible areas for improvement would include slanted blocks so a roof can have an honest slope instead of a stair step effect.  I'm working on a thatch roof hut so it would look better that way.Crafting Component and Crafting Surface Interface:  I will admit that at first I found this to be a bit cumbersome as I was first learning the game.  Admittedly I jumped straight in without doing that much research or watching many videos.  After I got used to it though I quickly fell in love with the quasi-realism.  The system lends itself well to using the same components in different recipes based on what work surface is being used or what tool you are holding.  It can be frustrating, but in the long run rewarding.  I could almost see a realistic NPC trainer scenario where a player coul learn a recipe by watching an NPC or other player laying out the components on the correct surface and equipping the appropriate tool.Item Placement:  I have played Skyrim and one of the most frustrating parts of that game was the item placement mode that didn't give you much control over the items your were placing.  This game has definitely improved in that function.  Instead of containers that give you a UI panel to add and remove from similar to an inventory screen, I found myself actually making ""real world"" storage solutions.  My hut had wooden beam rafters where I stored my spears, poles, etc. for easy storage and retrieval.  My garden had a ""compost heap"" next to it where extra leaves, seeds, and other unused items went.  I am anxious to experiment with handles that I might be able to create a rack down the wall for my spears.Visual Appearance:  This game is a promising blend of something like Skyrim and Minecraft,  The graphics are beautiful and I can't wait to explore other biomes just as soon as I'm certain I won't get lost.  The realism of the gaming experience because of the graphics combined with real life issues like getting lost in the wild give the game a very high immersion level.Technology Level:  Where can I begin about the technology level?  Obviously, at the beginning, just like with the technology of the characters.  The opportunities for development with this game bogle the mind.  In its current state at simple bronze age technology there are a fair amount of recipes available that could be made and make a game comparable to Minecraft.  As technology levels increase, the addition of new work centers and recipes only serve to give the game additional depth.  The idea of going from Stone Age to Space Age and beyond seems enticing, but I am going to wait and see what transpires here.  It would also be similarly interesting to see higher and higher levels of magical complexity.  Rituals, better/more powerful potions, spells, and enchantments could advance with technology level as well.  This game concept has me excited.Things I would like to see integrated:After reading the section of the wiki on this game and seeing the yet to be introduced game elements that are still in process I wanted to be sure to add in the things that I as a gamer value and would like to see.  On the off chance that a developer might actually read this review, please take as focus group data if nothing else.Family/Tribe Generation: One of the somewhat disappointing aspects of Skyrim and Minecraft are the social interactions with the world.  This does not necessarily entail an in depth quest and/or dialogue engine like Warcraft (Long Live CLan Arandel!) or some of the dating simulators out there.  I was looking at the 'aging' concept presented in the wiki and was hoping that we would see something that might actually allow the character to spawn progeny.  Nothing perverted mind you, but if there were a spell called 'mating ritual' you could complete near a NPC of the oppostie gender that would generate or spawn an aging offspring from toddler up to adult would be most refreshing.  The villager breeding mechanic found in Minecraft comes to mind, but the villagers leave something ot be desired in that game.  I see self generated quests as players watch a wandering monster kill a favorite offspring and then tracking the monster (or PvP player) down for revenge.NPC generation:  I saw the article on totems that could have little podlings carrying out tasks for the character and I thought that this would be rather novel.  I like this concept and I hope it gets expanded into the ability to create a village of NPCs either through breeding (as above), conjuration, or perhaps even rescuing the people from AI Monsters.  The usefulness of these characters couold range from merely asthetic value to contributing members of a community.  I would go into more detail, but I'm running out of room in the review.Baskets:  Stone Age containers.  I don't mind chests, but the open air basket that holds stuff would be a nice change.  As long as they are stationary and don't fly everywhere like they do in Skyrim.Clothing:  The most customizable part of a character.  The Sims makes a fortune off of people that go onto their online store looking for new outfits for their Sims.  I think that level of variety is a bit overblown, but when playing Warcarft and all the max level characters look the same it gets kind of old.  There are several color dye possibilities with the mushrooms so a simple color shift might be enough.  I simply think that more than just leather armor should be capable of being dyed and the clothing options should change with technology level.More work stations.  Leatherworking, tailoring, jewelry, etc.  The more the merrier.  Crap out of room.  Later!			"

								I like this game. I like it a lot. Even when it bugs out it's still good, because it's usually funny when it bugs out. I haven't played it much because it lags when I turn the graphics quality up, so I basically cant see anything because of the render distance. The lag is probrably just my pc, but I hope there will be better preformance updates in future, so that everyone can enjoy this game (The Ultimate Goat?) fully.			"

Early Access Review
								What can i say about this game; It has the likeness of minecraft and rust, plain and simple, so im going to use minecraft/rust as an indirect comparison.Remember before you even think about buying this game that it is early alpha and the developers aka nerdkingdom do not to my knowledge have any releases of any games under their belt, they are backed and supported by feedthebeast so based on this im giving them a moderate to low risk of getting a game thats not finished and thrown together.Disclaimer;As your reading this you may think this game is not for you or maybe im giving it a negative review in writing but recommending it anyway. My review is based on the current state of the game and will likely not reflect some if not all of the finished product and will only probably be relevent for the near future of the games development.(This is quite a long review so if you cant be bothered reading on ive included a overview at the bottom)Gameplay;You play as what i would describe as an elvin creature who has been dumped on a proceeduraly generated world (using the famous world seed system) there are numberous different resourses available to you and a crafting tech tree that can be progressed up. At the moment it is fairly easy to survive the ""energy"" (food meter) is easy to fill and once you have found an apple or orange tree you will never go hungry again. Additionally the AI is clunky and stupid, the only time your in trouble from them is in wide open spaces as they like to run into walls wherre you can stand just out of range and kill them. Additionally your own navigation is hindered by just 1 block height (explains the clunky ai) meaning getting out of your mine takes a lot of jumping and a bit of patience (Yes minecraft does this too but you dont slip back down again)Mining;Most of your resources for level 1 tech tree and any basic building material can be found lying around across the entire map, but the tools currently are unbalanced with the pickaxe and the hammer doing the job to quickly and of course the shovel doing the job to slowly and higher level tech tree ores are very rare and hard to find a few balancing issues then here but that particular feature is fresh out of the box.Building;The building aspect of this game definately needs some work and you wont be building mega structures just yet as block placement i find is a little bit fiddely, but on the bright side anything you build does come together nicely with the textures all blending seemlessly together.Mod Support;Yes im giving this its own section because it remarkable at how easily modded this game is in fact it pretty much has about the same or better mod support than a lot of games out there. For an early alpha thats impressive.You wont see that many mods yet but i believe they will come strong and fast as just looking at the way mods are imported into the game it seems remarkably too good to be true.Graphics;Not much to say here compared to rust and minecraft I would say they are miles better.Overview;If you like minecraft or rust and want to support a game that has soo much potential to be better than both of them then for $9.99 or £6.00ish  you really are not risking a lot of money by buying early alpha and with the developers letting us know the price is due to rise as more features are imported into the game, it really is a great time to invest in this game.I look at the review above and think to myself it really looks quite negative but trust me providing you remember that it is an alpha you wont care about that. With multiplayer support on its way im looking forward to loading this game backup again once the multiplayer support is added.For those of you interested in a polished off game with as many features as minecraft, alls i have to say is wait for a later beta or final release.

								First Impressions:While I've played countless open-world survival sandbox games, ""TUG"" looked too pretty to ignore, reminding me a little bit of ""Creativerse"".  At first glance, I thought I'd be thrust into a caveman-esque survival fest...it turns out I was partially right.  In this case, you're actually a Seedling: ""a race of humanoid beings with special crystals on their hands enabling them to interface with the strange energies and ancient secrets in the world around them"".  Like a caveman (or woman), you'll start with only the basic of tools and work your way up.  While there is PVP (currently under construction), folks will be happy to learn that you can play single player in either ""survival"" or ""creative"" modes, just like in ""Minecraft"".  This is truly one survival sandbox game to watch out for!

								Review for pre-multiplayer version.  7/10, Planet Explorers with a second dose of minecraft, but stuck in pre-historic times.Of note is the ""intuitive"" crafting system, where you press a key while things are on the ground or near an appropriate crafting station, and the game decides if it can identify a recipe.  Keep storage far from your crafting area.There is still a lot to come, but generally it has a solid base and room for a wide scope, even an adventure mode as a distinct server type.			"

								Well this is early access and still in aplha. But it is actually playable and will give you a basic crafting+survival game at this stage.Personally I think it has a lot of charm and potential. Can't wait to see what they add next!As a bonus Nerd Kingdom posts update and teaser videos on the youtube channel to ensure that you (the player) stay updated. Updates allso available in the kickstarter page.Recommended for those in love with the crafting+survival games out there, who have a bit of money to spare for a game that is still very much being develloped			"

								So far the game is fun.  The building and collecting is fun and the additions to the game over time have been interesting and deffinitely improved the game.  I think the method of crafting is fun and interesting.  It has a slightly more realistic feel to it.  storage is interesting as well.  I like that you can only carry so much with you and your inventory is small.  You can build backpacks and chests and stuff which is really cool.			"

								I recommend this game - but with conditionsIf you don't like exploring and crafting and mining then don't waste your money.If you want a complete game with heaps to do then don't buy this game.If you don't want to risk Early Access, where you never know if you will be happy with the outcome - then wait till release.If you like an interesting and visually appealing game that has similarities to the minecraft style of game then this is great.If you enjoy seeing a game progress, and are happy if you got your money's worth of game play along the way, then consider this game.The terrain and environments are nice to look at, and creatures are well done, sometimes a little creepy.I am not sure that the crafting style will suit everyone, as it involves dropping items you want to combing and sort of hope for the best.  But it mostly works ok, you just need to be a little precise with your items and quantities, and make sure you are in a clear area, so you don't accidentally craft a hoe instead of a hammer.The dev team seems to be interested in the community feedback, and seems to have put in regular updates, and made some strong decisions to maintain independence.Pros- nice visuals- interesting environments- interesting Lore of the world- Great feel to the atmosphere, really encourages discovery- Devs seem dedicated and seem to be good at communicating with the community (https://trello.com/b/rW2Xc2bj)- Potentially so many good optionsCons- Early Access (can be risky)- Small dev team (but seem dedicated)- Not a lot to do at the moment (still enough for many hours)- Slightly Limited block/items (growing with each update)- Manual Crafting will not suit some people			"

								Edit: Got the game working! It's fun and beautiful. Crafting is a little wonky, and it's really easy to get lost. But a fun game.           Still needs some work, but for an alpha it's looking good.Just when I told myself I was done buying Alphas, I saw this game. It looked so good I couldn't resist. Well... I regretted it instantly. It starts off downloading at a snails pace. I thought it was just my ISP giving me grief. But after the game finally finished installing, I booted it up. Everything went well until I made a world. It loaded fine, but went straight to a white screen. I gave it some time (about 5 mins), but it never loaded anything. I could hear movement when hitting the directional keys. But I then hit esc to attempt to bring up a menu, and it crashed. I tried several different times and functions to get something. Just a constant white screen. I checked their forums support page (http://forum.nerdkingdom.com/viewforum.php?f=28&sid=5f2d7f657e035594699a08b805a2a196) and found others having the same issue...from 2013! How is this issue still not resolved?! I tried reinstalling the game, and again got the slow download start (so it wasn't my ISP). I still have the same issue. How can you release and/or charge people for a game that doesn't even work????  ---   DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ---   The concept is cool, but it's not even a game at this point, just a loading screen.

								Interesting early access game with alot of potential.  As it is currently it has alot of playability and should only gain more as the development progresses.  The game is stable and so far after a few hours appears to be almost bug free with the exception of some floating grass left after block distruction - not a gamebreaker just visually annoying.   Purchase should be looked upon as an investment in the game's future.			"

								Even though it really is in its early stages and has a somehow fancy comix-style grafic it is already fun. Your character (seedling) is until now genderless and ageing is not jet implemented,which makes him/her look as a child.But you will spend most of your time in ego-perspective anyway,since most actions require that.You will be assisted in your early steps by a very good wiki,showing you all the tools and weapons and stuff you can craft and listing everything you need to do so.Should there arise questions the wiki can not jet answer, you will find an exceptionally friendly community which ,no doubt, will help you out.Survival is not really hard: wherever you start your game you will find a large rock or even a boulder nearby with a hammerstone close to it,which you can pick up and use on the rock or boulder to get the stone parts of your first stone-age tools and weapons.Everything you need to make them will be close by.As soon as you have your stone sword you can face any aggressive animal which may cross you and get its hide and flesh if it has any and if you have at least a stone knive in your hand after the kill.At that point I like to go exploring to harvest the different kinds of fruits (apples,cherries,melons,gourds,oranges,bananas and at least one pumpkin) .There are lots of them around ,so you are in no danger to starve: you eat them and get their seeds in your inventory ,which you later on may use to plant them close to your base (see the wiki for farming).Then I find a bit of sand (which later on I will use for crafting) and  since I like to make my first base in a cave,which will also be my mine and have a nice little garden with fruit-trees,gourds,melons and a pumpkin in it ,I look for a suitable place for it.The place I look for allows me to mine horizontally into a rocky mountainface,while having enough space in front to work with my hoe to create my garden and sporting some tall trees nearby for the wood I will need.If I also can spot some goats to hunt nearby then I have found my place.Since the game is in a very early stage,what you can do then is more or less set up your base with your crude bed and some workingplaces,mine for ore,hunt,cook,craft bronze tools and weapons and maybe build this and that minecraft-style.For me so far it was fun and the money for the early access was well spent,and I see a lot of potential.

								I picked up TUG in the HB spring sale for 0.99€ just two days ago and have already played for ten hours, six of those hours was spent in multiplayer (LAN). It's definitely worth it!While I'm not too fond of survival normally, I went for survival mode in the first place (I haven't actually looked at the creative mode at all). I haven't died as of yet, mainly because I stayed pretty close to the spawn point in single player. I had some goats near where I spawned but they wandered away while I was trying to figure out how things work. Crafting items is a bit of a challenge but resources have so far been plentiful. Crafting a vine fence instead of a chest because the hammer was not equipped? Check that. Just throw the missing items on the ground and try again, WITH the hammer in hand this time! The game runs pretty stable for me, only once there was a bit of a longer lag and the mouse pointer turned into a loading circle but that was all.Multiplayer worked to my surprise without any additional settings, though I anticipated having to fight to get multiplayer to work. I had even looked into UDP port forwarding to get things to work. But I only started a multiplayer game and my partner was able to connect! It was a bit laggy for the first 10-20 seconds, probably due to loading stuff. We played for around six hours, with one game restart for my partner (some reference to nil value error) and apart from one crash on my side the multiplayer was very stable. The best part was that nothing was lost due to the crash of the server side, I restarted the game and we continued. One item had been returned to my partners' inventory and he joined the world a bit away from our cave, but that was it, no big deal at all!			"

								TUG is in the very early stages of development and is being created by a team of dedicated, imaginative, talented and friendly people who are very invested in their ideas and the end-product. Despite the ""alpha"" state of the game, it is already one of the funnest sandboxes I've ever tooled around in. The art style is unique and inspired, separating TUG from other voxel-based games that, in my opinion, seemed hurried or effortless. Updates are coming in fairly regularly and, as stated previously, the development team is responsive to the community, in both addressing concerns and considering suggestions and feedback. I really can't say enough about this game and where its coming from. I just really enjoy the play, the style, the ideas and the people who comprise Nerd Kingdom. I fully expect to remain hooked on this game up to and well beyond the final release. If you enjoy sandbox games and like having your ideas listened to, I'd recommend supporting TUG and Nerd Kingdom in their endeavors! NOTE: The current system requirements for TUG are a little steep. PLEASE make sure your system supports at least DirectX 11 (DDI Version: 11!!!!!!!!!!!!!!), before you purchase! The dev team will reassess the system requirements sometime in the future, but at this time you MUST have DirectX 11.			"

Early Access Review
								Thanks to various bug fixes, I can now change my solid ""no"" vote to a very cautious ""yes"" vote. Tug is an ambitious project that manages to bring enough to the table that's different to not be immediately written off as ""just another minecraft style game"".The graphics are smooth and appealing, what little sound there is in the game thus far is very effective, and the crafting system is unique and sufficient once you get the hang of it. Emphasis on ""once you get the hang of it"", as that's one of the biggest reasons I'm saying this is a good game instead of an outstandingly great one.The way that TUG is currently set up, when you start out the game they drop you in your world, pants or not, with no instructions what so ever. If you aren't a hardened vet in the genre, you'd better pull up a guide online and make notes, because TUG tells you absolutely nothing in-game. You might figure out how to survive and make some basic tools and so forth on your own with enough trial and error, but some players will give up long before they reach the point where TUG starts to shine because of the complex and unexplained nature of the game's mechanics. That's not the only issue TUG has, but it's still early access so some bugs and issues are bound to happen. It can be difficult to get things like beds to sit flat on your floor instead of lodged halfway through your character, sometimes items will vanish when you leave the room (such as beds) or will cease to be when you merely meant to drop them, for example. If you know what you're doing, these issues are rarely a game breaking experience, but it can detract from your ability to stay immersed and having fun.The act of mining in TUG is similar in nature to how it is in Minecraft, but like a lot of things, it feels more organic. I never thought I'd be looking back at the tunnel I'd just dug and thinking ""Damn that's a pretty tunnel"", but digging ends up being one of the most enjoyable parts of the game because of how fluid and unstilted the process becomes. Overall, TUG accomplishes what it sets out to do. It's enjoyable, not too difficult, and pretty to look at. If you've played Minecraft and are looking for something that's a little less precise and a little more organic in both look and feel, watch some videos of TUG and then give it a try. You could do a lot worse with your money on here these days.			"

								This game is fun on a bun. I haven't experienced any game breaking glitches as of yet. The crafting is different than Minecraft. Instead of putting the items in a window, you throw them on the ground, on a workbench, on a furnace, etc.  then you press the ""G"" key to craft them. I actually prefer it this way.			"

								TUG is in the very early stages of development and is being created by a team of dedicated, imaginative, talented and friendly people who are very invested in their ideas and the end-product. Despite the ""alpha"" state of the game, it is already one of the funnest sandboxes I've ever tooled around in. The art style is unique and inspired, separating TUG from other voxel-based games that, in my opinion, seemed hurried or effortless. Updates are coming in fairly regularly and, as stated previously, the development team is responsive to the community, in both addressing concerns and considering suggestions and feedback. I really can't say enough about this game and where its coming from. I just really enjoy the play, the style, the ideas and the people who comprise Nerd Kingdom. I fully expect to remain hooked on this game up to and well beyond the final release. If you enjoy sandbox games and like having your ideas listened to, I'd recommend supporting TUG and Nerd Kingdom in their endeavors! NOTE: The current system requirements for TUG are a little steep. PLEASE make sure your system supports at least DirectX 11 (DDI Version: 11!!!!!!!!!!!!!!), before you purchase! The dev team will reassess the system requirements sometime in the future, but at this time you MUST have DirectX 11.			"

								This game will undoubtably surpass Minecraft given time. The steam EA version is rock solid one of the best EA titles I've ever played, and already one of the most fun sandbox games I've ever played. Note I've played MC, and several interations of the mod packages for MC, planet explorers, starforge (cringe), space engineers. What it is TUG is an open world exploration sandbox survival adventure, Your primary foes will be aquiring resources to progress throug the bronze age (currently only 2 tiers of tools are available, but the crafting system is awesome and can take some time to get going) There is only 1 enemy ai in the steam EA version (though the indev version turns one of the other roaming ai's hostile. My favorite aspect atm although limited in scope due to a very limited block sellection is building. This game trumps mc in that sense my first house on TUG looked more like my FTB ultimte residence - exterior decor because of the afore mentioned reason. My first house on vanilla minecraft was a block of dirt/cobble/wood. Whats more is the way the terrain morphs to accomidate your constructs if you start building something there isnt a jarring sudden change in texture, but rather they mold together.  Currently I'm playing the indev version on steam multiplayer is looming on the horizon sometime soon. As i stated earlier this is one of the BEST sandbox survival games I have played and i have played many of them. I also have played through the avilable content on the EA and INDEV versions several times. The EA version is deffinitely more stable, but the indev build for me is relatively stable as well. 10/10 from me if you love this genre then you will love this game, get it now before it goes up to 20 following the multiplayer patch.Update: Following multiplayer release game sitll runs stable my fps is up from mid 30's to 60's now on maxed view distance and high settings note I only have a gtx750 ti card and a amd fx 6300 cpu so its not  a resource hog. This game is still awesome and I've had it for almost 2 months would still recommend this to anyone that will listen. The developers closed a deal with some investors about 2 weeks ago, and following that released multiplayer I can't wait to see how far this game goes.			"

								First off, your inventory is small, you only have 16 spaces and 4 action slots. Some resources that you pick up will not stack, like the rocks you need to make tools.To craft you have to remember the recipe and then throw the ingredients on the ground and hit the letter ""G"". To me this is a complete pain in the you know what. Honestly, I have other games and I'm not going to remember individual recipies for individual games. Make it once, then it should go into memory and be available with a click of the button. But since you have to throw all the ingredients on the ground first....Crafting is also problematic if you happen to need to craft something and you're on a slope....As if that's never going to happen.I know it's early access, I just lost interest in it. Plus I don't find any fun in playing a game where you have to constantly look on the net for how to make things. I'd rather play the game.			"

								I spent a whole $0.99 on this game. I have not played it the many hours I have on other games, but I feel it has a lot of potential. Interesting graphics and mechanics, although a bit clunky.Edit: I originally left my review as negative, mainly due to silence from NK. Thank you, Chaonic, for sharing a link to their recent vid and website update.It is good to see this game is not abandoned, and is continuing to progress. NK has also stated they regret not communicating much with us, and plan to do better in the future.			"

Then out of the bushes a Saber Cat looking cat creature thing came and rushed me. I panicked and ran around like a headless chicken until I was eventually killed.. Only to be spawn killed by three more of them a few more times!!! That and the little creatures that laugh like psychotic children freaked me out. I never saw one and had no idea what they were lol.If you like sandbox games this is a good one. "

								granted i have played this game very little but when you have over 300 games in your account it gets a bit like that. still this isnt about how many hours ive put in its about all the negative jump-on-the-bandwagon reviews and comments thrown at the devs. your like a load of sheep with your copycat comments and boo-baaaa reviews......this is early access and not the complete deal something everyone who uses steam is well aware of. some games make it and others dont but not one dev STEALS your money YOU give it out of your own choice knowing there is a risk that the game may never make the shelf at the game store. with regard to TUG christ man have you read the forum? the dev is giving his all to this.... so not every decision theve made has been right or perfect.....i doubt very much any of you out there are all that perfect either so dont knock the team for trying to create  thier vision of what a good game should be about....give them the time to show us what they can do without  doing what humans do best......PUTTING OTHERS DOWN AND TRYING TO BRAK THIER DREAMS....if you dont like the way TUG is going simple.....GO BUY A DIFFERENT GAME.

								I have played this game for a very long time off and on, I have probably clocked more than 50 hours in this game through the launcher plus what I already have clocked through Steam.  With that said this game has come a long way from its early alpha stages.  If you are a fan of games like Minecraft, Rust, Stranded Deep, etc... then you will be a huge fan of this game.  Crafting is really well done, in the world, not in a crafting window.  The worlds are procedurally generated and there are numerous biomes that offer their own set of challenges.  It has multiplayer support, and an infinite degree of building options.  You can build a house, a cave, a mansion, a castle, the possibilities are limitless.The survival aspects are pretty fun too, food is your most valuable resource and you will die without it.  It can be abundant enough to let you have fun, but also can be elusive enough that you are challenged by it in some biomes.  The Dev team really cares about their game and product and are very active on their forums and here on Steam.  I can not give this game enough thumbs up.  Join the fun and enjoy your time in The Unnamed Game (TUG).I have also started a YouTube series showcasing my latest time in the game, you can watch it at the link below.  Enjoy!

								Before I start the review I want to point out two facts just to make sure you know1. This game is a Early Access Game meaning its in development ""Not Done"".2. Since it seems there are many threads about people who haven't gotten a Nvidia or AMD Graphics card made in the last few years, this game requires Directx 11 which most computers nowadays come with a GPU that is compatible with Directx 11 but also as it says in the requirements Intel's GPUs do not work well with this game.Alright now that I point out two things to that should be know before even thinking about buying this game on to the review.This game is at its core a Minecraft copycat but it isn't just like all the other copycats it has changed many things making this game unique. At first glance you can clearly see they have upgraded the graphics making it look at lot better than Minecraft and don't say a little you might make one of the devs angry. Also they made it a bit more realistic in the sense that monsters down just spawn at night but there are still monsters you just have to find them or they find you though I have played six hours in and still haven't encounters any but looking at screenshots I have seen that others have. Also one little fact that I didn't know to I looked up a tutorial is to craft you have to drop all the items for the recipe and than click g to craft things just thought I'd save you some time and tell you that so you can craft sooner and if you want to know crafting recipes you can always go to the TUG wiki page didn't want to say them cause somepeople may want to find them out on their own. I will say two things I would like to see added to the game, first thing is stairs kinda like the ones from Minecraft where you can walk into it to elevate yourself one block higher without jumping cause I want to make a elevated house and its a lot harder when you have to jump up the stair case than just walking up it, and two is doors because well a house isn't really complete till you add a door.Update: 5/28/2015Just encountered my first hostile animal which looked like a Lion. When I first heard the noises of the animal I jumped up my stairs and looked back to see it walking around till it fell in a hole I made to get some dirt. I walked up to the hole sword in hand than I realized it was stuck in my hole and couldn't get out. So it seems I now have a violent pet that wants to tear my face off and eat me.			"

								Though this is a positive review let me state I WON'T recommend this game as of now; but my opinion may change once it's out of early access and/or improved upon enough. In all honest I haven't played it in awhile, my first time playing felt like I was in an empty sandbox world that lacked  simple mechanics and direction as far as I could discern... That being said I also didn't do much research on it. I'm not saying that this is a bad game, but I was expecting something a little more polished then it was even though it is an early access game. If you'd like to support it please feel free, but as a word of advice expect to do some research in order to figure out the game while it's in early access.			"

								Heyyo,TUG has a lot of promise... I backed it on kickstarter. Right meow? it still needs A LOT of work... but in time it could be something special. For meow though? Cube World is a more complete game.. but who knots? In time TUG could live up to its original promises and be a much better game hence why the recommendation.. but be warned! This is more of a pre-recommendation since the early access still needs lots of love.			"

								Its ok fact that they are a early access game that developers actually support and do consistent and often meaningful updates is the reason I recommend. (seriously so many early access games are a way to get paid for a game in pre-alpha state and then abandon it.)This game has a ton of promise in depth crafting different blocks item repairs systems lots of functionallity. And a building system that allows for much more ""fluid building"". But my major detractors if you are one the fence first and foremost it is a resource hog. So if your even kind of close to min system requirements unless you want to play at a 800x600 resolution at 5fps. I would reccomend waiting till optimization me personally I am very capable keep very clean machine slightly over system reqs and lag on that computer is a problem.Another detractor is the crafting system hundreds of patterns and you place items on ground and hit craft button. But oh no item fell off/away from stack you were one item short or perhaps to far away from edge of stack for all materials to be counted. So instead of getting item you wanted when crafting it is extremely easy to craft wrong item. And no longer have materials for original item. (especially combined with lag) Reason why these are not reasons for a no is first is optimization its always a later/last in development once all of features are in game. So it is coming and I have no doubt some of resource dumps will be fixed. Secondly crafting system   is cool in its own way. And I think perhaps instead of just crafting random item based off crap on ground. It could be fixed with a simple scroll system aka hit craft and a list of available items to build pop up.			"

Also, Ladies and gentlemen, Goats. these guys frolic and you actually have to hunt them you cant just sprint after them and beat the snot out of them. Personally I rate this game 8/10. only 8 because it is incomplete and Storage is a bit more complex.			"

								This is still early alpha and I have very high hopes for this cause this can be really good. At this stage you can only craft, Hunt Stupid goats and explore But there is still allot of content that will be coming in as time goes on. The things im looking forward to is the way the seed (Player) grows and his actions show and develop the way you look so when you eat allot you will be heavy, if you run allot you will be slim and run faster and when you swing a heavy sword you wil become a Hulk well buff and strong haha.  Would be cool If they make your eye color change to like red if you kill others and like a nice light blue if they choose to help others. There will be pets and breeding at some point but i would like to see mounts  but fantasy mounts like ride on a shark on on or in water or a dragon or eagle in the shy and a big wolf or bear on the ground. But will see how this goes but again this is just early alpha and this looks promising. Every penny helps guys.			"

								the game seems to look good so far but they don't seem to be doing many updates kinda disappoint me thought this would be a good game but the game play is minimal and you can build a house explore or build a couple tools.Since we have been asking about updates in spite nerd Kingdom. decided to release a bunch of ""broken updates"" or not working updates and the kicker is there partners are yogcast who made a game that flopped already called Yogscast's Yogventures to quote them""But we have a way to get you guys access to even MORE broken things, much faster than the traditional update schedule. These “Indev Builds” will go up quite a bit more frequently and will be all kinds of not working sometimes,"" sounds like a yogscast venture to me so go ahead n funnel your money into the game but don't complain if it crashes hard like Yogscast's Yogventures ;)			"

Unfortunately I've since forgotten about it and have since been playing ARK: Survival Evolved in which does what this game does and more.			"

								Its an early access game, that nearly had a year of no updates, and there is a lot of controvercy of it going free to play (I was someone who originaly payed full price for it) and while I cant say they are handleing things perfectly, as its not even close; I am happy the game is still alive and despite paying money for the game I cant say I didnt get my enjoyment out of it.

								I really like this game. IMO the alchemy/magic crystal stuff is pretty goofy, but other than that, my dream game. Basically everything that minecraft is, but much prettier and more realistic. Actual predatory animals rather than zombies and skellies. Great diversity of flora and fauna. Having to smelt usable metals, rather than inexplicably finding already usable materials just in the ground. Having to deal with heavily used tools oxydizing. Maybe a lot of people would find that tedious and not worth while, but I think the realism is really cool. Really hope to see it progress out of alpha.			"

								This is a great game, currently in alpha, but has a multiplayer option and two of the three game modes available. The game modes are a survival games mode, a creative mode, and the adventure mode, which has not yet been released. Although it only has the creative and survival games modes right now, you will end up spending hours on this wonderful game. P.S. the game will be getting a plethora of new items, monsters, gameplay, and game mechanics. So, long story short, get this game and wait for the full release, while playing survival games on the side, because it is going to be FRICKING amazing.			"

Early Access Review
								TLDR: Really cool and has potential but still evident that it is early access.Very enjoyable if a little 'unfinished'. Tug is still in progress (something the devs are very clear about) and because of this the world is still slightly deserted, there isn't that much one can do in game and there are a large number of bugs. But, even at this early stage it is still completely playable. The graphics are breathtaking, I may not be a fount of experience in regards to games and their quality but I have seen my fair share and TUG is definitely one of the better ones. The crafting system is unique and not overly complex, even if some of the recipes aren't always intuitive.Nerd Kingdom has a distinct and clear vision of the general direction in which they want their game to go and I am sitting on the edge of my seat in anticipation. While the idea of a procedurally generated world with unique quests, events, landforms NPCs, etc. may not be exactly new, their plan for a dynamic playable character that adapts according to what the player does with said character is revolutionary (that's what I believe in any case) and I am looking forward to the completion and implementation of this feature. I can appreciate the planning that was put into this game as well as Nerd Kingdom and its devs consideration in regard to the users/players and what they want (this is evident in the name of the game).The style and approach possessed by this game and its creators is remarkable. Unfortunately there is a downside: the game is very demanding in regards to processing, it is very laggy with medium-high graphics’ settings with reasonably capable computer stats (although if you look at how the world is generated/looks it is understandable if regrettable).In the world of procedurally generated voxel worlds TUG, is a breath of fresh air in a smog of boring Minecraft remakes, rehashes and reskins. The game is still incomplete and I wouldn't suggest you buy it if you are looking for a game that you will play for hundreds of hours without running out of things to do. I do suggest however that you support the developers of TUG, they are doing something amazing. From my limited knowledge of game development it appears as if they have injected an astronomical amount of energy into the creation of this game by producing their own game engine and doing things in a new and untested way. I would just like to say that I appreciate their hard work and consideration.			"

								Although I havent logged very many hours into this game..infact less then one. I have always kept up with the constant updates going on through youtube. I orginally bought this game due to the ""sound effects"" animation as the idea of a world creating its own music was fantastic to me. I bought this game to support its creation, not for a final product. Moving into ver 2.0 I am worried of the new look (as I did enjoy the art style of ver 1.0) but knowing the concept and ideas/story are all still going to be there is why i have stuck around for so long. I bought this game to support its development into something i can one day state ""I am glad to have helped this become a reality"" You guys have my full support moving into ver 2.0 as from what I've already seen has always kept me around excited for more!For if I recommend this game: I bought this game years ago for its idea and to support the developers ideas. For no reason did I buy this game to play it straight away. I knew there was going to be a lot lacking and I hoped my small amount would go towards making it what they set out to be. Do NOT buy this game thinking you can just play it for hours on end as a finished product. Buy it if you (like myself) are captivated by the ideas going into it and want to make it EVENTUALLY into something you'd enjoy to play. I love this game (having not even played an hour of it) i am invested into its design process and feel totally connected to whats happening in it/ to it. I have never spent more time watching videos of updates from the team or creating fanart of its world and even coming up with my own ideas for what the story is and how it connects. I truly hope this game comes out the way they invisioned it and I will glady support its creation and afterwards, play it to my hearts content as the only game i have ever supported till completion.

								The game needs work. I hope they achieve what they set out to do it’s a game i would love to play. The development speed is scary slow when compared to similar kick-starter games. When I start up a world I feel bored. Some of the environments are nice but it just feels like a void. There’s nothing to do or explore. It needs time I don’t see this game being playable for another year or two so I hope they can last that long.			"

								Love the game, the only thing that bothers me is all of these people saying it sucks, mostly because their computer cant run it. no one read that you had to have a good computer to play this, i was smart i read what this game needed before i bought it and upgraded my computer to handle it. really do love the game, its alot of fun and if you get bored waiting on updates you can mod it to add new items, even some of the devs have released mods for the game in their free time. so far ive played for 83.5 hours and plan on playing many more hours of this game.

								So I got this game a while back when the building was still blocky like Minecraft. I took a bit of a break, a year or so, before jumping back in and now the game is even cuter than before. I love this game and once the devs finish the conversion to OpenGL I would recommend it to anyone who likes openworld creative games with cute atmosphere. And for anyone doubting NK right now, which seems to be quite a lot right now, they are still working on it as is shown by this porum post on their main site. https://gyazo.com/1c28d318630086ea6135c6e8c04eab28Most of what is going on right now is some re-coding and conversions that doesn't give much to be discussed aside from some technical junk that most of us wouldn't be interested in. From my understanding they are reworking the entire game into a new generation of it. All they ask is patients. The game will come back and as they stated they are aiming for December of this year. They aren't doing like a certain other game company that was creating a survival crafting game with good graphics and aliens and guns that fall from the sky....While I agree they need to communicate more all of this hate needs to stop until we know for absolute certainty that they abandoned the game.TUG is a great game with tons of potential. Honestly I look forward to the day it is comeplete and that I can share it with more of my friends. So be Patient, I have a good feeling about this.			"

								On paper it looks like a good game, but it is extremely incomplete. To me, controls feels weird and interface is bare. I know it's supposed to be survival and you're supposed to learn how to play by yourself without anyone to hold your hand, but I shouldn't have to go to the forums to learn how to gather wood, something I still can't do. A quick pop up saying which controls are what would do. I can't seem to interact with the world very much. If I try to punch anything it looks like I'm punching the air. After digging around in the forums you'll find out that animals don't exist. How's that for a survival game? Yes, I know what alpha means, and this game is not alpha yet.			"

								Look, I can run the game just fine. I'm in love with the entire concept. But this needs a serious amout of work. I know it's early access, and I know they're working hard on this game. Honestly, my biggest problem with the game is dying of thirst in every world I load. There's just no water. I'v watched some gameplay for the game on YouTube and I'm looking at a different hud than they are. Maybe It didn't patch correcly for me? Who knows. Maybe it's just a critical messup on your 6.11 update.  Anyway, I love the consept of this game. I really do, and I can't wait to play some more. But until then it's just unplayable. Plus I'm seeing this survival mode on everyone's videos, but all I'm seeing is proving grounds. I'm assuming, well, hoping you changed the name. Else something is wrong with my product.			"

								Okay, let me first start this by saying i only bought this game, because it looked good in the videos, and also because i seen someone write a negative review about it and rate it 1/10, at the time i thought that review had to be very bias and required for me to buy it and see for myself.So, with that being said, this game is utterly and completely horrible, and not because its in Alpha, but just because its simply and utterly horrible. When i say horrible, its like walking in on your Grandfather when he is rubbing one out, that type of horrible, you literally want to go to the washroom and wash your eyes with bleach in hopes you cleansed everything away.Why is this game so horrible you ask?Lets start with limitations, this game is extremely limited with function, and ability to change anything in the options menu. Secondly there is zero help or any tut's that will help you start the game, you are literally tossed into the game and pretty much have to figure it all out on your own. Crafting... well.. i still have no idea how to craft, i ran around for a ♥♥♥♥en hour trying to figure out what was going on and how to do anything, still didn't figure it out. Next issue was with this so called Multiplayer.. there is NO multiplayer.. there is just an option for you to host your own server on your computer for you and your friends to play.. that's far from what people really consider Multiplayers these days, i consider that more.. i dunno.. CO-OP.So whats good about this game you ask, well.. nothing .. it literally has nothing going for it.. its a POS, as simple as that, its $10 i could have spend on a stuff crust pizza from Pizza Hut.So put your wallet away, DO NOT buy this game EVER.. There are better games out there you can spend your money on, this is not one of them.Give this a 0.01/10			"

Minecraft with its cupic forms is still way better than this game.I know it not easy to make a game but if u have to sell someting , even in early acess , u should sell something worth playing .			"

								This game is TERRIBLE...now. This game has the potential to be an insane game, the next mincecraft if you will. This game can be expanded and built and all can enjoy it, just not now. Now we are giving them support/funds/bugs and stuff that will help them make it into a game that WE can enjoy. After a long year, we hear news from them again on the huge update. We look forward to seeing more. Atleast, we should.			"

								For an Early Access game I can kinda recommend it, I'm really on fence between recommending and not. I mostly support it because of the developer's philosophy.Pro-* Developers who promise to shape TUG based on player's actions and feedback. imo, this is way better then your run-of-mill arrogant know-it-all developer.* Designed from the ground up to be modded. This is a primary goal for developers while making TUG.* I like TUG's art style.con-* TUG seems to be in perpetual early access.* Very poorly optimized as of the DX11 version. Maybe the new OpenGL version will be better. My budget computer (AMD FX 4100, Geforce GT 610, 16GB) can only run it with the lowest possible settings and I still get choppy game play.* The crafting diversity is tiny. Within maybe a day you can craft all the items there are to make. After that it's about building creative structures.* The PvE content is tiny (hunting, fighting, raiding). The forest, fauna, and earth types are diverse. Although, the creatures that populate these lands are few in type and in number. I've only seen goat, cat, and bull. Of these few types I'd spend at least 15 minuets wandering around looking for them. There is lots of potential to build things but very little if you want to hunt and fight. "

								It is a horrificly made game. It atempts to be different however it fails dismally. It acts like a another voxel based sandbox game. The crafting system is annoying and often adds items that are nearby. The multiplayer element is non-existant. The aesthetic style of blending textures makes the game look poor. Has potential, but currently playing this game is masochistic.			"

								DO NOT BUY! these guys are talentless nazis. if they KNEW what they were doing they wouldnt need the community to TELL them what to do. we all know how it works out when you let the steam community influence your game, you get some of the most mediocre piles of feces that the entire world has seen before time and time again. to compound this these jerkoffs (what else do you call a team of developers who decide ""tug"" is a good name for their game?) have teamed up with yogcast (giving away THOUSANDS of copies of the game I and many others gave them money to develop .. to people i consider by in large to be the biggest wastes of spunk this planet has ever seen) which means you can look forward to an even MORE childish bunch of mentally-deficient jerkoffs influencing the game. bravo.this game will end up EXACT-fecking-LY like lego universe online! they did the exact same crap, they had ""scientists"" and engineers working with kids to make that game (and i know right now most of you are asking ""when did this happen?"".. because it failed THAT completely!!) and ended up with uninspired feces.. it sounded cool.. build things, race cars, fight monsters.. the fecking thing didnt even entertain for a weekend! they also monitor their forums with an iron fist, not that i dont get banned weekly from 1 forum or another, but all it took was for me to question their partnership with yogcast and they started deleting posts. when i called them on it (look some time at how often ""inoritewtf"" or whatever the very mature developers name is posts.. dude must never sleep) they denied it completely, then the next day some random steam mod (aka a goose stepper) bans me from their forum AND MAKES IT A POINT TO CONTACT ME DIRECTLY, something in my dozens of bannings i have NEVER had any of them do. so my logic is the developer probably GAVE them a copy of the game (that i helped pay for them to develop) to make it clear that it wasnt the developer that had me banned. really guys, if you are reading this you are already questioning the purchase. use your common sense, DONT DO IT.

Sadly its just llike the last wario games, grinding takes too long and the headcrabs got nerfed so they can barely circumsize you anymore. They should have learned something from the last game they made TF3, you dont need to catch em all, you just need to duel. The sex scenes where also terribad, why Miley? They could have made Jesus at least plow Sailor Moon instead. I r8 8/69 sheit game.			"

								UPDATE 07/14/16: Just read their last announcement here. I hate F2P games to the bones. Looks like another dev abandoning their game. As many other reviewers have said before me, I need to STOP buying f***ing Early Access BS! This will be my last update. I'm deleting the game from my HDD and placing it in my Trash category.UPDATE 06/24/15: The game was update again today, so I spend a few hours exploring the new features and stuff they added.- inventory system: greatly improved to the beginning of the game, still no wearable backpack, but at least the chest and backpack are working inventory wise, which is awesome!- the tools, armors and weapons that are in game so far are looking great- building your house is fun, though I wish there were a little more options for decoration and placing the already existing things (like when I have a item in hand that I want to place, a ghost image of said item appears which I can rotate as I want before I place the item)- combat wise I still can't say much yet, as I have yet to see any hostile mobs, I did some hunting this time, which is ok, but could use some balancing ( a tad to easy i think)- crafting, the system itself is solid, even though items fly all over the place when you put them down to craft, which is only a minor annoyance though. what I really don't like is the missing help within the game. If you want to know how to craft something, either you just try stuff out until something pops out or you got onto the web to look up the crafting recipes, which is what I did, but why can't there be a small guide (like in The Forest for example) that tells me what I need to craft. doesn't have to autocraft from within the guide, just a simple info book of what I need (just a thought ;) )- graphics, are awesome, I have the game set to max quality settings and it's running at a steady 60 FPS on my rig (see below), there are a few minor FPS drops now and then, but nothing that ruins the game for me at least, I'm sure future optimization will eliminate most of these as wellSummary: So with the current state of the game and the options available to play, explore, build, etc. I can DEFINITELY recommend this game to anyone. It might not have crazy update schedule as other early access games (yes I'm looking at you ARK :P ), but these devs certainly are great when it comes to dedication and community interactions as far as I can tell anyway. Looking forward, to what you guys come up with next ;). Keep up the great work!!!UPDATE 01/23/15: So today the game was updated and I hopped in to check it out again. The graphics are great, the game runs smooth at max settings with my rig (i7 quad, 12GB RAM, GTX680 4GB RAM). Crafting is still something to get used to, especially if you play MC a lot like I do. I know they are trying to make it more intuitive I suppose, but it is really not. Just throwing stuff on the ground and then hoping something nice comes out of it, is not really intuitive. And the crafting system could be overlooked if you had some place to store all that stuff that you ""accidently"" craft. There is a backpack and a chest, both have no use... WHY!? how hard can it be to implement some more storage options for gods sake?I STILL believe this game has a great potential, but the devs seem unable to realize it... yet. There are so many survival games out there, check them out, see what they're doing wrong and what they're doing right AND maybe implement some of the ""right"" parts. What ... you call that stealing? Blizzard has been doing the same♥♥♥♥♥♥with WoW for a bloody decade!Get to it guys! I DO believe in you.===================================================================ORIGINAL: First off, the game has definitely potential, BUT at it's current stage I cannot recommend it to anyone, but the most die-hard early access fans, like myself :).  What annoys me personally the most is the lack of a proper inventory management. I like to collect as much **** as possible in these kinda games and TUGs inventory is ludicrously small. You can craft backpacks and chests, but they're only decoration right now. And the stack size of some items is laughable. I assume they are trying to make the game more realistic in that term, but hey ... it's a freaking game ... it DOESN'T have to be realistic. Or they're trying to make the game artificially more difficult by limiting your inventory, which is annoying as hell.  The good parts of the game right now is the crafting system. It take a bit getting used to for Minecrafters, like myself ;), but it is really good. It lacks the variety of recipes that Minecraft has, but I'm sure this will improve with time. I wish there was kinda like a crafting book, that would store recipes that I already discovered, so I don't have to place down all the items each time again and rather just click on the recipe in the book and it would place them for me.  Graphics are pretty good and it fits to the prehistoric (I assume that's what they're going for) very nicely. There are some hick-ups and glitches now and then, but nothing game breaking that I have discovered so far.  Combat system, I can't really tell, since I haven't found myself in combat yet. There are predators in the game and they're supposed to attack the player, but so far I only seen one and I kept far away from it.			"

								It's one of these EA games that while delivering good fun make us wonder if that's worth it or not. Progress has been relatively slow and there's no guarantee that they will reach the end. They seem to be working on it seriously, it's not a scam. BUT they like others might be chewing more than they can bite.PROS:- nice graphics- some 'Minecraft feeling' where you can explore, dig, craft, farm...CONS:- the world is a bit empty for the time being- graphics aren't very well optimised so you might need a powerful PC- after a few hours it starts to feel repetitive and there's not much to doI was tempted to not recommend it, but I don't regret personally. It was fun.But don't buy it if you're short on cash; wait for the final release. Only buy if you're happy to enjoy it as it is and don't expect more in the future.Updated on 11/07/2016: it seems this game is more or less dead. I don't have any grudges against the team, they failed, that's hard enough for them; but don't waste your money on this failure.			"

								EDIT - Direct and to the point:  They are scammers and I was one that lost out.. I had high hopes for this game and really did like it.. it was really unique.. then they just stopped developing it.  Previous Review:IF this game continues to develop, I can see this being a pretty amazing game.  It needs some grounding and creative story.  I hope this doesn't go down the path of multiplayer PVP like so many others have done that end up bombing.  Multiplayer ... yes, could be very cool...  The basics are there and enjoyable.  Things dropped in the world are there till you come back and pick them up which is nice.  chests and backpacks are not functional yet so that is rather.... madening because you can't get rid of them... but I'm sure that will get functionality soon enough.  The devs need to finish the game before you start putting in multiplayer imho or it won't sell at all because the reviews will go down.  I like the crafting system.. it's rather unique.  I love the game but just not enough in it right now to keep my interest.. but will keep looking with anticipation to updates.			"

								UPDATE 07/14/16: Just read their last announcement here. I hate F2P games to the bones. Looks like another dev abandoning their game. As many other reviewers have said before me, I need to STOP buying f***ing Early Access BS! This will be my last update. I'm deleting the game from my HDD and placing it in my Trash category.UPDATE 06/24/15: The game was update again today, so I spend a few hours exploring the new features and stuff they added.- inventory system: greatly improved to the beginning of the game, still no wearable backpack, but at least the chest and backpack are working inventory wise, which is awesome!- the tools, armors and weapons that are in game so far are looking great- building your house is fun, though I wish there were a little more options for decoration and placing the already existing things (like when I have a item in hand that I want to place, a ghost image of said item appears which I can rotate as I want before I place the item)- combat wise I still can't say much yet, as I have yet to see any hostile mobs, I did some hunting this time, which is ok, but could use some balancing ( a tad to easy i think)- crafting, the system itself is solid, even though items fly all over the place when you put them down to craft, which is only a minor annoyance though. what I really don't like is the missing help within the game. If you want to know how to craft something, either you just try stuff out until something pops out or you got onto the web to look up the crafting recipes, which is what I did, but why can't there be a small guide (like in The Forest for example) that tells me what I need to craft. doesn't have to autocraft from within the guide, just a simple info book of what I need (just a thought ;) )- graphics, are awesome, I have the game set to max quality settings and it's running at a steady 60 FPS on my rig (see below), there are a few minor FPS drops now and then, but nothing that ruins the game for me at least, I'm sure future optimization will eliminate most of these as wellSummary: So with the current state of the game and the options available to play, explore, build, etc. I can DEFINITELY recommend this game to anyone.

								This game is SUPER early... probably not a good idea to buy it if you are looking to get a clean smooth play experience. The game is in early access to ACTUALLY get feedback to not just help the game progress in design, but also to get some help troubleshooting/testing the engine to stabilize it. Update to the 3rd Review 1/19/16: Now you take the game off of steam because you wanna make it better, and exclude others from buying to focus on building a new engine? Ridiculous, I paid good money for you to not let you let new people by things by letting them buy it but you aren't letting them. 1/5 would not let again... also, go play creativerse. Its way better than TUG (for serious though, go play it).Oh yea, they did finally make that recipe book... maybe they need a recipe for not sucking... HEY-oh! But I take all this back since that ino's beard is fantastic.Update Update Review 5/12/15:Game has not updated in like a month or something. The project must be dead, they totally arent working on engine systems that take longer than a couple weeks to build and test for a stable deployment for dedicated servers... jerks.Updated Review:- AI is CRAZY dumb- Crafting is a bit clunky- LOTS of performance issues- WTF why do gourdes glow? Thats dumb.- Needs more non blocks in terrain stuff for building- I'd really like more mob variety- where the caves at, yo?- those little chuckling goblin things scare and annoy me to♥♥♥♥♥♥br>- needs more pewpew, less QQAnother update review:The nubs finally got multiplayer working... nubs.ANOTHER update review:- AI still lame- multiplayer complicated to set up- WTF, y no linux and mac support, yo?- crafting still lame- need tutorial- Hey, make a recipe book or stop making games, cause you suck...Well, better get back to fixing all these problems in the game so I can write a better review of it...(anyone not reading into this clearly, im a dev on the game *high five*)			"

								Eted Review:So, in retrospect, my original review is 100% fanboy BS. Do NOT buy this game.If I had invested that $25 in BTC, I might actually have something worthwhile now.This game is an utter joke. Just another cash grab from lazy devs. They tried to start something that (in my opinion) would have supplanted minecraft. How far they have fallen.Message to the devs: I would ask for my money back @ssholes, but now that I think about it, why don't you keep that $25 and use it to go do something with your lives. This game is so far gone, you may as well.Original Review:Ok, If I had to pick a game, and it were to be one of the only 3 games I would play for the rest of my life, this one would be on the list. Right now, it is in alpha, being worked on by a team of 15 people, (after an investor backed out), and even now, it is pretty freaking amazing. Even the most basic AI these people put together is better then half the stuff anywhere else. I truly believe that when this game is done, it will be mind boggling.The issue that many people seem to have, is either ""I HATE YOU, my Graphics card doesn't support DX11"", or ""OMFG, IT IS ANOTHER MINECRAFT RIPOFF!"". To these people, I would just like to say, learn how to use the thing sandwiched between your ears. Minus the requirement of DX11, and the lag due to poor optimization at the moment, it is brilliant. Textures and lighting could look prettier, and some higher res models in some cases, but this is alpha. Putting aside all the eye-candy, it is really very solid.The team working on this game is possibly my favorite ever. Nerdkingdom, from the start, has provided regular updates, and kickstarted a great community. Kudos to you guys!To conclude, you could go and buy this game now, or later when you find out what you're missing.			"
