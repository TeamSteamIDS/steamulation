												This is another one of those games where I wish I had an option between thumbs-up and thumbs-down. It's definitely not the worse game I've ever played but I don't know if I would recommend purchasing unless it was discounted, even if it's already cheap to begin with.There are definitely positives with this game, don't get me wrong. For several of the quests you're given the option to solve them without having to fight which is a nice change from most games in this genre. So if you find the turn-based fights getting a little repetitive and boring like I did, you have the option to skip some of them by solving your problems non-violently. And the side quests are actually pretty entertaining. Most of them tie in well with the main quests and you usually only have to go out of your way to solve them if you forgot to get them in the first place.The character designer is pretty awesome. You get to shade your character the way you like and pick from a few specific features and then fine tune them which I liked. I also liked the way you leveled up and aquired different designs and body modifications for your character (though I wish you could have picked the way they looked a little more). Some of the NPCs you interact with are just gorgeously designed. Oberon is a pretty amazing looking character and your companions are all very fleshed out and look amazing. At the same time it's clear that they copied and pasted a lot of the character designs and that can get a little confusing. In the last mirror world it gets a little confusing to remember which little bearded man is which and on The Flying Dutchman all the Korrigans pretty much look the same. They're still nice to look at though.My biggest problem with the game though were the two middle levels, the Tree World and The Flying Dutchman. The environment is just not player friendly. In the Tree World you're trying to find stuff amongst the branches and the leaves constantly block the camera so you keep having to go back and forth, round and round to find a character or a nest in order to complete a quest. It's frustrating and I had to keep turning the game off to keep myself from hitting the screen. The Flying Dutchman level does it with darkness and the holds of the ship. It's almost impossible to see where you're going and you have to hunt down three monsters on sound alone.There is no voice acting which is fine, better no voice-acting than bad voice-acting. But there are weird parts where characters are ""talking"" and pointing to things and you literally have no idea what's going on. ""Over there"" amounts to nothing when you don't show what ""over there"" means.Of course there's no real ending. Apparently there was supposed to be a sequel that never got made and it's a little bit frustrating that you don't really get a reward or even just a feeling of sastifaction from all that you did.And a little pet peeve of mine is with the dialogue. You're allowed to choose the gender of the character but there are quite a few times where it's clear that the game was made with a male main character in mind because the pronouns get confused. I don't mind playing a male character, heck half the time I choose to do so when given the option, but if you're going to let me pick a female character make an effort to get it right.			"

												Faery is an RPG that had some real potential and it showed in some places but ultimately doesn't follow through.  It's not a terrible game and I wish I had better than a Yes/No option to rate it but, out of the two, I can't recommend it.The plot of the game is fairly simple.  You are a fairy and have been awoken from stasis where you slept for centuries only to find that the land of the fae has shrunk and changed for the worse.  The effects of man, various fairy creatures moving away to new realms and more threaten the lands.  So the fairy king sets you off on a mission to explore the remaining accessible fairy worlds and find out what's up.  You run a few quests to gain a couple companions and you're off.For the most part game play is very simple.  Each world map is extremely small and so being asked to retrieve an object (90% of the missions are fetch quests) just has you cruising the small map looking for the sparkling object you need.  There are few non-essential opponents on the map so once you clear them -- and they guard chests so you'll want to clear them -- there's little barrier between you and your objectives.  Some quests may be solved in multiple ways such as a horn that you can either gain as a reward for doing a deed or else steal by creating a distraction.  But ultimately all your choices lead you to the same place.Combat is turn based and uses an action point system.  More powerful attacks use more points and, as well, more powerful are of effect style attacks (and your heals) have timers so they can't be used until the second or third turn of combat.  In general I found the combat to be extremely simple.  Playing on the default setting (I don't remember if there's harder settings) I never once wiped and rarely had even a single companion go unconscious.  Supposedly, if you wipe, you all respawn at the mirrors, your entrance from zone to zone, to try again.  As you level up, you gain new abilities and this was one of the sticking points for me: new abilities are tied to physical changes to your character.  So a poison strike attack requires you to have a scorpion tail and a power buff requires goat horns.  Either you stick with a few abilities and just level those up or else you become a patchwork menagerie of animal parts and tattoos.  I opted for the former.  As well, you can gain equipment to enhance your elemental powers.Aside from all this, there's a collection of companions you'll gain along the way which are fairly inventive and each has their own strengths.  One companion is a pistol firing pirate, another summons a raccoon to fight for him and another is a young dragon among others.  There is something of an approval system for your companions although I never had anyone refuse to travel with me.  I did have one fellow pledge his love to me but that didn't seem to go anywhere past the declaration of our affections.  Bioware quality companions this was not but perhaps they'd have been fleshed out in the sequels that aren't meant to be.Ultimately the game just felt shallow and unresolved even allowing for the fact that it was intended to be the first chapter of a trilogy.  The worlds are inventive but small and the quests are linear and obvious.  The characters are interesting but the approval system feels pointless.  Combat was different from today's norm but was also extremely easy and the character customization issues could leave you feeling handicapped.  Because the game is fairly brief (even my 12 hour playtime includes a few lengthy breaks from the keyboard) I was able to complete but I only felt just invested enough to keep going but not enough to really care.  If you have this in a bundle it may be worth playing just to see if you like it but I can't recommend it as a purchase.			"

												Just writing to say that I am extremely impressed with this game so far. I just completed about 1/3 of it, and wanted to post my thoughts:1) The artwork is spectacular, and the character creation is extremely customizable. Sure a few models get re-used, but what the heck, they're fey folk!2) The story so far is very engaging. You can delve into characters and world backgrounds by talking to various inhabitants in the various worlds you visit. I'm quite impressed also with the customization of your character as it levels up.3) for under $8 this game is already a winner for me, as I usually rate my games by how much it cost me per hour to play, and I'm still playing and still enjoying.If you like somewhat casual RPG's (I also enjoyed Lauren the Amazon princess), this game will enchant and delight you. I find the default difficulty to be just right for a casual gamer like myself, but you can increase or decrease the difficulty as you like during play. All in all, a beautiful 3D RPG with classic fairy tale elements drawn from numerous mythologies. (British, Norse, Arabic to name the ones I've encountered so far). You will NOT be disappointed for $7.49 or even the regular $9.99 price.			"

												I do not recomend this game because its incomplete and abandoned. It was supposed to be the first part of a trilogy but was dropped on a cliffhangar.The game is fun and does a lot of cool things. The ongoing character customization was also pretty interesting. Dialogue options are nice, I would call them standard fare though. None of the choices felt like they had any depth or consequences beyond weather or not people like you, which I'm ok with. I would realy like to see the dev's reconsider finishing this, because it realy had some awesome ideas that were done well.If you are a fan of character customization, you might enjoy this. You creat the initial character, then the skills and traits you choose as you level up will alter things, like what sort of wings you have and other cosmetic alterations. All armor pieces have a unique look as well. The fairy tale style story telling is not for everyone but I liked it. Lastly, voice acting would be very welcome. A lot of characters have very distinct personalities that could be greatly enhanced with good voice actors.			"

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Faery: Legends of Avalon Original Release: 2010 Genre Tags: RPG; Turn-Based-Combat; Adventure; Fantasy; Nostalgic My Overall Grade: B Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 8-12 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Nostalgia chasers; Casual gamers REVIEWI liked this game a lot, for what it was.  It's a short (I beat it in 10 hours) and sweet little RPG with combat in the turn-based form many of the classics of the 90s were in.  There is nothing groundbreaking about this game, but it does what it does properly.  The game is short, but not in a bad way... sometimes RPGs are way too long.  There are only 4 areas to explore and the content is limited, but it all flows well and once you're about to get bored something else piques your interest. So, if you are looking for a quick and new world to explore combined with a turn-based RPG experience that may make you nostalgic for the RPGs you grew up on, I think you will like this.The graphics and sound are decent, but nothing special.  And the game worked just fine for me; I experienced no glitches or crashes.  The customization and new party members are limited, but it is enough to keep the combat fresh until the end.  There is no voice acting, but no voice acting > bad voice acting... and it adds to the potential nostalgic enjoyment. So Faery - Legends of Avalon doesn’t have the most elaborate feature list; but what it does have is perfectly adequate.The story is OK, full of predictable tropes, but it was entertaining enough... and it ends right when you may start getting bored.  A lot of people complain that this game ends on a cliffhanger, and it does.  Also, the developers have said they won't finish the story.  It's akin to a TV show being canceled.  But if you just accept that the ""to be continued"" at the end of the game should be read as ""the end"" it winds up playing as a self-contained story with an open ending.  Many stories use open endings on purpose that are worse than this game's ending.  Anyway, you will have to decide for yourself how you feel about it.Lastly, the game is very easy, even on hard.  It's a simple game, so there are no advanced strategies needed.  The depth of strategy boils down to basic elemental strengths/weaknesses and remembering to heal.  Also, much of what would be excessive combat can be avoided by completing quests diplomatically.I can say all-in-all I enjoyed playing through this game, so I give it a thumbs up, but I can see how others with different taste may not enjoy the game.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

												These days, most of my game playing is with my kids, so I'm always on the lookout for games that I think they would like that I would enjoy too.  Fantasy RPGs are right up my alley, so I gave this one a shot.  I'll cut to the chase:Pros:(+) Pleasant graphics and graphical style.(+) Reasonable system requirements-- you can probably run this game.(+) Flying around is fun!(+) Richly customizable avatars (almost MMO quality); can choose male (elf) or female (faery);      (+) Skill selection manifests itself on your avatar as a ""metamorphosis.""(+) Three difficulty levels.(+) I didn't find any bugs or glitches.(+) Trading cards and achievements-- easy enough to 100% if you do all of the side quests and explore a bit.  To my knowledge, you can't get locked out of an achievement unless you end the game, in which case you can restore a previous save.Meh:(~) Story is a little generic, but better than nothing.(~) Combat is ""classic turn-based,"" but also a bit generic.(~) Quests are-- wait for it-- a bit generic.Cons:(-) No voice acting.(~) Controller support is a bit lacking-- it's not obvious what buttons to click to navigate parts of the UI, and sometimes the mouse pointer appears in the middle of the screen and you can't get rid of it unless you move it away with a mouse.  I was able to muddle through it though.(-) The game seems to set itself up for a sequel, but from what I understand, this is unlikely to happen.  The story of this game is wrapped up, but the larger plot may feel unresolved.Overall, it's a decent fantasy turn-based RPG, but maybe better suited for a younger audience as it's a bit generic and doesn't have a great deal of depth.  Note that some of the visuals and characters could be a bit scary for small children (see the promo video)-- up to you how you want to handle that. All in all, a really nice game!  Happy to recommend it.			"

												„Faery: Legend of Avalon“ is a singleplayer roleplaygame in a 3D fantasy world. You can create your own character (face, hair, eyes, make up, lips and so on) and join a world full of fairies, trolls and other mystic creatures. The story is told like a beautiful fairy-tale and makes you curious how it continues. I don’t want to tell you too much about the story, because I don’t want to spoil the game adventure. But what I can tell you: You play a „Faery“ and as such you fly through the game! Really a great feeling (especailly the fast fly with 'Shift'). You will visit different worlds, you have a main mission and you can do lots of small quests. The battles are turn based and with every win you will get experience points to raise your level. With a higher level you get skill points and you have to decide which ability you want to learn or to improve. Some skills also change the characters look (for example the „better avoiding“ skill looks like a cattail). In the different worlds you can also find treasure chests (for some of them you will have to fight) but it’s worth it because you can get health items and also equipment for your character (e. g. new armor with also different looks and elements). Story: Absorbing! 10/10Gameplay: Lot‘s of options and alternation in this game which keep your attention. 10/10Controls: The controls are easy to handle (okay the flying is not always that easy). 8/10Graphic: It’s not the best graphic but still enough to be comfortable in the fantasy world. 7/10Sound: No special music. The sounds are okay but far away from stunning. 3/10Price: 9,99 € - in my eyes a fair price for this game.More: Achievements, Steam trading cards, playable with keyboard / mouse OR controller.I recomment this game for rolegameplayers who are not only searching violence and action, but also peaceful fairy-tale adventures.

												I always wanted to pick this up back in the day but never did.  Was suprised to see it released today and for that price said what the hell.  Upon starting it I saw the spiders (the developer's logo) and instantly knew it was the right decision.  After playing Mars War Logs last year, Bound by Flame, and then Of Orcs and Men (Co-developed by them I belive) I have come to the realization that they are probably my favourite RPG developer of the last couple of years.So this game has a great atmosphere, and art style.  The music hasn't blown me away, whereas some of there other games have some great, sometimes, stuff.  No voice acting at all in this game FYI though that's ok.  The writing is not quite as smooth as some of their latest effforts but still humourous and charming.  All the NPCs have been entertaining so far, and the turn based combat is enjoyable.Two of its strong points are the flying as a fairy which is a blast ziping across the map, hovering etc, all done very effortlessly by a couple of different ways either with the keys or mouse.  Also the character customization is unique and meaningful which really I believe is where Spiders are at the top of their game in all these RPGs.  The skill points you allocate are slotted at different body parts which both affect the way your fairy looks, male or female, and different skills like fire spells or lighting etc.  these then will branch and allow for other exclusive powers and then you can increase the level of each of these.So yeah great spiders RPG character customization, engaging turn based combat, full flying exploration of the different levels, and a charming story about faerys and the dying of magic which lots of recognizable lore like Pan, mermaids, and the tree of the world.

Posted: October 27, 2015
												I had to put serious thought into whether or not I would recommend this game. Just giving it a thumbs up or down doesn't seem fair. It's a very simple RPG and not the most fun game ever, but there are some things the studio got right.To give you some basis of my review... I purchased the game while I was sick with a cold and looking for something cheap and fast I could play casually while I was stuck in bed.  I finished about half of the game, recovered from sickiness, then forgot I even had it on my computer until I was upgrading the system. I guess the fact I forgot Faery was there is a telling sign that this game isn't very exciting. You start off in Legends of Avalon as a male or female fairy/elf, customised to your liking, and with the usual bout of gameplay amnesia. Apparently your character decided to become comatose for some amount of years because the lands of Avalon were getting too weird. Long story short, your job is to go around different aspects of the faery plane and figure out why the magic is supposedly all janky and the inhabitants are acting crazy/aloof/lazy. Let the fetch quests begin!Here is what the game does right...1. Flying around is superbly easy and actually fun. You will spend 100% of your time flying in this game. Controls are simple with mouse and keyboard or a controller. A good portion of my logged hours probably come from me just zooming around and testing the borders of each level's space. The scaling of your character and its environment is also nice. You really do feel small when you're flying around or talking to the bigger more humanoid characters.2. Upgrading your character actually changes its physical appearance. This ranges from changes in armour to actual body modifications like horns, wings, tails, tattoos, etc... Each addition adds perks or changes your fighting style and/or element. It's really great seeing how your character changes through the game.3. Traditional faery lore. You can see that there was some thought put into how the game world would be constructed and it definitely borrows from the older legends of fae. 4. How you respond to other characters changes the game dynamics. Not terribly, you won't be locked out of any quests or not be able to finish the main mission. The game is still very linear and definitely nothing at Mass Effect level moral decisions, but your actions do affect the style of your gameplay. For example, if you say something which conflicts with one of your followers, they'll begin to dislike you. If you're awesome to them, they'll give you gifts of armour or weapons. Fetch quests often give you the ability to choose between combative solutions and conversation based solutions. Sometimes you can get out of going through a horde of tedious turn-based battles if you opt to assemble a tool or talk to a certain character the right way.5. Battles are turn-based, so you might like or hate that. However, you can avoid many battles simply by flying over them. Most of the time, unless it's a boss or necessity to get to a new area, you choose when you want to fight. Of course, if you ignore too many battles, your level will be too low to take on a boss. Most of the battles are pretty simple and require only a minimum amount of strategy. This might be good if you have no experience at this type of gameplay. There's no blood or gore (enemies either fade away or slump over when defeated), quite low on the violence level, so this might be good if you're looking for something more kid friendly.Here is where the game has problems...1. The level design is quite boring. The textures are good and everything is well modelled, blah blah blah... But it's all just rather dull looking. If it wasn't for the characters, you could pluck the bulk of the landscapes out of any other game. With the exception of maybe the scarab level, it's just not very ""magical"" feeling. Even though the levels appear huge because you're a small fairy, the levels are tiny and there are tons of invisible walls. I imagine it's akin to the feeling a mouse would have being locked in a living room. If you're looking for an open word type game, this is definitely not it! The game world starts feeling small very quickly. 2. Fetch quests! Not necessarily a bad thing. Everyone goes into an RPG game knowing that they're about to do fetch quests. But these quests just feel kinda empty most of the time. You can't interact with objects in the environment and there are practically no FMVs. Collecting a special item (and by collecting I mean flying over to it then seeing it disappear) and returning it to the correct NPC just makes your screen fade to black then open up to you in another dialog screen. It's very unfulfilling. At one point... !!!SPOILER!!! ... You're tasked with helping a baby dragon hatch, but you never see the process at all. The dragon just appears next to you as a follower.3. On the note of NPC's, get ready to see a lot of the same models over and over again with just different clothing. Even their mannerisms are the same. Dialog is done through text only, there is no voice acting. If you're an old school gamer, you won't so much mind the lack of voices, There are plenty of games which do just fine without having that element of sound. But it is very awkward watching the characters mouth every word of the subtitles. Faery feels more like a game meant to have voice acting, but the studio might have run out of money to finish that part.4. This is the first and last game of the series. You get the four small levels that come with Legends of Avalon and that's it. The story was left open because of the intention of this being a series of Xbox Live titles. Very anti-climatic. Faery was produced by a small studio and it didn't make them enough money to continue the series. You can tell that the team has talent because of the awesome looking concept art during loading screens and the attention to lore. It would be nice to see this game redone by a larger studio with more funds and time. Seems like lost potential for a game world which could have been much more immersive and interesting. Would I recommend this game? Yes and no. If it's only £5/$5, then yes. It did entertain me briefly so I don't feel like I lost money. I got a stable, playable game for the same amount of money as a sandwich and chips. Do you need to go out of your way to play this game? No.  You won't be missing anything important.			"

												A short but sweet, rather unusual turn-based RPG that has its flaws but nothing that would stop it being a game I would recommend. The soundtrack is good quality. The graphics work well for the quirky, fey, slightly childish feel of the game. I love the way you customise the main character as you level up, your physical appearance drastically changes. The equipment sets look distinctive as well. Flying freely through levels and finding hidden items is also a lot of fun. I enjoy the story of being a Fey going through various realms based on different folk tales, the world initially feels a little childish but there are some slightly dark elements to the plot. I like turn-based RPGs and enjoy the idea of seeing a game that mixes my favourite console RPG and computer RPG styles.This game is often accused of being unfinished. It is a finished, if very short, game, but it is blatantly the first in a series of games. Unfortunately the rest of the games don't actually exist. I wish this game was longer but I don't think it feels unfinished.My only other criticisms of the game are that initial character creation is a little limited (it is fun to be able to colour your hair and skin any colour you want though), you can barely customise other party members, and that I've had the occasional issue running it, nothing I couldn'teasily fix.

												Loved this game back when it was released in the PS3 and love it still to this day. You have no idea how excited I was when I saw this on the store that I almost lost breath. I see this as a second chance to try and get the 2nd episode made with enough people buying it from here.Truly a great RPG with fun lore, great characters, and beautiful worlds to explore. I implore ANY fan of RPGs, Mythical fantasy lore, and hidden gems/underrated games to give this game a purchase and try it as I guarantee you'll like it or even love it.I truly hope this will help the developers make the sequel as I really want the second part so badly, ever since it first came out.

												Talking about this game is a little more complicated than Steam's ""Do you recommend? Yes or No"" option permits.  It's not terrible, but it's definitely not worth the 'Very Positive' reviews status it currently boasts, and if it had shown a more realistic ""Mixed Reviews"" as it deserves, I probably would not have gotten it.  But it's not awful enough to deserve a ""Would not recommend"" all on its own, either. Maybe 5/10.I picked this game up because I was craving an old-school turn-based RPG, and on that, it delivers.  It also has nods to folklore of several different cultures, not just typical Celtic lore, which was unexpected but very appreciated.  Its premise had the potential of being quite cool, and its combat and spell system also had potential.  The problem is, it has the -potential- for a lot of really nice things, but on most of them, it doesn't follow through.The story itself has an intriguing concept and that was what initially made me buy the game.  But it's never developed in the game itself and has no real resolution.  What story there is is made significantly more flat by the fact that there is no voice acting.  You're basically watching permutations of the same three character designs pantomime surprise or happiness at you while the same song plays on repeat for the entire ~9hrs of gameplay.  The game itself ends right before what seems like it should be a final boss fight.  It's probably supposed to feel like a cliffhanger but really just feels more like the game was never finished--it literally even asks you to save right after the dialogue announcing your intention to fight and then rolls credits on you instead.My other biggest gripes is with the gameplay.  Your character's appearance is dictated by what spells you want to have, and visa versa.  You can be a moderately beautiful bird-winged faery who gets exactly two very marginal spells, or you can be a mishmosh monster faery with ant antennae, goat horns, a scorpion tail, and have six much more efficient spells with multiple variation options for their effects.  Every spell is tied to a physical appendage being added to your character, which basically renders any time you spent on your character's appearance moot, and frankly, their rule of thumb seems like the more effective the spell, the uglier the addition to your appearance.  The most gameplay-altering choices of your appearance also come very early on in the game (like level 3) and there is no going back from them, so by the time you realize you've locked yourself out of the best abilities, you basically have to redo the entire game to change your choice. Overall, the game wasn't -bad-, persay.  It's okay for what it is, which is a time-waster turn-based RPG with some interesting concepts but not much depth.  I would recommend it to someone looking to waste a few hours, but I wouldn't recommend it without a whole lot of caveats attached.			"

												It stinks that Steam only offers two ratings, ""Recommended"" and ""Not Recommended"" as Faery had me thinking a lot about how to classify it. On one hand there's a charming game with a pretty good art design, quick movement and an interesting world while on the other hand the story isn't finished, (and never will be) the game is too easy and the quests are pretty much fetch quests. The fetch quests aren't too bad as the world's that I traveled were pretty compact, usually beautiful and the characters travel pretty damn quickly. It's not like I'm hiking 5-10 minutes just to get back to a person that I just fetched a mushroom for. The combat isn't horrible either, in fact it does have some depth to it but on the default difficulty setting I only had one character knocked out once simply because I knew the enemies weren't going to win so I decided not to waste time using a healing spell.In the 7 or so hours I played the game I gathered a party of some interesting looking characters. I say ""looking"" because the game never really delves into their personalities. There was a scholarly Troll, a mad hatter looking character with a habit of keeping animals as friends to summon in battle, an efrit, and a little dragon just to name a few. The all handle pretty similarly in battle with maybe just a few tweaks here and there.The game uses mirrors to teleport that characters to the different world's and I saw The Flying Dutchman, Yggdrasil and a town on the back of a giant Scarab amongst the gathering of mirrors but most of the teleport stations remained inactive which I'll discuss later on in my biggest complaint about the game.Then the game wraps it all together with turn based combat that is pretty easy and an equipment screen where different sets up armor and weapon changes the look of the main Faery and the look depends if you picked a male or female protagonist. One of the more interesting aspects of the game was the leveling system. Here's were the character is upgraded a point at a time and the points are invested in areas that change the appearance of the Faery. Dragonfly style wings enable the character to cast fire spells, bird wings would enable wind spells and I had to choose because you're not allowed to have both. The game further defines the character with tattoos, auras, tails, horns etc... My final Faery was a female with dragonfly wings, a scorpion's tail, ant like antennae, some tattoos and a wisp that hovered around her. It was a pretty interesting feature and I enjoyed cycling through the options and weighing the looks and benefits of the spells/abilities that the choices gave me.The main downside is that the game doesn't feel finished. Now there are right ways to do a trilogy or set a story up for a sequel and there are wrong ways. I feel the correct way is to have a conflict, then a resolution within a single game but it doesn't have to be the resolution to the main conflict. Faery: Legends of Avalon ends right when the story is reaching a climax and I thought I was about to fight the first major battle in the game only to be greated with some text and the credits. There were plenty of mirrors left to travel to but they all remained inactive due to the cliffhanging ending of the game.There's also a strange lack of sound coming from the majority of characters while traveling the world which lends an empty feeling to the environments despite the music being good. There are also some spelling errors in the text.Don't get me wrong, there's a lot to like about this game and I think it's probably near the top of Spiders' best works yet and this is where I don't think Steam's way of catogorizing games really does F:LoA justice. I would recommend this game with some reservations because, like me, some of these complaints are deal breakers.			"

Faery: Legends of Avalon is a turn-based fantasy RPG. Having awaken from the stasis you chose to go to when magic started waning from the world, you are sent by King Oberon to discover what corruption is consuming the various faery realms of magic.Pros: The story has a bit of a zelda-esque simplicity, which can be great for a younger audience. There is no walking or jumping, as you and your companions (up to two at a given time) all have the ability to fly. Chests are laid about in the four worlds you can explore, filled with potions or various piece of equipment. That equipment also happens to determine your stats: each different piece of equipment applies either to strength, initiative, etc., getting various bonuses depending on the one you pick for each. You still get skill points, which allows a nice customization by applying them to various upgrades in the form of wings, tails and tattoos. Dialog choices occasionally identify nice or rude answers, and not every character you encounter reacts well to nice answers. The visuals are an intriguing mix of fake cell-shading, but the aesthetics are imaginative and a nice change to gritty realism.Cons: The story seems to want to reference or borrow from various myths without understanding any of them. Let's call a faery Galadriel because of that entirely different character in that other fantasy story. Let's have one of the levels be on the Flying Dutchman because a 17th century pirate superstition kinda, sorta, fits in a fantasy mythical world of goblins and magic, I guess. The game feels emotionless with its drab background sounds and music and the lack of voice acting that is felt heavily, its absence being inexcusable considering how few and short the mediocre dialogs are. The graphical style conceals extremely low resolution textures, bad 3D design, and a disorienting choice of colors, lighting and landscape, made worst by the fact that you cannot land. This is only saved by the fact that the levels are fairly short, even with the sidequests which often involve flying a few meters away to click on something and flying back.Verdict: ★★☆☆☆ - Forget itI cannot recommend this game. It feels unfinished, it feels void of any richness, leaving me void of interest. While it may get a pass for a much younger audience, there's little content to make it worth the trip. I'm saying goodbye to Faery: Legends of Avalon and not going back.—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

												Spiders are a weird company. They are one of the few game makers that try to break free of the 'norm' when it comes to fantasy RPG's and occasionally try things that are little bit different than the ""Tolkien tropes"" of other games. Unfortunately, they also always seem to lose interest in FINISHING any of the ideas they come up with, leaving each game half baked and not quite finished (it was the same with Mars War Logs as well). This game is no exception. There are some GREAT ideas in this game (the fae setting is a really brilliant idea and the way you develop and upgrade your character and have it physically affect your appearance is very interesting) but again - everything feels unpolished and not quite thought through completely. It's short, ends at a cliffhanger that will probably never be resolved and with a not particularly interesting main story.That said, there's enough there to make it entertaining for a few hours. Providing you grab it at a discount during a steam sale then I don't think you'd be TOO disappointed. It might actually work quite well as an entry-level RPG for a younger gamer if you drop the difficulty level down to easy. It also lacks the casual mysogyny of their newer stuff like Bound By Flame.If Spiders took what they learned from this game and put it into a sequel or another game in the same world I think they could come up with something really fun...but as with their other games, instead of building on and fleshing out the game systems they create, they seem to just get bored and move on to ANOTHER short RPG with fancier graphics, a completely different setting and a whole NEW set of half-baked mechanics and they end up right back at square one again. Weird. "

												Pretty, interesting story, good game mechanics. BUT.. and I knew this in advance (thought I might not mind) there is no voice acting. The lips move yet no sound comes out. Since I find the background music anoying as I do for 90% of the games out there, I turned that down. I was left with a totally silent game except for the occational combat grunt. It's creepy and depressing. So I looked it up, this game had voice over on other platforms, the Steam version doesn't. And frankly it just makes what could have been a pretty sweet rpg, into a suck fest.			"

												First of all, yes, this game is abandoned and will not be finished, but does it make the content that has been finished any less enjoyable? The answer is no.I mean, come on, you can be a fairy and fly around as you like - it's totally up to the player.Also you get to create your character at the beginning and you have the chance to modify your character as you like, meaning you can spent your skill points absolutely freely.Ah, right, the story is pretty neat, too. I mean it's okay. I guess that is just what fairies do.All in all I really enjoyed this game. Yes, even though it is pretty short because it isn't finished. I just enjoyed flying around pretending I was a fairy (and that's the reason I bought it, actually).So if you always wanted to be or rather wanted to play a fairy, you should try this game.The world needs more fairy games.

												The story is ok.  Graphics are ok.  Gameplay is ok.  I had read the reviews before I got it so I think that I knew what to expect.The two biggest flaws in the game are around sound and combat.  I don't like music in the games and sound effects/ voice acting were not there.  It was like playing a game with no sound at all.  Combat was a little too dumbed down for me.  Would have liked more depth.There is slight customization of the main character, but no open world elements that would drive you to want to replay it.  Story line is designed to be linear with only slight variation in how you can solve problems. Combat v puzzle.I see this geared more to a younger audience.  Others might tire of the repetition after the first two areas.I recommended the game, not because I loved it, but because it delivers on what it is.			"

												I enjoyed this game a lot!It's a fairly easy old school RPG with turn based battles. If you're a fan of games like Final Fantasy 7 where battles were more about strategy than about action and reaction, i'm sure you'll like Faery.The story is quite simple and linear. No alternative endings and stuff like that just about 6-8 hours with mystical fable creatures.If it's not clear by looking at the cover Faery is a fairy tale. Your custom protagonist is a fairy-ish creature. (Just to clarify)I recommend Faery for people who like a short old school RPG with fairy tale setting and no real difficulty. Just to chill out and relax you know.Just as a side note: If you want to buy Faery just buy it on sale! Cause i think it's NOT worth fullprice. "

Teal DeerDevelopers: Spiders StudioPublishers: Focus Home Interactive Initial release: June 2014Genre: Casual, RPG, Turn-based#Worth/NotWorth: #WorthExposition, Concurrence and SummationFaery: Legends of Avalon is a relatively strait forward turn-based casually simplistic RPG affair. It's on the shorter side, as far as RPG's go. Seven-ish hours give or take based on how many side quests you decide to engage in. With the onset of the game you are granted a fairly robust character creation screen. It could be better but for the scope of the overall game it's more than you'd expect. Now, I'd say the game is pretty casual because not at any point on the regular difficulty was I in fear of not succeeding in battle. Health is fully restored without use of any items or spells after each battle. Additionally, spells don't cost anything aside from late game ones where they have a 1 or 2 turn cooldown and these are mostly for the multiple target spells. Instead of relying on some sort of mana system to balance the game, it instead relies on balancing fights by certain enemies having elemental or physical resistance to specific attacks. Adding to the simplistic nature of the game is the fact you don't really get to manage how other characters level or decide what skills they acquire aside from very late game decisions where it basically has no consequence. You only get to decide how your main character levels and what gear they wear. The level design is also relatively simple, though a bit convoluted in some areas. Each area is basically inside a dome of fog and everything will be accomplished inside the said dome. The objectives can also be rather difficult to find. In such a small area, there are a lot of hidden coves and outlets. With that being said, the game is about being a Faery and as you might expect, you can fly. Giving each of these domes some very unexpected verticality which can take some getting used to as far as your ability to search every nook and cranny. Objectives are marked with some vague orange particles floating about it but these only show up when you're very close to begin with. The game also has some loose morality choices. They don't have TON of impact but they aren't trivial. The writing is good which is nice as there is no voice acting. THE GIST A nice casual RPG that isn't too taxing and can almost be seen as a palate cleanser type of game. The environments being on the smaller side also lends them to be more detailed and are quite varied.Follow my curation for more "

												This game is pretty cute. You can fly around like a fairy and help (or fight) other creatures. The graphics are good, and they fit with the atmosphere in the game. The story line is okay, it is an interesting and a fairyesque(is that a word?) story, but also a bit linear and also very short. You can mostly choose between a violent or non violent option to solve the quest. When you talk to an NPC you can also choose between the good (blue texts), neutral (white texts) and evil options (red texts). So with that you can also make a NPC let you like you more, or less. And with that you can solve quests or problems as well.The character customization is good, you can make a cute looking fairy, but if you want to make an evil one, go ahead. When you level up you can give your fairy special skills and equipment. You can also find several companions to help you in your adventures. So now the combat: it is turnbased, and some skills/spells work better on your enemy than others. It is a bit of balancing who you take with you, so you can do max damage. But you can find a companion who heals you and your allies as well, or do it yourself.  There are only a few things that bug me a bit. I don't like the black lines around characters and objects (I know it is a small thing, sorry). And I miss a bit of voiceacting. You see the animations in the conversations, see them talking, but you can't hear them. Which is a bit awkward in my opinion.But overall I enjoy the game. I like the story, and the combat. I would recommend it to buy it in the sale. If you think that the combat is too easy, you can change the difficulty in options by the way. I hope they make a new game, which you would expect because of the open ending. But no one heard about a upcoming sequel.My rating for the game: 7/10			"

It shows a number of portals in the video but you really can only play 3 of them then the game just stops.The game up to that point is good however. If you want to pay for roughly 10 hours of gameplay and an incomplete story it may be worth it on special. the characters, gameplay and customisation you do get is good and it's a shame they stopped it.

												First of all i only recommend this game if its cheap, i bought it for €1,90 or something like that and it's easily worth that money. You fly around, get new skills, get some story, get loot, fight some stuff and that's about it. The game is not very long.While the flying is quite enjoyable and a very nice way of getting around, the combat is a very basic turn based ""Click what you want to do then click a target"" kind of ordeal. Not much depth there. Sure there are resistances and weaknesses and you can choose your companions accordingly, but there aren't many very interesting abilities or spells. There is however quite a range to choose from for the main character.It looks dated... because it is... what did you expect. While the textures are pretty low res, most of the modeling is actually reasonably done and the fx, while basic, do the job. There is no voice acting in this game, everyone just silently mouthes while text is displayed, not a huge deal, but does make the world feel a little dead. Other than that the design for the worlds and creatures is quite good.The main story is not that inspired, but the character writing is pretty ok and they do feel like actual characters and not just quest dispensers. Although here and there there seem to be some dodgy translations. The quests are pretty basic fetch quests and most of your time will be spent flying from A to B picking up objects, talking to people, defeating monsters, and collecting loot from hidden chests. That said, you fly pretty quickly and this helps to prevent it from becoming too boring.There is some choice in this game, and often you can choose to avoid combat (which is nice as the combat isn't all that fun and can get boring) all the different paths pretty much converge on the same point, but hey it gives a little bit to roleplay with.Pro's +-Flying is fun-Characters have personality-Good design-Has a charming feel to it-Might trigger some nostalgia for olden days games-Does reward exploration to some extend-Many abilities to choose from-Good character customizationCon's --Combat isn't very deep-Looks dated (because it is)-Uninspired quests-Predictable main story-Has a ""to be continued"" but it never has been continued. (luckily the story wasnt all that great anyway so its no big deal to me)-Short finished it with 100% completion (or close to it) within 9 hours. (according to steam it maybe even less due to it sometimes running in the background while i was gone)Does have some replayability because of the different builds you can have, but that won't change your experience all that much.All in all: if its cheap, sure get it but just don't pay to much for it, or expect too much.

Posted: July 7, 2016
												Firstly, let me say straight off, I love this game. I love fearies and mermaids, and this has both. There are alot of good things about this game. Firstly, easy as pie to learn. The flying wasn't that hard to learn. It felt natural and freeing. I love that when you have to go some distance, you can speedfly. So many games have alot of useless walking. You do have to revisit people, which normally bothers me, but with the fast Flying, its a  breeze. Secondly, the fight mechanics are turn based. I get so frustrated with Video games sometimes becuase I mash the wrong buttons, did the wrong attack and get penalized heavuly for it. This game doesn't have that. Take it at your own pace. The charecter creation was so detailed and customizable that I had a blast just makign my charecter, When I started out, I kinda felt that it had like a Slight Mass Effect feel to it. The end is coming and you have to put together a team to face it, and all that videogame plotline jazz. Earn loyalties, et cetera. However, this is much simpler.Now for the cons, but while it seems like there are alot on my list, they actually don't weigh in much in comparison to the positives. So You fly around as a scantily clad Feary. I don't know if you can get more modest clothing later on in the game, but I find the amount of skin shown is distracting. I can't look at her Bikini-mail and not wonder how that monster isn't doing more damage. Anything that pulls you out of the story world is always a little bit of a negative for me, but this wasn't that big. The graphic settings do leave something to be desired. My husband was looking at the game and assumed it had automatically been put on the lowest settings. There is no settings. Screen resolution and thats pretty much it. The other charecter development could be better. Not even four missions in and the first male charecter you meet has a crush on you. Of course, it is a video game......My last big negative isn't really a negative, more of a missed oppertunity. There is no voice acting. no talking. There is conversation, but it is written out. I didn't mind this. I am an avid reader, and the fact I don't have to wait for them to stop talking means I didn't have much of a problem with this, but again, it could have been much improved with voices. Overall, I loved it very much, the bit that I have played. I am a  Semi-grown woman who still likes fairies and mermaids and who wishs she could get a fairy gown and wings and glide around the house. This game is satifying in that respect. It isn't too complicated and there isn't any gore, which I appreciate very much. If you play video games for stunning voice acting or game mechanics or video quality, then this might not be the game for you. But if you have a love for fairis and can ignore the little nuances, then you will love this game. "

												I would recommend this game.  The controls are what I liked and noticed first.  They are very similar to Star Wars KOTOR, which I also enjoyed very much.  With the option to use only the mouse to move, interact, and fly, it keeps this casual RPG just that, casual.  The flying feels ""natural"", uncomplicated, and fun.  The leveling is simple and logical, while still having options to enhance healing, elemental, practical, or a combinations of magic.  The fighting is old school RPG turn-style based where your team is on the right and the enemies are on the left with animated fighting when each person/creature strikes or gets hit.  The story is interesting as are the characters you meet.  If you are looking for a simple RPG/Adventure without overcomplication of puzzles, controls, crafting, or leveling, then you will want to try this game.			"

												Faery present you with a fun turn bu turn rpg, where you can fly in a decently big open world, in the style of witcher, seprarate zones to explore. Being the size of a mouse, a seagull can turn into a boss fight.. so can a crab, which is somethign we dont often get. Beside the premise and world, the game has a few merits of its own, the combat feels great, graphics are fitting for the atmosphere, sound is good, etc. The game is not overly long, but given the price, it is acceptable. The game mythos, i cannot comment on, since i am not very familiar with fairies, goblins, djinn, etc The games only real downside (to me).. is that it is meant to be the first in a serie.. and there is no serie.. this is something you should know going in, as much you might want more, as it is, you will not get more.have fun and have a nice day!-Lost			"

There will be no sequels, and all plot points will not be resolved-Cliche overarching storyline-Monotonous cliched quests (fetch X kill Y)Get this flight simulator with 4 pretty environments on sale.

												An RPG where you can take multiple paths and choices on how to proceed with quests similar to that of games made by such as BioWare, Obsidian, etc.Getting all the achievements are easy enough as long as you manage to snatch every chest and complete all the side quests. The only issue I had is when it took me awhile to finally find where something was, but some RPGs are just like that.Pros: A story that isn't too silly or too seriousNon-linear ways to confront situations.Multi-branching dialog/quests.Plenty of side quests and things to do.Cons: Simplistic settings and options (obviously a port)No voice acting whatsoever, and the music can get boring at times.Sometimes had to use a guide to figure out where something is because sometimes it took ages to figure out where something was.The game is just the beginning of a bigger story, and yet there is no planned sequel.Some of the typos in the dialogue and other text was just abhorrent at times.That said, the game was still enjoyable enough to where I still played it until the end.

												There are games that become instant classics. Faery: Legend of Avalon is not one of those. You might say it is the very definition of an underdog. Why? Well, do not expect all the features that made Skyrim great in here, because this isn't Skyrim. It wasn't meant to be. In fact, if there is a tried and true formula for fantasy genre games, this title is as far as it gets from it. And that's not really a bad thing - do we need another typical RPG?Faery: Legend of Avalon is shockingly different. Not in turn-based combad (which feels more like a JRPG), nor in character development from a series of ""perks"". But the setting, the world, and, best of all, the ""feel"" of the game"". A fairy tale set in a world that actually fits the bill. And the artwork is great, despite somewhat limited textures. Plus, the fact that there are non-violent solutions available, means you don't have to be a serial bad♥♥♥♥♥(not killer, since winning a combat here doesn't mean wet work).Different ""worlds"", or whatever those are properly called, are very small. But there is so much to do, that, at some point, those begin to feel too large. And there are no ""clearly cut villains"" - each of these worlds is besieged by a host of problems, mostly due to neglegence or an unhappy turn of natural (including supernatural) events. Something that you have to put right.As you go on about your quest, and your character evolves, you tend to ""grow"" things. Like a tail or horns. And if you build a character solely on ability choices, you might have quite a frankenstein's monster in the end. Not sure if that's a good thing or a bad one.Sadly, there are a few software bugs there (had the game crash to desktop immediately after finishing character creation, so make sure to save often), and dialogs aren't consistent across genders (whether you are a ""he"" or a ""she"", in some cases they still refer to you as ""he"").  But that all doesn't matter in the end. This game still has the ""one more turn"" factor, and is guaranteed to make you go to sleep a few hours later than you planned. :)			"

												Faery- Legends of Avalon Is a really fun (RPG) packed with a very distinctive ambience and graphic style. Create your character, embark in a great adventure and discover the fantastic world of Avalon! I must say the engine this game runs off of is really great. I was able to play this game perfectly/ smoothly on a windows 7 Porfessional 32-bit laptop and probably lower. same with the graphics, makes the enviorment look almost real. The gamplay is very similar to the Pokey' mon games where you find enemy hidden in the game world, Then during the battle you take your first attack then you haft to wait for the enemy to attack you and hope your character doesn't take a lot of damage and die, repeat that combat system over and over untill you win then continue your quest for adventure through the world of Avalon. You usualy deal with this in most (RPG)'s, but this one is in 3D and it's cooler than most (RPG)'s i'v ever played yet. Also the game play mechanics is 10 times better than most (RPG)'s as well. The only repededive thing to is the soundtrack, the music is well done and fits within both the story and game's enviorment.  However the music that plays during a different fight is the same thing that plays over and over that it makes you not to look forward towards the next fight.  Other than that the character customization is great even tho you half to grind down through the world of Avalon for new clothing, armor, and weapons and magicial abilities.  Also the ability to have my character fly at high speeds by holding that shift key, makes traveling in the magical world of Avalon a lot of fun. I give this game a 7/10 ★.			"

The game is different enough to be interesting for it's short duration.  You fly everywhere, and adding fighting/defensive abilities adds different looks to your fairy character. I am sure people will chose and avoid abilities just for the aesthetics (which I admit I did). It's turn based fighting which does need consideration...so you can't just ignore the game completely.  It's not an open world, you spend your time in 4 closed small environments, doing pretty much linear quests, fighting your way through each objective, and then you're done.  You are given the ability to annoy or be helpful, but why would you be annoying?If you are looking for an in-depth and long game, go elsewhere.  If you want to see some really lovely environments, do a few decent turn-based battles and quickly move on to another game -- give this game a go.			"

												Overall, while I don't regret buying the game I can't say i'd recomend it.A decent way to kill 8 hours if you're bored enough. Neither good nor bad just a mellow game. A vaguely interesting linear plot with small zones and smaller dungeons (more like hallways thankfully). Repetitive combat but it's easy enough to avoid most it. Standard fetch quests but the majority of them are plot related and the rest just fall into place as you go. Ends in a ""To Be Continued"" but has long since been abandonded. There's only two good combat party members (including yourself) and the rest are situational if you want to take the time and effort to figure out the strengths and weaknesses of the small number of monsters you fight. The character upgrades are neat in that they change the appearance of you character (scorpian tail anyone?) but I couldn't tell if upgrading each skill actually did anything. The armor is lackluster - seemingly random drops with only 4 different models just recolored. And you can't customize your party beyond picking who you want traveling with you.My only recomendation is remember the sprint button!			"

												This game is a a real gem.The story is well written, the combat system has good balance and issn't all to difficult. Altough the enemies due have hidden weaknesses that require a bit of trial and error as many are not within the nowadays required 'a chimp can see its weakness' difficulty. But after a while can predict them fairly well.But please be warned;This game is based after a few very old fairy tales and even older stories and legends. So expect it to be a bit on the cheesy and sweet scale from time to time. Pro's:Gameplay, the adative of flight is used to its full extend while exploring the world. Balanced combat: chalanging at times (played at difficulty: hard) but not frustratingly so. A well done story-line with a nice twist at the end. Amazing graphics. Con's:Could have been a bit longer, but thats my personal opinion.At times a bit too cliché fairytalelike. But then again, it could be expected seeing the title.All in all; its to good of a game to simply not play it.			"

												Possibly THE most underated game I have ever played. When I saw this game I was sceptical because it looked interesting but is seemed to lack polish. However this game is mind blowing. Each of the worlds is very unique, well designed with fantastic enviroments. There are many varying characters, all kinds of species, reimaging of fantasy creatures and places but most of all it looks so good. If you like fantasy you will like this game. The only disapointing part of this game is the fact it did not get enough attention to merit a sequel.			"

												A fun little RPG, with just enough background, interesting landscapes, and battle mechanics to keep it from being hated.  Why the hate, you ask?  It seems pretty obvious once you start playing, that they had intended for a sequel to come out later, but because of poor sales, will never happen.  The game DOES end with a cliffhanger, where the sequel would would taken off from.If this is something that you can overlook, then you will find 7-8 hours of good gameplay for a decent price (especially if its on sale).

												Even though there are apparently no plans for a sequel it was still worth the money. Decent Graphics. Lovely worlds. Great Concept. Great artwork. Cool ideas. Enchanting Music (although track variety is lacking).  Strong plot.  Great potential.If you are considering it - Buy the game, show some support, and encourage steam to pressure Spiders and Focus Home Interactive to create the sequels as they are currently not planned for release. The only main criticism I have for the game was the over simplicity of the combat. While the Ex Libris customisation was fantastic I feel that more spells and more tactical combat would have made battles less of a chore.Of course I would also be happy if;There were more in depth character developments between and within the characters themselves. There were more options in terms of weapons and armor. You could customise your party members. You could reset your Ex Libris choices. Some quests were more adequately supported to help you figure out what to do (or not to do) next. There is some kind of benefit or strategy in being rude to people. There were more hairstyles. Your party members interacted with each other and not only you.I look forward to the potential of a sequel.			"

												Charming RPG with an interesting flying theme. Not a fast paced game by any means, but just pleasant in execution. Turning your character around is curiously sluggish, but flying from one side of the map to the other is very fast. There are many NPCs to talk to and often times you do not need to fight with everyone. Leveling up is particularly interestsing- the abilities you choose actually change how your character looks. Graphics are fittingly whimsical and bright. Overall, while not a 'great' rpg, it is enjoyable and has some different characteristics to how it plays. Worth trying out.			"

												Faery is a budget RPG with problems, no other way to put it.Good points first: it has a very beautiful visual style and a fitting soundtrack, and the game scales pretty nicely across difficulty scales. On harder difficulties combat is nice and rewarding, and on easier difficulties the game becomes a breeze to get through.The worlds are filled with unique characters and quests that are well thought out and fit in the world, and you encounter many different races on your journey.Sadly, this game feels unpolished in many other aspects. All the dialogue is unvoiced and delivered through subtitles, and the music, while fitting, sounds like a repetitive rip-off of the Harry Potter movie soundtrack.It also has very limited controller support: while you can control your character in the world with it, for menus and combat you're forced to use a mouse and keyboard combo. At least with my setup. The game is marked as both Partial and Full Controller support, which I guess means just that.And sadly, as of right now (October 2014) the game is broken. The executable will not work, so you'll have to track down a patch from another site as well as copy the PhysX DLL to the game folder to get it to work at all.As I'm writing this review, the game costs €2,50, and for that price, I think it's definitely worth it. I suspect it will give me easily 10 hours of playtime or more to get through, and I do want to continue. So it gets a thumbs up, with warnings.			"

												TL:DR: The game is cut a bit short, but ABSOLUTELY worth the money anyway.This is hands-down one of the best RPGs I have ever touched. The story can evolve very differently, the characters are well made and have very distinct personas and the art is gorgeus. The mechanics are very simple and easy to learn and the combat resembles the Final Fantasy series alot. Flying is done by looking in the direction you are going and pressing a button (as I used WASD it was W, but you can also use your mouse for this). The character creation is simple, but gives a lot of possibilities for your characters look. The leveling system and skill gaining (called metamorphosis) also impacts on what your character looks like. As an example: Focusing on fire magic means that your character has dragonfly wings that grow and gain a pattern later on. Tattoos in the face, around your leg and arm signify certain skills as does differet wings, tails, horns, auras and trails. Absolutely loved this.The story is also good, but is cut short as this is the first part of a non-finished trilogy which I am very sad about. This story had A LOT of potential and could have been amazing when finished. Considering the price it is still worth the money though since the game has a lot of re-playability due to the fact that your actions change the story as you go along and you can play around with skills as well. The art of the game is also gorgeus. A lot thoughts has gone into the visual aspects and all of the areas are thought through from which faery creatures appear there to the general feel of the area through background music.			"

												This game is cute, it's the only way I have to describe it. It makes me feel strangely fuzzy inside. At its heart is a children's story, with a few grammar issues here and there (none of the characters are voiced either, so you need to read all text to follow conversations), but those are only mild gripes.It's old, there's no doubting that, but the cuteness extends to its simplicity too. And it works, from combat simple enough for a child to understand (I suspect there might be reasons to that), to a really nice levelling system that doesn't seem to be possible to break.If you're an RPG fan looking for something a little ""lighter"" than normal, pick this up. Definitely well worth it.			"

												PROS: I found the game to be fun.  My son, who just turned 11, is having fun learning the game.   I have been playing RPG's for over 32 years.  I love games where the main character can be a faery.  You get to fly almost anywhere.  With each leveling up, you can to choose what you want to add or upgrade.  The game IS NOT all about slah and hack.  I love that feature.CONS: You have to live with the upgrades and attribute choices made.  Once you select, you cannot do a take back.  That is only a minor setback though.  I decided to just not make some choices, the next time I play.  The largest setback is tat just when you are really getting into the story, it ends.  You are left with a ""to be continued"" feeling.Overall:  The first playing it, took not too long.  It ended too quick.  Had a lot of fun playing it.  My son played it for over an hour before I bumped him.  (Not many games grab his attention for that long.)  For mere fun and entertainment purposes, I feel satisified with the purchase.  I hope Part 2 is much longer....			"

												This game was short but a very fun game to play as it had a refreshing gameplay style that most common games don't use. While a bit casual especially in the battle spectrum (unlimited magic usage that can be restricted to a max of 2 turns with more powerful spells) this game was relatively fun for such a short game. There are some negatives I have of the game, including the  lack of ability to walk, and the story filling about 11-12 hours on a blind playthrough, but overall I really enjoyed the game, especially because it's one of the few i've been able to finish recently. If you want a story that is interesting and something that is just overall fun as a side thing to kill time, I reccomend this game.			"

												I don't know man. The turn based combat is somewhat tedious, but there isn't very much of it. You can also avoid most combats by doing a ""peaceful"" option quest. All of those are flying around to collect items. Luckily the flying controls in this game are really good and the levels are designed to be interesting to fly through. The metamorphasis system for leveling up is neat. The writing seems like a non native english speaker wrote it. There are far worse things to spend six to ten dollars on.			"

												It has been a year or two since I played this game, but I was just organizing my games library and saw it, so I wanted to write a quick review. The moment I saw it in my library and was reminded of it, I smiled as my memories of the game all came rushing back. I absolutely loved this game and I highly recommend it to everyone. If a bitter,  hard core, JRPG hating, 32 year old lifetime gamer can love this game, then anyone can love it. At its core, Faery is an old school RPG, with turn based combat where both fighting parties remain on their own side until they attack, much like the combat from Dragon Quest 8,  Final Fantasy 7 and others like it. For me, nothing can ruin a game quicker for me, than it being too easy or it having ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dialogues, this game had neither one of those problems and offered plenty of challenge. I found myself having to frequently load save games and strategize and the dialogue was solid and effective. In addition, the difficulty of finding characters and locations on the various maps in the game, add another element of challenge to the game. Of all the games pro's, It is the polished flight system that is the most impressive, I have been gaming for decades and this games flight system evoked sensations in me, that I had never felt playing any other game. In fact, moving from place to place in the game never gets boring, because the flight system is so much fun.At the end of the day, it is absolutely worth the money and unless your one of those types that is impossible of writing a positive review about any game, your going to love this game. If you are looking for flaws, I am sure you will always find them, but this game lacks any glaring ones so STFU and enjoy it for what it is.			"

												The game had a lot of promise; it offered a lot of features that I enjoy including a customizable main character, alternate solutions to major obstacles (ie- not everything needs to be punched in the face), and an interesting premise for a storyline.  However, while it didn't disappoint me, having beaten it after barely 10 hours of play, I would say that it never managed to climb out of mediocre status.  As many of the other comments have indicated, the game feels incomplete.  It stops after you've saved three worlds when you make a very important decision which I won't discuss here for risk of spoilers.  The developers clearly introduced several new models in the third world to make additional worlds viable ... but nothing.  In fact, a major plot point is dropped on you right before the end that was completely unexplored nor foreshadowed in earlier gameplay and yet not unexpected when the revelation is made.  All in all, I wish the game had been completed or had been released chapter style like Wolf Among Us, etc.  Still, not bad for a simple RPG.

												This game might be described as a bare bones RPG, it has the core RPG stuff like customisation of the character's ability, side mission etc but it doesn't have most of the other things you might expect like a branching story or trading collected items. Some people may regard that as a negative but I liked the game, 30 hours into Dragon Age I was massively bored,  felt like I had missed out half the game and was just resentfully grinding my way through to see the conclusion of the story. However here I finished the whole game with all the achievements in 7 hours before I could get tired of it and felt satisfied that I had explored everything of interest in the game.The good parts of the game include the varied caricatured character design, the customisation of your character and the 3D flying exploration. The bits I didn't like was that there was no voice acting for the dialogue and it does end on a fairly big cliff hanger for a sequel that never happened.			"

												When I was a kid, I had an often-reread selection of favorite fairy books. I made fairies out of wire, embroidery thread, fake flower petals and beads. Whenever my family went on camping or backpacking trips I would build fairy houses out of twigs and moss and rocks and flowers, on the banks of creeks and tucked against the roots of trees. Playing Faery - Legends of Avalon made me feel like that fairy-loving eight year old again, in the best possible way.It couldn't have been a more drastic tonal shift from the other Spiders game I've played, Bound By Flame, which I think is best described as a  gritty dark fantasy Bioware knockoff. I got a lot of ironic pleasure out of that game. ""Ok, companion character who is literally Mass Effect's Thane with a man bun voiced by Fenris from Dragon Age's voice actor, who is inexplicably doing a Russian accent/speaking only in the third person,"" I smirked. ""Let's go kill some giant, flying swamp spiders. Whoa - we're making out now, without my ever having chosen a single romantic dialogue option? Sure,  I can roll with it."" So it was Bad, but also vastly entertaining and I loved it.I also loved Faery-Legends of Avalon, but I am not speaking with even one iota of hyperbole when I say that my love for this game couldn't be more pure and unironic. It's still probably not a Good Game, but it was light, sweet, earnest and adorable, and that is more than enough for me to find it immensely enjoyable and loveable. The characters were precious, and it became a ritual struggle for me to decide whether I wanted to take the spunky pirate lady or the baby dragon with me on my adventures. You're probably going to either going to dismiss it as a dumb GIRL'S GAME and go back to collecting pin-up cards of scantily-clad, helpless ladies you've rescued and then ♥♥♥♥ed in The Witcher, or you will love it with all the sincere passion that your soul is capable of, like I did. <3 <3 <3			"

												It's short, but fun. It took me a total of 10 hours to finish all the quests, and I really wish there'd been more- even if the graphics aren't best and the movement can be glitchy it was overall a casual experience with interesting story.			"

												The art direction is stunning (the pirate ship level especially) and the story telling is fresh.I love spiders later rpgs and so picked this up for completenesses sake in the sale but it is a real gem especially at the low price. It will only last you a handful of hours but they will be fresh and fun ones. Play it on easy and treat it as a ""walking skimulator"" and you shouldn't be disapointed.			"

												This game looks great and the graphics are good, but the storyline is faulty and the quests are buggy as crap!!  Some quest you face the walls and can't see  and others you have no control over!!  If this had less bugs and more storylines it would be a great game....its needs to  be finished!!			"

												It's surprisingly short, but entertaining nonetheless! If you're a fan of the old-style turn-based RPG's and character upgrading, this is worth checking out! Sadly, because it's so short, there's not really any point to whether party members like you more or less. This was definitely a stab at something that could've become much more, but around its release, players who had access to it just didn't want to play its style of gameplay, so it fell into the wastebasket of ideas.SPOILERSPOILER: Don't read unless you really want to.The completion of the game doesn't give any feel of actual completion and leaves everything hanging unfinished story-wise. What a shame. :(			"

												A charming and delightful gameThe graphics are beautiful, the story is charming, the characters are  interesting, what's not to like? It can be a bit simplistic in places, and the 'love' aspect seems to boil down to making sure your target approves of your choices (or isnt't here to witness them) and is around at the right moment to confess their love for you.I loved being able to customise my fairy character, though that could have been balanced better. The combat abilities are fairly limited, and combat itself is turnbased and fairly unexciting. Unless you bring the guy who's special attack is to throw bees, a racoon or other animal side-kick at the enemy. Then it's hilarious. In short I loved this game and highly recommend it.			"

												If you love fantasy games this is an interesting one to add to your list. Many of the characters themselves are drawn to look dark and mysterious but all of them are very kind to you. The different worlds were all very creative and I hope they add more to this game. Please be aware that there are only four worlds (including the home world) and this game is not yet completed.			"

												I actually picked this up because I enjoyed the more recent Spiders' games and I was waiting for the next. Entering the first fight I was surprised, it is more of a standard RPG instead of an action RPG like the rest. Even if it was their first, mechanically it's probably one of their best and more polished game to date. (I'm hoping for Technomancer to take the crown.) But since it is so short and with not that many fights, you don't have enough time to really enjoy it.It is also probably unfinished, the game simply ends abruptly, you expect a big boss fight, more worlds or at least some ending. Also don't be fooled by Steam, it is a 2010 game, not 2014 but it actually still looks decent. The second biggest flaw of the game (Beside the story being unfinished.) is the lack of voice acting. I don't think all games need voices but half the game is reading dialogues and the universe is interesting enough to benefit from some.I did not think playing a fairy could be this fun. The flying around actually works and feels good. Sure you will end up hitting some invisible wall and there's a lot of empty spaces but not being stuck in a corridor is refreshing. There are also multiple varied companions so you have diversity for combat. But they don't seems very fleshed out (Except maybe the first two.) and them loving or hating you does not seem to do anything, (Or at least nothing easily visible.) there a no good or bad alignement in the statistics and they never get new dialogue.Another interesting element is that some of your abilities actually shows on your character and improve as you uprgade your them. Like wings, horns, antennas or tattoos and same for the equipement, most are recolors but there are a few different models. Sadly companions level up by themselve, you can pick only their last ability and only between two choices, you also don't change their equipment. Despite all those options, battles are a bit slow and repetitives but I grew up playing those kind of RPG so I'm fine with it.Depending on how much value you put on your purchases, the full price might be a bit high but it's definitely worth it on sale for old-school rpg fans.

												-----TL;DR----- at bottom.I did everything I could/knew to do except: missed out on some dialogue (especially between the companions - so much), left no more than 4 locations undiscovered throughout the 3 Mirrors (and I combed every World, damn), locked myself out of helping those in the poor district of the last world (grew tired of bein' called a goody-goody so I challenged 'em and yeah, 3 side missions I failed because of me merc’in ‘em).10 Hours Straight. It was awesommmme.Any time I've ever heard the term ""guilty pleasure,"" I've always associated it with certain females who, at times, indulge in, say, chocolate. Thus, I've never had a guilty pleasure of my own. Faery - Legends of Avalon is my first blatant guilty pleasure [unless a sequel is eventually made... ;( ]. I plan to play through this game at least twice more, even though my first run-through was on Hard and there’s no point in going again, other than for my own entertainment – thethethethethe game is just too fun and awesome.Should you also jump into the game on Hard, at first, you'll be like ""Oh, okay, I can dig it."" If you neglect to recruit your 2 Companions within a reasonable timeframe, you'll be like ""Humph, I wonder what the game is gonna do when I run outta potions? Am I just not gonna be able to make any progress at all without having to play the same party of enemies over and over til it synchs up just right and I actually win - will I just have to start the *blank* over?! The *blank*."" Then you burrow under the Tree through the first Mirror; having grasped the mechanics well enough--((WARNING: BE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN IN THE SKILLS YOU PICK, AS ONCE A CHOICE IS LOCKED IN, THAT'S IT. THERE'S NO PICKING A SKILL AND THEN LEVELING IT FULLY, TO THEN LEVEL ANOTHER ONE FULLY AND PICK BETWEEN THE TWO, NAW. TRY AND FIGURE WHAT SORTA FAERY YOU'RE GONN' RUN AS EARLY ON))--if you've been a serviceable sprite, having earned some good basic gear, you quickly discover that the game seems brutal, for all of five minutes (relatively). After that, even on Hard, combat isn't too much of a bother, just tedious at times. Once you are in combat, only one of the parties is leaving. No Pausing to Restart, no way out other than victory or defeat. Beware all ye who're impatient, though, if you are such a one, I’m not too sure what you're doin' checkin’ a game with a turn-based combat system... especially one so slight. Explanation: The ways in which you can level your Faery are such that, really, no two play-throughs should ever be the same. So many skills; what’s REALLY NICE about the game is that, every (level of a) skill changes your Faery’s appearance. I ended up with Butterfly Antennae and Wings with spiral designs emblazoned on them, as well as on my cheek, a Scorpion Tail and wispy blue orbs following me. These are the major areas in which differences in appearance show, but there are, what, 12(?)’ish skills?AGAIN, I WARN YOU, IF YOU HAVE A SET LOOK IN MIND, FIGURE WHAT SKILLS ARE NECESSARY FOR THAT LOOK; VERY QUICKLY, ACTUALLY WITH THE CHOICE OF YOUR VERY FIRST SKILL, YOU LIMIT YOURSELF DRASTICALLY IN TERMS OF CUSTOMIZATION. TO GET TO THE EXPLANATION Combat is what you’d expect from it being turn-based, if not watered down some. I was disappointed to find that little to no strategy was ever necessary; all 3 characters in your party are set to the same initial clock, that is: every member starts with their 1-Star (energy required to do the move) attack ready, their 2-Star will be ready next turn and their 3-Star (THE MAX NUMBER OF MOVES YOU GET IN A TURN PER CHARACTER) will be ready in two turns. So, if you’re getting slaughtered, all you have to do is have every member of the team survive two rounds and then you all can open up with y’all’s Area of Effect attacks and, from then on, switch between using your 2-Star+1-Star attacks and then the 3-Star when it recharges again, REPEAT(HEAL)REPEATREPEAT(HEAL)…The combat is not what makes Faery a great game, though; the concept is – the presentation of it. Few games have ever caught my eye as much as Faery did, really. I didn’t ever mind how obscure some of the objectives were or how much time it took to find them; the world is just gorgeous. MY ONE COMPLAINT: Your Companions Will Almost Always Be In Between Your Faery And The Camera, Meaning, When You’re Trying To Fly Around And Explore, You Have Half The Screen Taken Up By CROWDING COMPANIONS. It’s ridiculous. I can understand the dev’s not wanting to make the characters fade out, should the camera intrude too far into their bubble, but seriously: I’d rather have immersion breaking than this constant annoyance. BUT THEN I CALM MYSELF DOWN and remember that there’s no chance of action being randomly sprung upon me, I don’t HAVE to see at all times, go back to enjoying the game. Yes. -----TL;DR-----           I look at Faery as an awesome exploration game that accompanies a quaint text adventure, with some turn-based combat thrown in to prevent the actual fun (flying around) from growing monotonous. MIND-BLOWING DEAL AT LESS THAN $3 (THOUGH, THE CLIFFHANGER ENDING could MAKE YOU INSANE...), prettyyyy good deal at $10, though, for that, they should have done better with the Achievements...EVERYBODY SHOULD BUY THIS GAME SO PERHAPS WE COULD GET A SEQUEL MAYBE POSSIBLY AT A FAR-REMOVED DATE PERHAPS? KIND OF?!			"

												Visually... questionable, feels low budget (not just indie low budget, but actually ""we had no money to do it right""). Has a lot of interesting non-linear quests and ""plot"" twists, many different an wierd worlds, and it rewards exploration too — secrets to be found around every corner. Combat is rather repetitive (jRPG syle) but challenging enough to enjoy it some times.So if you give this game a chance it may actually surprise you, or not.			"

												I managed to grab this pretty cheap during the summer sale, and I have to say I don't regret my purchase. Granted, I probably wouldn't pay much more than I did for it considering that it seems to be largely unfinished, BUT the graphics are nice and smooth and the overall look is just stylized enough to make it feel like a fantasy world without being too cutesy or too Tolkien-esque gritty. There are a lot of really good idea here, and it's a little disappointing that they don't seem to have been fully implemented. Still, it's fun to play and it harkens back to good, old-fashioned turn-based combat and questing from the Final Fantasy VII era without the tediousness of frequent random battles and mind-numbing level grinding. It's a nice, relaxing little game and I definitely recommend it for younger gamers as a stepping-stone to more immersive and indepth games in the same genre. Might end up buying it for my little brother and sister, as well as one of my nephews~!			"

												Awesome Game! Its a great role playing game! The things you say tottaly change how others react to u, and what choices u can  make! And there are usually more than one way to go about doing somthing! U can really give your character a personality based on what they say! And the custimization for your Faery is pretty awsome! You can also choose what type of elements they use in their magic and equipment. The art designs of the world and characters are incredible and gorgeous to look at! And they have (for the most part) pretty acurate faery lore! Sadly, the ending dose leave on a cliff hanger, that was meant to continue in an as yet unmade sequal. But it was still very fun, and I feel it was worth playing.			"

I kind of wish for more ways to interact with my companions because I am having a silly crush on Amareta but I was never really given much options or time to actually get her to like me enough.

												Grab it when it's on sale, since it really isn't worth full price.Pros: The game looks rather nice The ability to free fly makes moving around the world easy (Though the level with the ship is a bit harder as it's a bit more claustrophobic) The story is fairly interesting The ability to play as a girl Upgrading your character is fun, as there is variety, and the upgrades you pick are physically reflected on your character You can use a tiny baby dragon to burn your foes to deathCons: The combat tends to get tedious and boring after a while No voice acting which leaves only the background music to play in the overworld and battle music during fights Lack of a final boss leaves the ending without closure (there was originally going to be sequels, but the devs backed out due to poor reception of this game) No waypoint system, so finding out where you need to go can be difficult sometimes.  Usually this can be solved by talking with NPCs, but not alwaysOverall if you want a quick and easy rpg without too much commitment, this game has you covered.			"

												Honestly, I actually COULD recommend this game to a real RPG fan (like me) if it's on sale for like 2 dollars. I beat it in 7 hours, and that's with alot of time spent going back and forth, back and forth, talking to the same people over and over. All of the gameplay elements are actually competently executed, but, with such a short game, are really shallow and simplistic. The story is somewhat interesting but, again, too short and shallow to really get into, and it just ends, boom, with no resolution (or final boss!). The exploration/RPG aspects are NOT well done; oftentimes, you know what to do, but can't until you find the ONE guy to set you on the path (the path to speak to the OTHER guy, and you already knew you had to speak to that guy, but no, while you could just ask guy A what to do, you can't ask guy B unless directed). Even worse, however, is that the opposite will happen; you'll be told you need a MacGuffin, and suddenly you will get dialogue options to ask people about the owne of the MacGuffin, despite no one having told you his name. Several questlines were cut short via this short-cut, quite accidentally. Also, amusingly, the journal that tracks everyone you meet will sometimes tell you who characters are (relevative to the story) or what to do before the story actually gets that far. And don't expect character development; everyone is one note, period.So, sure, it's got a decent art design, acceptable sound and music, not a terrible system, and the story is midlly interesting, but between poor coding and simply being far too short and too shallow, there just isn't much to recommend about this game. As for replay value, barely; yeah, you can level your character differently and use different team members, but this isn't Baldur's Gate--these changes are very small, and the game is so easy anyway (I never once, not ONCE, used a healing item of any sort), that it's not a ""different experience"" to play like this. As for ""choices"" in the game, sure, there are; mostly, you can either complete fetch quests or just muscle your way through bad guys--that's it, that's your choice system. It's all the same in the end. You can also be an insufferable jerk if you like, but again, it doesn't matter. There is just no meat to this; it's too short, too simple, too basic, to warrant any real attention, except as a fun way to pass maybe a single day, or as an introductory RPG for a small kid.			"

Even though you are a male or female fairy, you are not some little weakling and are about the size of a normal being. There are also so many ways to customize your character, you'd be surprised. As you go about doing good deeds and solving problems, you meet buddies who help you fight monsters and may have their own side quests, too. I've not seen another game like this before. Why?

There are physical & magical attacks and healing with potions or defensive magic.Game is very enjoying but simple and has RPG elements, as you progress you choose which skills you want to learn.I love this game for its unique approach and simplicity.

The controls are not great--for a fairy, my character felt very heavy and hard to maneuver. The dialogue is also unskippable. If you start a conversation with a character, prepare to be there for however much time the game thinks you need to read something.I was interested in the idea: Playing a customized fairy out to save the magical realm from dying. Customization is very limited, however. Yes, you can choose a variety of skin and hair colors, but the hairstyles themselves are few. Needless to say, I didn't get very far in the game.			"

												So forth the game closed itself once and lags rarely.To the game, it is simply good, controls are quite hard to learn but you will get used to it as you are flying.It feels like fairy tale for kids and is simple, that you are the good and you fight against the bad.You have very little islands to play on filled with different creatures and many to fight.There are chests with armors and potions to find.Fight is simple turn-based strategy, you manage 3 characters maximum, at first you can only attack once then another character is on its turn, later you get more initiative and fight for example 3 times in a row or use power attack instead of 2-3 small attacks. There are physical & magical attacks and healing with potions or defensive magic.Game is very enjoying but simple and has RPG elements, as you progress you choose which skills you want to learn.I love this game for its unique approach and simplicity.

												I haven't played this game for long at all but so far I don't like it although my feelings are somewhat mixed.The best part of the game, and the reason I bought it, is that you play as a faery and can properly fly around. Unfortunately, despite this nice bit of control the game is let down by its combat which takes you away from the flying, go-anywhere feel, and puts you into a dull turn-based combat system. All that having been said, the game does have its good points. The characters in the game look really original and are distinctly different from each other almost to the point of being caricatures. As you level up in the game you can unlock new spells and when choosing which one to obtain you affect the appearance of your character by changing parts of them; this system makes you much more invested in your character.Overall I feel like this could have been a great game if only all of the lovely monsters and their animations had been an open part of the game rather than being put into a turn-based combat system that rips you from any immersion. I would also have appreciated a nicer UI and, as many other have mentioned, some voice acting.I will eventually play through the game some more if only to see some of the things in the screenshots that look so imperssive and will change my review if it gets better.

												Before I get into the review a few things you should know: This game has no spoken dialogue. It's the first part of what was to be a trilogy, but those plans were scraped so although the stories in the game all resolve, the main plotline does not, it ends on a rather big cliffhanger. So if either of those facts bother you, then you should steer clear. However, if you're okay with that, then this game is worth a play-through if you can get it on sale, or full-priced if you really like the subject matter. That said, Faery - Legends of Avalon is a pretty decent RPG set in a world rarely seen in video games, which makes an otherwise average game fairly interesting. It's also short, it took me just 7.5 hours to 100% everything... but because of that it doesn't overstay its' welcome. As you might have suspected, it's not a game with any real grinding either; just story missions and sidequests. Despite the flaws I mentioned at the start, it's got a lot going for it: While the graphics aren't super cutting edge, there is a nice overall style that's very consistent and fits well with the theme. Most of the characters are pulled straight from legends and fairy tales, but Spiders have done a good job of putting thier own spin on these characters and blending them together well. The gameplay is pretty standard classic rpg fare. There are four environements that you spend your time in, and they're all quite different from one another. The environments are well designed and fun to explore as you go about your business completeing quests and battling foes. It's got JRPG style turn-based combat. Unfortunately it's a bit simplistic; there is room for strategy, but the enemies are all weak enough that they never give enough of a challenge to force strategic thinking. As a result, fighting becomes a bit of a slog by the end of the game.But thankfully there isn't much of it. In fact, for almost all quests that involve fighting they give you a frequently more interesting alternative route to take that doesn't involve violence. The dialogue is not amazing, but it's decent enough to keep you entertained, as are the stories and quests. Overall, it was seven and a half hours well spent. Now if only Spiders and Focus Home Interactive would get around to making parts 2 and 3.			"

												Delightful and enchanting. While parts of the game (and its combat system) are a little quaint, it still retains a lot of charm. The ability to fly is easy to use and master - and means that your travels around the different worlds are a joy to behold. The characters and monsters are also exquisitely crafted - all providing a deep and evocative story.			"

												Well, this one is somewhat unique, you're flying around in a fairy tale world doing quests, combat is turn-based. Suitable for younger kids, as there isn't any blood or killing (as far as I've seen so far).The creators did a great job on the visuals, while they are probably not state-of-the-art in a technical sense, the world is beautifully designed, and everything does fit together nicely.Probably more of a kids game, but I still liked it.

												I'm really not sure if I would recommend this game or not. The story is cute, the flying is fun, the characters are adorable, but I'm having so many issues. For one, I think that there should be more customizing options for your characters. All the female faerys look the same. Another thing is that the game is not well optimized. I am running this game on a beast of a machine and, during the pirate level, I am yanking my hair out because of all of the lag. Also, there's so much stuff on the pirate ship that it is so difficult to fly. There should be an option to walk at least.I don't so mind the lack of voices, but all of the music sounds the same and it kind of gets on one's nerves. Also, sometimes the words will ""wig out"". They will become distorted and unreadable, making my game experience lacking.With all that being said, I do enjoy this game (save for the pirate level).			"

												I very much enjoyed this game it was light and fun. The flitting around like a flying fey on speed was quite enjoyable. Much of it's appeal come from that and also the realization that your character is really tiny as seen when you encouter the seagul in the 1st chapter. The turnbased combat was a bit of a let down, it reminded me too much of many JRPG style combats. I am not a fan of that style of combat.  This game would of been better as a first person shooter style RPG. The dialog and discussion choices were not bad for an RPG, in no way the worst. The plot and story was interesting. As were the quests you had to do. Also the style of leveling up with the choosing new physical features that upgraded your powers was a good idea.One f the big issues is it is over way too quick. Though it seems the 1st of a series. Or maybe there will be more chapters through DLC.			"

												I bought this game during the September sale for $2.49 and I think it is worth that price, but definitely not worth the normal price. I very much enjoyed the world and character design, but nearly everything else about the game is boring and repetitive. The combat is simplistic and completely unchallenging, and the quests are all of the fetch variety and largely tedious ones requiring little thought. The game is also very short, 100% completion taking me roughly 7 hours. The character customization is good, but that and the aerial exploration of a very pretty world from a diminutive perspective are the only real draws. I still enjoyed my time with it. Worth a couple bucks, but don't bother after it comes off sale.			"

												Faery has a special place in my heart. It isn't your run of the mill rpg. The setting  and characters are unique and very well executed. The story is interesting and new. The different worlds are each crafted with my love and detail.The vertical exploration via flying is very well handled. Maybe games with flying have terrible controls, but this is not one of them.The combat could have used some work to make it more exciting, but it's good enough.Character customization and progression are both pretty good. I would have liked some more, interesting looking gear for the individual characters though.The real bummer is, that it's the first part in a series, which never went further than this, so the ending feels very open. I would have loved to play more of this series.			"

I was a dragonfly-scorpion-ram-butterfly pyromaniac (with some poison on the side, of course)!In my opinion, it's worth a playthrough. Even if it's only one playthrough.As for the cons, I think the companionship system could have been better. I wish I could have customized my companions as well. The fact that I didn't get to use my baby dragon just because I was already roasting my enemies was a little disappointing. There is also no voice acting for anyone who is picky about that kind of thing. I am not, but you know...to each his own.Overall, I give it a 7/10 and I do recommend it to anyone who enjoys RPGs.

												I give this game 3/5 stars.First the good: Do you ever dream of flying? I do sometimes, and this game has captured something of the feel of the weightlessness and mobility of that dream. I could play for at least a few hours enjoying the twisting and turning of being a leaf on the wind.It also has a pirate ship sequence that can't help but make me feel like I'm Tinkerbell in a Peter Pan play. And that is simply fun.I also think the music is soothing, just the kind of thing I want to listen to when I'm flying around.The leveling system is unique. You gain various faery attributes as you level up, choosing between different sets of wings or tattoos that give you different abilities. It was entertaining.Now to the middling qualities of the game:In terms of RPG plotting, this is pretty much baby's first adventure. If you're looking for something to get younger children into gaming, this might do it. There's not anything really scarey, no one is permanently killed even when they're defeated in battle, and the game usually offers two solutions: one that is peaceful and one that is a straight up battle. It also provides a scenario in which there are no good options. You will either need to fight or lie to get what you want. So I give it some credit for a level of moral complexity.It was not a difficult game. I think I used a light healing potion 5 times total. There's no way to adjust the difficulty.It uses a combat system very similar to JRPGs.The bad: It was unvoiced.It required a lot of wandering around talking to people asking if they had heard of any of the parts of the solution to the puzzles. If it were a walking game, I'd call it a walking simulator. Fortunately, the flying improves this situation.It's short. Though I give them credit that the $9.99 price is fair for what you get, and if you wait for a Steam Sale you can usually get a bargain at under $3.00.In the end, I'm glad I bought it. It was enjoyable, and I'll probably play it again some time because of the flying and the leveling system. But if you're looking for something serious or challenging, look elsewhere.			"

												Basically a very, very poor man's Dragon Age except with traditional turn-based combat. However it does have some unique features that made me really enjoy it and lament that there will never be a continuation of the story: -Unique concept.-You can FLY! Really fast too. Never seen this in an rpg before.-When you level up you give your character new abilities and upgrade them by changing their appearance. For example, if you give them butterfly wings you get a lightning spell, a scorpion tail and you get a poison attack, etc.			"

												I must admit, this is a fantastic game, for starters, not all problems are solved via battles, they have genuinely alternative solutions that work and are intelligent most of the times, if not all of them. Characters, even if the interaction was limited, they still felt great and were properly developed. Combat was fast, yet simple, increasing your stats via leveling up, was interesting, I liked the idea of visual upgrades. In the end, it is a good game, worth playing, though a shame the other two games, it was meant to be a trilogy, haven’t come out yet, and I can only hope they will eventually be released.			"

												Please read till the end :)I got this game for USD 5 and  being aware of the criticism from some users, stating the Game was not completed. And I am glad to had bought it. I spent 14 hours playing this game and exploring the available worlds of Avalon and I can say:- The game was undoubtedly developed as a first part of a continuous saga, which seems it never came.- The game play is quite simple and the options limited- The skills and weapons systems feel a bit unpolished.- Re-playability is not highAnyway, errors are always easy to point.Still, at the end the most important thing is to enjoy the experience and definitely that was what happened to me while playing this game. This game gives you the feel the developers actually invested a lot of effort and somehow it just kept coming to my mind that this is one of those games that was developed with passion and love. It might sound silly but thats my main point.Any of you that is fond of not too complex RPGs with a gorgeous environment should give this title the opportunity to surprise you.			"

												I'm really not sure if I would recommend this game or not. The story is cute, the flying is fun, the characters are adorable, but I'm having so many issues. For one, I think that there should be more customizing options for your characters. All the female faerys look the same. Another thing is that the game is not well optimized. I am running this game on a beast of a machine and, during the pirate level, I am yanking my hair out because of all of the lag. Also, there's so much stuff on the pirate ship that it is so difficult to fly. There should be an option to walk at least.I don't so mind the lack of voices, but all of the music sounds the same and it kind of gets on one's nerves. Also, sometimes the words will ""wig out"". They will become distorted and unreadable, making my game experience lacking.With all that being said, I do enjoy this game (save for the pirate level).			"

The game provides an illusion of variety, but most of the options are irrelevant.  The story seems interesting, but its progression is quite wooden and uninspired.  The environments are interesting, but running back and forward (often a little lost) quickly becomes thoroughly boring.

												alot of this review sounds negetive but since this game is fun and cheap it makes up for its negatives in way i think most people who would consider buying this game would appreciate. for example, the game is quite short so you'd be glad to be finished it before most things would annoy you, but then i can say for sure how patient you are. this game is suprisingly fun, though like i said it did seem kind of short, especially when i didn't even know i'd completed the game until the credits started. i liked the graphics and the story was quite good too, though there could have been more to it.simple and easy to understand turn-based game, if you've played any other turn-based game at all you'll understand this no problem. the only problem with this is that it remains rather simple for the entire game, even though you gain levels and get new skills it just doesnt feel as though damage increases that much throughout the game. basic attack damage is pretty much always double digits for the entire game and because of this there isnt a strategic reason to use buffs or status effects that aren't attached to regular attacks. the advantage in damage gained by increasing your attack doesnt make up for the damage lost by using it since even most enemies (including bosses) are pretty quick to die.its very much just identify your strongest attack against the enemy you're fighting and then spam that attack (healing in many cases isn't even needed). thats the same for everything including boss fights, which i would have liked to be a bit more than just basic enemy fights but with more health and strength, all that means is that you have to heal 1 or 2 times in the fight. they lacked diversity so no need to strategise. that could get boring after a while but like i said previously, the game probably isnt long enough for that to happen.

												A fantastic game with lots of detail to its world and an unexpected use of the Z-axis/ the ability to fly freely around.  Quests get a bit tedious and repetitive, and despite obvious strategy branches, combat is never truly difficult. The character development system makes up for the repetition by keeping everything fresh as your character evolves, and equipment isn't given the standard RPG treatment;  instead, you can equip items which directly boost your powers (for more of a boost in 'sets').  Want to be a good healer?  Equip the wand and robe of healing!  Overall, pretty light RPG fare which I found to be thoroughly enjoyable.			"

												I'm almost split on this one. I recommend it because I enjoyed playing it mostly, it is cheap and quiet unique.Details: 100% playthrough in around 6 hours. All achievements can be easily gotten off the game. You're playing a flying fairy and get around four worlds where you do some item-hunting quests, find companions, solve problems and plunder treasure chests. There are some turn-based battles encountered. Some Problems might be solved by either battle or item-hunting. Most quests require you to fly around and talk to the right person. Thankfully you are a fast flyer and traverse the small worlds in seconds.The worlds and ideas are fairly original and worth exploring and that's the game's strong point. Flying around in games is good as are unique settings.Bad points: some tedious quests, story ends on a cliffhanger and it is implied that the rest was cut so there'll never be a resolution to the story. (notice the number of standing mirror portals) Fighting is somewhat boring but multiple companions to choose from and few battles in total counter that.Some monsters might be too scary for young kids to play. Otherwise a good youngster game.Oh and on my Windows 8.1 the game minimizes all the time...			"

												Faery - Legends of Avalon is a turn based RPG story game. It centers around the main character that you create solving the problems in a given world before advancing forward in the next one. Faery, however, is an incomplete game. All the mechanics are there, the gameplay, the story, even the combat system. All these things just need more work put into them before it is complete. This game has a beautiful artsyle and is executed well graphically. I found myself drawn to this game in the first place because of the graphics. But graphics DON'T make a game. The story is pretty generic. It had its moments but all in all it is very predictable. Go to place y, fix thing x, solve problem z, return to me for your reward type of deal. This playstyle is amazing for games like Skyrim and Mass Effect and generally RPG games as a whole. However those games give you a sense of adventure, fullfillment and endless possibilities. They have substance to back it up. Faery seems to desperatly want to provide that to the player but just falls short. This is a shame cause I think the game could have actually been something. I found myself wanting to like this game so much as I played but I was ultimately dissapointed. If Faery was put back into development and polished up, given a more wholesome stroy and a better dialog, I would have no problem giving it a 9/10. But as it sits, I couldn't justify more than a 5/10.			"

												This game is cute. You probably won't die a thousand times during the fights (they get repetitive pretty soon) and in most quests you can find an another way to fulfill your goals (mostly running around and collecting things and using them up). The quests are easy enough and  when you level up, you choose your abilities and bonuses, so your character gains new tattoos, limbs etc. What annoyed me sometimes: the flying. Especially when you are forced to do it in a dark and narrow cave or when you are playing an elevator bc you are searching for an NPC or a place and the maps are useless. 3D exploration is fun and being a fairy is fun too, but also irritating! :)The biggest problem is that this game is supposed to have a sequel, I guess? I actually thought that there will be a big boss fight or something, but I only got the ending scene and a ""To be continued"" line.7/10 (Not sure about this score. Probs not going to replay this game.)			"

												For those of you who have troubles getting the game to start up: install this (http://www.nvidia.com/object/physx-9.14.0702-driver.html), restart your Steam, and it SHOULD work! It helped my game.I found the demo for this game back on the PS3 several years ago, downloaded it, engaged in it and got sad when the demo was done. So far I'm pretty much enjoying this game. There is no voice acting, which is a bit weird to me after having played through so many games that involve voice acting, but it's not terrible! I almost wonder if voices would ruin it, and it allows you to imagine how the characters would sound, without the disappointment of the characters actually not sounding like you imagined.So far the story is engaging. It's kind of fast paced but at the same time slow, if that makes any sense. It definitely isn't slow to the point where you aren't engaging yourself, but also not too fast so you're missing things. The artwork, to me, is a bit weird and the outlines are jagged, but that just might be my computer. As for the controls, I wish the mouse sensitivity was able to be set a bit higher. I'm one of those people that like it when the camera can turn fast without having to lift my mouse to move it three times just for it to rotate 90 degrees. The controls are still giving me h*** and I keep trying to use control to fly faster instead of shift. Overall it's pretty fun being able to fly as a fairy instead of having to walk or run everywhere. You can zip around fast! The combat system is turn-based, and fighting is an option to solve many quests, but it's not the only option! You actually have peaceful options to work around some quests. Which is nice if you're trying to play a more peaceful character. You also have the options to be nice/mean as well.Overall I definitely think this game is fun, and definitely worth it at a low price (I got it 75% off, yay!). I've heard that it hasn't been finished and won't be finished, but I'm not sure if that's true or not. Either way, for what it's worth so far, it's an enjoyable and slightly different game than others I've recently played.			"

												The game had a few glitches, speficially when your toolbar is on the top. It kept cutting to the windows 8 start screen randomly. I take it because the game did not control the mouse right. It also glitched quite a bit that only an Alt+Tab could fix. Pretty annoying.The storyline was decent, but you had to read it all vs having talking. The option to skip most of it was great, the game play was just like any other turn based, but way easy. Even on the hardest difficult, there was not much of a challenge. The 2 companions following you around while you look for people etc (getting in your way, especially on the pirate ship) was annoying as well.The game was good, but not worth what I paid for it in my opinion. It has no replay value. 12 hours was what it took me to fully beat it, however, most of that time was spent with me afk due to kid aggro or getting bored and then alt tabbing to look at other stuff then coming back. If steam had a star system, I would do 2 stars simply becase it was entertaining, just the few bugs / glitches as well as the lack of replay value.			"

												My experience in the world of Avalon was not a great one, not terrible either but i have to lean more towards not reccomending it than giving it a pass.All of my time so far has been spent doing fetch quests. Exclusivly. Which would be fine in small doses. The problem is that the fetch quests take you all over the same island multiple times to the point it gets tedious. A lot of the objectives werent important to the story in any way (such as the fetch quests to add a party member to your group). Then when you think you're making progress you hit another obstacle that seems to be there just to stretch out the time the quest would take. Find a missing page, search the entire island after you just did it the first time to find your first companion. You get the page, oh wait theres a bird there, go to the other side of an island to get a fish to give to the bird to get the page to give to the NPC so he can join you.  The game itself is beautiful and the character customization really adds motivation to the otherwise bland turn based combat, each level you gain you can pick a new fairy ability that gives your character a physical change, be it wings, or horns, or tatoos which tie into the combat, but the entire experience just feels so padded, like they werent happy with the total length of the game deep into development and didnt have the time/money to add more content. If  its ever on sale and you dont mind a slow, and I mean really slow start I would reccomend this game, but if you paid more than 5$ for this I wouldnt say you are getting your money's worth. Obviously with only an hour played at time of writing I cant call this review anything more than a first impressions, but if they felt the need to stretch out the game so much from the very first level im not too interested what later stages hold.

												This game is a short colorful adventure. Short due to the obvious unfinished state. Still the time spent playing is well worth it. You, a fairy recently awakened from stasis have to travel to different worlds inhabited by creatures from folklore and mythology. Gathering companions and solving problems are a large part of the adventure.For a rpg game it gives a standard customization for skills and looks, the npcs will react to your conversation choices and you can take an aggressive or pacifist stance to most situations. The lack of any voice acting can become tedious. The turn-based combat is satisfying and the enemy variation is great.Try out this game for a look at something different than the usual fantasy themed game. The graphic style and atmosphere is unique. Sadly the game ends halfway in and you can't help but feel it would have been so much better in it's finished state.			"

												Absolutely gutted to find out this isn't a final product after finishing what's been available since ~2012. 8-12 hours game play; quests are somewhat repetitive: main, side, side, side- oh look, loot crates; element focused, turn-based battles. Still, beautiful scenery aesthetic mods to characters, and flighty worlds made it an interesting afternoon.			"

												This game is a short colorful adventure. Short due to the obvious unfinished state. Still the time spent playing is well worth it. You, a fairy recently awakened from stasis have to travel to different worlds inhabited by creatures from folklore and mythology. Gathering companions and solving problems are a large part of the adventure.For a rpg game it gives a standard customization for skills and looks, the npcs will react to your conversation choices and you can take an aggressive or pacifist stance to most situations. The lack of any voice acting can become tedious. The turn-based combat is satisfying and the enemy variation is great.Try out this game for a look at something different than the usual fantasy themed game. The graphic style and atmosphere is unique. Sadly the game ends halfway in and you can't help but feel it would have been so much better in it's finished state.			"

												If you like games that give you unique points of view and a decent level of character customization, this game is for you. The storyline isn't the most complex in the world (and there are some spelling / gender errors) but it's more than immersive enough to lend itself to the creation of a literally fantastic enviornment. The turn-based fighting is familiar and easy to master, the controls of flying...well, they take a few minutes. All in all, I give it a7/10Would recommend.			"

												Please read till the end :)I got this game for USD 5 and  being aware of the criticism from some users, stating the Game was not completed. And I am glad to had bought it. I spent 14 hours playing this game and exploring the available worlds of Avalon and I can say:- The game was undoubtedly developed as a first part of a continuous saga, which seems it never came.- The game play is quite simple and the options limited- The skills and weapons systems feel a bit unpolished.- Re-playability is not highAnyway, errors are always easy to point.Still, at the end the most important thing is to enjoy the experience and definitely that was what happened to me while playing this game. This game gives you the feel the developers actually invested a lot of effort and somehow it just kept coming to my mind that this is one of those games that was developed with passion and love. It might sound silly but thats my main point.Any of you that is fond of not too complex RPGs with a gorgeous environment should give this title the opportunity to surprise you.			"

												I really enjoyed this game and was very disappointed to learn that there wouldn't be a sequel.  The combat isn't difficult and the art and music is very nice.  A relaxing, casual RPG and the ""upgrade your faerie character"" is pretty neat.  Story is good, especially if you have some interest in / familiarity with myths and legends.  The puzzles are fine and the characters are well done.  Would have been better with voice acting - didn't realize how much I would miss that.I recommend this for when you need a break from the length and scope of Skyrim, Witcher etc.  Maybe not worth full price, since the concluding chapters were never finished, but an enjoyable way to spend a few hours.I must agree with the comments that there is a lot of potential but not enough depth to the game - everything has a feel of being almost but not quite finished.  I still say it's a ""recommend"" though, because what was there was well done.			"

												Faery - Legends of Avalon is a turn based RPG story game. It centers around the main character that you create solving the problems in a given world before advancing forward in the next one. Faery, however, is an incomplete game. All the mechanics are there, the gameplay, the story, even the combat system. All these things just need more work put into them before it is complete. This game has a beautiful artsyle and is executed well graphically. I found myself drawn to this game in the first place because of the graphics. But graphics DON'T make a game. The story is pretty generic. It had its moments but all in all it is very predictable. Go to place y, fix thing x, solve problem z, return to me for your reward type of deal. This playstyle is amazing for games like Skyrim and Mass Effect and generally RPG games as a whole. However those games give you a sense of adventure, fullfillment and endless possibilities. They have substance to back it up. Faery seems to desperatly want to provide that to the player but just falls short. This is a shame cause I think the game could have actually been something. I found myself wanting to like this game so much as I played but I was ultimately dissapointed. If Faery was put back into development and polished up, given a more wholesome stroy and a better dialog, I would have no problem giving it a 9/10. But as it sits, I couldn't justify more than a 5/10.			"

												It was... cute, if short and incomplete. The whole ""be a faery, save the world"" felt fresh and refreshing and the plot certainly had promise, but in the end... the worlds were too small and empty to explore and the game just... *snaps fingers* ended. There was supposed to be a sequel but still... that was wayyy too rushed and, you know, lazy. All in all, the game was well worth the 2,5€ I paid for it but double that and I would've felt cheated.Not really recommending it, no. But it's worth a try when it's on sale.			"

												GAME IS INCOMPLETE! And production is discontinued. Be aware of this before purchase.Update 21/08/2016 - Game no longer works. There is no support at all from the production team since the game was abandoned. All efforts to reach out to them to continue work looks to have failed. Pity, because this game is beautiful and its a shame to see it end abruptly. Unless highly discounted i cannot recommend supporting the people that released this when they have no intention to continue it. Luckily it looks as if steam offers a refund. I may choose this option as well, no point having a game that no longer runs at all. >.<Gameplay review: Control - Mouse recommended over keyboardDifficulty - Easy to moderateQuest selection - LinearGraphics - Very goodVoice - None, all textSound - Slightly repetitive, Calm ambientChoices - LimitedConsequences to actions - Not reallyCharacter creation - LimitedStory - ExcellentPrice - Buy on discount onlyCombat - Turn based systemPersonal feelings:It is a really good game but im SO DISAPPOINTED to hear they will not conitnue with this trilogy! The game style is simple and casual and relatively easy in general but its disappointing because i was enjoying the story in the game. The story itself is beautiful, Oberon be praised and is what kept me playing to be living as a Fae in this gorgeous little world of Avalon. The characters all loveable, the world itself has beautiful graphics and its easy to get swept up in it. The game shows a lot of potential but unless the other installments are made, it may not be worth playing. I suppose if you've got kids though they'll love this game.... no i am seriously really heartbroken i will never hear the end of this story... i love this game... but im really upset by this... Really it truly hurt!Petition active to get this game back in production, please sign it:* http://www.ipetitions.com/petition/faerylegends/ "

It would be nice if there were a sequel to see what happens with the dramatic cliffhanger ending, but oh well. I'm recommending the game based completely on the setting, tone and aesthetic.			"

												When I first saw this game I was very intrigued, so decided to buy it. I wasnt disappointed. The storyline is very well written and the concept is fantastic. There a couple of issues that I found with the game ;the first is that there is a button called Delete Session Data, I thought that it would remove all of the query searches I had done and the list of videos I had saved - not so.....it removed the 'watched' status for every video I had watched up to that point and I had watched about 1/3 of them....grrrrrrrthe second issue is the search facility combined with the user tags. for every video you can add your own user tag which then becomes searchable. the problem is that every video has a BLANK default user tag which is searchable!!!! This means that all you have to do to watch every video is to search for the word BLANK, watch the 5 videos it gives (removing the BLANK tag for each) and then search again for the word BLANK - rinse repeat until all videos have been watched. This would totally defeat the object of being a detective and piecing the story together.all in all, a very good and enjoyable game			"

												I do not regret buying this for one reason. I only play $2.25 for it over a year go. It was exactly what i expected a casual RPG turn based combat. Interesting story... however. The story just gets going after the first 3 mirrors and you figure out what is going on. Then you go back talk to Oberon and after a long conversation the game is over no matter what choices you make. If you can find it for a couple dollars or don't expect a finished product go for it. Otherwise stay away as it's an unfinished product and that's saddening.			"

												This game was enjoyable to play.  It's simple and casual.  It's not something most RPG fans would sit around and talk about but if you're a fan of fantasy games it's worth playing.  If you're wanting something with a huge world to explore and lots of action this game isn't it.  This game released in 2010 so the graphics look dated.  I also didn't like the lack of voice acting.  If you read the credits you'll see there actually is voice actors but this must be a foreign game and english voices haven't been added so it sometimes feels like playing a Zelda game.  The gameplay is like most JRPGs.  It has turn-based battles, fantasy world, and due to no voice actors it has typed dialogue.  One big peeve I have with this game is the ending. I almost hid this fact with a spoiler notice but I think anyone who pays money for this game deserves to know.  The story to this game is unfinished!  Apparently they originally had plans to update the content or release a DLC and it never happened.  Just be warned, when you get to the ending you're going to have a cliffhanger!  I don't recommend this game but you can get at least around 10 hours of gameplay if you do choose to play it.  It's worth getting if you're a fan of fantasy and want something easy to play but otherwise don't bother.Pros:Interesting storyRelaxing gameplaySimple and casualCons:Lack of voice actingSmall worldsFew charactersLack of direction - sometimes can't easily find where to place an item or find an item. It has a sparkle effect but still sometimes hard to find.Cliffhanger ending :(			"
