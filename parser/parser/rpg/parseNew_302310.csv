												I'll be up front. If you're not into games like Dr. Mario, this game is probably not for you, as that's primarily what the gameplay is in Dungeon of Elements. The gameplay is primarily based around you throwing capsules into a room and trying to match 4 of one color, Puyo Puyo style, to remove all of the enemies in said room. If the smoke from the capsules starts pouring out the door, you're forced to retreat and have to start again. Outside of combat, you can take some of the loot you've found and mix it into a cauldron to produce improved equipment for your character as well as emergency use items that can help bail you out of a tough spot, or you can sell it for money.The difficulty for this game scales relatively well, and the three different difficulty levels affect the starting drop speed for the capsules, boss health, and boss attack speed. Higher levels also start to increase the starting drop speed every now and then, and various obstacles placed within the levels impede your capsule movements, sometimes in downright evil places. But you can also use whatever weapon you have on you to kill off enemies in a small area or bring up your shield to temporarily slow the drop speed greatly (however that works) to help you.Overall, I'd say this is a game worth at least trying out.

												This game likes to bring a fantasy/RPG element to the gameplay of the classic Dr. Mario puzzle game, and it does it well.  It guides the player through increasingly harder levels, 'battling' different type of monsters and include special boss fights that really mix it up.  It also include loot and gear that you can get from beating each level, which allows you to combine and craft various equipment and items to help you during the level.  For those that like a story, they have included one of those as well, with progressively unlocked chapters as you beat each segment.So, if you're in the mood for playing a classic puzzle game, with RPG elements, crafting, monsters, a great soundtrack and 3d model art, go ahead and give Dungeon of Elements a try.

												Such a shame this has so many negative reviews. It takes some getting used to in order to understand it. I think the problem is that it is tagged as an adventure RPG when in essence it is a puzzle game with some additional elements.In order to clear a dungeon, you actual play a puzzle game and it's a lot like Tetris. This is the bulk of the gameplay. This in itself would make it a nice little puzzle game in its own right but Dungeon of Elements takes it much further than that.Note: I got this in a bundle and paid less than $1 for it.As you play through these dungeons you get weapons, armor, money and special essences. You can then do some crafting using these essences to create better weapons & armor. These can then be used within the dungeons to help you clear it more easily. For example, crafting a good set of boots slows down time so you can think more easily your strategy, crafting a better weapon allows you to click on enemies to kill them directly, as well as just through the puzzle game.This makes it a lot more interesting. With the addition of steam achievements & trading cards I think it makes a nice package.			"

												I found this game to have a lot of interesting ideas, but it didn't take full advantage of its potential. Dr. Mario with combat elements sounds good on paper, especially since Arkanoid did a similar thing to the Breakout formula, but there are several issues with Dungeon of Elements. For example, while there are many normal enemy types, they only differ in terms of appearance and potential loot; they never move, they never interact with the alchemy pills nor the board, and they all die in a single hit. Boss fights likewise tend to simply devolve into tedium as their abilities are usually defensive in nature, such as teleportation, invincibility shields, and/or some form of regeneration; the few bosses which actually pose a threat by creating and moving units are all fairly early in the game. Obstacles on the screen are another element of this game which sounds good on paper, but in execution they are sometimes hard to see and at other times (sometimes deliberately) they hide enemies; this isn't so much a challenge as it is a struggle with the aesthetics. Pits which pills can fall into are another interesting idea, but they are rarely anything but beneficial and this leads to one of the bigger overarching issues at play here; the player is given a ridiculously huge advantage from many of the unique aspects of this game. Weapons have fairly length cooldown times, but can devastate a substantial number of enemies in a single hit, even the earliest boots in the game slow down pill drop speeds substantially and shields temporarily slow it down even more (though I never once needed to use my shield until the very final set of stages when playing on Normal and Hard is only unlocked upon completion of the entire game), and crafted consumables range anywhere from large explosions to a pill which will outright kill every single non-boss enemy on the screen.There's plenty of content here for anyone who *really* likes the Dr. Mario formula and there are many interesting mechanics present, but Dungeon of Elements fails to take full advantage of its systems and ultimately comes across as being a case of quantity over quality and simply ends up feeling repetitive.

												My score for this game: 9.5/10I spent entirely too much time playing Dr. Mario when I was roughly 8. My parents spent alot of time with it, my grandparents also spent alot of time with it when they had the old Nintendo. This game brings back the genre that the newer versions of Dr. Mario butchered and adds the new twist of having an RPG element. Yes, this sounds extremely odd. But I LOVE IT. Pros: A well done twist of a nostalgic genre with a modern RPG element twist. Graphics are not bad, good by indie developer standards. - Anytime I can crack open an indie game and they put a sufficient amount of detail (Characters blinking, breathing, moving, etc) I know they spent a good deal of time on it.Achievements. - Gotta catch em all.Items and inventory. - I questioned this at first, but I'm extremely glad it was added and it adds a much needed new element to this genre.Runs on old single core machines. - Ye olde Turion 64 processor and 1GB of RAM should work just fine.Fun and relaxing - Some games are fun and relaxing, some are fun but leave you frazzled. This game is nice after a long day of work. There are no Zombie Nazis screaming in your ear on this game, but it does have some nice tunes.Cons:No free taco with purchase. What I would like to see:Multiplayer - The wife wants to punish me. I would like to play this with the parents some day. :)Kudos on a well done game. I hope to see more in the future.PS. Bought this game on kickstarter. Just loaded it onto steam!-Sier			"

												Not good, not good at all.I know you’re never supposed to judge a book by it’s cover, but there was nothing good about this game from the moment I first booted it up. You first are put into an RPG character creation screen which was quite odd since this is obviously a casual match-the-colors game, and I cannot even begin to explain how atrocious the character modeling was. Afterwards I was greeted to the “story” presented via a huge book overlayed with what appeared to be Microsofts default Times New Roman font; it was extremely out of place. Finally I began the tutorial and after the first few tool tips nothing happened. That’s right, the game froze during the first 2 minutes of the tutorial level.Not to be deterred (and against my better judgement) I rebooted the game. It’s apparently an amalgamation of tetris type drop n’ match with completely inexplicable items and rpg elements. The first level- or at least what I presumed to be the first - took no more than 12 seconds to beat and at the same time I apparently killed a boss sans weapon. I moved on to (again I am assuming) the second level and that is where I stayed for a good half an hour. The difficulty was just completely broken.In between levels there are art assets that are completely missing, yet have functional tool tips. There is no explanation of anything in the “overworld” and during my time with the game I had it freeze 3 times. In summary, aside from being broken, all the concepts promised in this game are executed much better by other titles. A definite pass on Dungeon of Elements.			"

												Dungeon of Elements is a repetitive Puyo Puyo clone with a few and scarce fun boss battles and a bunch of shallow and incoherent RPG elements thrown into it.The core rules of the game are simple: You drop colored pills from the top of the screen onto colored enemies down below, and when you match 4 elements of the same color (not necessarily in one line, as in Dr. Mario), they disappear.First off, the positives.Puyo Puyo is fun! Bosses in Dungeon Elements are also fun! Each boss is one of their kind, has a set of its own unique abilities (e.g. regain health from nearby pills, spawn hordes of enemies running towards you, shoot a projectile that destroys your pills, etc), and it felt very enjoyable and rewarding to figure out mid-game what those abilities were, understand how to counter them, adjust the play style accordingly and win.So, why is this not recommended? Well, because sadly I’ve already pretty much ran out of the nice things to say.My main gripe with the game is that it is incredibly padded. For each fun boss there are about 5 near identical and tedious non-boss levels that you just have to… sit through. There is no real sense of challenge in those levels, no new rules, nothing. They are just boring timewasters. You drop pills onto enemies and match colors, that’s it. The enemy and obstacle layouts do change, but that has almost no impact on the gameplay. In my opinion, if the regular stages were made optional, like challenges and side missions, the game would have become instantly better due to the uniqueness of each boss level. It would have been much nicer if all of those levels were turned into optional side missions, leaving only the boss battles obligatory, or reducing the number of non-boss stages in each dungeon to just one.The “RPG” elements are incredibly rudimentary and abstract. You have a shield that lets you slow down time once in a while, a sword that destroys N cells once every M seconds, boots that just make blocks fall slightly slower, “pets” that are supposed to automate item pickups, but in reality only mess up combos by randomly picking up strategically important items (which means you do NOT want to have a pet at any time), and you have armor which… serves no purpose whatsoever, aside from being a cosmetic item.You can also craft a number of bombs and use them episodically, but somehow I easily managed to beat the whole game on Normal(the hardest available difficuly that did not require New Game+) without using them even once.Another significant issue is the graphics. I’m not talking about the humongous character models that take roughly 50% of the screen for no good reason, those are actually somewhat decent, even though the female body proportions and most outfits suggest an attempt to cash in on the hornier part of the male audience.I’m talking about the actual game board, the part which the designers should have put most of their attention into. And it looks they didn’t. The graphics is very misleading, it is hard to tell what’s an obstacle, what’s the background, and what is a hole. Sometimes you can move your pills through what seems to look like pillars or bonfires, and sometimes you get blocked by a rug, or a hole, or some... dust on the floor? Same goes to actual holes through which pills can fall through. Their boundaries are uncertain, and some things that look like holes are in fact plain obstacles.Rotating pills is awkward and unintuitive. Since all pills occupy two in-game cells, one of the two halves must be a pivot around which the other half is rotated. That is a case in DoE, just like it's been the case in Puyo Puyo. In DoE, however, the “pivot"" half is not designated in any way, as opposed to Puyo Puyo, where the pivot half is highlighted white and blinking. That subtle thing makes some advanced rotations and combos much harder to pull off, since you always have to remember which side of the pill is its pivot. Rotation animations are also missing, which makes doing precise rotations even more so confusing.The story is incredibly dull and feels like a bad book for a young and not very bright child. At one point throughout the campaign you’re supposed to make a moral choice and decide whom of the characters to trust and side with them for the remaining couple of levels, but due to the aforementioned dullness of writing, making the choice just becomes a guesswork. Once the choice is made, you cannot revert it. You have to create a NEW character and start the game from the very beginning to see the other side (pro tip: make a save copy before chapter 8 and when you beat one side, replace the saves and do another... if you manage to care). Aside from the story, there’s quite a lot of flavor text on your equipment and monsters, but most of it is also way too dull to read and care about, and that comes from a person who generally loves flavor texts.Some achievements are incredibly grindy as well and, according to people on the forums, take more than 100 hours to grind them all out, and quite a bit of luck on top of that.All in all, I think the game has its moments, but the sheer amount of meaningless grinding and filler levels you have to sit through to fight the fun bosses prevent it from being a flawed, yet attractive enough to recommend, little indie title. If you want to play Puyo Puyo, go and play Puyo Puyo. If you want a puzzle fighter game, chances are you will be better off with some other games in the genre.			"

I can play it hard core for a few hours and then come back.  I can pause it and take care of my crazy kids, and then come back and not have missed a beat.

												The gameplay is wonderful. It's simple, classic Doctor Mario. Enjoyable RPG elements allow you to craft and find new items that provide play affects like dispatching enemies stuck in corners, or slowing the fall rate of your pills. Terrain details provide a nice twist that brings the play-area to life.The sound design is abominable. The music is genuinely obnoxious and distractingly bad, while the sound effects are wispy swooshes that don't connect with the action, at all.Menu animations are pointlessly long, reminding me of Puzzle Chronicles, where half the game is spent waiting for the game to start. There should have been an option to skip these animations.It's rare that sound design works against a game. I can't remember ever responding so negatively to the way a game sounds, but it's distracting at its best, and flat-out aggravating at its worst. If you turn down the sound effects, turn the music off, and think about what you're doing with your life during the animations, it's a wonderful game. If you try to listen to it? You'll probably go mad.			"

												Wow. Just wow. This game is absolutely brilliant. As many folks stated before me - Dungeon of Elements is a nice crossover of Dr. Mario, Puzzle Quest and others. You destroy enemies by combining 4 or more blocks of the same colour and your aim is to clear the dungeon of enemies from map to map. That simple. And FUN! You find materials and armor, you craft the enchantments and enchant your stuff. You fight bosses! Especially I'd like to mention in-game music. It differs from dark ambient tracks to classic tracks with a original Dr. Mario vibe. In couple of words: Buy it! You won't regret a moment spent with it. Thank you for your attention.			"

												Don't buy this game. It has absolutely nothing going for it. It's a lacklustre mix of stale gaming elements that combine to produce absolutely nothing new. You basically play board after board after board of falling blocks Columns-style while pretending that you're defeating enemies. There is a character model to dress up and pretend that you're levelling up a hero but it's all a crock. Ditto with the map - CROCK! Both graphics and sound are miserably bad, too.Oh, and the achievements are absolutely ludicrous and grindy. In fact I wish i could delete the achievements that I already earned and try to forget I have this game in my library (I got it in a bundle). This is the kind of game you would get free on a mobile phone and never play since it's not even good enough to pass as a casual game. Paying for it would therefore be quite stupid.			"

												I've played this game in beta, and am delighted to see it launch! It's good fun, and is part of the progressive push toward Linux gaming as a supported platform. DoE has a fairly challenging primary gameplay mode (make that ""very challenging"" if you choose Hard mode), and then you end up with components that you can craft with. Personally, I think the crafting search is rather fun, although it can get a little frustrating when you burn through all your components. But then you just go back and grind a few levels and get some more stuff. Tip: Replaying old levels has much better loot drops than repeatedly failing at your current level.			"

												It's a bizarre mix of different elements but if you like the style of gameplay, you have other RPG type elements to intensify the action. The story is well written and while you don't necessarily get to choose which way it flows, at least you can customize your character in look and equipment.Levels are broken up into nice sections where you can clear a few and then go back to doing something else if you want. I find it's best like that, just stagger it out and then it always feels fresh! I would say that's not a denigration of the game but it all depends on how fun you find the core gameplay how much you can play and still go ""yup, still enjoying it!""The boss battles are something else though, sometimes they have some very funky changes to the way you have to play or particular elements that make life a lot more difficult. More than once I've had to rework my equipment to succeed at a boss. That's something and does break up the gameplay with a bit more challenge - but some areas are quite challenging enough!			"

												In Dungeon of Elements, you play a character in a rather uninteresting story.  Perhaps its the lack of narration, and my lack of imagination, but the story itself I found quite difficult to get into.  Putting that aside, I actually really enjoyed this title.  If you have ever played Dr. Mario, you will know the type of gameplay to expect.  The backgrounds can be a little confusing, and the controls will sometimes mess you up if you are trying to squeeze something in a quick spot, but otherwise no complaints as far as the game mechanics are concerned.Aside from that you have an interesting take on an RPG/Puzzle game.  You can use different weapons and equipment you find throughout the game, to assist you in clearing the ""dungeons"" (really just puzzles).   While the replayability is somewhat low, the game does offer an enjoyable means to kill time, and left me wanting to come back for more.If you do not know anything about Dr. Mario, the screenshots for the game can better give you an idea of puzzles to expect, otherwise I would absolutely recommend this title for the price to anyone seeking an enjoyable puzzle adventure.Pros - Fun gameplay, Awesome design and equipment setup, Soundtrack (medieval and enjoyable)Cons - Dated Graphics, Controls and backgrounds sometimes irritatingOverall - 7.5/10			"

												6/10This game was actually surprisingly fun, much more than expected.My first impression when I started playing is that it was just a game that plays like Dr. Mario and has a few RPG elements and not much more than that. But the truth is that the game actually has quite a bit of content to encourage the player to delve further into the game - mostly, the new recipes for creating new items, which is pretty cool.And while Easy difficulty lets the player properly play through the game without much hassle, Hard difficulty presents actual challenge that's not easy to beat (I admit Hard was too difficult for me).The main issue with the game is that it's repetitive - both in gameplay and in content. Boots and shields will only slow down the falling speed of pieces, weapons can be used to break some pieces, armors are merely cosmetic and pets will fetch items for the player. That's about it. It's pretty fun to try and craft new items but they don't make that much difference in terms of gameplay.Also, during gameplay, there's a large portrait of your character there, which serves no purpose except show simple animations when the player activates their shield or when the player's pet fetches an item.The character levels up but I'm yet to see that make any difference during the game. I haven't noticed any differences with my character leveling up.This game could improve GREATLY by the addition of more, varied content and by making it so leveling up makes a difference somehow, perhaps letting the player add points to attributes that cause an impact on gameplay.Regardless of these flaws, it's still a fun game.

												I'd almost have been very positive towards this game. The story elements around the puzzle game give some additional motivation, even if the continuity between story and puzzle segments isn't always there. The puzzle game itself has enough variety to stay interesting. I didn't expect that. (People mentioned Dr. Mario, but this is definitely a sufficiently improved gameplay to not be a mere idea ripoff.)When I started deliberately aiming for achievements to further motivate me though, several achievements weren't registering for seemingly various reasons, even while others at the same time did register, and that was a bit of a low. I don't know whether it's the game or Steam or both, but come on! Every bit helps in such a relatively simple game. (The screenshots achievement for example doesn't work at all - the counter stays at 0 even between game sessions. Other achievements are annoying, like ""play the same level twice in a row"". I accidentally realized they didn't mean finish, just start. And the achievement for canceling a popup dialog question doesn't work for all dialogs, only select ones.)When I had played through the easy difficulty and started normal, it began to get a bit tedious with all the recipes to discover and items to sell or use. Not my thing. And some of the achievements are really just for extremely dedicated players.So it's a surprisingly motivating puzzle game with a good, slow difficulty progression. The achievement thing doesn't completely spoil it for me, but I wish everything worked flawlessly. Consider this a neutral or slightly positive review.			"

												I really like this little gem. It's a variation on your regular drop down and match the colours thing but with some interesting in-map elements to shake things up and the added interest of giving you an avatar that you can power up by crafting new equipment for with items won from progressing through the extensive campaign. Add to this that it is currently in Humble Bundle with the exquisite The Dream Machine and you have a guaranteed winner.			"

												To be quite honest, the RPG elements advertised are very arbitrary and meaningless in the grand scheme of this game. It wants you to feel like a grand amount of strategy is involved but with anyone who has played Dr Mario before, they know it's purely random. Worse yet, the aesthetic is so bland, with such meaningless 3D graphics shoehorned in, they would have had better luck simply making this a Flash game with a 2D art style. Quite honestly, this game loses out to several Flash games I've played in the puzzle genre because it just doesn't really bring anything new or captivating to the table.Save your ten dollars, this was not worth it.

												I'm unable to play DoE as the game crashes before starting the first quest (Old Farmhouse).Frogdice say:""It would appear that there is some kind of Unity issue with certain veryspecific distros and configs of Linux that we are unable to address withour code.""An unhelpful and vague  response to say the least.  If it's only on specific distros and configurations how about sharing those details so we might have the chance to change the configuration at least, or know which distros to avoid installing on?TL:DRI've paid for a game that I cannot play and essentially get no support from the developers except for what feels like a stock email reply.

												Got this in a bundle...so admittedly wasn't expecting a lot.  However, based on reading the other reviews, I wasn't even going to try this out.  I am so glad I decided to read through a few of the positives because this is actually an enjoyable little game.Sure - it doesn't have the greatest graphics, sound or a story (in fact, I don't even know why it bothered to have one).  But if you remember Dr. Mario fondly and are looking for a bit of a different take on it, this is your game.In standard Dr. Mario style, you match the ""pills"", but the difference is that you can progress through dungeons, acquire weapons and loot and there is some crafting built in.All in all, I don't know if I'd pay $10 for it - but if you go into this without thinking this is a AAA game, you'll like it.

You're better off buying puzzle fighter, tetris, lumines and of course Dr. Mario. But those games are all on consoles soooooo.			"

												While many reviews are negative, I found this simple to pick up and play puzzle game to be fun. The story was ok and I didn't find the character customisation all that exciting but as a casual time filler, it is good.After whizzing through the game on easy mode, I played through again on normal and started hard mode. I hit a difficulty wall here though because my fingers hurt trying to keep up with the speed, lol. I then returned to normal difficulty and have since been casually chipping away at the achievements while listening to podcasts. I was surprised to find that I had racked up 60+ hours playtime.If achievement hunting is your thing or you just like to play casually to relax and unwind, the hours of playtime will easily justify the pricetag. If you don't care for achievements and will only play through once for the story, I would suggest picking it up on sale.			"

												I really liked Reign Maker.  A great game and loads of fun match 3 game. Easy to understand and its fast paced. Since this is published by them I expected a game like Reign Maker. Instead its a sloooooww paced match 4 game. Its so slow I almost fell asleep playing the tutorial. After spending over 5 minutes on the same board  I gave up. You have a weapon that can take minutes to come back up. Also furniture in the room is very annoying and not needed. Just make the board smaller if you have to. The graphics are extremly ugly. The trouble is they are 3d but your looking at the top so all you see is the top of ghostly  heads. The animation is just bad.  I really want to like this game. Mostly because of their previous game. However this isnt their best.  I might try this on my desktop to see if its any better. But right now my vote is a big no.Boring boring boring. I was on the starter board for 5 minutes watching pills scroll by waiting for a  2 minutes sword cooldown. The game is boring boring boring. Still puts me to sleep.Game has no energy or looks. Sound is boring. Gameplay is boring.  Who playtested this and thought this was fun? Ill stick with the avoid tag. Sorry guys I still love Reign Maker. Hate this game.			"

I wouldn't have even written a review if it didn't take 8hours for the cards to drop.... Luckly I just afked for all of that. but trust me.. I came back several times to see the cards hadn't dropped.

												Given that I got this game in a package, I can't complain about the price. Unfortunately this i probably the most positive this I can say about the game. You combine small pills in rows og blocks of 4 or more, in order to remove them. There are a set number of coloured blocks, which have to be removed in order to complete the level. This gets boring very fast, and in the end there are nothing that motivates the player to continue paying. Just the same tedious gameplay.			"

												I generally like these mixes between puzzle games and RPG systems: of course Puzzle Quest comes to mind, but also Defender's Quest I enjoyed immensly. Dungeon of Elements, however, not so much. My main gripe is not the ugly graphics or terrible music, but that it's too slow and thus basically boring. You don't get any sense of urgency such as in the other games I mentioned, there is no sense of ""danger"" and in the end it just comes down to slowly cleaning the board of coloured baddies with your own coloured pills. The equipment you can use has huge cooldown times and also didn't offer any deep tactical options that I could see. It might be that later in the game things spice up a bit, but I already lost interest in the game after an hour. *yawn*			"

												I can't really get behind this game.  It's a weak combination of a Dr. Mario-style pill dropping arcade game and a paper-doll ""dress up my hero"" game, and each element, hur hur, is weak in itself.Really, I should have said ""dress up my heroine,"" because that's clearly where most of the, er, ""visual assets"" have been invested.  The male outfits are pretty monotonous.The gameplay visuals are so poorly done that half the time you can't tell if something is an environmental obstacle, a bit of non-colliding background decoration, an enemy, or what.  The animation is clunky and makes it very hard to do any kind of delicately timed maneuvers.The paper-doll visuals are better but very cartoonish, and this whole aspect of the game feels like a gimmick.  Your RPG-style equipment does almost nothing to alter gameplay; in fact, your armor is 100% just for aesthetics.  The ""pets"" are derpy, and not in a cute way.  The crafting minigame is more tedious than anything, partly because gathering materials to actually progress through the crafting tree can be pretty grindy... and this is NOT a game that is fun to grind.There is actually a story, although you tend to forget about it in between chapters... which should tell you how weak the story is.I played it for the cards, I played it a bit more to get some recorded video for a video review, and then... that's it.

The female character art is offensive, parts of the interface are never explained (and *of course* there's no manual), and the ""storyline"" is shallow and insipid even beyond my modest expectations.Also, only close the game using the in-game menu. That's what triggers the game to save, so If you use the window chrome instead, you lose all progress since the beginning of that session, including achievements earned.			"

If you can get it through a bundle of some sort, trust me it's worth trying.PROS:-Refreshing to play-Fun achievements-Relaxing-Low specs requiredCONS:-Bad graphics-Raw animations-Music is tedious-Not worth the full price-Might get repetitiveOverall pretty good game.

												#54 Dungeon of elementsSo today i decided to have a root canal w/o any painkillers.  It was a fun time, really, it was.  I was told i have an extremely high tolerance of pain, because of this.  a few months ago, i ran naked through a leaf cutter ant colony, and then ran to the bushes to lose the baby arm i was holding on top of a fire ant colony (you think sand gets everywhere, oh boy).  Whats my point?  I could not stand the pain and agony of this game long enough to even get all the cards.  Everyone has to have a threshold, right?  This game is it.  The controls are unresponsive, the avatar creation is completely unnecessary, the graphics come right off the playstation 1 era, and if thats not enough, it has a smooth, jazzy soundtrack that makes Kidz Bopz Grammy worthy.  This is NOT Dr. Mario, or even Dr. Robotniks Bean Machine.  if you have even a single desire, heres a reminder: schedule your colonoscopy, it'll be more fun.			"

												All of the puzzle you'd expect in an RPG combined with all the classic RPG elements of a puzzle game.  This could possibly be one of the worst games in the history of gaming - not just here on Earth, but in the entire universe.			"

												I paid less than 1$ for this game and I still don't feel like it was worth that amount, let alone the 10$ asking price. The game is bare bones, handles terribly, rotations don't even have animations, enemies are hard to distinguish from normal block sprites, and bosses are just as dull. The whole affair has a tacked on RPG element with equipment but it is impossible to care when the heart of the game is an incredibly poor Dr. Mario rip off if Dr. Mario also included foreground/background confusion issues. This is just an absolute no go for me, for ANY amount of money that isn't free and even then there are better free games to play then this.			"

												I strongly recommend against purchasing.  The design concept has potential, but the execution misses the mark -- the game just isn't any fun to play.  I felt frustrated and bored for about 30-45 minutes, then decided to uninstall.Also, poor production quality detracts from the game experience.			"

												Basically it's Tetirs. With a story. And bosses to kill. And special powers. And a main character with equipment. And crafting. Its fun.			"

												Puzzle game. Decent. Kind of reminded me of Dr. Mario with the pills and everything, but whatever.			"

												To be honest, I'm a bit confused as to why this game is rated mostly negative. This is not a bad game. It's actually a pretty good for an indie game. I went into this game expecting absolutely nothing but to waste some time as I watched/listened to some Let's Plays, but instead found myself pleasantly surprised at what I found.The game play is a clone of Dr. Mario or Puyo Puyo. If you are not a fan of either of those games, you aren't going to like this one - so save your money, close the page and find a different one. No harm done. But if you are a fan of those games, this game goes slightly farther and gives it more than just repetitive game play; you get a small story and extra features to go along with the puzzle game play.These 'extras' consist of a alchemy system where you collect items in an attempt to create better items, pets, and a small amount of character customization. Nothing revolutionary, but added enough padding to the game to make it enjoyable enough to continuously grab my interest and keep me playing.The alchemy is simple. Mix two items together. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes you're lucky enough to get recipes through gameplay and you can make those items instead.The character customization is very simple. You get a small amount of things to customize, but enough that it feels unique. This is an indie game here, of course they aren't going to have Fallout 4 levels of customization, so if you're going in expecting that, expect to be highly disappointed. Of course the graphics aren't the best, but they aren't as bad as many of the negative reviews are making them out to be. I've seen way worst graphics.Pets. Well, it's cool? I can't say much about the pets because I haven't fully explored that function yet. I know they can pick up items but I haven't been using them much. There are quite a few in the game and several of them are kinda cute. Others of them . . . don't necessarily look as good. But indie developer, so I give some leeway for it.I won't lie, the achievements are very grindy. Am I going to grind to get the achievements? Heck yeah! Will it get to be repetitive and annoying after a while - I fear it may be so. But that is my burden to bear as a person who likes to 100% things.Now for a few things I didn't like.Money. Money is pretty hard to maintain since you need it to pay for using the alchemy pot. So if you're someone like me who refuses to sell anything you pick up in dungeons, then you just get by on the money you find in the said dungeons; which is not a lot. So every time a traveling salesperson comes by, I am unable to buy from him because I do not have enough cash to look at his stock.Which leads to another issue. Why is there a cash barrier on the traveling salespersons stock? Wouldn't it be better to be able to see the prices to get a general idea of how much you need so you can acquire that amount? This is one of the things about the game that irks me the most.So, for the TL;DR crowd. This game is not as bad as the steam reviews would have you believe. It has some flaws, but on the overall whole, I found it to be enjoyable and entertaining. If you still feel unsure, get the game in a bundle or on sale.			"

												I do like this game. It's brain candy. It's the kind of thing I can play when I have a fever and other games are too cereberally demanding. Everything negative I have to say is merely an extension of the game hinting at more and me wanting that more to be there.So what are these negative things? There's a crafting system but it's largely for show. You can embew items with elemental magic which does different things, but all weapons have the same traits. There's very little strategy involved in it. You can customize an avatar, even giving him or her a backstory or something, but the avatar is entirely eye candy. They watch you play the almost-but-not-quite Dr. Mario game. There are pets, but they only differ in how long it takes them to grab loot for you. There's a story, but it's not very good.So this is a $15 game for sale at (currenttly) $10. I want it to be a $40 game, but that's not what's on offer here.It gets a thumbs up, and I hope Frogdice has another game in the works which takes these concepts farther.			"
