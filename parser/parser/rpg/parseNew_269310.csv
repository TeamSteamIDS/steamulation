												For me this game took a while to get good at. It is challenging good old fashion end of the world fun. I find looking for supplies, weapons, etc, while zombies are at every turn to be great addicting fun in this game. You can unlock things that make the game easier or harder, also you can find other survivors to join you and your HQ. The gameplay is really good and does'nt take itself so serious but still makes it great. You will need to make and find supplies to keep your group going and making their stats better. It all mixes really well.			"

												""WALL OF TEXT OMG! No, PLEASE, give me the short version!""-Ok, here goes: Infectionator : Survivors is a game with lots of potential but sadly doesn't deliver, it's says it's released but plays like it's still in early access. Easy to master, quick to finish, lacks replay value.I bought this game on it's release day, it's full/gold release day. It had been in early access for quite a while before that and been on my wish list for almost as long. So seeing that it was finally completed pleased me, so I bought it.The game is good in many ways, great even. It has nice pixel graphics and a fitting soundtrack. It is also fun to play, for a while.The first reef barrier you hit is the frustrating random no-control insta gibs of one or all of your survivors; when on the strategical map, now and then when you move to another city block you get a prompt telling you that your team of survivors has encountered this or that, like a car on the street with boxes spread around it. Now you get pick between two choices, either leave it alone or examine the boxes.The results? Well, it's either, A. nothing of value, B. some lesser valued stuff like twenty rounds of ammo and two food supplies, C. something valuable like a weapon (really, really rare, only found one once), or D. for Death; one to four of your survivors die, with no chance to revive, heal or mitigate damage. And the D. result happens quite often, I'd estimate about 20-25% of the times. So, you learn fast not to examine any boxes, open any doors, or doing anything besides leaving text events alone. The risk is NOT worth the reward, not at all. But it doesn't end there, no no. Sometimes you don't get a choice. Instead, the game simply straight up tells you that one or more of your survivors have died, because ""Hey, tough luck!"". Could be ok if survivors in this game were like lemmings in Lemmings, or soldiers in Cannon Fodder but they are not, they are more like the soldiers in X-Com or  adventurers in Baldur's Gate.Dieing in a hard game, a survival rogue-lite because you make mistakes, misjudge or just plain isn't skilled enough is one thing. But losing because of random events you have little to no control over isn't fun, especially not when these events are text based in an action oriented game, no booming explosions or goory pictures of zombies gorging on flesh, only a plain sentence telling you that ""Mike didn't make it"".Good thing that you can press Alt+F4, restart the game and get a new random seed. Mike is alive!So, how is the ""actual"" game then, when the random text events are finally handled? It's fun.Well, for a while.If your survivors live on long enough (more than one day), either because you chose not to take part in any of the texted events, restarted the game to get a new seed or just got lucky (I don't like this kind of luck, unvolontary russian roulette is not fun, only frustrating), you will  quickly find all you need for your team while you are out exploring the city.Sure, you can craft alot of things in your base, like weapons, armour, grow and cook your own food to make supplies and rations, but there is no need for it really. Because you will find everything you need while you are out exploring, even food. If you have the slightest amount of brain power you will quickly find the optimal tactic to win the action sequences, whether that be the tower defence-like scouting missons or the more free-roaming exploration missions.And then you win the game. On my first successfully completed playthrough I had owned the game for three days, played a little each day. I beat the game under nine in-game days, which there is an achievement for. You start out with a fifteen days limit in which you must repair your car and escape. That can be extended to thirty days if you spend tickets which you earn by completing runs, winning or losing.So, after beating the game, even doing so on less than half of the required time, do I feel like play ing it again? No, not really. I mighth be going back for (some of) the achievements that are left, but I don't feel too excited about them since they are mostly ""grindy"" ones.Remember how I wrote that that you don't need craft anything, because you will find everything you need? Well, guess what, several of the achievements are for crafting lots stuff. Others are grindy in the hoarding sense, either kill things in the thousands or collect ammo in the tens upon tens of thousands, or loot a couple of thous... well, you get the idea.These ""grindy"" achievements might have been ok if the game had any kind of real replay value, which it doesn't. Sure, you can unlock different teams with your tickets, instead of stomping koopas with Mario you can flatten koopas with Luigi, or you can beat M. Bison with Ken instead of with Ryu (ok, maybe this is a bad analogy, ...yeah it is).Point is, there is no replay value except for grinding out achievements; there are no special endings, no leaderboards, no functional endless/survival mode, no actual new things to explore or discover.Apart from this there are also bugs, glitches and genereally unbalanced and unfinished elements in the game. This game left early access too early. Which is sad, because it could be a great game, and I really want to enjoy it.Perhaps it will become updated and finally become ""full"" some day, I surely hope so, and that that day comes sooner than later. If so, I will update my review.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is a tad bit fun. It might even be worth your hard earned monies. But not at the price of 12.99. This is a 2 to 3 dollar game at best. I can easily, off the top of my head, list games that are in the same genre and beat this game hands down: Project Zomboid, Fort Zombie (even with all the bugginess), and rogue survivor. What I expected, from the description of this game, was Fort Zombie+UFO: Afterlight-lots of things due to it being alpha. What I got instead was essentially a more spiffy web browser game (even the graphics reinforce this notion of the game).Pros:+Solid semi-fun mechanicsCons:-No challenge (you don't even need turrets half the time and you would be hard pressed to lose any survivors)-Limited tech tree-Oversimplified mechanics (for a zombie game that's 12.99)-Unintriquing story-Pretty much no content that justifies the current price even for an alphaThis may all change as the devs continue to release material for the game. However, until they do I highly recommend those of you looking for a rogue zombie game to check out Project Zomboid, Rogue Survivor, and even Fort Zombie if you are considering this game. If you haven't played Rogue Survivor it is FREE to download and play, and it offers a good challenge for those who like games in the rogue genre. On the other hand, if you want a good rogue-like game that combines RPG, strategy, and tower defense there is also Dungeon of the Endless which is absolutely fantastic (and very challenging).More in-depth analysis:I recently replayed this game. While the tone is much more apocalyptic many of the issues I had with the game haven't been addressed. Primarily, the issue of getting me hooked and wanting to continue to play the d*** thing. I'll divide this up into several sub-sections.1. Failures on the zombie survival game level. Again, if you're looking for something to fill the void of being eatten alive by the undead (wait, what?) there are plenty of other titles out there. This game fails on this premise simply because supplies are too plentiful. It is too easy to acquire absolutely everything that you need to survive. Most zombie survival (and rogue-likes) turn every move into a time vs ammo vs hunger sort of mechanic. IE, if I engage that horde of zombies how much ammo do I waste to get the supplies they're guarding? That simply isn't the case here. The issue becomes simply one of finding enough food and resources, which are too plentiful. But that's partially due to design. Because you *have* to clear each level there is no room to design the levels around players making strategic decisions (rather than just tactical ones).2. Failures on the level of tower defense.The towers/turrets are still just over-simplified fluff. I didn't get to (and I didn't want to either) play long enough to see if we see towers/turrets evolve. Are they even really necessary? Well, they could help someone who doesn't know how to manuever characters in the middle of combat. I could see that, but I still don't feel that we need them. At this point in time they're just feature creep.3. Semi-successful on the management side:With getting rid of the rest period between fights we actually do see a useful element of management occuring, however this is undermined by the fact that the game is still way too easy. In a 1-2 hour play through I ended up with enough characters to both send out into the field and to research/build stuff (and I choose a 2 character start). If the devs manage to make the game challenging the current management part of the game might become more important and less feature creep.4. Still just a way too easy RPG tactical:We still don't see the game improving to the point of really having much promise. It is mildly fun for a 1-3 hour play through (though boring to come back to). While the devs talk about a lot of exciting improvements none of the changes they're proposing will actually fix the main issue with the game: Making people want to (continue to) play it. I think what has to absolutely be addressed is either developing a decent story to make us want to play through the cities or to ratchet up the challenge (preferably both). The later of which doesn't necessarily have to come from overhauling combat, just rebalancing how players get resources. Specifically, redoing drops from zombies and forcing most of our resource gathering to be from scavenging the mission sites. This might make both turrets (as a way to deal with really difficult waves) and management (as a way to balance injured personel) more important and less feature creep-ish.			"

Early Access Review
								Infectonator : Survivors , Small Review by Santo98I would just like to start with this game being within Alpha and I can not go full blown with this.Pros:- The Music gets you pump'd- The Scavange System is nice- Movement system is nice, you can either click and drag or just click- For being in Alpha, there is a nice amount of weapons.Cons:- After Completing a Mission, you are only greeted by a sentence saying you've made it, at least something visual- The price of healing, I think it could be lowered to atleast 30 or 35 coins, 50 coins is quite a lot- Your ability to reload, automatic reloading between waves would be niceOverall though, I'm enjoying this game so far and hope the best for it and all of it's future updates, being a fan of the series.

												I really want to like this game, I really do. But the mechanics are bad, and the luck factor is completely imbalanced. One game you get 5 car batteries and 6 fuel on your first run, the next you get neither after 4 raids, making winning virtually impossible at that point. The swarms are overpowered and random, your characters are idiots (run through the toxic slime or just stand there dying for no reason!) and there is no sense of balance in the gameplay. It's a great idea and a setup that really should have worked, but it doesn't. Don't drop your money on this one. You'll just be rage quitting again and again after hoping ""this time"" the potential will pay off.			"

												This game is almost good. I enjoy the survival aspect and the resource gathering. However I do not like how you cannot assign a character to rest. He will just stand around ""tired"" for hours. When it comes time for a mission he is tired and will walk slowly for all the missions you under take that night. There is not a way to strategically avoid this. It is a dice roll to see who is tired and who isn't. It is a strategy game so that is frustrating.When you need a particular resource it is not more abundant or more likely to be found at any particular destination. If I need fuel I am just as likely to find it at a church as I am to find it at a gas station. This removes the strategic nature of choosing your missions.The game also appears to be free on http://www.miniclip.com/games/infectonator-survivors/en/#t-sd. Perhaps it is an older version of the game with less features but it appears to be the same game. I paid for a free game. I feel like I have been hoodwinked!			"

								Pretty fun little game. For an early access game, it's pretty enjoyable. Very difficult at times. If you expect it to be like Toge'sflash project ""Infectonator"", you'll be dissapointed. It has the same art style, but this game is much more than what the original flash game was. There's still some room for work here, but like I said.. Early access, so it has time to become something huge. "

Early Access Review
								The game is really good, but I have a couple of suggestions:- I think at the moment it's way too easy. I'm able to hold off a block at ""Dangerous"" level including a boss zombie with only 2 survivors with no problem at all. I now have something like 15,000 ammo and 300 supplies and an insane amount of weapons and building material. Also, I don't know about anyone else but I've never had the need to build turrets.- Going through blocks that you have already cleared is incredibly tedious... you're needed to hunt zombies in the building even though you have done it already? I don't see the point in having to do it a second time, especially if there's one zombie left and you're out on a wild goose chase to find it is pretty agrivating. Maybe after a random amount of days those blocks can become repopulated with zombies again?- I really dislike that you have to always return back to your HQ in order to save progress. I think there should be an option to set up camp at the block that you have just cleared, maybe have a limit per in-game day that you can do this.- I hate that you can switch equipment mid-clearing. It should be that the weapons that the survivors are already using to shoot zombies just stay that way until it's clear.- Just a glitch I've come across when clearing zombies in the merchant block. I headed to a merchant block that I had already cleared and found that there were two merchants?? I couldn't talk to the second one or anything, it was just his playermodel standing there. No guards, just the merchant.- It'd be great to see more variety/customisation in the survivors. Maybe like weapon specialisations, such as rifles or shotguns. Or even talent trees.All this being said, the game is really good and would recommend playing this game, and any other Infectonator games, it's just a couple of things that I think could be improved.

												I used to love this game, I played it back when they released the Demo back on Kongregate, I remember commenting ""I'd buy this for $15"" And sure enough, it was around that price. I happily added it to my library, and built up my fort, I was a force to be reckoned with, and then...... After 24 hours of work...... When they updated the game..... It deleted it, all my work, gone, an entire DAY sunk into this game, that I was never getting back, I was furious, I ended up leaving this game to collect virtual dust for months, and then I returned thinking ""Maybe I can just restart, it was fun, after all!"" And what I saw was just plain horrible. It was so scarily bad, that you could've sworn that it was the Halloween Update. They brought back the ""Escape the city before it got nuked"" thing, and if I remember the Demo, some of the top comments were asking if that could be REMOVED, and for a while, it was. You may think ""Just play survival"" But as far as I know, in order to get passes, you need to do Campaign. That IS just a guess, BECAUSE THEY DON'T TELL YOU! Now, as a lot of games do, it starts you out with the cruddiest team, and forces you to get the previously stated passes, this would be bearable, except A: It doesn't tell you how to get passes and B: IT USED TO BE FREE. They stripped away content, just to shoe-horn in passes. That's just plain scummy. I don't even know if it gets worse, I could only endure a bit more of the new gameplay before feeling the need to write this. This is a minor complaint, but I think the goop thing should be an extra ""Pass"" feature, as it just feels annoying, not difficult, annoying. So, overall, I'd give the original an 8.5/10, and the New version 3/10.			"

												Honestly found this game to be extremely frustrating, unfair in a bad way and just not very fun.-The difficulty is a joke. It's the kind of difficulty which is based almost entirely on luck. I found that after trying 5 times i had one ""good"" run which lasted 5 days and then my team of 6 people were instantly wiped out because of an insane amount of zombies and no supplies.-The game has a lack of feedback to the player. I died more than once because i didn't realise that my characters were out of ammo. The game doesn't really do a good job of telling you how far away you can go from the safehouse because I couldn't tell if you needed to have enough stamina to make it back or not. -The art style is fantastic in some parts but not so great in others. It seems like it's trying to replicate a Gameboy game but in some places it brings back the negative limitations of such an art style, in places it's too pixellated such as in the intro. It's a shame that it's a bit of a let down since i've been interested in this game since it was released in early access, but i can't recommend it because it's a frustrating experience.			"

								At the first look, this game looks like any other better flash games. It might be true but it's pretty addictive and funny. Soon enough you'll noticed that you spend quite some time on it. With each update you see more and more stuf which brings more tweaks to the game, making it even more interesting. Game is quite simple. You fight zombies, look and scavenge for materials, upgrade your gear and your characters, explore town, fight bosses, find survivors, fix your car, get some fuel and travel to next town. Even if it sound quite boring at first you end up playing the game for few hours and only then you notice how much time you spent on this ""simple"" game. I myself ended up playing from the begining like about 30 times just because I didn't want to see my characters dead haha... After spending more time you notice that some areas become harder to deal with and you end up constantly healing your characters or trying to find a better strategy how to fight off zombies. Turrents, reminding you tower defence games, help you a bit but they need quite some supplies and they stay at that place, unless you dismantle then. Of course, no matter what you're doing zombies sometimes get to eat raw brains and you end up losing a character which might or might not be very important for you because of it's stats, gear and/or anything else :PI spent some time on this game and I'm pretty happy with it. After a while you notice that it might become more interesting with more stuf, but for that we need to wait for more updates. I really recomend playing this game even if only for a short time.			"

								Saw this at PAXAUS and bought after seeing its gameplay.Much as this game still on its Alpha stage. It has proven its potency of a survivor/zombie/small-class management game.Gameplay is simple and easy to understand. Mechanics of both base and 'before entering the building' phase is a still a little funky in a way. But difficulty in this has its own up and down depending on location you visits.Only thing I feel stumped on is:- Does the base function on any other things? Besides Crafting/Research and Farming?- Do we get more Survivors? *Only managed to find one throughout three gameplays.*- Do we get any base upgrades like barricading the openings that are being spread out throughout the building?- Is there no chance of pausing the game while selecting of projects in the crafts/farming section? Or any sort of auto bump to next project selection.- Would there be an option to repair/replenish Armours/Items that have Durability?- Because there is no pause in Crafts/Farming Section and the day ends. It literally bumps you to the next day.- Are we not allowed to control our characters when Base is under attack?- When Characters got K.O in base. Is there no way to revive them without spending 500 Ammos on that? *Could be a chance of using a Med Kit if avaliable or spare a certain amount of supplies.*- Does Scott and Shiro have any use to the game at all? I see Scott has a Communication Device on the desk. And Shiro could be used to be sent out as a scaveanger hunt like bringing back random supplies or items?The game is still fun despite of the stuff above. Difficulty is its key element, Survival on the other. What I hope to look for in its complete stage is that,- More Characters?- More Survivors to be recuited/saved/joining your base.- Chance of upgrading your base.- Maybe a storyline of such? *Might be asking too much. It is a survival game after all.*Cheers, and happy slaying. :D			"

Early Access Review
								I played the flash version, loved it. I was excited for this early release and have not been disappointed. This game is simple, addictive, and (surprisingly) thought provoking. Pros:-Weapon range-Character builds-Random events-Research system-Characters actually loose life when they don't eat-Weapon knockback feature-ReplayabilityCons:-Reloads and/or heals not completing on level transitions-Map navigation makes portion of the game slow and tedious-Level length (would love to see some 3 or 4 transition buildings to add to difficulty)-Supply/Weapons are never obtained where they should be (gun store/police station never have any guns). Would be cool to know exactly where to expect to find certain types of items. Would make map navigation more strategic.-Supplies are maybe a little too scarce (while I realize this meant to be a zombie survival game, 2 to 0 supplies per building make it almost impossible to keep the basic 4 character team build from starving each round after a while). If you want to have more than four players to focus on research, forget about it. I very rarely keep more than 6 players on my team for this reason.-Not being able to walk and reload at the same time. increases difficutly, but not very realistic.Best Feature:The ""random events"" system at the end of some levels is what completes the game for me. After a few hours, the game can become fairly stagnent. Difficulty increases, but if you get the hang of weapon combos (2 ar's, 1 shotgun, 1 melee) and creating choke points, you can breeze through most of the levels with little difficulty. And then, once the game starts to become mechanical and get boring, it throws an uncontrollable  wrench into your system: ""You hear moaning behind the door...A zombie horde is onto you, you manage to get away but now all survivors make it."" All of a sudden, you loose your best weapon, you loose your best player, and you have to completely reevaluate your approach.. Do I need to go find a merchant?. Do I need to go find a survivor?, etc.. BRILLIANT game mechanics to spice things up in a no-going-back zombie game.  I would love to see further development in this portion of the game.Worst Feature: My biggest complaint about the game mechanics would have to be with the map navigation. As the cities get bigger, only being able to move to adjacent buildings makes the game progression very slow and tedious. At certain points in the game, you just want to move across the map quickly, especially when you have alreayd cleared 98% of it. It would be nice to be able to move to any building that you have already occupied, no matter where it is on the map or how far you are from it. This would expediate th e most tedious portion on the game and let you get into the core gameplay quicker.All-in-all, a very good game. For the price, I would recommend it.			"

												I've played countless hours of Infectionator II, and this game seems to be a great follow-up, however in my experience it is not.Pros:+ similar 8 bit still graphics, making the game optically enjoyable+ killing zombies+ crafting items is funCons:- Not very polished. The map just shows ""quest"" or other markers on certain buildings, but not why (is there a person in distress? Fuel? Supplies?). You just have to go there to find out, which is annoying if you return to a game you played a couple of days ago. In general there are a lot of things that could be improved in terms usability.- ""Permadeath"" and staminaIn combat you may lose a character permanently if they die and you don't revive them. Maybe you played too risky or had bad planning - it's OK to lose someone. Except for the fact it can be easily solved by closing the game and reloading the last autosave. That's not permadeath at all.However, if you are not in combat, and you run out of stamina (or use the retreat button), someone might die in a text based event. This can not be avoided by closing the game. Oh wow, I didn't properly count that I need 8 stamina back to the house and now I've lost half my team. That was exciting. NOT.What makes it even worse: Some of the quest houses are so far away you cannot reach them even with maxed out stamina without running out of stamina and subsequently losing team members. Again, this is not connected to skill, good planning, or to the stats of your team members (at least i assume so), but simply the game killing off teammembers.- green acid gooIf you kill a zombie, sometimes a puddle of green acis goo will remain in its place for some time. If you touch it, you will lose health.This is probably even more annoying than the text based deaths. Sometimes the goo will make you chose another exit from a room because the first one is blocked, hence acting as an element of chaos and chance, but in 99% of all cases a green puddle of goo will just be in the way, blocking the only entrance or exit to a room and annoy you by being there. I really don't see how this makes the game more enjoyable or interesting.- Low replay value.1st game: Lost entire team, quit game.2nd game: Figured out how to fight and how to find items. City got nuked after 15 days.3rd game: Managed to escape city4th game: Started with other characters, managed to escape city. Quests were slightly different, but began to feel boring.5th game: Meh.Overall it's a nice game, but the annoying things are a real dealbreaker.			"

												I'm a great fan of the original Infectionator game and the theory behind this game was cool. Unfortunately, the exploration becomes quickly tiresome and boring and your party can be overwhelmed in a rage quit inducing instant. I *really* want to like this game, but I keep coming back to this conclusion. Sooo much potential, but sadly, I can't recommend unfortunately.			"

I don't know why, the steamworks overlay doesn't work here :/			"

												It is kinda with a heavy heart that I have to rate this bad. I played it when it first arrived on armor games and fell in love. (fun fact this was actually my first steam game) However over the last year it has gotten worse. Overall: I liked the game but it has since gone way downhill and I really hope they can update or fix it to be amazing again.Back in may I had 14 survivors 100+ food and made it to town 4. It was ablast and I was constantly pushing further.This changed however after a few updates that did not improve the game.First thing is (like everyone else) I do not like the acid. It does way too much damage and pops up way too often. Another is that one of the starting survior groups that you could choose (Mar and pewds) are no longer selectable.The quest system is also very confusing. Unless you are writing it down or have a really good memory you will forget what each spot is and will waste time.It has lost its original feel of stockpile and try to survive. It now has changed to: How lucky am I this run?			"

								If you liked the flash games (Infectonator: World domination, Infectonator: 2) then you will love this game too. Instead of playing a scientist hell-bent on ruling the world with zombies, you are killing them. Aswell as surviving. Meaning you need to keep watch on your food, fuel and the state of your survivors. The game may be in early access but it's already a great game. And for you L4D fans you can play as the characters from L4D 1. Great fun, Good mechanics, Can't wait for more to be added.                           What are you waiting for?			"

								For $13, I'd say that so far I've gotten my money's worth. The game is in Alpha, and is receiving updates at a decent pace as well. As I've played it, there have been a few things that I feel would make it better have they been added, but the game's still Alpha, so long as they keep working on it, I can only see it getting better.Pros:-Excellent music (one of the main things that brings me back to playing it at times)-Good variety of weapons along with tiered progression-Decent variety of survivors to find, and an okay amount to pick from to start off the game with-Plays very well on my laptop, minimal lag and such, so it's a solid experience that isn't interrupted by FPS dropsCons:-It can get repetitive after a while of playing-Entirely Single Player at the moment, no idea if they plan on some kind of Co-op or something-Obviously Alpha, so there may be a few bugs here and there (many of which in the past have been successfully patched)Well that's about all I can think of off the top of my head at the moment. It's a pretty fun game with excellent music and it's an enjoyable way to spend a bit of time. As of this moment, I'd say it deserves an 7-8/10, it's fun, but breaks should be taken every so often to not tire it out (like many other games of course), and it's still in Alpha so we don't necessarily know exactly where it's going from here. (Also I might update this every so often as the game progresses, maybe I won't, we'll see).			"

								Gonna keep it short and sweet.Pros-Easy to use HUD-Great Game mechanics-Even Better Gameplay-A Variety of Decisions to make-Various ""Back-door"" Schemes to get what you need!-Permadeath-Randomized ""dungeon-ish"" if you may-A save featureCons-Low Res.-EXTREMELY tough area's for some beginners-Rare Occurences-Various Glitches and Bugs concerning movement and ScavengingThis is what i've dreamed about in the infectionator series. I always thought to myself ""...What happens to the people I don't infect, but still beat the city/town/urban-area?"" Well, this is the answer. The fact that you control from 1 up to 4 survivors to try and protect them as if you were their ""Guardian Angel"" and lead them into the dangers of the infected populi is one of the best things Toge could've done. This completely flips the tables from the Virus Spreader, To the Virus Survivors. The wide variety of weapons and gear avaliable was intense, but the tricky part was finding them. I couldent help but laugh as i found a lightsaber in a cardboard box in a mall. The controls and movement can get tricky or glitchy (when trying to scavenge ""Sparkley"" objects it would close out of the decision boxes, and the character) but it is fun. The permadeath was a nice feature so the pressure was on. A little Glitch i couldent help but take into my own hands in the alpha version was before i died to exit out the browser, but they fixed that, by making the full version on steam. For anyone who played the infectionator series i recommend this to you.			"

												Not sure if too much changed since leaving early access, but bottom line is its a good game.It reminds me of the zombie survival flash games I played as a kid.I defnitely have enjoyed the game enough that I want to beat it and beat it again.Here is a list of pros and cons as well as a video of game play.Pros:+Good graphics, art, and music (a solid 16 bit theme)+solid mechanics and balance+good longevity and replayability(every time you play will be a little different and different starting options)+mechancis are straight forward(all stats are very apparent about what they do)Cons:-early game can be botched by chance(all my rations stolen twice and everyone starved)-funky tiredness system(no way to rest your characters during the day, they do this automatically, and you can only rest them by wasting a night which you need to be scavenging on)-unbalanced end game (game breaking strategies)-its too easy

												This is the Green Goo perfect example of Looters a developer taking Early Access feedback text-based deaths and completely disregarding it grinding to fix what they feel is a ""problem"" horiffically unbalanced and add things that no one asked for.Back when you just had the wave-based TD to go through the game was fun. Exploration? Good too. Crafting? Ehhhh kinda weird.Now you have:A needlessly tacked-on character ""tiredness"" system that only serves to waste the player's time.Stupidly unbalanced zombies including: Cop Zombies that take way too many hits to kill, Hazmat Zombies that take way too many hits to kill and explode, and the stupid freaking Dad zombies that leave puddles of Acidic Goo that last for 2 hours. Tangent: Why the ♥♥♥♥ was this added? All these zombies do is waste the players time and cause them to take cheap damage. The goo puddles are hardly noticable, and deal way too much damage. If they just made impassable walls for the player's units that would be fine, but NOOOOOOO. They gotta damage you for 10 health a second! Because why not?! This isn't even mentioning the fact that you can find Looters very early on in the game who will swarm you with number rivaling the zombies and outrange you as they sit in areas you can't walk into and take pot shots at your units.An incredibly random item drop system that makes crafting a complete joke. Want to build yourself a Gun? What about Armor? Well good luck ♥♥♥♥ing getting the materials to craft that♥♥♥♥♥♥ Because instead you're going to find 40 bottles of ♥♥♥♥ing brandy, when all you need is a single ♥♥♥♥ing bottle of water!There's needlessly cruel, and then there's how this game turned out. Everything is built to play against the player. This isn't the Ghost and Goblins or Castlevania type of ""against the player"" either. In those games you at least knew that it was possible to win. That, if you worked hard enough, you'd achive a result.In this game, unless you manage to find 2 medkits on your first mission, you're destined to fail! And of the 20 something runs I had that happened once!Do I regret buying this? No. Despite everything, Toge is one of my favorite indie/Flash developers. I had a lot of fun with this game before it's full release. But this is the perfect example of why they should stick to strategy instead of Roguelikes.But would I recommend it now? Unless you can tolerate there's no tolerating that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t mod out the looters and Dad zombies, and fix the random drop system: No. Go play one of the better zombie survival roguelikes on Newgrounds.

												My biggest complaint for this game is the acid left behind by some zombies. This acid damages you and stays a good while. It's an incredibly, incredibly stupid mechanic.  I understand the intent was probably something about having the player change tactics, but it's so incredibly annoying. Sometimes you get trapped in a room for a long time because these zombies keep coming at you, and unless you wanna run through zombie goo you gotta stay put.  I explored and area with no acid zombies (only fatties and normal) and the gameplay was good, nice. With acid zombies I keep gritting my teeth all the time.And the RNG could be a bit less RNG.			"

								The game a really good game for it to be in alpha. Really a review wouldn't be best because the game is not done yet. I do like the fact that there is no pity for you, you die... that's it buddy. start over try again. I will say that aloccating one person to search and the other three do do the heavy work will get you through a match... the game is shaping up good. just needs a good story, the merchant should come around more often, and if you can get the dog later on in the game as a pet to help you in the matches it would be awesome!!!!! great job tho! Also it would be nice that after you complete a zone, and you want to go back a second time there are more stuff to search/better rewards so you don't waste your resources trying to complete a lvl 100 precent and run out of supplys!

								Pretty good and ""cute looking"" survivor sim, for lack of a better word. It's got some depth to it, as you've got to scavenge supplies, ammo and food to stay alive. It's pretty harsh at first, atleast with a full group, as supplies can run dry faster than you'd like. But once you get the hang of it, it's pretty easy to survive for a longer period of time. It is a roguelike in the sense than you squad can die, and they will remain dead. You do have a small window of 10 seconds to revive them when they fall, though it may not always be the easiest thing to do since by then you'd probably be swarmed with zombies anyway.Repetative but ok retro music, sweet pixel art graphics, lousy crafting and item variation sadly, some replayability. Even thought it's got it's flaws, it manages to make me want to play some more.. But in short bursts.Also the storepage needs an update, as all the screenshots are of a completely different version of the game (maybe even the flash version?). And the storepage claims to have Achievements and Trading Cards, none of which it has... which is rather iffy to my. I take that kind of stuff serious, misleading customers. It doesn't sit well with me.PR is not this games strongest boons, especially when I read there are people copying the entire game and selling it on IOS appStore.. Copyright claim perhaps? Anyway.. For what it is, I give it an 7/10 for now. It's a totally okay Z-survival micromanager. If it gets better, I'll re-review it.			"

												Even though this game is out of Early Access it still needs a lot of work with rebalancing and adding things. The fact that you can make a decision in a text based scenario and immediately have a team member die is baffling. Along with the fact that some areas are impossible to reach without running out of stamina even if it's maxed out. The survival mode is also a joke. It's survival in it's most primitive sense of only being in one map. If that isn't your cup of tea then all you have is a timed campaign mode. For anyone wanting a more lasting campaign there isn't a chance of that happening.			"

								Really fun! The content is a little light (it just went early access after all) but the systems are all there and they're really strong. Fast-paced, tactical, addicting and rewarding. And hard as hell.A couple notes because I'm not sure where else to put them and I feel like constructive criticisms are an advantage of going public early:I think survivors should get XP from working on projects in the garage. Not as much as from a battle of course, but I think it makes more sense to have one person man the garage than have people constantly taking turns being the mechanic so they can rotate who gets XP.I know it's like a satire that the only girl in the game (not counting Zoey from L4D) is just called Blonde Girl and has no background of note, but until there are more girl survivors to choose from I think you should give her something compelling. Having survivors with backgrounds and proficiencies is always more interesting and I feel like you're alienating people by having the sole representation of females be a sexist joke.A little more time at the end of a round to finish scavenging would be good. It seems intentional to keep up the pace and difficulty, but it strays from real world logic a little too far for me. Maybe have a place you move to to complete the level instead having the survivors leave automatically?That said, really fun game! Can't wait for updates with more events and characters.			"

You are going in raw pretty much due to the fact that no area boost your chances of more supplies. The buildings with zombie heads is boss fights and the one with exclamation marks this--> ! means you will find a survivor. When you start each round make sure you got good placement in mind because your survivors do not heal easily. Little tips cause i had no clue at all when i started, Great game needs more fixing and polishing but other then some minor things it is great!

								This game, while having its flaws, is one of the more polished early access titles on steam. It is more or less a RTS game, that has a focus survival, rather than making money or ruling an empire. It has some things that set it apart from simmiliar games, such as skills that make characters more unique and thusly more important. It adds value to the characters and makes the player more distressed once one is killed for good. Party members feel like just that: Members. In games like CiV:V, you just have armies that you can uphgrade, and once you get in to the big leagues, they become easier and easier to produce, with not much differing between them. Here, party members are scarce at best, and it makes you feel lucky when you manage to save someone from the overrun city. One of its biggest strength's is its gameplay. Gameplay is simple: Its a mix between keeping a lane, or holding down an area, while also scavenging for supplies or ammo.  Its minor management but it can be entertaining, and in the later game very challenging. While I had little challenge with this game since I am a veteran of StarCraft, I would reccomend it to someone who is bad at RTS's, as this game is simple but offers a good learning curve.			"

								I honestly at first glance thought it was a Turn-Based game, It turned out to be a WHOLE lot better as I started actually reading what it is. A Tower Defense game where your towers (Survivors) can scavenge, get awesome weapons, and can actually die... Amazing huh?			"

												There's a lot to this game, and it's made to be hard and to try again and again. However, I don't really enjoy the puddles of green goo that appear when certain zombies die. They stay around too long, your characters will not path-find around them, they just suck to deal with, and are always around. Plus the survival part is weird, because bullets are everywhere but medkits are not.			"

								Hay! So, this game is awesome really! I would recommend you to try it! There's a BUT though...Being in its Alpha, there are still bugs and errors that might occur, bugs and errors of the kind that either freeze the game or force you to hijack it exploiting the "" idle"" screen in order to reload the scene.They can hinder your experience as you progress through the campaign and that's bad because the game seems already so much far with its development that you really have the impression it's finished, if it wasn't for these errors.So yeah, it's so good that you can't tell it's an early access, but as soon as your heart starts growing attached to your save file, an error kicks in and blargh!!You've been warned: play it, but don't freak out if the save file gets screwed up!

												I've had this game for a long time, and now that it has been fully released it's time to write a reviewI remember when I first played this game. I didn't have Steam, so I was playing it on Armor Games.com. I found it so fun that I showed it to all my friends, and most of them didn't have my feelings for it :(I bought the game on Steam because I enjoyed the other infectonator games, but this one stood out the most. This game is probably the best zombie survival games I've played. I love the pixel graphics, soundtrack, and quotes by the characters. I might only has a couple hours on Steam, but I have had LOTS more on browser websites. I really enjoy the updates and how they haven't ruined the gameThat's all. If You are reading this, buy the game, You won't regret it			"

												I reviewed this game during early access and while I found it to be fun to play, I decided I wouldn't want to recommend the game in its current state.  Now having found it outside of the bars of early access I decided to re-review it to give an updated view of what I think of the game.  I'll probably reference older features they improved upon or removed altogether and how that change adds or possibly detracts from the game.  My only real complaint with my original review was the unfinishedness of it, which now ought to no longer be a flaw with the game.  So I'll be playing the game and then come back to update this review again later.Update:So the game's finished, it's polished up, it's found what it wants to be, and the flow of the game finally works.  I can't really say too much about the game outside of that.  The core is there and it's just improved.  Other than a play by play of what's changed then there's nothing much to offer.  Glad I was able to help so many people with my early access review but it seems I've also lost the will to play through this game with the same fervor I had for the first 90 hours.  I won't try to force it, but know that it's a good game and definitely worth it now.			"

												This is perhaps one of the most refined indie games on steam. Just based on that only, this is definitely worth your penny. These indie developers spend years developing and refining the game so giving up your lunch money for this game really nothing huge compared to what you're getting.Graphics: 7.5/10PIXELS!! Pixels are back! Pixel art are never out of season. There are various kinds of pixel art, but the pixel rate on these graphics are quite high and although you can still get the pixel feeling these are definitely top of the art pixels. Although you'll see some of these gets repeated throughout the game but believe me - the graphics on this game I can only say 'its an art'.Audio: 7.5/10The sound of the multiple gunshots is somewhat addictive, gets you pumping, and the beautiful sound when the zeds drops dead. When the sound stops and your ammo runs out you know you're in trouble. The sound effects are well... effective i guess.The developers really know how to match the audio and the atmosphere of the game really well. The BG retro music suits well with the graphics of the game. I don't know how else you can improve the audio on this game. Just watch the trailer you know what i meant. Gameplay: 8/10You can definitely spends hours playing this game. It'll definitely give you a run for your money. It's very addictive and may seems very hard at first. I'm quite a hard core gamer so I can easily adjust to the game quite fast. For casual gamers the game dificulty can be quite hard. The game does requires tactic, but cmon peeps the game is set in a zombie apocalypse world, of course if you run around like an idiot without any tactic in both exploration and scout mode you'll get yourself killed. Positioning, check perimeters, hit and run, divide and conquer, use your sun tzu art of war knowledge on surviving. some battles are won or lost before it's ever fought. If you don't work on your supplies for healing and getting by the days of course you'll get doomed. Even researching at your HQ and thinking ahead which work needs done and assigning which members to work are part of the preparation. I really enjoy the gameplay. It's part RPG so there is role playing involved, and putting yourself in the game is really easy to get your head around what choices to make. There are random events and quests in the game which keeps you well motivated and adds variety throught the game. The permadeath on characters really adds the reality in the game. You don't get second chances with life. Sometimes you just have to move forward. It's challenging, but it depends on the players makes of this feature of the game. Luckily there're no 'personality' for the characters so the RPG stops right there and you don't really get attached to them except for the exp and levels you had racked up.Mechanics 8/10It's hard to explain all the game mechanics, because it is rather a rather in depth game system. But in simple term the game is really about surviving a zombie apocalypse. If I really have to give a simple explanation, perhaps this might be the easiest way to explain the game mechanics through genre:Missions/World MapScout - Tower Defense / Action RPGExploration -  Dungeon Exploration / Action RPGHQ BaseResearch, Craft & Upgrades - Simulation Character Stats, Levelups, Equipments - RPGIt is a well mixed genre for the game, which makes the game mechanic sort of a mini game within a game, but having them built as such, makes the game well versed and so interesting. The fact that the developer chose to develop the game built around a variety of mechanics for the different tasks in order to reach the goal of the game is highly commendable.Story: 4/10The bit that is definitely lacking in the game is story. The game has a high potential in having a good story telling put into it. The random events are all nice and all, but a stong storyline is missing in the game. The game could really use it as a sort of milestone checkpoint to motivate the players as you proceed into the game. Some people might find repetitive quests and exploration to be a bit grinding at the late stage of the game. A story with a main protagonist and background story could really be impactful. Overall: 7/10I'm giving this game a solid 7. Understand when you buy this game, this is an indie game, don't expect full featured game from big game developers with unlimited budget. I'm giving the reviews above with consideration that this is an indie game. Nevertheless, this is definitely one hell of a game. It's addictive, fun, and very indepth. I'm definitely recommending this one.			"

												I have played this game for quite awhile (despite the hours it displays). So why do I not reccomend this? Here's why:While the game used to be great in MANY ways (while it was in early access), I'm afraid the final product is actually worse than the original. The game got WAAAAAY to difficult since the previous version (I can only survive 3 days now!). The soundtrack and graphics are great. However, some ideas the devs implemented make surviving this game unforgiving. There is a free version somewhere that is close to my favorite version (missing some features). But overall, they REALLY need to tweak the balance of the game.			"

  In a sentence:  A game with an excellent idea and beautiful art suffering from a cluster♥♥♥♥ of bugs and a poorly designed user interface. Wait until full release.It's a really good game. Or rather it could be that if the bugs and user interface issues were not present. You will probably like this game if the idea of a top-down, zombie survival tactical strategy is appealing to you. The game is basically you will be trying to escape the city, while recruiting more survivors scattered around the city which you will explore to find much needed bullets and crafting resoruces, while holding back a relentless horde coming in from every direction.Keep in mind that this is an early access game  with everything this usually entails . There are a ton of issues not only with content that has already been implemented (an occasional crash, game-breaking bugs with HQ management, lack of perks or portraits for certain characters and many other things), but also problems with game systems that are in place (really bad combat controls, lack of combat pause, poorly presented information on the UI, poor combat UI). IF and only IF the developer will resolve at least majority of these issues you should consider buying the game. At this moment in time, it's something to keep an eye out, but nothing more. P.S. - I personally enjoyed it because I'm a sucker for Zombie Survival stuff, but it doesn't mean that you will too.			"

Early Access Review
								I've been a big fan of the Infectonator games since I first played them on Kongregate way back when.  Toge Productions showed a lot of promise and potential with their games and ideas.  I like what I see so far from Survivors, but it's obvious that the game still has its flaws and feels incomplete in a number of places.  In no particular order, I'm just going to pinpoint some notes I had while playing the game.1.  Experience - It appears that my ""travel team"" never really gets experience.  As I bounce from location to location in the map, my efforts are not reflected against my team's experience.   Only when I get back to base does XP appear to be tallied, and even then it appears that I only get credit for the last fight I was in.  On the other hand, if I stay at the base and use my guys to plant or build something, then they get experience for doing those activities.  In the end, spending 10 minutes fast-forwarding time while planting veggies and other things granted my team more XP than the hours upon hours I spent going through and collecting tons of items across a long expedition.2.  It's a little difficult to determine what you're supposed to do when a location has a symbol over it.  Do I go into Scout mode or Explore mode to resolve the issue at the location?3.  In the begining while trying to build the car, you can use one of your quest items to build something else, thus losing that item forever  (the electronic module seems to also go into making advanced turrets).  Be careful with this, it sucked when I had to restart my game.I'll add more to this as it comes to mind, in the hopes that it will help the devs with feedback.  I think this game is definitely one to keep track of and watch for any fan of Greenlight games.			"

												After purchasing this game apprehensively due to the recent reviews, I am glad to say that I am enjoying my time with this game. I just finished my first campaign and I didn't have to face-desk once. There is a rather steep learning curve initially but once you know what to look for, how to survive and how to play the game, it's addicting zombie killing fun. Take the ""Mixed"" recent reviews with a grain of salt. They're probably people that forgot how games used to be challenging. This game, is NOT IMPOSSIBLE as the reviews make it seem.The art style is very cute and makes light of a typically dark genre. Audio is what you would expect of a pixel style game, it's not mind blowing but it works. Reminiscent of old SNES games.A couple of caveats however. I rather dislike the ""text based deaths"" in this game. Occasionally there are ""pick your adventure"" style text scenarios where if you select a certain action, it ends up killing one or several of your characters. So characters WILL die. It's not like Fire Emblem, where if someone dies you can just quit and load back in. I strongly advise you to not get too attached to your team. Other than Sydney and Mike, i've lost all of my original crew.<<EDIT>> I've discovered from another member from the community that you CAN exit the game and reload just before the encounter you are in. So... YAY!Also, in the community hub, there is a pinned post where the dev talks about future potential features in what seems to be a kickstarter campaign thread. To include a mod-tool and character customization. However, after the official release of the game there has been no major updates to the game. So it's very likely that what you get is what you get and we may possibly not get any future support from the dev(s).			"

Posted: August 9, 2016
												Edited 8/13/16 There was an update that really helped to fix the game. It's plenty better now. However, I still don't think I can recommend this game and here's why. Once you get further into the game, you have to move farther and farther out from your safe zone, you are also limited by the number of spaces you can move per night. That's controlled by the number of your stamina points and you can upgrade that, however as you progess further with your goals you will consistently be ambushed by zombies when you move to a space which in turn forces you to use one of your precious stamina points. Once your stamina points hits zero every additional move after that damages your characters. And it's quite a bit of damage. And that will continue until you return to your HQ. I've noticed, that the game is almost broken at this point because you can't possibly get out far enough and make it back without losing characters just to these stupid 0 stamina points and ambushes EVEN IF you do really well and your characters take little to no damage while exploring, this ridiculous game mechanic can completely ruin your game and experience.Original Review 8/9/16At first this game reminded me of the South Park tower defense game, but after playing it for awhile it just became another game of micro-managing your characters' base, health and supplies. Most of which are incredibly difficult to come by. I was never able to find the parts I needed to fix the vehicle, I was never able to keep my team alive and I was never able to recruit new survivors. The best strategy I could find was to honestly never stop clicking the mouse and moving. THAT GOT BORING AND TIRING! I think for a person to buy this game and who is completely new to it, the game is WAY to difficult. It's not forgiving what so ever in the early stages of the game. The moment you lose a person, you minds well quit. My first time playing, I lost a player in the ♥♥♥♥ING TUTORIAL!!! Yes, you read me. While I was trying to learn the game, I lost 1 of 4 people and that completely crippled my ability to do much after that, except start over. I'm giving this game a negative review, until several things are reworked.			"

Early Access Review
								There's some things everyone should know going first update.1. Your save games aren't safe. They are randomly lost due to a bug with the game. I got to day 14 my first sucesful playthrough.2. It's easy to exploit this game by staying in one spot(Wherever a merchant is) and using the first two days to build the two farm upgrades. By doing this and endlessly farming gold and exp, then buying supplies,you create an endless loop of:Killbuy foodkillbuy gunsbuy foodkillbuy foodIf you don't exploit the game, it's really hard to survive...almost impossible with an odd diffuculty curve which randomly ranps up nearby locations to frantic and dangerous in the first 20 days. So with this, the bottom line is the game is either too hard or endless repetition of the same easy area. obviously there would be some grind,but it's far too excessive to make moving around fun,tl;dr: What you do on the first playthrough(before turning your computer/program off) is your limit and the game is either too hard or exploitable,Would this mean the game is bad or unplayable(in its current state)? No it's fun and an interesting yet challenging take on the zombie genre by actually creating a survival aspect without relying purely on tower defense. Though I'd be cautious about buying this as of now(April 21st).			"

												This is a great concept and a fun game, but the frustrations it gives are just too much for me to recommend buying it.  Either you play on the scout/TD mode and it gets a bit tedious and repetitive, or you do some exploring and watch your team die because you get 15 seconds to revive them but your team can't kill 3 zombies in enough time to even get a revive off.  Needs updates and some work, this game would have been a 10/10 if they'd gone turn based with it.			"

								Early Access review 04/14/2014.If you like the web-based game ""The Last Stand - Dead Zone"" by Armorgames, then you'll probably like this game due to the similiarities in terms of gameplay.I've only played for a short time, so I don't have much to say at the moment. But it's a good tower defense/survival simulation/RTS where you need to scavenge for supplies, fuel, rescue other survivors, etc.The only downside that I noticed is this game uses coins and ""gems"" as the currency, though I don't know for sure,  and I could definitely be wrong, this game might have microtransactions. If that's the case, then it's a huge turn-off for me personally. Other than that, all good.UPDATE:Turns out that gems are the end-game currency when you get a game over(win or lose) you will get gems.This game's is quite hard, got wiped out on my first and second playthrough. You need to carefully plan ahead at every stage. Going to try again tonight.			"

Early Access Review
								For an early access game it is very playable. However resources are a little more limited than they need to be. It seems less like a challenge and more just kind of unfair. I can go to 3 different locations and search everything and sometimes never find supplies.Also, building a farm currently does nothing unfortunately so it is a waste of research atm. It also doesnt feel especially random. The game starts the same way every time and you always have the same hq on the same spot in the map with the buildings varying slightly.That being said it is still a very fun game especially for alpha and the tactical combat is pretty enjoyable. I think this game could certainly benefit from letting you create your own characters and making the experience a little more varied each playthrough but so far it is coming along.Cant whole heartedly recommend yet but some small tweaks could go a long way here6/10			"

												This is a flash game with all the limitations of a flash game, developers did not take into account the expectations a PC game should answer. The flash version is a good time waster, because players do not expect a polished or finished game. After the terrible console ports period, we entered the terrible flash game ports period.your team stays on the last project they were assigned to, even if it is finished, ""auto assign"" doesn't send them to a new projectmelee fighters are the slowest, always at the back of the team, they are uselessexploding enemies do not damage your teamteam has no formation during movement, and they change position when they stop, you can't decide who is in front, no tactivs hereteam member suffer from fatigue, they move more slowly, which doubles the time needed to explore, making exploration more of a chore, but can't send them to sleepmission info does not update : ""this place is filled with weapons"" written just under ""status : depleted""missions shown by an icon on the map, but no way to know which mission is which - where should I go for the merchant? where should I bring back the orange box?caustic pools were added, but no pathfinding for your team, they can't avoid walking on these pools, even worse : they stand exactly in the middle of the pool and take damagelots of micromanagement - pathfinding, limited time to do research and no sleep button, useless intermediate screens to confirm dialogues without optionsmerchants dialogue is worthless : ""Ok, I'll do the job"", what for? either you do it or you fail the game""dialogues"" are perfectly uninteresting and unecessaryrandom events are shown on one screen too many, as if they needed the player to lose time on useless mouse clickingyou may choose the leader of the team (the person you need to search for ex.), but it is forgottent between maps and you have to select it again (micromanagement again)if you want to keep your weapons charged between assaults you'll lose hundreds of bullets, handguns cost 20 to recharge event if they have 8 bullets, and you have only shot 2, DO NOT recharge your weaponsyou have a set amount of stamina to visit the town - good idea, but movement + encounter + scout + explore = 4 stamina per building, which means 3 buildings at the beginning, and 4 at max stamina, OR you decide to avoid scouting, if your group is strong enough, however you risk losing the survivors you want to save during the encounteractually you have enough stamina to go to the edge of the town, but not to go backintro video is a heavily pixelated diaporama you can't skipvideos on the store page DO NOT correspond to the actual game "

												Bought this game as a full release, but feels like early access.Plenty of bugs and problems keeping it from being a great game.To name a few problems:- Everything requires multiple redundant confirmations. (Open backpack? Loot item?)- Collect everything in the area? You're still forced to run around an empty map exploring it for no reason.- Many things are unclear and/or seem to do nothing.- It seems very difficult to last more than a few days, due to the random nature of supplies you find. You could find useless ones which makes your squad starve to death early. And if they are starving, you can't make good quick enough to save them, etc.For a game about building a squad, they can get wiped out very easily forcing you to start a brand new save file. Roguelikes are supposed to be quick games where you can get a bit further every time. Not a game where you can develop a full party, craft things, get further to a goal, and then have your entire save file essentially deleted when the randomness of the game fails to give you items you need to survive.I love a challenge, but this game just feels unfair, unintuitive, and as a result, unfun.

								Wait until the developers get their stuff together before buying this game.  The idea is addictive and I love this as a great time-killer.  The problem is the developer puts updates 3 weeks apart and they often don't make sense.  Ideas are half-implimented, such as one updated created a glitch where there was no obstacles/cover.  Would you like an update where, in L4D, you suddenly were in a big empty field too big to cross without a horde coming?  And it is out of order.  They impliment a search feature which isn't complete yet, a perks feature hinted at, and armor which doesn't completely make sense.  The problem with all of this is the game features perma-death, so deaths by glitches and bugs and empty maps are permanent.  Weapon and character lost.  You don't create a game, update to feature a half-completed shotgun, and say ""hey, try out this weapon!  It's really cool, but doesn't actually reload, but we're working on that!""  No, they didn't say it like that, but it's how the updates sound.  Also, there's a pirated version around, so they may not actually get the will to try to earn a paycheck from the legit Steam one.  A real shame as this game would be awesome in better hands.			"

								Alright after 6 game over i think its safe to say ive seen the game.I like the idea and i can't wait for more content. I am a huge fan of Survivor Squad and this play like it. Survivor squad is a bit surperior though. Purely for the fact that you get alot more survivors, You can build bases and defend them.My major complaints are this. I have never been higher than 4 survivors. The game just refuses to give me more. That's why I always play the convict and swat. They to my opinnion are the best.The hazmats should have little to no hp. They are exploding zombies. The fact that they take a full turret and like 2 clips is way too much. They also make melee weapons useless on them. They explode on death which has resulted in me quiting and reloading many times. In my hoenst opinnion, they can keep the explosion. Thats what makes them dangerous but cut thier hp by atleast half.My only other complain is the lack of supplies. If you play with 4 survivors. I can never find food to keep them all and it results in very quick deaths. Before anyone say ""its the zombie apoc"" I say ""It's a game, Games don't play by logic""For the +, It does require you to move your survivors and kite. I like that idea, A pause and order would be a nice feature but it not entirely required but would be a very huge + if they added that.all in all, Its an alpha. It's still fun even if it has crushing difficulty.How crushing? A little under Dark Soul.			"

								Awful. This game shows so much potential, and generally these guys make great stuff, but this game is just awful. The bugs here make the game totally unplayable, so save your money and wait until it's finished. First there are the general glitches that are understandable for a game still in development: randomly dying for no reason, getting stuck inside walls, clunky mechanics, etc. Worse though are the major ones: your progress gets recorded totally haphazardly, so you can spend 5 hours playing only to come back later and have to start all over. Very disappointed. Mostly because there is so much potential to bean excellent game, it's just hidden behind so much rage inciting problems. The finished version will probably be excellent, but for now, save your money and play it on armorgames. "

								Fun game at first, but when you finish it, that's it. You got only 30 ingame days to do everything. All sidequests, and quests, finding better gear, weapons and loot and other survivors. Crafting takes too long in one single day or to farm etc.When I finished my car and decided to drive off, the game just said ""Game over"" with survivors died. I thought that my game got 'carried' over to a new generated town with more difficult enemies and new quests.Survival mode is boring and too tedious. You just walk around until your people die. That's it.4/10. I wish I still could refund this game.			"

												This game gets boring fast. No randomized survivors. They always have the same perks. Melee weapons all have identical stats, almost no need to switch to a new one. Guns are okay but there isn't much variety.The gameplay itself isn't all that good either. There is scouting, which is sort of a wave based RTS. But not really. You place your melee guy in front, your 3 gunners behind and then click next wave untill it's done.Then there is exploration mode. You select all your guys, right click all over the place untill you discoevered 75% of the map and leave. That's all you do over and over and over again.Between this 2 things there is your base phase. You basically make food to heal and repair your car to win the game. Nothing more but a ""click here and wait if you have the ressources"" phase.Good things about the game is the art style. The sounds and the music. But the gameplay itself is lacking everything.			"

								This game SEEMS simple enough.......until your face is getting chewed off by zombies.  I enjoy the gameplay but there needs to be a LOT more explanation as to WHAT EXACTLY you're supposed to do first.  Yes, the tutorial says useful things like ""assign survivors to do this or that"" but without having ANY clue as to what is what it's a lot of trial and error when you first start.  The gameplay is fun especially the scout missions but the exploration missions are.......imbalanced?  I really feel like this could be fleshed out JUST a bit more with explanations but I also SEVERELY believe that a difficulty setting should be an option.  Not everyone is the micro managing god.  Perhaps also adding a ""tactical pause"" feature?  Definitely a good game though but also still needs work.EDIT:  After playing a few more times I have come to the realization that this game should have been broken down into two different games.....I believe the developers ""over-extended"" themselves and have tried to make more content.  The problem is that it's almost two different games as the scouting missions are one type of play and the exploration missions are another.  They just don't mesh as well as could be hoped.			"

												This has all the elements that I love in an indy game, but unfortunately it is thwarted by poor AI coupled with bad play control.--Poor AI in that my characters do dumb things all the time trying to avoid one another due to collision that I can't avoid even when I micro the crap out of them.  See other comments about the sometimes unavoidable acid pools that are nearly instadeath early game.--It requires way too much micro to get your characters to line up in a way that allows your melee characters to be on the front line, as well as getting your squishy characters away from the front, particulary because of the collision element (see above).--The game is just no fun imo with the constant micro particularly when it frequently does no good.I really like the concept, and truly would love to see an improved version one day.  I picked this up for cheap on sale, so I can't complain much, but still getting only 2.5 hours of game time before rage quitting for the third (and final) time is a little shallow.			"

												Fun game with tower defense and RPG elements. Can be brutal sometimes until you get your legs under you. I'd say it's not for people that want a simple drop towers and wait kinda game, cause you will actively need to move your units around and gather supplies. You'll lose a few times, just be okay with that and you'll have fun.			"

								Just like the first two Infectonators, this game just blows me away. There's just something about the game that makes you want to keep playing it. And that's what's been going on with me. I just can't stop playing it. It was a bit challenging at first, but I learned how everything works and now enjoy playing it a lot.Some ideas:The materials that you collect in-game could be used for modifying weapons. Different attachments/customizations increase and/or decrease weapon stats. If possible, there should weapons and/or gears that can only be obtained by building them with materials. Each of those custom weapons should have something special about them. Like, for example, high damage, high fire rate, large magazine, etc. Or they could have a perk or effect, useful for dealing with zombies. Like ""Slows down zombies,"" or ""Chance to score critical hits on zombies,"" or ""Slowly heals the Survivor holding this.""Also, on the missions menu/map, I'd be helpful if it just tells you where all the merchants, survivors, and bosses are located without having to be near them.In-game, when a survivor(s) gets killed, you can search their body, just like sparkly objects, to obtain whatever weapon they were holding.I deeply thank Toge for making this game, and i hope they will improve Survivors and keep making more games.

								Like this game. Even at this point of time, for an incomplete game, it's shaping up to be something special. Or at least, that's how I see it. I can understand why some wouldn't like this game but I guess it's an aquired taste of sorts. Still, I'd recommended it at least.It's far from perfect though. There is the occassional bug. One I just found is when I started playing the game with team Left4Dead. Things were running ok till I fixed the car and traveled to the 2nd area of the city. While exploring area's, I found the ""police officier"" survivor along the way but when I checked another area with a ""?"" mark...well. My guess is that I was mean't to find a survivor during the ""encounter/scout"" phase but when the map panned to the right for the next area, I briefly saw Fransis running around like a found survivor then suddenly disappar off-screen. Not only was I handicapped to a team of three for that weird reason, it glitched the game when I made it back to HQ since the ""auto-save"" feature locked up mid-save on the status bar, forcing me to close the game.Bad luck on my part perhaps but I guess the game gave me a survivor I already had and was in my active party for whatever reason. Probably not the best place to report glitches like these but I don't have access to proper forums for this.Despite this though, it is a good game. It just needs some more work but I'd give it time. To me, it'd be worth the wait for the full game.			"

								So while I originally enjoyed this game a lot, I'm not very pleased at what it has become.  The game feels tedious and I have trouble really getting into it.  It seems like a tower defense game, but it barely gives you any time to set up your characters nor does it give you many options for changing the landscape.  It has elements of a survival game, but there's way too many ""gamey"" quirks for there to be any type of survival game immersion.  And most of the gameplay is, well, boring.Pros+ Lots of areas to explore, lots of items to farm and craft+ Gun sounds are well done+ Randomized maps and items make for a lot of replayabilityCons- Not enough tower defense elements (you can set up turrets and that's about it)- Boring gameplay, nothing to keep you interested- No real sense of accomplishment for surviving- Environments are boring- Maps are very small- Game price is too highThe game tries to be too many things, and the elements don't mesh well together.  Might be worth buying on sale but I don't feel like it's that much fun.  If you're looking for a good zombie survival game, you can do better with 7 Days to Die or State of Decay.			"

												Well, this is one of my favourite games, since you can get really rekt. Like i got. I still like it, it's alot of fun, but there's some stuff which are good, and bad. Let's start with the bad ones.Bad: At the start, you have only pistols, unless you buy with the ticket things other groups,so, 5% percent bad, that's the only thing what is bad.Good:This whole game is amazing. Sending people to expeditions, searching for supplies, crafting, cooking, repairing the car, even getting rekt, farming, surviving,dying like a skrub (like me),Being badass Bandit/Zombie/Walker killer.This game is like one of the best games, what i ever played. I like Unturned too. But...I guess. Infectonator : Survivors is much better. You shall get it.-Very good Smile Doge skrub.			"

								I love games from the bottom of my heart. For about a year and a half I loved Infectonator Survivors mainly because of its play-ability on my low-tier laptop. In 3 weeks, I will probably forget all about Infectonator and Toge Productions, as I will have a much better computer, and it will allow me to play better games. Infectonator Survivors is by no means outdated or outclassed by other prettier games, but it loses in responsiveness as an early access game that claims to be headed towards completion. When I say that I had a great time playing The Organ Trail, that is my genuine review of hours of satisfying gameplay of a retro game that has had someone's care and attention given into it's development. Respectively, for Infectonator Survivors, what I have taken away from many hours of gameplay is also drawn from various other aspects and small details that I've observed. The conclusion I've come to is that the developers do not care to fix the bugs, bad english, small details or mechanics. Honesty is a big part of success, but naturally people are afraid to face others objectively and they lie, just like how the developer who relays updates to players can't honestly say that updates actually take 3-4 weeks on average and continue to insist that they'll be back in 2 weeks with another update. Personally, this trend has made me have doubts in the back of my mind about how serious the developers are about  fulfilling the promises that they have set forth and even leaving their own mark on the game industry. I feel that the sheer heart that other developers have toward their games will outpace Toge; when you then add graphics and inspiration to a passionate developer, the disparity will become even more noticeable, until everyone notices that the developers behind Infectonator Survivors is not as responsive as other teams.As of August 6th, 2016 my opinions has gotten better with recent changes. However, on August 4th, a new announcement was made in the in-game ""new game"" screen. Despite there being no new content, the past 10+ hours of progress are simply gone. I don't know what to think, but I know that I won't invest anymore time until the game is complete.			"

								While base building zombie end of the world games I enjoy. This one... is TERRIBLE. The interface is slow to unresponsive at times. The pathing is terrible. Sometimes I have to click three or four times to have a survivor do one task. I love how when you tell one of your survivers to heal nothing happens and then they die. I love how if your survivor is at the top of the screen you dont get the countdown to death so then when you do revive them they are dead (which cost me a mission) The music is repetitive and can drive a person crazy.I played the other Infectionator series of games and this one is the ASC Unity or Batman arkham night of the family. DO NOT BUY. I know this is an early access game and this review is based on the early access part of it. I hope the development teams take these issues into heart for the full release. BUT in its current state . 0-10 cookies. Sorry boys, I hope the next patch/final release is much better.			"

								I love the concept that this game is going for, and I was excited to see regular monthly updates to this game, so I bought it, tried it out, and am pretty disappointed.  Yay for steam refunds!I'm all for forgiving glitches, bugs and crashes for early access games, but I think that this game is pretty unplayable right now, and for only one simple reason:  The user interface is super unresponsive.  It's like the game was optimized for touch screens or something and doesn't register half of the mouse clicks.  I'd click character 1, click their movement destination, they walk to the spot.  Click character 2, not realize that it didn't do anything, click movement destination, character 1 now walks to where character 2 should go.  Click back on character 1's destination.  Repeat until zombie wave comes and since it's a tower defense game and none of my people are in position, watch them die.  I would try to get the wounded guys into the back, but that usually just resulted in the guys in the back walking in circles as I frantically try to select the guy getting his face chewed off.I could probably try to get into the habit of quadruple clicking on someone to select them, but it was getting much more frustrating than fun.

								Through the patches I have survived it has become a great game with udderly Horrible people and not in the rude way the discussions you can see alot of people complaining and alot of smart people giving ideas for devs but all in all if your not terrible its a fun game and I personally like to listen to some creepypasta's on youtube in background but turn off game sound (which is just a bunch of gunfire anyway ... and sexual zombie moaning) or if i run out or creepypasta to listen to ill just look up scary stories and then listen with autoplay ... well the list is endless of what you could listen to like podcasts, or just even music, or, well stories in general			"

Early Access Review
								Snoozonator: Where's my coffee? As it states, Alpha. Great deal of good concepts when it first came out, and have been progressing to this day. Sadly, at too slow of a pace. The developers are hinging on the fact that you the community are the game testers and providing feedback. There has been only three notable additions since April of last year, that's perks, a new level, and modding. Sigh. Mechanics are simple to those of survival type games, scavenge for resources or die trying. There is no end-game, yet. You'll need supplies for ammunition and food, fuel to progress to a new zone. As for what you can do at base, nothing really. You are able to place manpower into upgrading/inventing while sending out the remaining survivors to scavenge. There isn't much to upgrade right now and the base expansion system isn't in place other than a shell concept. As you progress, survivors will obtain exp and can level various stats. Perks are half implemented and only available on select characters.Gameplay is really straight forward and easy to pick up. When going to scavenge for supplies, the game plays a bit like a tower defense style game where you encounter waves of zombies. Replace towers with survivors. The new addition is that after defending against waves is hunting down zombies. There is a set number you will have to hunt down and honestly this is the ♥♥♥♥♥iest idea ever, the game goes from fun action pace to a drab tedious man hunt. You scavenge the hell out of the map only to spend like two minutes hunting down the last zombie, like really? I should have just scavenged and left already man.I'm glad they enabled modding because Infectonator is at a point of defecation and decay. Hard to stay interested and hopefully the community will carry. When I read the curators and ""reviews"" I just wonder how high you have to be to recommend this. In it's current state, it is worse off than most Armor Games. It's fun for like a couple hours before you see an empty husk Infectonator really is.			"

Early Access Review
								It’s a fun game, but I wish I hadn't purchased it. I’m serious, 12 bucks for a flash game? That’s a little unreal. But I did anyways and I’ve enjoyed it ever since. So what do you get for 12 bucks? A doge meme reference. Yep. No cool new characters (despite saying, “Get them on Steam!” they’re still locked up.) No new weapons as far as I can see. No new maps. Just a new doge at your base camp. That does nothing. It’s just as ridiculously difficult as the online version and I’m hoping that Toge builds some actual steam content into the game to offset the cost. Otherwise, you’re just paying for a free game. The game will scale in difficulty based on how many days you spend and how much stuff you research. The game doesn’t understand the difference between advanced weaponry and farming, so you’re better off getting the weapons upgraded first. Don’t bother trying to do it on your own; you’ll quickly learn you’ll need as many characters as possible to go on raids and do research. Also, since research doesn’t yield experience, get used to kicking out characters as you cycle through better ones. The bottom line is, prepare for disappointment. And an overwhelming, crippling addiction. Seconds after you rage quit, you’ll be starting a new game. I promise. "

								Infectonator : Survivors, a  Randomized Tower Defense Strategy game that is sure to keep you on screen for some hours. I enjoyed kill the zombies and leveling up my survivors so they could past the hordes of the undead. I also like the tower defense system where you must defend your post for a certain of time. But, sadly to me the tower defense part could use a little work, maybe like increasing the amount of opitions you can use to defend yourself. The game is still is in its early access stage so i hope to see some new features and game improving. Other then that i'm enjoying my time trying to keep what's left of humanity. ^__^			"

Early Access Review
								What to say about this game.Despite its' simplicity there's an undercurrent of planning and forethought that is all but required. Squandering supplies or fuel is death, and if one of your Survivors is killed, their weapon, equipment, levels and skills are lost with them. Every Survivor is an investment.Yet things can go wrong so quickly, and without warning, that it feels unfair at times. Survivors can't reload and move at the same time, so prolonged waves of zombies all but require that someone take the fall. They can seldom be outran or outmaneuvered in the landscapes.In addition, while the lack of anything other than autosaves makes the game seem unfair, punishing small mistakes with the abject loss of considerable time and effort by killing off your last, desperate survivors as their guns click dry and they find themselves faced with a horde, it doesn't offer enough opportunities to refill those numbers, and when your survivors are dead, there's no ""game over"" screen, it just returns you to your most recent base camp, and sits there. You have to exit the game yourself. As if being defeated isn't bad enough, you must exit the game manually, erase the save file that now contains nothing, and start over.The game has potential, and I've enjoyed the previous Infectionator titles, but I feel this game has a sense of artificial difficulty that keeps nagging at me. If you give your survivors the best weapons, then they quickly run out of ammunition. Apparantely it costs more ammunition to reload a 30 round rifle than it does a 30 round submachinegun. If you give them more modest, economic weapons then they are swamped, crying out their lack of ammunition.The roguelikes elements are extremely well done, the skills management is effective, and levelling up is just difficult enough to make each skill point seem valuable, yet I feel the game could do with a tweak in the difficulty curve, particularly given that there is only one city, and yet the maximum level of difficulty is not impossible to find in it.Recommended, but only for those with time, patience, and a voluminous vocabulary of colourful language.

								This is a really tough game to stick with through updates, particularly because one of the updates changed the game from a tower defense-esque style game, using survivors with limited mobility, to a top down room exploration/scavenging /crafting (limited implementation on that last one) theme that draws out gameplay unnecessarily. Between the implentation of crafting, perks, base building, surviving and traveling to the safe-zone (as per the original storyline, which seems to have all but fallen out of the more recent updates) the game seems to be spread awfully thin right now.PROS+zombies are all the rage+weapon/tactic choices+devs are relatively activeCONS-introduction of filler gameplay-lots of reports of bugs/no starts (personally i've been fine)-for a survival game, resource management plays a minimal role-you're paying $12+ for a game that is two steps removed from being free on Newgrounds.4.5/10 although a few updates could make this game a 7 or 8 "

								The game is TERRIBLE on the linux client. I had emailed the developer once yet I waited NEARLY A MONTH for an update. The game WILL NOT launch on the Linux client by default. I have yet to find a solution. I have waited for a LONG time for the new Infectonator to come out. I have waited about a year or two I forget the years. This is one of the few reasons I got the Steam client. This is the reason Steam got my money. It was well spent money. But not on this. It is a complete piece of trash on the Linux client. It launches to a black screen. The only thing avalible to me is the logo splash and a black screen. I leave you with this. A chance to redeem your 13 USD from a TERRIBLE game that the developer DOSEN'T SUPPORT even though he has the client avalivle on Linux. If it requires something else like Flash or some other non-free item. So be it! Just list it! I had waited for what feels like an eternity for a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥to suck my 13 USD.

If you try to explore and find the required parts to progress the game the zombies WILL kill you. and if you think well I will just go back to base and then return to gather supplies, guess what you WILL starve to death.

								Definitely not worth the price of admission... it seems like an interesting concept but it's just excuted very poorly.The game becomes a monotonous grind out of collecting wood, fibers, ammo, fuel and food to stay alive.All you do is wave after wave of zombie hordes in a small confined area... you then move on to clear a building full of zombies and salvage some items, maybe meet a merchant (which is where the real progress beings)You have so many moves to jump around and scavenge the map, what happens when those moves run out? I'll never know, I was too scared to find out... probably death... I always retreated early and got penalized for doing so by losing some of the supplies I had gained... yet another flawed and idiotic design to go with the rest of the game.It's rogue like, so expect to have either great luck or terrible luck... if you have the latter, expect many restarts. I fixed the car twice and travelled to two different areas... nothing different from the first two... I think the game might be endless until you finally can no longer survive... so a game that never ends... lame.Death is also perminent in this game, there is no way to revive your team mates if you leave them behind. You can only resuscitate them in a battle but if they die from starvation, that's it. Also if your entire team is wiped, your save file is erased and you must start from scratch again.I didn't really understand the crafting system either... you place your team on a work bench, then speed up time, wasting a couple days just to upgrade a turret or craft a shotgun... it's kind of ridiculous. Everything is a domino effect... you have to have ammo to progress the game and find food so you can survive all the while collecting components for upgrades so you can make your life easier. If you run out of any one of those things, the game is basically over. The farming aspect of the game is really silly as well... it takes a full day just to harvest food and the amount of food you harvest is good enough for an entire day... so it just becomes redundant to even bother harvesting food... if the gains were better and you earned 6 supply or 8 supply for wasting a day harvesting, then you could get somewhere.You can however upgrade your ability to catch food and even though it takes a day, you'll get a perminent +1 to supply per day that passes... thus securing survivability for a single team member... that makes more sense... There's just a lot of weird and quirky things with this game I didn't like. The HUD and interface is abysmal at best... it feels like a cell phone game.The only redeeming quality of this game is that you get to play as the Left 4 Dead squad, which is what kept my appeal going, however this is offset by the inclusion of the highly obnoxious Pewdiepie and his girlfriend Cutiepie character which I rolled my eyes at and cringed at the sight of.Either way, it's early access and I doubt it's going to get any better really... so far the upgrades are basic and there's room for improvement on those, other than that I think the game is pretty much finished in terms of game play... you just keep doing the same monotonous boring thing over and over again until you either die or get fed up and uninstall it like I have...Cheers.

								okay this is a GREAT game but with some flawsthis game is very very good but it needs some minor work and balencing first of all i feel it needs random events at least different or more of them and i feel like the game is to easy first try i end up with 50 supllies and im already nearly done on the car at day 6 with 18 fuel i thought this game was suppose to nearly kill you every turn and would if you not smart about it and finally movment i could only move on sqaure every 5 hours which was somewhat annoyingbut otherwise music is good gameplay great and what it fouces on is goodfinal score 9/10 needs modreate blanceing			"

												I cannot get anywhere due to its brutal difficulty.  I have been wiped out by bandits with machine guns on the very first day.On my best run I had everyone decked out with mp5's and half of them in Leather vests. On day 6 the bandits with machine guns and ninja swords show up and insta wipe me.I cannot recommend this game due to this insane difficulty.  Six hours and at least 15 attempts later and I have only made it to day 6 the one time.  I usually die around day 2 or 3.I bought this game at something like 80% off and I still feel like I was ripped off.Stay away.			"

												Flashgame,Good ideas, but not that funny when you play it. It is a flashgame.Cons : Acid from zombie is just a no-sense,No-pause during combatNo turret or anything during ""explore"" (at least in 3 hours of game)The countdown in campaign mode... 15 days (30 days with a ""bonus), but meh... no way to explore everything... even if there is not that much to see\explore  maybe, and it turn to a repetitive game quite fast. The price. Thx god I bought it during discount... but even 4 euro, is waay too much. 1-2 euro game.I don't like the gameplay. There is no strategy, just big weapon win.I think I don't like the graphic, too.Not balanced well, IMO.Pros :Charachter designIdeas. Ideas are quite nice, is just meeeh, not that funny after half-hour of gameplay... just the time to learn how to play it, when you got this, it is just boring.			"

								I bought this game when the game still ""supported"" linux. This, however, has never been the case. Linux has since been removed from the supported operating systems. The linux version has always, only, presented the player with an entirely black window, after the splash screen. This has been reported for a score of different linux distributions on the forum.I have repeatedly asked the developers to comment on the issues and no response has been given yet; not even a confirmation that any problems exist. I have also asked for a refund, with no reply: neither from steam support nor the developer.I like playing Toge games, and the old, broken, free, version found on Armor games looks like fun,  but because of the dishonest treatment of my complaints (as in, ignoring me entirely) I cannot recommend supporting the developer at all.Skip this game.

												I Don't like the way of this game, cuz your charactors have instadeath on day 3, even you doing everything right, you getting out of ammo, and they instakills you. Second, there is no way to do easy mode or hard mode in this game, in fact it putting you on hard mode, wich is hard for me, because I losing all ammo... Third reason is, it cost normal amount of money for me, because Im not using dollars in my country.. Fourth reason, when you getting lots of stuff like 5-10 fuel surviving only 3 days killing lots of zombies, and have guns over 25 it giving you a C, a fricking C for this all hard work for me, Im not noot on it, but it don't have easy mode to change.. for new players. Fifth reason is, when you doing tryhards on campain like 20 times, it giving you less Exp to get more points, and this is insane to get them, in here is no P2P thing, cuz I don't like the way of all those 3 charactors, but not Left 4 Dead, (Im never gonna get it...). So I would buy this game for free of reasons there is nothing updated, and not added new things for players who can't play game on hard.			"

								This game looks good on the Surface. I enjoyed at the start till I started to notice the UI bugs hardly anything that is needed for basic function for the game is incomplete selecting your character to move will 90% deselect your toon on trying to move. Food is so much needed yet it’s a shot in the dark of how much you will get from a given area (as that part hasn't been implemented yet) a lot of things haven't been implemented yet like traits I know this games In Alpha but it won’t even save your option settings upon exit till this moved up on the tree of Development a little more I recommend holding off till then.kerissakti  [developer] Sep 12 @ 9:59pm I'm too lazy to do a changelog today, maybe early next week :PThis should also tell you the maturity level of the developer  "

								I went to run the same zone a second time thinking it would repopulate materials and I was met with increased difficulty and no reward.  I then ran out of food and was forced to move to the next zone with less than half hp on each survivor.  I like the idea of needing to manage my resources but being able to run a zone a second time without any reward in store is a very damaging experience for a first time player.I really dislike having to control each survivor individually.A group move option would really make this less frustrating especially in high danger situations.

								The game features simple pixel graphics with a pinch of anime in it, and the gameplay is a bit similar to X-COM and This War of Mine. If you're a fan, you will get the X-COM or TWoM-ish feel when survivors have to allocate their time to either do research or go out and look for supplies.I actually was introduced to the game only recently, at a convention in Indonesia, the devs are very nice and are willing to explain the game mechanics to me (But I have known the Android game for a while, which was similar to Plague Inc.). I was hooked when I see the gameplay at the works, and was raging when they let me play the game on challenge mode, if you get a certain score, you get a free Steam Key and a T-Shirt, but all I get was a bio card and a pin with a pixelated zombie face on it.But enough about me, this game is pretty fun for fans of games I mentioned above, I play both TWoM and X-COM.The ladies in the development team are really cute, I thought they were just SPGs.10/10 Would be awkward in public again.

Early Access Review
								Summary: I enjoy this game but this is clearly a work in progress. If you were hoping to buy early access to an almost finished game than these aren't the droids your looking for. Pros:♥Well designed 'toy' concept♥Can scavenge for parts and guns♥Good use of ammo as money and well ammo♥Level up system with stat points♥Variety of characters and guns♥You can see where they are trying to go in terms of design and it's good, just isn't there yet. Cons:♦Crafting system is more like a 'research' system because it takes forever even with 4 guys helping. Seriously from a design standpoint this should be broken down into 2 seperate things and crafting should be more instaneous and item based. Researching should be more time and skill based. Example: I spent 1.5 days learning (researching) how to craft armor. Why does each additional armor take 1.5 days, why not just take my materials and make it instant?♦There are some tough spots that might kill you, but right now it's very 'grindy' without much tension. If you go play their ArmorGames flash version I think that version had better tension.♦Item variety is very meh, a gun is a gun is a gun♦Not much use for turrets if you play ""right"" until later levelsTips as of v0.54: Start waves as a fast as you can, spam where the button appears even. This will help you build up 4000+ ammo. Don't wander too far from base, just go out 1-2 and then do 1-2 more buildings on your way back. Goto buildings with (!) above them, rescue the guy and then put him to work on the crafting table. Level up 4 guys as crafters and 4 guys as scavengers. Give lots of HP to the scavengers. Have fun and good luck. "

								Quite possibly one of the best games I've played on Steam. The developers really listen to the community when adding features and even in the alpha stages they've made it completely playable with hardly any bugs. Not all features seemed to improve the game though. For example, when scavenging mode was introduced it really took away from the overall game play in my opinion as it takes way too long to find every single zed and usually you'll end up with one that you can't find at all causing frustration. Nevertheless I'm very surprised how underplayed and under reviewed 'Infectonator : Survivors' is. Definitely worth playing and contains much doge.			"

If you go play their ArmorGames flash version I think that version had better tension.♦Item variety is very meh, a gun is a gun is a gun♦Not much use for turrets if you play ""right"" until later levelsTips as of v0.54: Start waves as a fast as you can, spam where the button appears even. This will help you build up 4000+ ammo. Don't wander too far from base, just go out 1-2 and then do 1-2 more buildings on your way back. Goto buildings with (!) above them, rescue the guy and then put him to work on the crafting table. Level up 4 guys as crafters and 4 guys as scavengers. Give lots of HP to the scavengers. Have fun and good luck. "

This will lose progress since the last time you were at your home base, so return there frequent-ish (every 4 or 5 buildings, or 1.5 hours: not really the frequent for a save...).BUT THAT ASIDE THIS GAME ROCKS.

								Quite possibly one of the best games I've played on Steam. The developers really listen to the community when adding features and even in the alpha stages they've made it completely playable with hardly any bugs. Not all features seemed to improve the game though. For example, when scavenging mode was introduced it really took away from the overall game play in my opinion as it takes way too long to find every single zed and usually you'll end up with one that you can't find at all causing frustration. Nevertheless I'm very surprised how underplayed and under reviewed 'Infectonator : Survivors' is. Definitely worth playing and contains much doge.			"

								Really great foundation. Interesting gameplay and awesome potential for strategy. I know it's early access, so I'm not complaining, but it's definitely lacking polish. I think it's a solid beginning and has a lot of potential to grow into a very well developed strategy game.Here are the issues I feel need to be addressed:1. Difficulty. The game starts out great. But after a few hours of play, it becomes repetitive. There needs to be a sharper increase in difficulty. Faster zombies, more resilient zombies, more zombies, new types of zombies, that throw a curve ball at you. As is, once your characters are leveled up a bit and have good equipment, there's not a lot of need to place them anywhere specific, you can just walk into a room and clear it.2. Harsher limit to actions per day. The timed system in place right now takes all need for supplies or sending specific characters on runs. Instead of splitting the group to hit two buildings in a day and risk having your smaller teams be overrun, You can almost hit as many buildings as you want before your group ""uses"" supplies. By the time the supplies are deducted, you have such a huge stockpile it's basically a non existant feature of the game. There's no threat or danger to running out of supplies. This ties in with the difficulty increase.3. More Random encounters. Obviously there is more coming as this is still a work in progress. This suggestion is more me looking forward to interesting situations being introduced into the game. My two cents would be to include aggressive zombies. Have the base camp be under threat of being attacked so players need to keep ""guards"" there as well as send some characters on runs.Overall, great work so far, but I'm looking forward to what will be coming!

								Infectionator is a great game but the game ending bugs like not being able to travel really ruin the experience it would almost seem that they do not know where they are going with their core gameplay. That being said the Toge team has always delivered an entertaining game even though it is still incomplete it would be nice to be able to progress a little without the game ending up on a constant loop of trying to travel from the first town without it telling you night has fallen and returning you to base. travel was not an issue in earlier builds and i hope this problem will be rectified soon. But it looks like a promising game when it is completed and i would recomennd it bugs and all. "

												My boyfriend kindly gifted me a copy of this game after I mentioned how I liked the original Infectonator on the iPhone (free app). I really want to like this game, it has nice graphics and the gameplay is fun but while I have almost 4 hours on record, the game is extremely tough. I have tried the campaign mode a number of times now and have died repeatedly, barely making it past day 5. I really wish you could skip past cut scenes instead of having to constantly press buttons. The random events make the game tough. I was doing great on my last game and suddenly, the night passes with my characters resting and two have died of some disease, a thief stole supplies and ammo, rendering me down to two characters and zero ammo, so I died while scavenging for supplies. This has happened multiple times.Overall, it's not a bad game, just tough (which some people will enjoy) and the graphics are nice. It does have the factor of making me want to keep playing to try and beat my previous score (just in small doses).EDIT: I also forgot to mention that the game has frozen on me a few times (did a few minutes ago while on a mission) but I do enjoy the fact that the missions seem to vary each time.

												I played the first infectionater games since the early days and loved them but I have mixed feelings about this one. The presentation and sounds are great but the difficultly justs seem OTT, does every game nowadays have to be like Darksouls?  My last game survived zombie hoard and human ambush at the minimart then returned to base only for it to have rained so heavy that it washed my food away. I suppose the team forgot to picked up some beans or something from the minimart levels previous,  So by day 2 I didn't die due to zombies or armed assault but because the rain managed to disolve every piece of food in a fridge in an enclosed building and my people hadn'rt eaten for 24 hrs... HARSH!  Also when you find a survivor is it possible to stop him flailing around like an idiot and charge directly towards an oncoming zombie hoard??? Maybe build in an action to hit the person with the butt of the gun perhaps? I recommend purely for your previous titles, presentation and if you like Darksouls difficulty...			"

You can find other survivors to join your group but they will need more food so having alot of people is not always the bets idea. Every town you must repair your car to go to the next town, but while your doing this you must get stuff to keep your survivors alive and you can do things like crafting finding weapons and leveling up.

								Ok so, when they added the survival mode I thought it was going to be awesome, but it wasn't, challenging yes, but for the gameplay not so awesome. I'm pretty sure if they took their time instead of just thinking it up and slapping it on there you probably would have got the game alot more attention... who knows. I have 10 things that would make the survival mode kick serious♥♥♥♥♥ 1.Add more weapons, instead of the piece of junk pistol2.Get rid of the unnecessary loot that you find in objects.Like jumper cables,batteries,tires etc. 3.Add health packs and guns that come from killing more difficult enemies  4.Add more characters5.Make the characters have special abilities6.Add an upgrade system that goes with the survival mode. Example lets say the weeker enemies are worth 5 points and the harder ones are worth 10 to 15 making the bosses worth alot more, with that make it like every 500 to 1000 points to be able to upgrade the character7.Add online gameplay 8.Make different levels for survival mode in addition add a level editor so people have the abbility to create their own levels and play them online with their friends9.Add a sells person in a random spot to buy guns and other things from10. This is the big kicker! Add dual wield to some of the characters or all of them "

Perhaps that will change moving forward, but i can't see coming back for dozens of hours to what it is right now.  However, for the price, even with my complaints, I think it is a great buy if you like the same kinds of things I listed above. I personally look forward to seeing it in its final state.

Early Access Review
								Honestly, I haven't felt the need to review a game, but this one stands out. For an early acess game, there is already so much in the game. Sure, after almost a day in game it could get a little slow, but anyone can make things a little more fun by using only melee weapons or playing as pewds. I love they way the scavange system works and how to find survivors. My only hope for the game is that there is eventually a multiplayer gamemode or multiplayer campaign. I would reccomend this game to anyone who like picking up a new game to play for 30 min-1 hr at a time. Happy hunting!			"

												I'm not good at writing comments so I'll just write my experience.First try - didn't know what I should research/craft and you can't pause the game so I just sat around wasting time and I didn't explore that night because all of my characters were tired from trying to reaserch/craft. Eventually I died because there was a boss and I didn't notice one of my characters was dead so I just sat there like an idiot trying to seach an object. Then I gave up because that was a stupid way to lose a character and I thought I'd just quickly restart since I wasn't very far anyways.Second try - I got a distress signal on the second night (the first night that you can actually do anything) and it was only two spaces away so I explored the spot before it and scouted the area. There were people with guns instead of zombies and I died in the second wave because they shot me at the same time so I couldn't physically kill them without putting my own characters at risk. To be fair, I thought that it could be a trap, but I didn't think that I had no chance of winning. Since it happened on the first night of playing. Maybe if I had better guns or equipment I guess.Third try - Everything is going great I've scouted and explored 3 areas in the second night (first night you can do anything) I've gotten a bunch of resources and weapons and my characters are barely injured but I head back just to be safe. Right before I get back to the safe zone one of my characters is killed by dialogue from a random event. I would've been fine with an ambush or something where I could actually fight back and if I did die it was my own fault but all I got to do was watch as my character died on top of the safe zone. I had the option to not explore the room I guess but I didn't know that it would insta kill my character. She wasn't even the injured one. We had already cleared the place of zombies.I'm going to keep trying because I've had fun with this game before and it still fun sometimes.Edit*Fourth try - used the radio to find a survivor since it's apparently extremely difficult to not lose all of your characters and I got an answer. When I got to the spot I started searching a nearby car but then I heard gunshots and startd getting money so I panicked and ran to save the survivor but apparently the entire horde was in the next room so two of my characters were knocked down and I apparently started reviving them too late so they died anyways. When I finally managed to drag my two remaining characters to the next room the survivor was already dead. In hindsight I'm not sure what I should've done, maybe I could've gotten there a few seconds earlier but I didn't know the location of the survivor until after he started shooting and that was when I started moving, or maybe I should've automatically known that I wasn't strong enough to save both my characters and the guy and I should've waited a while to explore the place. After that it took me the whole day just to make 3 supplies and I needed 4 everyday so I had to explore other places and I got killed by a boss.Edit**Fifth try - human bandits again only this time they were right next to the starting point so ♥♥♥♥ me I guess. I actually built a turret that time and I was reviving people as soon as they went down but then 3 of my people died at the same time and while I was trying to save even one of my other characters the last enemy killed me.Final EditSixth try - almost beat the game I made it to night 15 and went out for the final time and I got the last item that I needed to escape but I died anways. I'm not sure why that last night was even added in if you can't finish the car. The game is decent if you figure out the ins and outs but there's too much that's based on luck. By the end of this run I had saved 15ish survivors and had over 100 supplies.			"

												Ok -So this is sadly my first review. I normally don't take the time to write these. Bust sadly chose to do so for this game because it was the first game I'm going to uninstall, because I have zero plans of ever coming back to it.I usually love games like this... FTL, one of my all time favorite games. Kingdom Rush: not a favorite, but solid. Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten: SUPER good! So... I was really dissapointed that this game didn't do it for me. I'm also a Zombie fan. Talltales Walking Dead, the best. Dead Age, decent.So what is wrong with this game.#1) It took me only a couple hours to see how this game turns into a nasty grind. You're required to ""explore"" areas, which I was all into in the early stages, but quickly turned into let me just walk around the edge of this map so I can get out of here.#2) The RNG is nasty. The game works like this. Go Explore Squares... You have a very limited amount you can explore at first (You need a game mechanic of ""Stamina"" to go exploring. Once you get around 33% you have to head back to base. Each time you do that, you lose a day. You have to complete the game in I believe 15 Days.). Based on your Exploration you will randomly find componnents to ""Beat the Game."" The game gives you no indication that you'll find all of the componnents. #3) Coupled with this grind is a nasty system of upkeep. You need ""food"" or your people starve. This component is not bad actually. What makes it annoying though is it being handcuffed with #1 and #2.Do not reccomend this game. Sorry.			"

												The game was really good when it was under development and you could see improvements.  Now it is not worth my time to play when: random zombies drop acid for no reason, the drops from searching are terrible now, the day/night thing is not well thought out (as a survivor, why would you only go out at night?), the 13 day timer to complete the car and get out is dumb, and the other survivors you find are worthless and get you killed for helping them now. So little is balanced now.			"

												Over-staying acid, no sprint, crafting good weapon emerges way too late. not so much of narration.once you overcomb the fatal difficulty in the beginning, the later phase becomes fairly easy and very repetitive. I played once every major updates since the beginning, but I did not expect the final product to be rather unfinished sandbox. If the developers were intending to create sandbox, then it should have more customization on not only characters but the shelters. However, it is impossible due to limitation on the days to leave the city. had potentials, but left unfinished it seems. oh and the freakin' acid from the beginning. Should have shortened the time left. It stays too long that it's more irritating than threatening.p.s. the first trailer;s music on steam now does not match with both the trailer and the title itself. Please just stick with previous trailers.			"
