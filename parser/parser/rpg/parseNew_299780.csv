												   Noir Syndrome is an interesting game. It tries to bring in something new to the Rogue-lite market, by putting you in the shoes of a private detective. From there, you have several places to visit to gather clues and suspects, while trying not to step on the wrong faction's toes.   While the concept is fantastic, the game's scope is much more modest. I was expecting much more from it, and it's not what it was trying to deliver.    Sessions last about 15 minutes.   There is a rampant murderer in the city (for cult reasons), and you can visit every landmark freely, spending one day to explore each area. I was expecting a bit more FTL or WeirdWorlds influence, with a deep lore that one could discover by playing it over and over again, but this is purely a mechanical game. Unfortunately, its mechanics are not robust enough to carry it, in my opinion. Presentation   The game's artstyle is not beautiful, nor unique. You can probably get that from the screenshots. But it's functional, and to be honest, it didn't prove very relevant in my enjoyment of the game. A great artstyle would certainly make it more enjoyable, but I could distinguish everything of important here, so it's fine.    The Music, however, was pretty neat! As you would expect from a Noir game, it features a lot of Jazz, with a bit of chiptune influences at times, and also Classical music in a couple of places (expensive hotels and the hunting club, for example). But for the most part, it's jazz. And it fits the detective vibe perfectly.    It's not something I'd listen to on my own time (it's simple, and not a lot of variety), but I didn't feel like turning it off while playing the game!     Now that this is out of their way, I'll explain how the game works.   You have 14 days to explore the city and find out who the culprit is, and bring him to justice. You have various different areas of the city to explore. You can explore one each day.   In those areas there are objects and people. In a restaurant, for example, you can speak to people there, and also explore the seats and tables for clues. Each area functions similarly. This exploration phase plays like a 2D side-scroller.    People can be either of 2: normal people, and sellers. Normal people can give you suspects (or give a very generic and not very convincing argument against them being a suspect... just flavour text), while vendors will try to sell you Food, Lockpicks or Bullets.   Examinable objects can also give you Locks, Bullets, Money, or Clues.   You'll need Locks to open doors or steal from vaults, and Bullets to... well... kill people. More on that later. Clues are a bit more interesting (although not too much). For your deductive reasoning, you'll have to find suspects that fit certain criteria. After you learn about a person, you'll know all of their attributes. Clues will provide you with the killer's attributes.   Each person has a faction, an occupation, a gender, and a name. The faction includes Police, Mob, and Civillian. Occupation can go from Artist or Chef to Tailor or Driver. Once you think you've found who the killer is, you check him on your notebook, and his location will be shown on the map.   Every clue is about the killer. This is very important (and also a big issue). No matter where you find it, the clue is always about the murderer. Also, the clues are Binary. A gun holster, for example, tells you (s)he's either from the Mob, or the Police. An ornate fabric tell you (s)he's either a Tailor, or a Dancer. And so on. There can't be contradictory clues, so you'll end up collecting just enough to find which aspect is common between them. If no one fits those traits, you'll need to speak to more people to get more suspects.---   This is a very uninteresting way of making you a detective, isn't it? There's barely any brainwork from the player! It's just about running around the place, inspecting every random background object (because that's where you get clues), and then finding the right choices. It doesn't feel like you're playing a detective, and every game ends up playing too similarly.    Since every clue is about the killer, you don't really need to go to the crime scenes or follow leads to find anything about him(her). You can just explore any place that's convenient to you, and you'll easily succeed. This is probably the biggest issue I have with it. There's not a lot of thinking in this game, and it completely takes the ""detective"" part out of the game.---   On the City, there are different possible events. There are Civillian Gatherings, Police/Mob takeovers, Crime Scenes, and fishy places. About he latter, I have no ideia... You get that information from the people, but there is nothing different in those areas.   The first 3 are areas dominated by said faction. This is relevant when you killed someone from the Police/Mob and left witnesses, or stole from either, as factions can then be hostile towards you, and shoot on sight. On Hard mode, there's always an hostile faction from the start.   CrimeScenes are areas without people, where you can look for clues, without the risk of getting murdered.    Other than that, one important aspect is the Hunger Meter. Yes. This has a ♥♥♥♥ing hunger meter. I'm sorry, that's rude. But seriously... Why?!   The game has nothing to do with survival, except for the fact that you have to buy food not to die. Each time you examine something, or open doors, you'll lose 3 points. A piece of food can give you from 100 to 300, depending on the price. I guess this puts a stop to spamming Z constantly, but it doesn't feel necessary to have such a ""feature"".---   This is a good segway!   The game is far too easy. There aren't too many suspects, and it's easy to find his attributes from the clues. Normal mode is not challenging at all. Hard Mode, can be fairly challenging, but for the wrong reasons. Food could be one of them, but you learn to play with it. The main reason is the factions that's trying to kill you. You have very limited bullets (1-2, usually), so you can't just kill everyone, which is good. However, while finding clues is very easy, finding all the suspects can take more effort, especially, when there's a faction that will kill you immediately, and there may also be hitmen on you, that seem to spawn randomly. You can literally enter an area and just die, because he was right in front of you, and you couldn't escape.    This helps the game having challenge, but still doesn't feel like being the detective was the focus. The detective part is a very thin layer, surrounded by all these other systems trying to keep you from examining it closely.---   I think I've covered most of it. It's a purely mechanical game, of getting clues and suspects, and then arresting them. Killing them ends the game, but not with a victory. There are some special systems, like stealing from factions (that♥♥♥♥♥♥them off) or killing everyone in an area not to leave witnesses, but those play a very minor role in the overall game. This is because the game isn't hard at all! When you die, it's mostly out of your control.   The only narrative, is present in the murderers appartment, where there are random logs (6), with a passage of his Egypt-mythology related killing spree. Nothing substancial at all, though. There are no interesting plots throughout the city, no lore, no interesting random events, nothing of the sort. It was what I was mostly looking forward to, unfortunately...   Conclusion. It's not an awful game. It's actually pretty solid, for what it is. If you're looking for a very simple game (perhaps a good first project), then go ahead. I enjoyed the game, but I don't consider it great at all. Lots of wasted potential, but an interesting effort nonetheless. Only higher from here!			"

												Noir Syndrome is one of those games that falls into the quirky category of ""For its price, it's pretty good."" In spite of the claims of the developer, to say that each playthrough of Noir Syndrome generates a new and unique procedurally generated Murder Mystery story is a bit of a stretch. That being said, it's still a fun puzzler that mixes in enough demand for quick reflexes, gut instincts, and the ability to bluff with confidence to make it a very worthwhile experience. In Noir Syndrome, you play an anonymous flatfoot who wakes up one day to a city under siege from the mysterious murderer Anubis. You are given 14 days to explore the city, interviewing citizens for tips and suspects, searching through garbage cans and police desks for clues, and avoiding the bullets of the police and the mob (assuming you were rude enough to tick off either party somehow). Over time, Anubis will strike again and again, reducing your score but also helping weed out suspects. Visiting crime scenes burns through your valuable time, but searching for clues and chatting with citizens burns calories, so between the actual detective work you'll need to scrounge up funds and get a bite to eat. You can also spend cash on tips from the mob, lockpicks to aid in your more ""thorough"" investigations, and bullets for taking out those who take offense at your methods.Once you have enough clues and suspects, you'll be able to narrow down the names and know for certain who your man is. Of course, if time's running short, you might be forced to make an educated guess and hope for the best; given the choice between walking into a nest of furious gunmen and placing your faith in a coinflip, sometimes half-baked detective work is really your best bet. Each game takes about 20 minutes to complete, so it's not like you aren't committed to success, but at the same time losing isn't exactly the end of the world.Eventually, the game will get a touch dull; there's only one city layout, and the number of variables they can flip around really isn't that huge. Fortunately, there are three difficulty settings which drastically affect the experience, 30 in-game Achievements to acquire that provide you with bonuses for future cases, and an alternate Dinner Party play mode that forces you to find your man in a fraction of the time of a normal game, and which unlocks a variety of goofy costumes (always a solid selling point).Noir Syndrome accomplishes all this with a presentation better suited for an NES than a radio serial broadcast. It might not scratch any authentic murder-mystery itches, but it's a clever little puzzler that's well worth the price of admission.			"

												Well isn't this a nice little game, a creative idea executed fairly well.The idea behind it is you're a private investigator in a violent town, trying to arrest an assassin. As a result, you investigate this filthy town while trying to stay alive.The clues are randomly placed in the environment and you have to investigate every nook and cranny to get the clues that will reveal who the true culprit is. Some clues are more decisive than others, for example, a bullet casing may indicate the culprit is a Mobster or a member of the Police, while a Police ID precisely tells you the culprit affiliation.You have to figure out 3 things : Affiliation (Civilian, Mobster, Policeman), Job (Driver, Chef, etc.) and Sex (Male or Female).Of course you can just guess and try an arrest but if you get it wrong you fail.As to how gather suspects, you have to talk to the people in various places, crime scenes don't have people lingering about but have generally more clues and some events make people amass in a place, particularly if they're from one affiliation.Anyway, this becomes quite important when playing a higher difficulty than normal, because either the police or the mob want you dead, so the investigation becomes much harder with shootouts, especially since bullets are limited and costly, that's why it's wise to avoid places where the affiliation that wants you dead hangs out.Bullets aren't the only thing that can kill you however, hunger can as well, you have to manage your money to buy the right resources like lockpicks, bullets or food to survive, everytime you investigate or talk with someone you get hungrier until you die.Some places need lockpicks to explore fully and you can even rob some places where hopefully you don't get spotted or you make another faction your enemy.Everytime you start a new game, the culprit and the clues are randomized, as is the faction that hunts you down, the events of course are randomized too, as is the place you can find clues.The gameplay is free and you can go whenever you want mostly, but you have a time limit in days to catch the culprit... or you might just go on a murder spree.All in all this is a repeatable noir detective story with a great soundtrack and a great feel to it. Recommended, but might get old pretty fast.			"

												You have two weeks before the mysterious killer known as Anubis assassinates the mayor. Ask around to find suspects, and narrow down your list by finding clues to the muderer's identity. Try to avoid the wrath of the police and the mob, because they'll kill you on sight. Or play the dinner party mode, where you're locked in with the killer, and the other guests occasionally go mad and kill you. Collect badges to level up your subsequent characters, and play on three difficulty modes, all of them challenging. Noir Syndrome is great fun with procedurally generated mysteries that usually don't last longer than ten minutes, but there are some obvious flaws.Controls are fully rebindable, as they always should be in a PC game. There are only five action keys, but a couple would have been helpful. The ""investigate"" key handles all actions except shooting, which is quite annoying when someone is standing in front of an object you want to investigate or a door you want to enter, but the game insists on making you talk instead.The interface is a bit clunky as well. Using multiple screens to try to manage a very small amount of information on the suspects is rather ridiculous. The game doesn't let you cross off suspects who don't match the clues you've gathered, and you can't un-designate a culprit once you've selected one (though you can change which one you'll arrest if you talk to him or her).The tutorial is bare-bones; some will appreciate learning the mechanics on their own, but it would have been nice to learn more before being thrown into the game. On the whole, though, there's a lot of pixelly fun to be had here.			"

												Noir Syndrome isn't a terrible game, but it lacks in-depth gameplay. In this game, you solve cases by asking questions and finding clues, but the way you do so is redundant. How do you find clues? Rather than actually looking for a clue, you just press the 'Z' button whenever you stand near something interactable and hope you get lucky enough to get a clue. In other words, you don't find clues in this game; you just wait until the game decides to hand you a clue. How do you get information out of people? The same exact way. Press 'Z' and hope they give you information. No story, no dialogue options, just a 'Z' button. A successful detective game needs to make the player feel like they are actually solving the case themselves. Make them find the clues; make them interrogate suspects. Don't reduce everything a good detective game needs to one simple button. This game is playable, but the shallow gameplay will ultimately lead you to let the game sit in your library untouched for a long time.			"

												The thing I really liked about this game, is that I as I got to understand the dynamics of the gameworld / exploration elements, I started finding the clues I needed faster, and succeeding more.  Like Binding of Isaac, it's less about a single play that weaves a story, as the way different failures lead up to a run where everything falls into place, and you realize you've developed the skills to make use of it.I would recommend this game, but be aware that the action and story elements are very minimalistic.  Like a lot of classic and retro titles, it's the limits and balance of the game that make it a unique and enjoyable experience.			"

												One dimensional, lacking in interest and overall disappointing game.There's no real substance to the 'clues' or game mechanics, and there's nothing really detective-y about it. There are murders which produce crime scenes; this could have been cool - it could have featured a chalked out body with higher probability of clues, and witnesses to question. Instead, you get the same area, and gameplay simply boils down to pressing Z all over a few locations until you have enough clues to blame-by-logic. Feels like an iPhone game, plays like a free flash tite.			"

												This game has a great concept, but it unfortunately really falls short, almost feeling unfinished.  The game has huge potential in its mechanics and the idea of procedurally generated mystery in general, but it needs the story element (the mystery genre's strength) to be interesting.The atmosphere is enjoyable (the soundtrack and art style are very nice), but the gameplay totally took me out of the mood.   At first, I completely didn't understand what I was supposed to be doing.  It is not intuitive, and there isn't a very good introduction/explanation of the controls.  You have to focus so much on figuring out how the game works that it's impossible to get immersed in it.The story elements don't link up at all with the gameplay, which is a big part of why it's so confusing to figure out.  For example, you're no more likely to find a clue at the crime scene than in ANY other place in the game.  A lot of things feel very luck based, and it's frustrating to realize a lot of things you were trying to do were just a waste of time and resources.  The game does give you a lot of freedom in what you can do, but there aren't logical consequences for every type of action.  Everything you do in the game is done the same way (selectively spamming the interact button until you have enough data) and then solving a simple Guess Who logic puzzle.  Before you understand how it works, it's confusing and jarring, and once you do, it's overly easy.  There are a lot of interesting elements (like hunger meter and managing resources, factions, etc.) but without narrative to contextualize them, they feel empty.   It seems like the game is mostly figuring out how the game works, instead of actually playing the game.The Dinner Party mode is a condensed version (1 night in a house vs. a week in the whole city), which I actually found a lot more enjoyable.  There's more of a real-time pressure, and it's easier to get immersed because the investigative style makes more sense on this scale.  The ""madness"" mechanic (essentially, the other characters will sometimes want to shoot you) makes you stay in the moment and keep moving throughout the house.  However, again, once you figure out how it works, it gets old quick.If I'm a little harsh on this game, it's because it has such fantastic potential and concept that got me really excited, and it simply doesn't deliver.  I wish the devs kept it gestating a little longer, and spent as much time on integrating story as they did with coming up with (frankly really interesting) game mechanics.  Yes, you can play over and over.  Unfortunately, it doesn't really make you /want/ to.			"

Or that person being Mob or Police... you can see where this goes.It's a fun game. You can solve a case fast if you are taking a break, or take your time to build a strong case to be sure.			"

												As I stood in my run down apartment, my mission became clear.Noir Syndrome is agame that hits all the right targets: it's stylish, has a good story and is, most importantly, fun. The player's goal is to travel around various buildings in a 60s Chicago town, collecting clues and learning of possible suspects. However, you are only human, and in this mystery game hunger and hitmen sent by the culprit because you know too much are also your enemies. Anyone anywhere in this town is a suspect, but you need to find someone who's backstory fits the clues you have gathered. Then finally when the culprit is obvious, you locate them and apprehend them.This game has certainly been worth 5 quid, maybe more (And that is NOT. repeat NOT a hint to raise the price, guys). The general rush of desperately trying to piece these vague clues together while deaths occur all around you is an experience not usually encountered in other games. Beside that, the way you execute justice is entirely up to you. Want some gun action? Go bounty hunting for the Hunt Club. Want a challenge? Rob a shop or kill a gangster and have the police and mob on your tail too! Hungry? Go to the diner and grab a ham and cheese plate. It's basically 8 bit, scaled down GTA.10/10. Case Closed. Thanks, Glass Knuckle. "

But your given plenty of time to find whodunitBLEH-*No really options menu to(music and sound on one setting)*I had a high tendacy to screw up cases by shooting my gun accidently, as the investigate key and shoot keys are right next to each other*Hunger mechanic is lame and adds nothing to the gameVerdict: A great game, that gives you a quick game of whodun it, but can become quite easy over time			"

												This game is exactly as advertised, a procedural detective game. Sadly the result is a bland experience.The clues, suspects, and locations where something can be found are random, this also means that the story -- such as it is -- makes no sense at all. What this leads to is a detective game where you don't care about the story and you just go about at random.And the gameplay just isn't interesting. Everywhere you go it is the same. Walk up to someone or something and press Z. Walk up to the next person or thing and press Z. Shoot and kill someone with X. Z, walk, X, walk, Z, Z.Good concept, but sadly lacking execution.			"

												Noir Syndrome is like single player Clue, but with a detective/noir feeling and a pixel art aeshthetic.You are plopped into the life of a pixelated detective and must catch a serial killer in 15 days. You're presented with an array of locations to visit, where you'll collect clues and interview people in point-and-click adventure style. Once you leave an area, a day has passed. Any info you've collected is placed in a notebook you can access at any time. Gather enough clues about the gender, occupation, and civilian/mobster/police affiliation of the suspect and you'll be able to pinpoint them and arrest them before they can kill again. Behind all this is a hunger system, but most locations offer at least one food vendor. I've never gotten hungry enough to experience any ill effects, but I imagine if you reach full hunger you die.That's only the core of the game. There are all kinds of side objectives and optional activities. You have a gun, and if you play on a harder difficulty, steal from the mob, or shoot an innocent civilian you'd better be quick with it or you'll be dead. This isn't a health bar situation, this is one shot to kill.Money is an important resource in Noir Syndrome, as you'll need it to buy lockpicks to investigate locked rooms, bullets to defend yourself, and food to sate your hunger. You start with an appropriate budget for a private investigator, about the price of one hotdog. In the course of your investigations you'll find more cash, and by earning badges (essentially in-game achievements) you can unlock better starting bonuses, including extra lockpicks and bullets.There's a seperate Dinner Party mode, in which you've been invited to a Clue/Murder By Death style dinner party and must uncover the identity of a murderer. You already know all the suspects, but finding clues is complicated by the paranoia of the remaining guests who can become hostile with little warning.A playthrough of either mode will likely take you less than half an hour, but since the clues and culprit are randomized each time you'll want to play repeatedly.I love Noir Syndrome, if for no reason other than that it's the second game I've ever played that actually lets you use deductive reasoning to solve a mystery, the first being L.A. Noire. The art is great, and gives you just enough information to know what you're seeing, but not enough to get you bogged down in details (insert GIF of Cole Phelps examining a beer bottle, mumbling ""useless"" to himself.) The game's soundtrack is great, but gets a little repetitive after a few playthroughs. The controls can take a few minutes to get used to, and I find myself clicking the wrong button to close the notebook often, but these are minor details, and I expect they'll be addressed. This game is not in Early Access, but is being actively deveoped, and each patch I've seen has added significant content. The latest as of this review added randomized challenges for each playthrough, which I haven't tried yet.My only real complaint about Noir Syndrome is that the hunger system feels inappropriate for the rest of the game, Like it was left over from some earlier iteration in which this was a survival rogue-like. But for the most part it's unobtrusive and doesn't detract from what is otherwise a birlliant game.I highly recommend Noir Syndrome, and if you like solving mysteries it's an absolute must-have game.

												A game where if you rob a vault when it's a murder scene you get away scott free!A very fun little game. When I first started this game I seriously had no idea how you were supposed to do anything but eventually I figured it out and started having more fun.I kind of like that the game doesn't explain that much to you and the badges and costumes are fun to get. I'm really liking the additions that have been added to the game such as the hunting club and sandbox mode. I do wish there was more to it, like a mode where you can play and solve as many cases as you can before you die (to try and see what you can do before you die each run) but still it's quite fun and a good time waster.The music is also quite fun and while I have probably died more than I have actually solved a case, I still have fun even when i'm fighting for my life.Also being able to pay off the mob/police makes life so much easier.

												Noir Syndrome is a very fun procedural mystery game that stands out as fairly unique in a sea of pretty samey indie games. The game gives few instructions beyond basic controls, leaving the player to figure out not only the mysteries at hand but how to solve those mysteries. What is frustrating in many games is actually very fun here. Since each case is so quick (about ten-fifteen minutes at most), you don't feel like you've wasted time if you make a mistake (I accidentally shot a cop in my first game and accidentally robbed the mob in my second) and have to start over.  There's room for improvement, personally I'd love to see ""Dinner Party mode"" made more than just the standard game in one locale and the cases can get repetitive after a while but the game is totally worth it at this price point.

												The dame walked in like a shower of brightly coloured lego blocks.I pressed her Z button and she told me of the case, a case so tightly wound that Fort Knox used it as a blueprint.But I don't trust dames. Not since I first played games with them. This required nostalgia, sketchy characters and a haunting jazz melody.Luckily, that's exactly what I got.Will I be here long? Maybe not.

												This game is hard to get into and a little big confusing but it has potential. It took me a while to figure out how to select a culprit, and the game can be confusing in parts but I loved L.A. Noire and felt this would be a similair game made by indie devs, which it is. It would be fun if it had a story mode or a better tutorial, but for now it's alright. Worth the money I payed for it (£1.69). There are procedurally generated cases, but that only goes as far as the murder victims, clues and suspect names. It would be better if there were different types of cases, that would make the game more enjoyable. It's great for playing in short bursts but I wouldn't play it for prolonged periods of time.			"

												It's a really simple logic puzzle game at it's core.You walk around at a frustratingly slow pace and keep pushing the ""Z"" key. That's basically it, you collect clues and the names of suspects. Once you have a suspect that matches your clues i.e. ""female, mobster, dancer"" you go to the location where the culprit is and push the ""Z"" key again to arrest them. Riveting!Add to that an absolutely annoying and unecessary hunger feature, that requires you to purchase food at regular intervals and you have a game that could have been pretty fun but gets repetetive the 3rd time around.If you're looking for a challenging detective puzzle game you won't find it here.

												Noir Syndrome is a procedurally generated Detective-Em-Up and it's a heck of a lot of fun.The mechanics are fairly simple. you basically move from location to location hitting Z (to search) on everything to gather clues, suspects and various items.The fun comes from taking these clues and trying to work out who the culprit is. Your Notebook gathers all your clues together along with any suspects you've learnt about.It's then about eliminating suspects who don't match the clues.For example, one clue might belong to either a Poet or an Artist so you know the killer has to be someone with either of those hobbies.The killer and the clues are randomised every game, although the locations are always the same.You'll also find money, bullets and lockpicks as you search each location. Although a playthrough might only take 20 minutes or so there's a lot to come back to.Beyond simply trying to track down the killer there are various other side things to do.For example, one area houses a vault that's been sealed shut for 100 years. Tempting, no?There's also a more condensed mode called Dinner Party where you and all the suspects are locked in one location.Here you already know all the suspects including their affiliation (Civilian, Mob or Police) and their hobbies so all you need to do is hunt down the clues and piece them together.Although it seems being cooped up together does take it's toll on the guests, over time they go a little crazy and need to be avoided (or shot) until they cool down.Aside from the two main modes there are also in game Badges to unlock for completing various objectives, such as closing five cases or visiting 100 crime scenes.Each game also offers an individual challenge, fire 10 bullets for example.Unlocking badges and completing challenges give the player permanent bonuses for future games, such as starting with an extra lockpick.Oh and there are costumes to unlock too.The soundtrack is superb as well. On the downside, the gameplay is really simple. You talk, you search, you shoot and you unlock. That's it.I think it helps that there are side objectives to do but if you're looking for something really deep you won't find it here.Although each game technically is different there's not a lot that changes between playthroughs. The clues, suspects and killer will be different yes but this doesn't really mean as much as you might think. You'll still be doing the same things regardless. You choose a location to visit, you hit Z on everything and then you have a look at your Notebook before moving on. There's also no real logic to the clues. You find them anywhere, regardless of whether it makes sense to do so or not. Sometimes murders happen as you play and an area is marked as a crime scene but all this means is the area will empty on that day. You won't necessarily find a lot of clues in that area for example. The Hunger mechanic can be a bit of a pain too, you lose hunger every time you do something (even searching in an area you can't find anything in for example, or searching the same area twice). This has been improved now that the Notebook states hunger as a number though. Before that update it simply said ""Hungry"" or ""Full"" without giving any indication how much longer you could go without eating anything.Also it's a really minor thing but it'd be nice to be able to score people off the suspect list. Overall though, I'd recommend it for sure.			"

												First of all, let's get something out of the way: this game was QUITE CLEARLY made for a device such as a tablet. Now that that's out of the picture, Noir Syndrome is a very strange take on what one could call the detective games' genre.Gameplay is a simple ""look for clues"" ritual, where you click the investigate button near a backdrop and have the potential of finding evidence that points you in the direction of one of the suspects or you click the same button near a person and talk to them, potentially adding someone to your suspects' list. The reason this is quirky is because at the end of a session you may not have had either enough evidence to point you to the real culprit (and thus force you to guess who the culprit is for the session) or, and this one's a real pain and somewhat usual phenomenon, you don't even have the culprit on your suspects' list yet; if this is the case, you have lost, period.Other game mechanics are a hunger system, where you are forced to interact with salespeople to get food of various qualities for differing prices, a wanted system, where either or both the police and the mob are out to get you, and essentially a pressuring system where at some points during the game the culprit will send hitmen out to kill you. There's also a ""quest"" system so you can earn a little more money either by killing assigned targets or delivering mail to the intended recipient, but for both of those you need to have found the respective items to access the quest givers via the quirky random chance while inspecting the background, which is the main source of your character getting hungry by the way...Noir Syndrome comes with three difficulty modes where the main factors are how awful are your starting conditions and how expensive every commodity in the game is. Yes, that steak isn't going to pay itself in Impossible Mode if you haven't been improving your money-hoarding skill that persists through different game sessions, so you'll have to start at Easy and work your way towards it....Which, after all, is Noir Syndrome's greatest sin. The game is awfully very much about strategy and luck, as you have to choose which areas you go into in order to get clues while taking into account if the police or the mob have a chance to be represented in the area, and also managing your scarce money to buy bullets, lockpicks and the ever-important food at different locations. But after you've raised your money-hoarding skills to the point of making money become just another number you casually look at while at the hardest of difficulties, it's almost like you're playing on Easy again if you have the right strategy, and the game becomes once again about how lucky you are to find the clues you need. This makes Noir Syndrome fit into the category of mindless fun: at some point, you'll be doing something mechanical, taking the same options as you play essentially the same game over and over again. And it can stop being fun to become boring.As you've noticed, I don't recommend this game. The reason? It simply isn't worth the full cost, and it hinges on your willingness to continue grinding away until the game becomes ""easy enough"" at each of the difficulties you'll be playing in. If the game was somehow grander, most of the clues less redundant and/or less narrowing, or if the ideal strategy wasn't too mechanical to the point of almost making you shut out cognitive thought and forcing you to reacquire it when something immediate happens (such as a very innoportune hitman that once killed triggers the police/mob to want to gun you down), I would have recommended this game because it is, surprisingly, fun to go around poking random stuff for random clues which may or may not be enough to catch the culprit.

												This is a game you'd find for .99cents on the Android App store. I bought it because of the noir and pixel graphics. I expected a game with a tiny bit of depth and fun. I got neither. It's simply unsatisfying. It's mindless searching and collecting clues. You can walk through without reading anything, collect all the items, grab a bite to eat because the developers wanted to slightly distract you from the mindlessness, and then pick a target.Big disappointment. This isn't noir.			"

												Procedurally generated Clue or Guess Who.  That's a simple way to put it.Find the culprit in a set amount of time.  Travel the map, touch all the things that are touchable.  Things in the environment might yield items, clues or money.  NPCs will either say something irrelevant to your progress, give you a clue or sell you something.Once you've collected enough clues, you check your handy-dandy detective book and do some good ol' fashioned detecting.  All clues you've collected tell you two POSSIBLE things about the killer.  Maybe they're in the ""mob"" or a ""civilian"", an artist or a PC gamer, a man or a gender-fluid teenager.   The more clues, the more chance you have of honing in on the killer.And that's Noir Syndrome's main problem...there's no real challenge to be had.  It's easy to master the game's mechanics in a few sessions and get lost in some of the challenges that reward you with character unlocks (in the form of more starting money, more bullets, more enjoyability, etc.), but it all becomes really boring and repetitive after your tenth playthrough.

												Noir Syndrome is a simple crime-solving game, but a successfully addicting one.  One game takes roughly 10 minutes to play, so you'll find yourself playing a lot and saying, ""Just one more time.""  Admittedly there isn't much variability in the clues you find, but you still need to gather a majority of them in order to nail down the culprit.  There are a number of locations to visit in the city, each with a different 2-D atmosphere of its own.The bonus challenges in each case provide an extra level of depth, and you may sometimes find yourself completely abandoning the main task just to get it done.  The openness of the game is refreshing.  For something short and simple, you never feel hemmed in by restrictions.  If you want to be a criminal instead of solving the case, go ahead.For additional replay value, there are 30 in-game badges earned by accomplishing certain tasks.  Every 3 badges increases your Detective Level which confers permanent bonuses on future playthroughs.  Additionally, you can collect clothing scraps to unlock new costumes.  The costumes themselves are purely cosmetic with no actual benefits, and many of them aren't very impressive, but completionists will want to get them all.One last note: If you are a ""graphics snob"" then stay away.  The game is meant to harken back to 2-D pixelated games of yesteryear, so some modern gamers may be put off by that.			"

												People have written some very long reviews detailing the gameplay mechanics of this title, so I'm not going to waste all our time repeating what the top reviews already say. Cutting to the chase, I enjoy this game. It isn't a complex game, nor is it one that you're likely to play for hours on end. What it offers is a quick, stripped-down murder mystery that you can play through in some spare minutes. Waiting for a file to download, on a teabreak, or just want something to occupy yourself with while waiting for your brain to start working properly, the game gives you a pleasant little diversion for that time. So, don't buy it if you're expecting the indie LA Noir. Buy it if you often need something to fill five or ten minutes.			"

The dinner party mode is insane though, as you're exploring a house where people randomly go homicidal while you're trying to hunt clues and find a culprit.I won't recommend this to everyone, but if you like detective stories or logic puzzles and the freedom to bop around, it's a nice pick up and play game.

Because each game is  randomized, you start from a completely blank slate every time. The clues you pick up can either be case-breaking or completely useless, which is what I find fun. Depending on where you decide to go and what you decide to do in the limited time you have to solve your case, you can find all of the right clues to catch the wrong guy, or vice versa. Its endless fun, the music is great, the style is wonderful, and the gameplay is enjoyable.

												My favourite thing about the game is the music, the composer sure knows how to write a jazz tune. The graphics are relatively simple but that just means you have to use your imagination, which isn't a bad thing in my opinion. I like the sense of progression you get from unlocking in game badges and the bonuses they give you as a result. Another bonus, you don't have to play as a nice P.I. or even bother to investigate at all and just shoot people and hope to get lucky. I haven't yet found the culprit this way but I'm still holding out hope for a lucky headshot to take him/her down. A gripe I have about the game is that if a NPC is on the same zone, hit box, area, etc., that you have to wait, only a few seconds, for them to move without wasting time talking to them. Besides that though I can't find a reason to not like this game.There's also a sense of drama and suspense when you go to a part of town where there's also a hitman after you, especially if you don't know about it. One time I went to the Nightclub, there was a hitman with a person standing between us. The assassin and my character just faced eachother for what felt like minutes, he shot first but only by half a second. Joe or Peter or whatever that poor bystanders name was saved me from failure that run by taking the bullet meant for another. Overall I would recommend if you like casual mystery games, especially if you're a fan of gritty P.I. themed things.			"

												First off, I think this is a better game for phone/tablet than on the computer, so consider that before buying on Steam. That said, on both formats it is a lot of fun.Gameplay consists mainly of picking a location in the town (not randomly generated), then talking to people and searching everywhere there. (You can also shoot people, pick locks to gain access to more areas, buy things, steal things...) Talking adds suspects to your list and sometimes gives other hints; searching finds equipment, cash and clues. Suspects and clues are randomly generated and are added to your notebook; when you think you have figured out who is the murderer is, track them down and arrest them.Its very rogue-like-like; each playthrough may last only 5-10 minutes, but you learn more about the game as you play and can level your character up by earning achievement ""badges"" to get more starting gear and better drops on later games. You don't have to ""win"" a game to get credit towards levelling up. Over time you learn more about the town and where to find food, gear, best places to talk to people or search for clues etc. Some locations are definitely more useful than others.Combat can be entirely avoided (you won't be attacked unprovoked unless on hard mode, even then its avoidable) but is frantic and fun when it happens despite the simple interface. Its definitely NOT the focus of the game, you should be talking to people to get a list of suspects and search for clues. There is other stuff to do in the town too - gamble with the mob or steal their loot, raid the vault in the old fort, etc.The difficulty is entirely player controlled, once you start to level up and figure out where things are, you can start tackling some of the harder achievements and give hard mode a try.One warning: You should remap the default controls and change X for shoot to another key that you can get to quickly, but not press by accident. S works well. I've killed people by accident when trying to press Z.			"

												I've played it over and over again, even though you do the same things again and again, you won't get bored of it. It's so addictive and short to play, it's a nice little game to play during breaks! Also, with the current updates, it's even better!			"

												Upon hearing about the idea of this game, i was intrigued. I bought it on sale and played it a little bit. I was actually a bit relieved when i was shot almost instantly in game because i realized that this wasn't going to be as simple as i thought. Narrowing down the suspects takes some work but it's very fun. There are a lot of little details that keep me playing case after case after case. Very fun as a casual mystery game. definitely one to pick up and play.			"

												Current playhtough has  me enjoying and disliking this game all at the same time. Maybe I am just a terrible detective but I havent been able to find one culprit yet. It's my fourth playthrough and I suppose Im still learning, and none of my LA Noir skills switch over to this one. To me this title has a lot of potential, it's unique, and a very good genre to delve into. But alas, clues feel more of hot/cold, rather than an actual clue, the murderer is always the same brand of murderer known as ""Anubis"" so the procedurally generated world just makes me feel as if Im hoping for the one where all the clues will just be hot, hotter, hottest. It doesn't really feel as if I'm making real connections or anything of the sort. Oh and everytime there's a crime scene, there's nothing to investigate, it's just an empty version of said building. Kinda, well no more like, severly dissapointing. I got this title in a flash sale, so I say let thisgame age some more, before buying into it's tempting design. (Will come back to Edit)			"

												I had high hopes for this game, and while it might possibly be worth it's sale price, I don't recommend it at the full cost.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------     There isn't really any mystery to solve. People are dying, but the clues you can find are rather meaningless, and in the end you need to just guess who is the murderer, (and with as many suspects as there are, it is nearly impossible to correctly choose your suspect). The idea of there being a new ""mystery"" every time is entirely laughable, since it takes place in the same town with what might as well be the same people. While I wouldn't mind this normally, they advertise it as one of their main selling points. On the postive side, the pixel graphics fit the noir style nicely. The music, (however basic is is), also helps set the tone.      Basically, in the end, what we have here is a game of ""Clue"" or possibly even ""Mafia"", just without any deduction or the fun of other people being there to enjoy it with you. I do not recommend it at full price, I'm simply glad that I got it on sale.			"

												Noir Syndrome is a detective game analog to Noir cinema. Its simple graphics and music don't harm the game in anyway, in fact it suits it just fine, but the excessive simplicity of its core mechanics prevent it from being a better game.In the main game mode you have to find who the murder is on a limited set of days. You do this by visiting various places on the city map, going from place to place as you collect evidence and questioning suspects, until you'r ready to point who's the culprit and arrest him. If in paper this sounds interesting, truth is that the gameplay fails to establish any significant connection between you and the game. You basically side-scroll your way through the levels constantly pushing ""Z"" hoping to find any clue or money randomly hidden on the set. Also, the fact that this is a rougelike does little for the game. It doesn't offers enough replay value and, in any way, it compensates for the lack of narrative depth. Still the biggest problem the game faces it's being on PC. If you get it for a portable platform then I think it might be more worth it, but if you plan to play it on PC I say to stay away from it.

												Just play Don't Starve. This game had alot of potential, but the fact that you play as a Uganda refugee really crippled it out the gate. You'll spend more time worrying about the extremely half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥starvation mechanic than you will worrying about who the next victim will be. Even worse is the fact that, despite this game's advertised replayability, you'll just be visting the same 12 or so locations trying to find clues that won't really narrow down your search since none of them seem to narrow down anything down past ""civilian/mobster/police"". Ontop of all of this is the horrible coating of generic indie-dev laziness known as ""retro graphics"". Someone get these guys a color wheel, seriously. There is no redeeming quality about the ""artistic choices"" made here.Good  concept, terrible execution, what the ♥♥♥♥ why is there a starvation mechanic.			"

												A small puzzle game that tries too hard to be something more. The result is something more likely to annoy you than provide entertainment as the added game mechanics either get in your way or allow you to do really basic actions like robbery for a small reward. Not worth the time to play it and I wish there was more effort into developing the gameplay rather than guess the murder to extend your time while baiting people to play more with unlockables.			"

												The game is extremely simplistic and, despite being part of the ""community choice: roguelike"" bundle, it is not a roguelike by any stretch of the imagination (if this is a roguelike, then Pitfall! is a roguelike).You basically click locations on a static map and walk across the screen mashing the Z key like a little monkey (well, okay, mashing it will make your character get ""hungry"" but whatever, food is easily acquired from the same three or four locations and money flows like rain). You are rewarded with either ""suspects"" (if you mash the Z key on top of a NPC and get lucky) or ""clues"" (if you mash the Z key on top of a background element and get lucky). There's really no rhyme or reason to the ""clues"", each one exists as a mere token to narrow down which suspect is the killer - those expecting to piece together a mystery-puzzle on their own will be gravely disappointed. For instance, finding a leather wallet will mean the crook is either a civilian or a cop, but not a mobster. Each new game picks a random culprit and random list of suspects with random professions / affiliations, and some games are going to be unsolvable save through luck (there may be two Male Artists with the Mob, for instance).I was pretty disappointed by how formulaic and - moreover - simplistic the game turned out to be, but for some reason it's strangely addictive - possibly because it doesn't really demand too much of the player. There's no small text to squint over, it doesn't demand lightning reactions or pinpoint hand-eye precision. Games resolve themselves in about ten minutes or so, so it's hardly a timesink either (well, unless you want to unlock the costumes and badges (costumes are self-explanatory, badges give you boosts to ammo/lockpicks/money/hunger-level when starting out). These unlocks are retar­dedly ""priced"", requiring literal DAYS of constant Z-mashing to earn enough stats to eventually unlock).It's definitely not worth full-price, hence the ""no"" recommendation, but for $2 or so you could do a lot worse. Just don't pay $7.00 for it, because at that rate it really is a total ripoff.			"

												The game would be decent if you take the ""starving"" out of it. Dying of hunger while looking for the culprit (or money to buy food) is annoying. You go from full to starving just searching a couple of places. Also, if it takes a whole day to interview a couple people, am I going without sleep? If they skip the need to stop for sleep, they should skip the need to stop for food. It detracts way more than it adds to the game.			"

												A great concept, but sadly not something I can recommend. As others have said, the game just isn't all that fun. You go through the same motions of searching a location and hammering the z button to investigate and then periodically going to buy food for each case, and because the murders and evidence are randomly generated, there isn't really any depth to the story.It can be interesting to play through once or twice, and the idea of a randomly generated murder mystery is awesome, but the mechanics for solving each case are a little too simple. The ""Dinner Party"" level is a little more interesting, but there's not much to bring you back after you've completed it.			"

												The amount of randomness in this game hurts it. I have been in situations where I have all the clues and cannot find someone to give me proper suspects. Even worse is that you can be in a situation where there are two equally valid choices. The clues only narrow down gender, affiliation (police, civilian, or mobster), and potential job. I've had it where two characters had the exact same characteristics. The game is too heavily based on luck with the only option to actually figure out who the person might be is through spending a large amount of cash on the mobster tip option. Finding the culprit within a short amount of time is nearly impossible. The game also makes a big deal about ""those who are dead, stay dead."" What that means is that if there are a string of murders, you're suspect list might get shorter but in the multiple games I've played, has had almost no effect. Everything resets when you start a new case, so that means they don't really stay dead. They're just not there on that case. Ultimately the main game is not worth much except maybe a few tries if this goes on a heavy sale. Even at the relatively cheap price, you're paying too much. I will admit the mansion minigame that gets unlocked once you luckily solve one case is a bit more fun. In that, you have the full suspect list and have to find the clues. You also have to worry about the people in the mansion temporarily going insane and trying to kill you. The same issue of multiple suspects meeting the exact sime criteria for the clues unfortunately hurts even this fun mode. You also have to worry about the failure state induced by killling the actual murderer rather than arresting them. So, the game is good in concept and maybe a couple playthroughs in concept but is not worth the full price they want.			"

												I already knew what was going to happen when i bought this game- but i let my curiosity get the better of me... A detective game that randomizes clues, victims and suspects just sounded really intriging, but that's also the source of every single fault with the game. Noir Syndrome is a perfect example of all the Cons of random generation: 1) its simplified down to just 3 aspects of the murderer, and the clues needed to pin some one are entierly unrelated to ""crime scenes"", thier intent, or thier life- you can find them just lying around any where after pressing the ""Z"" button enough times as you walk around, and finding a clue does not lead you to another. ""WOW, found dress shoes at the church? thats a clue. the killer must be a dancer or driver""2) the generator is borked. for the main game i havent had an issue other then being unable to find useful clues or suspects to accuse, but cranking up the difficulty or playing the extra""dinner Party"" mode has given me times where 2 or more suspects are the same in every way, even in name. that right thier is a deal breaker. http://cloud-3.steampowered.com/ugc/3278934346172286700/67CE738813FDDDE7923EB4754657E10BD121DFC8/ when the only diffrence between people is thier occupation, gender, and mob/cop/civilian faction, its unexceptable to allow 2 people to have all 3 in common.3) unrefined difficulty curve. the solution to the game is the same every time. you find 5 clues, and gather as complete a suspect list as you are able- then look over your ""clues"" for something like ""is civillian or Mobster"" AND ""is Mobster or Cop"" to find some one to fit the bill. the only restriction is hunger. every time you act you loose invisible food points, and you can starve. so in higher difficulties you need to first get money for food... which wouldnt be bad- things get more expensive and some factions are already willing to gun you down on sight, so you have more reason to sneak around, Steal or shoot first. that'd make the game worth it if you didnt also loose hunger points for TALKING to FoodVendors and using doors. thats dumb. you shouldnt get penalized for walking in/out, buying food, or talking to the  same person multiple times if you only get new information the first.4) poor convayance. it took me a while to notice that the locations actually have a functionality besides just being  were events happen. you usually get a notice each ""day"" that something of interest is happening at a location- Mob TakeOver, PoliceZone, social hub, crime scene... you can only tell what each means by going there several times (crimeScenes have No npc's, Mob takeover's have only mob members there that day), and just because it's flashy doesnt have any impact over how usfull it is- ie, if you are looking for a male Mobster chef, the game doesnt do much to inform you that asking mob members nets you More mob suspects... or nets you more NON-Mob suspects. you cant tell, and you wouldnt just roam around learning about each location's specific resources unless you are directed there by an event.given that information, How much did you enjoy Clue? becuase until some of that stuff is fixed this is all its good for. it saddens me that this could have been something really worth replaying on higher difficulties, but ugh... no.

""WOW, found dress shoes at the church? thats a clue. the killer must be a dancer or driver""2) the generator is borked. for the main game i havent had an issue other then being unable to find useful clues or suspects to accuse, but cranking up the difficulty or playing the extra""dinner Party"" mode has given me times where 2 or more suspects are the same in every way, even in name. that right thier is a deal breaker. http://cloud-3.steampowered.com/ugc/3278934346172286700/67CE738813FDDDE7923EB4754657E10BD121DFC8/ when the only diffrence between people is thier occupation, gender, and mob/cop/civilian faction, its unexceptable to allow 2 people to have all 3 in common.3) unrefined difficulty curve. the solution to the game is the same every time. you find 5 clues, and gather as complete a suspect list as you are able- then look over your ""clues"" for something like ""is civillian or Mobster"" AND ""is Mobster or Cop"" to find some one to fit the bill. the only restriction is hunger. every time you act you loose invisible food points, and you can starve. so in higher difficulties you need to first get money for food... which wouldnt be bad- things get more expensive and some factions are already willing to gun you down on sight, so you have more reason to sneak around, Steal or shoot first. that'd make the game worth it if you didnt also loose hunger points for TALKING to FoodVendors and using doors. thats dumb. you shouldnt get penalized for walking in/out, buying food, or talking to the  same person multiple times if you only get new information the first.4) poor convayance. it took me a while to notice that the locations actually have a functionality besides just being  were events happen. you usually get a notice each ""day"" that something of interest is happening at a location- Mob TakeOver, PoliceZone, social hub, crime scene... you can only tell what each means by going there several times (crimeScenes have No npc's, Mob takeover's have only mob members there that day), and just because it's flashy doesnt have any impact over how usfull it is- ie, if you are looking for a male Mobster chef, the game doesnt do much to inform you that asking mob members nets you More mob suspects... or nets you more NON-Mob suspects. you cant tell, and you wouldnt just roam around learning about each location's specific resources unless you are directed there by an event.given that information, How much did you enjoy Clue? becuase until some of that stuff is fixed this is all its good for. it saddens me that this could have been something really worth replaying on higher difficulties, but ugh... no.

												My expectations were low. I left disappointed.The entire game is nothing more than incredibly drawn-out version of a single line of an incredibly easy sudoku puzzle, or a game of minesweeper on easy mode.Every single mission amounts to repeating the same simple steps over and over, while praying to the RNG.1. Go to social gatherings. Talk to everyone to fill up your suspect list, examine everything else for resources. Buy stuff if you're low on resoucres. (All of these actions can be done by basically holding down right+z)2. Go to crime scenes and suspicious areas. Examine everything to fill up your clue list.3. Cross-refence to see if the clue-list and suspect list match up with only one possible action.4. Repeat until game is over, either through victory by getting the right information in time.That is literally everything to the game. The rest of the mechanics are near worthless.Starvation? Eating once gives you enough food to survive until the final day.Factions? Literally just ""don't go to this area right now or you will die"".Combat? If you need to use combat, you've already lost. It's basically impossible to recover from, and it causes your score to plummet so far that there's nearly no reason in continiung.Story? Literally completely nonexistent. All character names are completely random, and every single killer has the motivation of ""I'm doing it for Anubis. Don't ask why.""You don't get to examine bodies, you don't get to examine clues.Here, you know what? I'll just give you the game for free, right here:Anything I list here is completely true (assuming the game doesn't glitch out and give the wrong information, as it does a lot, and there's nothing you can do but just eat the loss. And, yes, the developer has admitted that this is a glitch, not some really stupid ""feature"". Though, I wouldn't be surprised if it was added into the patch notes as a feature in later updates, considering how lazy this is- the developer made ZERO effort to hide the fact that it's a poorly-ported version of a cell phone game.)Clue- Civilian or MobsterClue- Civilian or Police OfficerClue- Dancer or DriverClue- Dancer or ChefClue- MaleSuspect (Civilian)- Joe (Dancer)Suspect (Mobster)- Bill (Driver)Suspect (Police)- Bob (Chef)Suspect (Civilan)- Jessica (Artist)Did you figure out that the killer was Joe? Good job! Now you don't need to waste your money on this garbage.			"

												This game is impossible to beat even on normal mode. You have no idea what to do when you jump right into it even after doing the tutorial. There's supposed to be clues that point you to the murderer but all that I got is pieces of junk by seraching randomly. Also, the controls are ridiculous solely because they put the 'fire gun' button right next to the 'examine item' button. For some reason you can starve to death in this game even though It's not a survival game, It's a mystery-solver. I tried playing dinner-party mode which I think may have been working out except at random times people would just shoot me and I die instantly. I kind of reccomend this game if you want to figure it out because It is a nice game. It's just so confusing.			"

												This isn't really a mystery game at all.  You just wander around the city and search for clues.  They are distributed completely at random.  Eventually you'll get enough clues to know who the murderer is.  That's it.  You don't have any real choices to make.  Just keep walking and hit the Z key to search every time you go past an object.  It doesn't matter what building you're in, where in the building you are, or who is there with you.A lot of effort seems to have been put into making this look stylish and trendy, but under the surface there's just no gameplay.

												I found this game a little too challenging. Often I'd run out of time before I'd met everyone, or I'd find I had missed a crucial bit of evidence that means I couldn't properly identify the killer. The tutorial is too basic and doesn't really cover off the more detailed aspects of the gameplay. If you don't search a crime scene immediately, it's gone for good. You get the same answers from potential suspects and their accusers which doesn't really give anything away. I wouldn't recommend this to the casual gamer.			"

												Nice idea but badly executed.After not even playing for one hour I think if seen the whole game. You run around trying to find clues which seem to be randomly placed around the city. You talk to npcs to add them to your list of suspects and to get a pointer to a location where you can find more clues. Suspects have a faction, gender, job,... Clues help you find the killer by narrowing each attribute down. For example:One clue might tell you it is either a Dancer or a Tailor, another clue might say either Police or Mobster.... you get the idea.The cases don't have a story or require logical thinking, A lot of times it is just a matter of being in the right place at the right time. There is also no case specific scenery e.g. crime scenes. You just go to the same static places and click investigate and hope to find a clue there.  Their ""Permanent choices"" selling point is also kind of joke considering that each case takes only around 10 mins and then you land back on the main menu and the city resets.			"

												I guess it's a neat gimmick, but there isn't much there. There's two gamemodes, the regular gamemode where you have to get suspects and clues to find the murderer, and dinner party, where you have all the suspects, need clues, and the suspects will go mad and try to kill you from time to time. It's fun, but I find that the gap between difficulties is a bit boggling. Normal difficulty is hardly challenging, with you being able to solve cases in literal minutes if you move fast. But on hard it's a pain to juggle not starving, getting clues, and getting suspects all at the same time. After what I experienced in hard, I haven't touched impossible, as it probably lives up to the name. You can complete challenges and collect badges for doing stuff in game, but it gets old kind of fast, and once you've done all that stuff, it's down to collecting hundreds of pieces of costume scraps, of which there are only a small handful of styles. And once that's done, well, there isn't really anything else to do. But as a quick little pick up and play game or a collectathon, it does pretty good.			"

												A lot of detective games (as if that is a thing) struggle with the concept of replayability. You can't keep solving the same case forever. Noir Syndrome is a Rogue-Like at heart. It's random nature lets you constantly play and its different every time. The fact it's very simple to play too helps and it's really fun to just throw yourself into, even if you fail. House Party mode is hell though. You are locked into a house with a killer, seems easy enough but the people inside will go crazy and start shooting till they calm down. As such, it becomes a race to solve this before you get shot. I really wish i could have got the soundtrack though. The mixture of Noir trumpets and classic jazz themes mixed with 8-bit charm is fantastic to me. :) For the price, you will be hard pressed to find a better detective game. (It's better then Murdered - Soul Suspect anyway)			"

												I was pretty excited when I first heard about the game, mainly because a procedurally generated noir-detective game sounded amazing (still, it is an awesome idea). However, I can't say that the game lives up to my expectations. I could have tolerated the fixed map/places (only the culprit and clues are generated), but the gameplay is too dry and shallow. It plays like this, choose a place, go there and press z and collect clues (which mostly don't make sense,for example you can find a fingerprint on a paint that wasn't even in the crime scene and claim that fingerprint belongs to the murderer), then go to another one do the same etc etc. No dialogues, little room for thinking,good but limited soundtrack. I don't have any problem with pixel art graphics (I can even say that I'm biased in favor of them) but the ones in the game just don't have that ""art""y quality. Well, I don't regret buying this game as I still think this is an interesting theme and I'm happy to support the developer, and it is not completely dull either, but still it lacks depth and content, so mind that when you are buying it.
