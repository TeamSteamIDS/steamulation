												Oh boy, a review!I saw this game on PS4 and decided to wait out the PC port, as that'd get more mileage. It's basically a neat little mash-up of Dark Souls & Castlevania (or a ""Metroidvania"")! I mean, that's how I went in to it and that's what I got. It definitely scratches all the right itches, if that's up your alley.So, when folks say it's a Dark Souls-like, there helps explain some mechanics quickly:-There's a stamina bar-There are ""bonfires""-You get ""Estus flasks"". Don't worry about needing to grind for healing stuff if you're in a rough patch-Level-ups are governed by ""souls"" (referred to as ""salt"" in this)-Movesets are very similar. ie, parrying, rolling, choosing to two-hand a weapon, etc-Equip load controls and limits your movement and rolling/tumbling/flopping ability-It's easy to die. Things hurt. They also don't really like you?? It's very rudeThe Castlevania vibe comes from a few things. Largely because it's 2D, but I think the label also applies itself because this is a 2D world with lots of vertical movement. Y'know, scaling several ""screens"" and stuff.It's a fresh world, though! Story is given through item descriptions (DRINK UP THAT ~~LORE~~, FOLKS), as well as very sparse NPCs. Salt is also a heavy item of reference, as you will quickly find. The primary use? For leveling. Now, there are primary stats in this, but they are tied to/governed by a skill tree/web. Think FFX's sphere-grid and there you go.""Choose this to learn how the hell to use a hammer. It also gives you a point of strength.""""This icon has a horse. It also gives you endurance for some reason""The game itself is rather lightweight and looks wonderful in spite of this (~500mb at the time of release). I will say that the character faces look... Bad. I just gave my dude shaggy hair and a gigantic beard to cover it up. The Grizzly Adams look worked well until I found a hat.One thing I will mention, though, is that the game doesn't *tell you* much. Like, I get that it's the ""Dark Souls Thing,"" but remember the Estus-equivalent (red potions in this)? For example, from what I'd seen so far, the game never tells/shows you that your little red potions are refilled at sanctuaries. I died at a boss, thought I wasted them, and noticed I had gained them back.Anyhow, it's a good game so far! I recommend it if the above appeals to you!			"

												I'm no expert at games like this, and obviously I haven't put that many hours into the game yet since I just got it. However, I will try to explain why I fell in love with this game at first sight (from an analytical point of view).Side note: I'll be honest, I was reluctant to buy this at first simply due to the price and even found myself regretting the decision once I opened up that CC menu, but it was indeed worth it and I'll explain why later.At first glance this game doesn't look like much. Just another dumb 2d flash game, right? That's what I thought. The first time I loaded up the game as a knight I wasn't expecting the damn near perfect swinging animations from my sword. Almost every good thing about this game took me by surprise. I was blown away by the amount of production value and time and effort that's just so apparent in every corner in the first few starting areas. THE COMBAT The combat is lovely and fluid and beautiful. It's everything I could ask for in a hack and slash rpg because unlike in Dark Souls you can perform Air Combos and finish off with a powerful downward strike which obliterates your enemies into a mesmerizing spray of red liquid. The enemy/boss ai works well to keep you on your toes and wastes no time punishing your mistakes and trying to put you in inconvenient positions. I got ♥♥♥♥ed up several times by The Sodden Knight (First boss)yet, had I known that you could roll that probably wouldn't have happened quite as much.LEVEL DESIGNVerticality is a must in 2d plat formers like SaS and it goes all out with the vast amount of detail packed into every area and the subtle creaks and croaks of old, moldy wood as you step on a board that may even give away underneath you due to pressure. The pick ups and drops are all easily attainable and don't divide into the action too much with long, tedious 'bend-over' animations. For once the developers decided to make it less of a fetching task to retrieve your lost currency (in this case 'Salt') in a Souls game. And, they did it by making a beast out of your salt which you have to kill every time you want to get your salt back. Otherwise, if you die again, as suspected, you permanently lose those piles of salt you worked so hard to attain and have to start all over from 0. Luckily to retrieve salt from a boss you don't have to kill him all the way. Just take his health down to a certain point.SOUND DESIGNSound is a wonderful thing in this game, any game for that matter. It adds to the authenticity of being able to imagine these places. Hearing things adds levels of atmosphere to a setting. The rapid splashes of rain and mist and the sound of wind blowing through grassy fields gives the game that flavour; sells the vibe. I can't wait to get back into the world every time I hear that, it's amazing.The music on the otherhand, even if there's little of it, is pretty good. Although it's very minimalist music, the background ost does well to add some tension throughout the areas you encounter. The boss fights are all made very epic with the addition of those fantastic chords. I believe there are like 2 boss fight tracks and 2 background tracks: In total 4 songs which shouldn't be too much of a problem given that the rest of the game is a masterpiece.ART/VISUAL DESIGNLast but not least we have the visuals. As I mentioned before, the visual effects of the blood spraying look absolutely mesmerizing. Some other visually stunning achievements would be the heat distortion near the torch flames and what not. It's always the little things like that which get my attention. Also, despite the mildy childish and cartoonish look of the world and it's characters, there is a certain level of realism to it all and I've come to like that a lot about it. Especially in the darkest areas is where the game's art direction can really stand out. It's so unique and interesting.All in all this game is great because it was made well. A couple of glances on the surface don't mean much with gameplay this brilliant it will definitely have you hooked for hours no matter what your experience with rpg's is. I did my best to try and avoid references to Dark Souls and the like. Now I should probably stop typing because I've been typing this review for about an hour and a half now and I have exams.			"

Basic InfosGameplay lengh: 14 - 28 Hours per regular Playthrough if you do not seek to speedrunRequired Skill Level: Low to Medium (New Game) to Very High (New Game+ mode)This game is not suited for audiences 16 years or lower - some Blood and Gore, comic-esque physical and psychological crulityAbout this gameSalt and Sanctuary is a rather unique game. You play a Hero of your choice, who got stranded on an strange isle seeking to find his/hers lost princess. However, as always, things do not seem to be the way they are.Story wise, this game is rather cryptic, this doesn't make the appeal of the game less interesting. It is very important to read item descriptions sometimes, though you can easily finish this game without being too much into this games lore so you don't need to be bothered about it all the time. This game is also for those who just enjoy quick action as it is for those who enjoy a very thoughtful and deep gameplay experience alike. This works thanks to the excellent layout of the World the game happens to be in, which is structured like a Maze of sorts.And This labyrinth like Gameworld is, in my opinion, the best thing about this game. Walking around, finding the right place to progress further is a ton of fun. This is partially because on how connected the Gameworld is, paths previously blocked by an obstacle open up to the player later via unique Traits, which you get by many of the interesting NPCs that roam the world. These Traits let you change, for instance, the gravity of the player character which enables you to walk on ceilings, though only at certain places. Imagine fighting enemies from the ceilings with a bow or with a big melee weapon. ""Coolness"" is certainly written big in this game.GameplayAfter you've choosen the Gender, decided on a class to play and changed the looks on the Character, you will be thrown into the game world. Tutorials are there, but its only explaining the controls and which they do, the rest is up to the player to find out.This game does have very fast paced Hack and Slash gameplay if you use smaller/weaker weaponry, or the slower and more thoughtful one if you carry Heavy Warhammers. Logically, the bigger the weapon, the stronger the impact. This game makes no exception of this.Fighting itself is rather simple, as you only have a Strong and a Weak attack. However, depening on what attack you choose, you can make combos. Beside that you can also quick-switch weapons with the press of a button. Imagine throwing your enemy into the air with greatsword and then using a bow to kill your foe while its in the air. You can do that in this game and it is tons of fun.Besides attacking, you can also use a Shield to block attacks or use a dodgeroll to roll past the enemies. As this is a 2d Platformer this seems a bit unusual at first, but the games Dodgeroll is balanced enough that it didn't bother me to dodgeroll through enemies. It also looks more aesthetically pleasing as you might think.However, this game isn't exactly forgiving as I make it seem to be. Some parts are quite tough to beat and it required from me to attempt certain parts a few times before I mastered them. If difficult games are too stressful you should still consider to purchase this game regardless, since the difficulty in general is just rightly choosen, there aren't many points in this game where the game flow stagnates and frustration kicks in, all in all the entire game was a breeze to play through. However, if certain enemies are too strong for you, you can upgrade your Weapons and Armor at a Blacksmith, where you can use your Salt as a currency to upgrade them. Besides your Salt, which you will also use to level up, you will also use ""regular"" currency to buy regular items, such as Torches. You will need those to traverse the dark caverns of this game, which there are a ton of. You get both Salt and Gold by defeating enemies. The usual video game logic applies, the stronger the enemy, the bigger the reward. Often enough, you will find yourself being a bit overwhelmed by the enemy, as you are not a Tough Hero and will die if a Strong enemy unsuspectingly attacks you a few times. So you often need to go to a Sanctuary to recover.Sanctuaries, the other namedrop, are your Safe Spots, where noone can do you harm and those are the places where you can fill up your healing potions and where you can level up and assign Skill Points to your character. Most Sanctuaries are hidden and must be found and claimed by the player first, which adds a bit of an exploration aspect in this game.As I already wrote, Sanctuaries are used to Level Up your Hero. What makes it interesting though is that leveling up is done in a similar way to Final Fantasy X but on a Spiderweb-like board, where you can access certain skills only if you have leveled up the connected points leading before it. Otherwise you have to choose other skills to reach the stuff you want. There are also items which let you remove your already placed skill points so you can replace them on another place if you believe that you made a mistake. Be careful with this though, sometimes you realize that the mistake your made was actually the right thing to do.There are 12 different Weapon Classes, such as normal Swords, Staffs, Bows, Spears and Lances, Scyths (yay!), Crossbows and even Guns. Theres more than just these of course. All and all I say theres about 500 - 700 unique Items and Equipment you can get in this game. Theres also a lot of Magic skills you can use, such as making the ground on fire or cast Lightning, if you rather fancy this. This type of skilling leads to some interesting ""what would happen, if..."" type of scenarios if you decided what to skills you want to pick on next.Multiplayer is also included with the game, but only be played out on a Local setting, so make sure you have a Friend to play with!Graphics and SoundGraphically this game is very excellent, even though it is no cutting edge 3D game. The characters all look lovely and the Monsters are detailed very metriculously. You can be sure that even regular Monsters look all very destinctive and unique. Theres a little less then 100 different Monstertypes in this game, including about 25 unique bosses. The lightning is by far the best about the Graphics as they nail the Atmosphere about this game splendidly. The games grim setting and colorful lightning just synergizes very well with one another, as it is already evidential by the screenshots on this games Store page.While everything about this game is to the very least great, including the sound effects, I found that the Music is pretty lackluster. Even if its very Atmospheric and fitting throughout the game, after you heared a certain theme like 30 times things can get a little bit boring.The game also has some slight graphical errors, such as weirdly placed walls, which shift depending on where you stand, creating a weird uncanny valley optical illusion of walls that seem to move unreasonably in places and tiny open holes where you can look right through the void, even though there should be a room right behind it. These issues are barely noticeable but regardless they are there if you pay attention.VerdictMy, is this game lovely! Even if its just jumping on platforms, this games world makes it so there is always something interesting and challenging to see and do, with a ton of beasts to slay and a ton of loot to find.And even regardless of those tiny issues previously mentioned, Salt and Sanctuary is, without any doubt, the best 2d Platformer and Action Adventure game I have ever played and a definite must buy for everyone who likes these type of games.Recommended food while playingChicken and Potatos with Chili Sauce, but Apple Juice instead of Mineral Water. No Alcoholic drinks this time.			"

												This is the first game that's not a ""Souls"" game that has me hooked. I was gonna write an elaborate review on Salt and Sanctuary, but I thought this might be better:I play nothing but Souls games. I might take an interest in some other game for a while. BUT I never finish em or I loose interest. That might be boring of me, but whatever. When I played Dark Souls 1 back in 2012 it had me hooked. I also bought Demon's souls and really loved that too. Those two Souls games were all I played. I played them till my ps3 died and then thank the gods, Dark Souls came to PC so I got it on Steam. I played that till Dark Souls 2 came out. Then after all the DLCs and things were done, I also bought a PS4 JUST so I could play Bloodborne. Then I bought the Scholar edition of Dark souls 2 and played the crap out of that till Dark Souls 3.Salt and Sanctuary is the Best thing I've played since Dark Souls. I love the weapons, the combat, the bosses and the great locations. It's familiar enough to jump right in and start cracking skulls, while being different enough to be fresh.  If the Souls games are your ""thang"" then just buy this and Praise the salt.			"

												REVIEW FROM A DARK SOULS PLAYER!PROS- Game is difficult and challenging (which is what we aim for on those types of games)- Message System (like the message signs from Souls, those are pretty helpful for newcomers)- Gameplay feels good, the game feels smooth.- Even though you'll die alot, you'll still have fun because the game is pretty fun.- Awesome price for this great game- Cool and smooth combo system- Unique ""Powers"" (Called Brands in the game) that makes the game feel more unique- STR is Broken just like Dark Souls 1- Each boss has a new different moveset or skill when it goes down to x %hp, which complicates the fight. (also called Boss Phases)CONS- R.I.P Online Multiplayer (There's no online multiplayer, that would be awesome!)- You'll get lost easily at your first playthrough, the game will literally shove you into the world and you'll need to find the places by yourself, with some NPC tips. It's even worse than blind Dark Souls playthroughs.- Some bosses/enemies feels unfair, no counter-play, if you try to roll behind them, their attack will reach you even if you're behind (Looking at you, Kraekan Wyrm you ♥♥♥♥ing piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥I've already played 40 hours by the time i'm doing this review and the game still pretty fun! So i think i'll give it a 8.5/10!			"

												Salt & Sanctuary is Dark Souls 2D with a dash of Castlevania. If you like Dark Souls, I don't see why you wouldn't at least somewhat like Salt & Sanctuary but if you're looking for a pure ""Metriodvania"" this game will disappoint, because the game is much more Souls than ""Vania"". The combat combo system is awesome. Different button combinations produce different attack animations making combat fun and kinda like a ""beat-em-up"". S&S has alot of different weapons and armors, all upgradable, and a very cool level progression system sorta like Dark Souls but includes a massive skill tree. S&S also has a message system like DS, where you can create and read messages from other players.      S&S is very easy at first, even the first boss is weak (not the impossible boat boss), it gradually gets harder, then I experienced a huge difficulty jump when I visited ""Castle of Storms"", which was rather frustrating. I put the game down for awhile because of it. I would have liked to see multi directional attacks as well, as you can only attack left and right=old castlevania style. I would have also liked weapon and armor drops from enemies like in DS, but its not there, enemies drop loot sometimes, just not weapons and armors. Overall I do like S&S. Its not near as good as the Souls series and a ""Metroidvania"" it is not, but it is a wonderful game if you like Souls and 2D side-scrolling action and its unique for that very reason, its 2D Souls! If you don't like the Souls series, you would want to pass on this game as it borrows too heavily from it, not bringing enough originality to the table, nor does it bring game changing mechanics to the 2D action-plat genre.I'd rather play DS 3 atm, but I do recommend this game, I highly recommend it when it goes on sale and after you have gotten your DS 3 fix.

												This game is a master piece, 95%.I finished it twice on the PS4, and these are my grievances:1. You don't keep your traversal skills in NG+2. Only few weapon types are really competitive3. Not a big fan of the human character modelsPositive points:1. Beautiful art style of enemies and environments2. SO much to explore. Think first half of DS2.3. Exploring the world feels really rewarding4. Combat is surprisingly crisp and fluid5. Music, if somewhat repetitive, sounds AWESOME6. Diverse and fun boss battles7. Really impressive, depressing atmosphere8. Interesting talent tree, loads of spells, items, upgrades, just an all around treatSome of the ways in which this is 'Soulslike':- Combat strongly tied to a fast depleting and replenishing stamina bar- Blocking, parrying, rolling for damage avoidance and mitigation- Different fighting styles based on the weapon of choice- Punishing difficulty based on risk-reward mentality- Open world in the vein of DS1 that facilitates progress through shortcuts- Multi-phase boss battles- Fluid class system for diverse character builds- Salt system is a carbon copy of how Souls work- Gritty an dark atmosphere, a loose plot and a rich lore			"

												This game was made by two people.  That's it.  So keep that in mind when I tell you that it's the best indie game I have ever played.  And please ignore my listed 20 hours with it, I have nearly eighty more of offline playtime clocked.This game has all the old school charm of a Metroid or Castlevania style game, loving crafted artwork, and the asthetic in general is incredibly appealing.Combined with tight, genuine platforming mechanics, a crafting system, smooth, lethal combat mechanics, and a skill system that is well beyond what a platformer would normally offer.  And to top it all off?  This game is H.A.R.D.  If you are looking for a challenge, look no further.  I cannot recommend this enough.  It's a genuine challenge so it feels rewarding to succeed, it's a beautiful game with a handcrafted asthetic, and it's a damned good experience for your twenty bucks.  Buy it, and get ready to get salty.			"

												Salt & Sanctuary is a truly remarkable effort by the husband and wife team of Ska Studios. I looked forward to this game for two years since seeing VaatiVidya's alpha footage of it. Now that the game is out, it does not disappoint in the least. Everything that I hoped for is here, and any slight issues with the game just don't stack up when compared to the love and care put into everything else. S&S is Dark Souls combined with Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. That's actually how I described the game to a friend. ""Imagine if every enemy in Symphony of the Night was actually a challenge."" If you're thinking you can play this game like any of the ""Metroidvania"" games out there, remove that misconception from your mind. Every attack must be calculated. Every roll timed perfectly. Your surroundings must be studied and investigated as you progress. Secrets must be sniffed out. And bosses sometimes require a high degree of patience to learn their movesets. This is a side scroller for patient people. Impatience is the bane of any Dark Souls player, and that aspect is 100% shared with Salt & Sanctuary. Clever planning, meticulous gear management, and a sharp eye will get you much farther in this game than a hack and slash attitude. There is an impressive amount of content here considering only two people made it. Tons of weapons, armor, and accessories await you. There is also a respectable spell and miracle system. Some spells require a catalyst to be cast, like a staff or wand. But there is also the incantion variety that can be used from your item menu just like potions or throwables. However, there is an odd elemental imbalance system with spells that basically forces one of your four ring slots to be used up for a specific ring that negates it. Using a specific elemental spell too many times in a row without this ring causes an elemental imbalance that will cause you to take damage if you continue casting. It's an interesting system, but doesn't exactly feel neccessary when it can so easily be negated. The large amount of content also applies to the numerous zones you'll be playing through. There are about 20 zones in the game, and each one has a style all its own. It is commendable that Ska Studios stayed true to the Dark Souls method of interconnecting certain zones like a worm in an apple, but it ultimately proves a little pointless since teleporting on a whim is so easy. Thankfully the devs recognized this and added items next to almost every backtracking gate that can be opened, offering incentive to seek them out. A particularly interesting aspect of S&S to discuss is the bosses. While the majority of them are well designed, I noticed that some of them could be made utterly inconsequential depending on what playstyle or gear I was using. One boss would prove to be trivial on one character while another could be a serious challenge. While ideally it would be best if all bosses could be equally challenging, I believe this is a fair compromise given the limitations of making a boss that is creative both on a gameplay and artistic level. It also goes to ensure that there isn't a most powerful playstyle. No matter what you play, you will eventually hit a challenge wall. (And truly no matter what you play, you will hit a challenge wall when you reach a certain witch on a certain lake. A fight that I am still trying to decide if it's poorly designed or not.)While I would love to say that S&S is a flawless experience, there are a few small issues. For example, in the original Dark Souls, you could accidentally break an NPC story line if you played a section out of order or didn't find that NPC in the next area that it was supposes to be in. The NPC would just vanish from your game and you would have to start a new game if you wanted to finish that story line. That is one of the less appetizing aspects of Dark Souls that somehow made its way into Salt & Sanctuary. Unfortunately, it's even easier to accidentally sequence break in this game and cause an NPC to vanish forever. During my third playthrough, I made sure to use a walkthrough so this didn't happen again. After using said walkthrough, I realized just how easy it would be to mess up and do things out of order. Another issue that is a glaring issue for me is the music. What is here is good, but it was halfway through my second playthrough that I finally turned off the BGM because I couldn't stand listening to those same four guitar chords that play over and over again in sanctuaries. It literally got stuck in my head and I couldn't stand it. Other than that, the game is mostly quiet with the exception of boss fights and a tune that sometimes plays while exploring zones. Although I will concede. The tracks that play during the last 15 to 30 minutes the game are excellent. Perhaps not quite memorable since there's still not much of a melody to them, but they are powerful songs that truly grasp the gravity of the moment.Another issue is the lack of a map. A map in a game like Dark Souls just wouldn't be possible, but this is a 2D plane. There are fan made maps out there that perfectly detail the game, but no map in the actual game. Perhaps the devs thought that a map would break immersion. To an extent I agree with that statement, but you know what else breaks immersion? Having to alt tab out to bring up a fan made map because I can't remember or figure out where to go next. Bottom line, have a map. As I said earlier, these issues are nothing when compared to the sheer scope of accomplishment that Salt & Sanctuary achieves. A married couple set out to make a side scroller inspired by Dark Souls, and they succeeded. I have high hopes for either expansions to the current game, or even a sequel. Salt & Sanctuary is well worth the asking price of $17.99. I do not regret my purchase in the least.			"

												Let's get to the point first and ask if is this game worth about 20 bucks.In my opinion: Yes. I have put more time into this game than into many other high profile games.(Scroll down if you just want to see the pros and cons)If you like Dark Souls you probably already heard about it.And yes, in it's core it's a well done Souls inspired game with a metroidvania platformer getup.It has punishing enemies, covenants (creeds as they are called), souls like currency, a parry/riposte system, variety in armor and weapons(some work even better in 2d), an interesting artstyle and beautiful scenery.There are some differences though.Creeds actively give boni as you level them up, having greater impact on the game than just selling certain spells, weapons or armor. These boni consist out of these as well, but you can also get more healing items, buffs and consumeables. You can choose one out of the later each time you level one creed up by trading in monster drops.Instead of souls you get salt. It's used to level your character, upgrade weapons and create new weapons from monsterdrops. Similar to bossweapons, but here also from common monsters as well. You also receive gold to buy anything elseSpeaking of leveling up: Unlike in Souls games you don't immediatly spend your levels on base stats. But rather receive a black pearl which you put into a Final Fantasy 10 like grid. Here you can spend this pearl for stats and the ability to use weapon and armor types and classes from tier 1 to 5. You have to go down paths to reach the end tier of each. You can put up to three points in each stat. Weapon and armors cost as much as the tier number, tier 5 costs 5 pearls (level ups) however they boost one stat just as much as well. So if you buy the abilty for tier 5 swords you also get 5 strength. You get more out of weapon points than for individual stats.You can also find these black pearls every now and then in the game as well as grey pearls which erase points you spend and then you can rearrange them.Like in Dark Souls 1 (at least in my opinion), once you are able to parry, you can parry any parryable attack by blocking and pressing attack. Either with a shield or 2 handed weapon (I experienced no difference)You can 1 and 2 hand any weapon, 2 handing increases your strength by 50%. Instead of a shield you can use wands, the miracle counterpart and 1handed ranged weapons, like crossbows and guns. The aiming does need time to get used to, though.Some weapon types combine movesets from others. The swordwhip (you guessed it) combines swords and whips for example.You will have no trouble finding armor sets and weapons you like in terms of looks and usabilty, I am sure.I have mentioned the artstyle, I personally love it a lot, but it's a matter of taste so take it with a grain of salt.In combat you will notice that your max health with decrease by taking damage, similar to Dark Souls 2's slow hollowing process and almost copied from Dragon's Dogma.Same thing happens for stamina and focus (which is new) if you fight long enough. However spells and miracles put a much, much greater strain on these. However spell and miracle users unlock special items to remedy this. Down other skills paths might be one point for this. Items to regain max health can only be unlocked by certain creeds, if at all (correct me if I'm wrong)Now what is present in Salt and Sanctuary and not in Dark Souls is the Metroidvania like gameplay.You have one big map, but some areas are restricted by abilities you will unlock by branding through the game.Such as inverting gravity (only for you and by activating certain monoliths), I will not tell you all of them...As you progress through the world, you'll find sanctuaries, save spaces similar to bonfires. By claiming it for your creed you can rest there, level up and upgrade it by offering stone statues. These not only bring npcs to these places, but also give passive buffs to the sanctuary's designated area. And yes, you are always part of a creed. You can freely switch between them, but some might not want to put up with you after you sinned often enough.Spellcasters will recieve elemental imballance, punishing overuse of magic spells (I had no trouble though)There is a multiplayer, you can unlock it by offering a sellsword statue to the sanctuary. You can also engage in to pvp if you want. I will sum things up now:Pro:-It's beautiful in it's own depressing way.-Enemies are punishing-a bestiary, which keeps up with enemies you have slain and which of how many different drops you have gotten...-combat is simple, but simply works-simple combo system for those who can't finish Devil May Cry on harder difficulties ;) -lot's of variety in almost every way-interesting new mechanics adding to combat-Soulslike storytelling in item descriptions and skilltree, as well as some more philosophical and  obvious story-possible to go through the game in not intended ways-Optional bosses-explorering types are usually rewarded-developer still patches it, implementing new languages and correcting mistakes-number of equipable spells (which there are 2 of each for magic and miracles) doesn't need to be increased by spending points, you still have to make the right choices, though-multible endings -Challenge modes, such as hardcore, no healing, no shields, etc.Con-same weapon types all handle the same, some might be faster some slower, that's it-some types as a whole are uninteresting (imo). I have no desire to play with daggers for example.-you have to consciously decide not to level up to avoid overleveling (I always feel to strong on NG)-while some bosses provide a good challenge at least on NG, others just fall flat...-some enemies have gripping attacks, they are usually pretty strong and are sometimes unavoidable and feel cheap-ambushes might feel cheap too, as some enemies can just appear without warning, always at the same places, though-some shortcuts from different areas make no sense-by teleporting to a sanctuary guide, you can teleport to any sanctuary you visited. Imo he should be tweakedOverall verdict:If you can overlook some shortcomings, you can get your money's worth.I am glad I picked it up after forgetting it was released for quite some time and gladly get back to it every now and then.

												Great game. One caveat. Since it's a Dark Souls style game, death has relatively big consequences here. It is also a 2D platformer with pretty hardcore platforming sections. Endless pits, invisible platforms, moving platforms, timed platforms, enemies that can knock you back in the air making you fail a jump... whole 9 yards. If you're not good with this kind of stuff, this particular combination will burn your nerves out with rage. Beware.			"

												THIS GAME IS NOT FOR EVERYONE!!!Reading the reviews people have put on here I agree with some but most of them are the persons fault. Yes the game pretty much made a 2d Dark Souls but it's still good.    -Controls-Yes this games controls are odd and the timing is not perfect. There is a slight delay in jumping which will cause troubles when it comes to platforming (which causes a lot of early game deaths) but it's something you will adjust to without realizing it.    -Bosses and Enemies-Most of the bosses have♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off but they are still fair you just need to learn the moves. Unlike Dark Souls where you have a whole 360 degrees  to dodge around the bosses the 2d makes it a lot harder to dodge but they balance it out by giving you a faster dodge. The normal enemies can be a pain most of the time but just like bosses after you learn there moves they are easy.(Besides those unicorn ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, I hate them with a passion.)    -Getting lost-The one I have seen people complained the most about besides controls is getting lost and backtracking. This is a metroidvania game, you are ment to get lost and backtrack. This game will not hold your hand when you need to figure out where to go and will not tell you when to backtrack but it will drop small hints here and there.    -Game Mechanics-The game pretty much tells you what you need to know but just like Dark Souls there are hidden game mechanics that they won't tell you about and neither will I.If you can get past odd controls, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bosses and enemies, getting lost , backtracking, and hidden mechanics then you will like this game.

A game made by husband and wife and a love child of the Soulsborne and Metroidvania gamesDeveloper: Ska StudiosPublisher: Ska StudiosRelease Date: May 17th, 2016If you know me then you know that I absolutely love games such as Castlevania, Metroid, Ori and the Blind Forest and so on. In other words: Metroidvanias. Those games just have their rather unique charm. You’re not limited by a linear story-line nor are you unable to visit certain location whenever you want. Those games take place on a huge overworld that you can explore to your heart’s desire.Also you’d know that I absolutely love the Soulsborne games. Demon’s Souls was one of the best and finest gaming experiences I’ve had not only on the Playstation 3 but during my entire gaming career and I’m around since the NES age (for better or for worse … oh well).You’re thrown into a world without any guidance or help and everything’s able to kill you and ruin your day. Not to mention the whole souls system. Without souls, which drop on death (and vanish for good if you die again), you’re unable to do anything in the Souls game since you need those in order to level up, buy and upgrade items and so on.So some games feature a skill tree but this game features a tree of skill. Same thing just with a better name. Basically you'll find items like black pearls which let you, after you've spend quite a bit of salt in order to level up, learn a skill. There are skills such as increase strength, dexterity or will. You also find that you can increase your main heal item by one or learn to wear better armor. Weapons and armors do have classes ranging from one to five and you have to learn the right skill in order to be able to equip a class five weapon or armor.Grey pearls you find randomly through the game and those act as erasers meaning you can choose to forget one skill. Haven't used it myself yet but I figure it comes in quite handy if you happen to learned a skill by accident.So a love child between Metroidvania and Souls would be the absolute blessing and here’s where Salt and Sanctuary comes in: It IS that love child.If you’re wondering what Salt and Sanctuary is about well … the name says it all. More on that later.But beware … the salt is real. What is Salt and Sanctuary?It’s the bomb. It’s the best thing that happened to gaming, in my eyes, in a long time. Also it’s about Salt and … Sanctuaries. I’ll explain in a jiffy.Salt and Sanctuary is rather unique in the way it approaches the usual Metroidvania. You’re not running from point A to B in order to find certain items or upgrades. Instead you do those things just as you do in the Souls games. That means that you’ve to kill and slay enemies in order to get salt which you then use to level up your character or to upgrade your gear for example.However if you do die you lose all your salt, just like in the Soulsborne games. However there’s one difference; If an enemy has killed you then you have to go back and slay your killer in order to regain your salt. If you died because you thought it might be a good idea to listen to one of those bottles and jump off that cliff you’ll encounter a specific enemy on the location of your death and if you kill it then the salt is yours again.


Smiles ... I guess the red kind by the looks of it

I mentioned Bottles right? So remember those messages in the Soulsborne games on the ground? I mean the Praise the Sun! or Beware of ambush. Exactly. Those Bottles are messages written by either players. Most of the time it’s useful information like Secret ahead and so on but then there’s also stuff like the aforementioned jump of that cliff. So it’s up to you whether or not you decide to listen to those.Sanctuaries belong a to a particular CreedRight after you’ve arrived on the beach you’re greeted by a dude with some questions and depending on your answers you’ll join a certain Creed. Covenants anyone?

It doesn’t matter which Creed you belong to you’ll always be able to rest at another Creed’s Sanctuary. Unless you’ve managed to turn them hostile.The job of the Sanctuaries are basically to give you a brief moment to catch your breath and to stock up on levels and items. Also you flasks err I mean your main healing items recharge whenever you visit a Sanctuary. Each Creed has it’s own version but they all work the same.During your quest you’ll find certain stones. Merchant, Leader and so on. Once you reach a Sanctuary you can make an offering by selecting from those stones. Depending on your choice you’ll summon certain NPCs like a merchant or a blacksmith. You can also offer a leader stone in order to summon a Leader of your Creed. You can trade in specific items in order to raise your devotion. Raising your devotion will give you extra items each time you respawn or rest at a Sanctuary of your Creed.Then there’s also Sin. If you decide to leave your Creed in order to join another you gain sin.You can be absolved of your sin by paying a certain charming woman a visit. With a big ol’ pack of salt of course.With certain items you’re even able to convert Sanctuaries of another Creed to your own. There’s an easy and a hard way but it’s best to find that out for yourself. Just more fun that way don’t you think?Soulsborne combat is thingThe combat works basically just like the Soulsborne games. Thrust, slash, hit, block and parry.Every action requires stamina so you should feel right at home.

There are a variety of weapons ranging from daggers to pitchforks to greatswords and so on.Also there’s magic but it works a bit different.Also just like in the Soulsborne games you're able to transmute weapons or armos with the ashes of bosses for example.Basically using Spells consumes Focus and will lower your max Stamina. In other words the more spells you cast before resting in a Sanctuary the more stamina you’ll lose and you end up being unable to cast spells at all.Enemies have and follow a certain attack pattern which you’ll have to get used to in order to see another day. Bosses in particular. They all have a few mean tricks up their sleeves to make you hate your life and them. Remember the salt is not only sacred but real in this game.What I noticed during Boss battles is that depending on their current HP they mix their attacks a bit up so you can’t just follow into a rhythm like: slash, roll, slash, roll slash.I mean you can and feel free to do that but you might get rekt fairly easily that way. Trust me I know what I’m talking about.There’s no explanation to how or whyJust like the Soulsborne games you’ve no idea how or why. By that I mean story wise and so on. However during your encounters with numerous NPCs you’ll learn a bit more about the world and the game each time you talk to’em.So if you’re like me and you enjoy a good story listen to what they have to say.There’s too much and nothing left to sayI could be really specific about the mechanics of the game and so on but I feel this is enough.The beauty of the Soulsborne and Metroidvania games is that you don’t have a real clue how to get to anywhere or what’s really going on.All in all Salt and Sanctuary has managed to become my favorite game at the moment and overall since it mixes up to genres which I absolutely love.Not to mention that the Music in this game is just so fitting and exceptionally good.I bought it full price without regret and to be quite honest I believe that the Devs have earned their money so don’t be salty about the price and support’em.Also I have to mention real quick that the only two devs behind this gem of a game are husband and wife.Pretty neat eh?

												Extremely good side-scroller Metroidvania game. Works fine with Keyboard+Mouse but Gamepad is still the best choice. Your first run from beginning to end will take about 20-30 hours. Each subsequent playthrough will take considerably less time as you'll know all the shortcuts. If you like 2D games there's no reason to skip this game.Pros:Strong skill choice system, let's you get a diverse build.Depending on your weapons/shields you can have fast paced combat or slower more methodical combat.Plenty of secret areas with interesting items and gear. There are even some secret zones with their own bosses.Plenty of rings with different effects to choose from. Functions similarly to Terraria's accessories.Plenty of different weapon types (16 total weapon types) and armor types.Generous Invincibility frames when rolling. Possible to kill bosses without being hit if you're good enough.Mostly non-linear gameplay. Once you make it a few hours in you have multiple zones to visit as you wish.Cons:No ingame map. You have to remember how each zone connects to each other or use an external map.Some of the bosses (19 total) are lackluster and not very memorable.Some of the enemies rely on grapple attacks that can bug out and make you fall into the void.A few of the NPC quests (not required) are basically impossible to finish without a guide.Some of the weapons are simply better than others, like the Greatsword/Greathammer. The faction system (Creeds) is fairly confusing at first. No mod support at the moment. Hinted at by devs as possible in the future. Doesn't hold your hand at all tutorial-wise. Some may see this as a good thing though.I'm not a big fan of the art style, especially the human faces. The backgrounds are fine though, if a bit samey in some zones.			"

												Ok, so... I played this game with a friend. Couch co-op, that is. We talked this over. Neither of us is much of a believer of anything, but we're sort of in agreement with one thing:The developers of this game must have sealed a pact with a demon or something.Salt and Sanctuary is... incredibly fun. Like, ridiculously fun. Beautifully, perfectly, unmeasurably, unfathomably, grotesquely fun.It's unbelievable.			"

												At first, I was interested because I heard the game was souls-like.I managed to buy it first week of summer break 2016. I was torn apart weth I should get Hyper Light Drifter or Salt and Sanctuary. My little brother was a little more interested in S&S, so I got it.I got thrown onto an unknown island to find my princess, after I lost her at sea and washed ashore. I found my first sellsword idol and realised, ""Wait, there's local co-op?""And so me and my brother played and enjoiyed the game to our fullest. I was the tanky, two-hand great sword dude, and he was the high dps mage. I also threw a little of miracles into my build to use the guardian sword miracle I bought (but ended up finding the revive miracle way more useful).The game, by itself, should not be treated as a parody to Dark Souls. Rather, treat it as a stand-alone title, with its own experience and gameplay that rivals even Dark Souls. Treat the game as an equal, because it gives and experience that is independent in its own way. Of course, it does look a little souls-like, but dut let that make you think the game is a worse parody of Dark Souls. The world map is interconnected in a way that can even rival Dark Souls. The bosses are just as amazing and challenging, if not, more. But unlike Dark Souls, the platforming never gets old as you wall jump, change gravity, and even dash mid-air to help you get to where you're going.In summary, the game has you running about killing monsters, jumping in puzzles, and slaying enormous bosses. But unlike Dark Souls, the whole concept of plattforming, level and world design make the experience unique and fun. You can even bring a friend to help you celebrate your deathfest.			"

												I bought this back in March on the PS4 and have a decent total playtime with that version (100 hours+).The port is exactly the same game with some pc quality of life upgrades. Like rebindable keys (espically good for a souls fan) resoultion options, borderless windowed for those who enjoy that. Onto the game:This game is basically a Souls-like set in a 2D metriodvania style. The game mechanics have been translated to 2D in a fashion that makes it feel natural. The Controls are responsive and fuction like what you should expect out of a 2D souls-like.The game carries over more or less all the Souls mechanics that would work in a 2d plane (Stamina bar, Invicibilty frames, ""bonfires"", refreshable healing [estus], currency dropped on death and then gone if you can't retrieve it etc.)A mechanic in this game that can be brutal is wouding. Attacks deal different amount of wounding to you, reducing you total max health. This can destory you if you aren't careful. Also you can exhuast your stamina bar losing max stamina. This is easy too do since rolls use a lot of stamina but are very very good. Can be reset at sanctuaries (bonfire) or with certain spells/items.Some of most spotable diffrences is leveling up. Instead of simply having stats to level up, you have a talent tree. The talen't tree adds depth and a diffrent apporach I think is beneficial for this game. You flesh out and learn higher classes within it weapon which might seem annoying in the first place but it adds to not making you a master of all trades. While higher class gear is better it means you gotta sepnd a lot more levels to get it. Hence it balances out. Everything in skill tree imrpoves your stats, other than those giving you more potions/estus.Another mechanic that is different is there is salt and gold. All salt is dropped or rather stealed by the enemy that kills you, the enemy that steals your salt will power up and you receive the salt when it's killed. Bosses drop salt they've stolen at set precents (usually 20-25% ish) and doesn't seem to change in anyway by holding it. Upoun death a npc will pull you back to the last sanctuary (bonfire) and take a set amount of your gold (10% ish). This can't be retrived. Salt is mainly used to level up your level and weapons and to transmute weapons with boss drops to other weapons (boss weapons) Also enemy drops can be use to transmute to non-boss weapons. Gold is mainly used too buy items from npcs.In this game sancutries are your safehaven where you level up. The big thing here is that sanctuaries are under certain creeds if not empty. If you are the the sanctury's creed you can summon npc's to that sanctuary, vendors, blacksmiths, creed questline npc's etc. If a sanctuary is oppucied by another creed you can not summon npc's or get creed exlusive's from the npc. The npc in there will offer you to join theri creed which abondeds the old one. You can hower convert or defile another sanctuary to take it over.Creeds have exlusive itmes at certain npcs which usually are locked behind leveling up the creed. This can be done trough a leader (creed npc).The enemies and bosses in this game is very varied and placemnt of enemies uses the 2D plane to it's fullest. Platforming is a fair chunk in this game while not the most difficult it adds to the game and can be used heavily against some enemies.Boss desgin is great, difficulty compared to souls depends on the player more than the game. Personally i find it easier due to it's easier for me to see the bosses attack (2d handrdawn style is the reason behind it) Bosses in this game is highly varied in terms of desgin, attacks etc. So bossfight doesn't feel like copycats. This game has a good hand of secret and cryptic secrets. So there is a lot to exprole. The world conects together, making backtracking less a chore and makes the world seem more ""naturual""Sound and visual wise this game is solid giving you a fairly good immersion.The game cartinaly isn't without flaws, but no game breaking ones. There is a lot that could be added and things to improve and tweak, but for such a small team this is a Grand 2D piece. This game isn't for everyone, and being a soulsfan doesn¨t nescarrily mean you will like this. But all in all I highly recommend this game.PS: For those who need help; Yes there is a wiki			"

I accidentally chose the wrong ending, so i spent the next 12 hours laying down playing NG+ to right my wrong. I watched the sun rise and set without getting up once. I did eventually get the other ending though. I think I played it for like 28 hours straight.

 Is this 2D Dark Souls or something completly different ?	First things first, in my opinion this game should not be compared to Dark Souls.As someone who beat all Dark Souls games multiple times, I see why people compare it to Dark Souls and I have to say, that some facts are pretty identical to Miyazakis masterpiece (lets forget Dark Souls 2 for a moment). But this game feels more like a 2D brawler, like Streets of Rage or to be more precise, because of the higher difficulty level, like the old Shinobi or Ninja Gaiden games. But lets talk about the game itself:	 The game has a stunning artwork. Everything looks like a painting. The animations are fluid and the combat system is ""inspired"" by Dark Souls (damn, looks like this comparison is just too fitting...), means you have a fast depleting stamina bar wich is used for every action taken and a even faster depleting healthbar, if you are not carefull enough. And it  will	 deplete, because the bosses are difficult, have mostly two or more phases and are just freaking awesomely designed. For example an early boss,  The Queen of Smiles	 looks just terrifyingly epic and has some pretty beautiful and deadly attacks.The weapons you will use have different move patterns, wich needs to be mastered. But for me, here ends the similarities between Dark Souls and Salt and Sanctuary.Salt and Santuary plays like a 2D plattformer, stuck into a great RPG-corset. And the battlesystem reminds me somewhat of Devil May Cry, with its fast and light attacks and the heavy but slow attacks and of course the aerial combos. Yes, right - aerial combos. You can knock your enemies up in the air and follow them with some hits and a final blow to the ground, wich is a good way to deal damage while avoiding it.By the way, wich needs some explanation too is, that if you want to play a sorcerer or cleric:When you cast spells, your stamina bar will loose some maximum stamina, wich represents fatigue. So you need some ""blue health pots"" (they are different for each faction) to restore your maximum value.And lets not forget that this game is a metroidvania, too. You will find items and equipment wich will help you find new ways, even in the starting area, after you have departed for round about 3 hours. So prepare for some backtracking, if you want to reveal all the secrets of the island. To make it short:	 Pros:	 Beautiful artstyle (- but the character models look a bit strange at first) Challenging gameplay and bosses Metroidvania thoroughly There are some factions to choose from, wich will alter the look of your sanctuary. Even compared to Dark Souls, this game differs a whole lot, to be recognize as its own game Cons:	 If you dont like backtracking - there is backtracking Some may do not like the character models That´s all - seriously, I do not find any other cons, at least for me.  Verdict	To be honest, this game looks like Dark Souls, feels like Dark Souls, but it plays totally different compared to Dark Souls.The World itself, with its melancholic feel and artwork wants to be explored. The weapons and skills wants to be mastered. The epic bosses want to be defeated. This game breaths and lives the vibe of the Souls-Games, but it has it own ideas and tweaks to be its own game. If you like the Souls-Games and need a new fix, this will greatly sufficient.Even if I have not yet completed the game, I am sure that I will remind this game as ""Salt and Sanctuary"" and not as ""the 2D Dark Souls game"".(Edit: After exactly 15 hours of play time I have beaten the game, and it is pretty awesome. The ending will left you want to play more and thankfully there is NG+.Still I need to say, that the last few bosses were much to easy, at least for my build, wich contained heavy armor and a two-handed mace)......By the way, I did compare it to Dark Souls, didn´t I ? ...

												Oh. My. God. Went into this because I played 200+ hours of darksouls 1-3 + bloodborne so I wanted something new. I've played 7.7 hours in one day...Send help. I can't stop playing. But if you love dark souls. You will love this too.*EDIT*beat it twice now... played 32 hours... no help yet...*EDIT... AGAIN...*One more thing... ive been reading some negative reviews and most are about the controls (mostly about grabing onto stuff), i found that if you hold up (i think havent played it in a bit been busy) and jump TOWARD it not just straight up, your character will grab as soon as you are in range.hope this helps someone, it did annoy me that i didnt fit out until about the last level.(P.S. i played with a controler, so i dont know if the grabbing thing works with keyboard)either way... enjoy!

												A great Dark Souls-lite 2D game made by  a small team (just two devs!).ProsCombatExploring nicely done areasCraftingDying and prevailingExcellent performance, really small install sizemusicart style (except for really strange faces ;)KB\mouse  controls are quite good and can be remapped. 2 endings. One for paladins and another one for us, Evil Overlords ;PConsPitchwoods.The area and the boss are optional, however, if you are a mage you have to ""git gud"" at pretty hard platforming (only in this area)  coz it's the only way to get to the best mage covenant.No other covenant is locked like this...I suck at pretty hardcore platforming, so it's in cons.The game needs some balancing in regard to spells (tier 4 Dragonfire spell  nerfed to oblivion and useless etc) and probably some weapon types( daggers)No online co-op for now.A bit washed out graphics in general but I guess it was made on purpose for creating this dream-like island.Hitboxes. You hit and get hit although visually it never happened.Just a bit of phantom range.  But you get used to it real fast.Some dubious choices to make the game artificially more difficult.I haven't played NG+, so I can't say how it is..8/10			"

												Salt & Sanctuary is compared to Dark Souls a lot. There definitely are similarities, but if you'd play S&S to get ""more"" Dark Souls, you will get disappointed. S&S is more obscure both lore-wise and gameplay-wise, has less items to mess around with, and the loss of a dimension makes movement, perception and spacing less important in favor of twitch reactions and stamina management. However, S&S has ""proper"" couch co-op, the gameplay feels satisfying, and despite the game overall being worse than the 'real' Souls games, it's still well above average and a pleasure to play.The main disadvantage of S&S is the systemic obscurity; you will need to have a plan to play properly, and a lot of important decisions you make early on (such as which creed to pick or how to level up skills optimally) are not explained in-game, meaning you can screw yourself over because you could not make an informed decision. While Dark Souls is about ""making the best of what you have"", Salt & Sanctuary is about ""work towards an intended goal"". If you're okay with that, or just want an easier game to see if the Dark Souls hype is something you want to get into, S&S is a solid metroidvania well worth the price of admission. Just make sure you bookmark a wiki or two before you embark.			"

												This is a great entry point for someone wanting to try a ""hard"" game.It's almost impossible to get into any discussion about this game without the phrase ""2D Dark Souls"" coming up, and with good reason.  The bottom line is that this is a very addicting, 'hard' game that feels like Dark Souls and Castlevania had a metroidvania love child. Hopefully without gushing too much..Pros: -Rewarding gameplay that feels good once you get the hang of it-Tight controls, this game is all about timing and strategy, not button mashing.  There are combos, to a point, and when you execute one perfectly and the monster explodes into a blood stain, it's some of the best 2D combat ever.-The art direction in this game is perfect.  The island, the characters, the weapons.. everything comes together to deliver a beautifuly modern 2D experience that is cohesive, while still delivering varied locales on the island.-The story, it's there, and it's a good one, but it's very much not in your face and you can breeze right by it if you choose..  Don't.  Talk to everyone, seek out new areas and people, exhaust all conversation trees, and talk to the scarecrow. Always. -The sphere-grid skill tree and leveling system in this game is deep and when you combine that with New Game+ can produce some pretty interesting hybrid builds.-You will get frustrated, and you will get mad, and you will want to keep playing this game regardless.-Pumpkin HelmCons:-Not really a con because it's more just part of the genre, but can scare away someone used to having a game hold their hand (If this is you I'm describing, push forward and keep trying even after seeing ""Obliterated"" splash across your screen dozens of times..it happens.. and maybe switch to a strength build using 2h when you can.  2H hammers in this game are a license to make monsters explode. You can also grind up salt from monsters and level up at a santuary a bunch if a boss is just too much for you)-An in-game indication of soft cap breakpoints on skill-tree points/ more in depth weapon scaling info would be helpful, but thankfully there is an extremely good Salt and Sanctuary wiki with a lot of this information.  Same goes for boss weaknesses, although those are sometimes indicated on message bottles in-game.-A map of discovered areas would be nice at some point in the game.10/10 would kill God's with a giant warhammer again			"

												The shameless Souls clone comes to the PC!I'll admit I was hoping for this port for a while, and it didnt dissapoint. I havent tried Mouse and Keyboard, but there appeared to be no performance drops and all of the button prompts were correctly translated for my Steam Controller. An adequate port thus far with no obvious issues.As for the gameplay it is the lovechild of ""insert From Software title here* and *insert metroidvania title here*. There are no huge mechanical twists to be found.That said, what it does, Salt does well. The combat is tight and brutal, and the platforming is snappy and satisfying partly due to a ledge-grab mechanic.The art style is nothing to write home about. Adverage indie-title quality, with some personality of it's own.tl;drIt's a Souls clone. But it is faithful to the source material and fun.Art: 6/10Gameplay: 8/10Port: 10/10Overall: 8/10			"

												An immensely enjoyable, moderately challenging metroidvania infused with numerous Dark Souls bits. While character design won't appeal to everyone, the dark, dreary locales are truly outstanding. Packed all to the brim, S&S features 20+ intricately interconnected areas to explore, just as many intense boss fights, 16 categories of equippable weapons, varied melee moves and combos, gratifying number of armor sets, seven joinable factions/covenants and a baleful bestiary that will always keep one on his toes.

(You commit to attacks and then they happen like Dark Souls.  Not everyone likes this, but I LOVE it.)+Hack and slash that requires thinking and timing.+A great many items, weapons both ranged and melee, shields, spells, and ways to play.+Platforming and puzzles.+Large mazelike world wrapping around back into itself with shortcuts.+Many varied enemies and bosses with entirely different animations, attacks, and personality.+Filled with great art, except the character face looks like generic flash game man.+Interesting characters, vague plot, it is basically Dark Souls Castlevania style.+Wall jumps, dashes, Castlevania style abilities.+Build your own religious base style save points that de-buff the area.+Local co-op.Cons-Wander lost for hours without using the wiki.-No online co-op.  PLEASE ADD, PLEASE, PLEASE!-Falling to your death is very common, lol.TLDR Wonderful game, only for people that like Dark Souls and Castlevania games. ADD ONLINE CO-OP PLEASE! "

												I have Always loved 2d platform games and I have always dreamed of this mashup, souls formula and a metroidvania style.When I a friend told me about this game, I Raged hard because it was initially released for consoles, and cried manly tears when I heard that it was going to be released at steam.The game is challenging, fun and has the same replay value as any souls game. Thousands of weapons and dozens of builds to experiment and progress through the game. Cool bosses, nice level design and I should talk about the gameplay: A challenging game needs to have good gameplay and the game delivers it. Fast paced with good responsivity to your inputs and commands. It’s very pleasant to see this level of gameplay on an indie game. You can feel a good coded game and its very satisfying to play it.I really enjoyed the game, and if you are into 2d platform games you should try it. Even if you don’t like the souls formula, you should give it a try, because it’s an awesome 2D game. And let’s not forget that it was done by a very small team of 2 devs, one marketing guy and 2 cats.  I would lke to say HELLO to some terrible and lier devs that don’t deliver what they promise. Learn from Ska Studio!Cheers to then, what an awesome game!  "

												A great 2D/sidescrolling ""Metroidvania"" platform RPG. Sanctuaries act as hubs for leveling up (which is done by collecting ""salt"" from enemies), branching your skill tree, and talking with vendors. Tech Tree is locked so choose skills/abilities wisely. Losing salt when you die makes death a consideration when chosing to battle enemies who might be stronger than you. This lends itself to somewhat of a grind for salt/leveling up at the begininng of the game but the grind is just enough to let you get a feel for controls. I used my Xbox One controller in lieu of a mouse/keyboard and it works great - would highly recommend going this route. The different character classes seem to offer lots of great replayibility.			"

												Very good and interesting game. Many people call it ""platform souls"" or ""2D souls"" because of Souls series influences (which are clear as day), however for me it is still closer to Metroidvania style games with added character progression in form of stats/builds and with bigger emphasis on challenging combat than platforming (there are however still few quite challenging platforming sections).If you like Souls series and/or Metroidvania games I would really recommend this one.

												One of those games with a truly unique atmosphere. Dark, brooding, but with some sparkles of hope and belief in higher purpose. Certainly not a horror.It gives you a lot of freedom: regarding both mechanics (skills, weapons) and story. You can explore many areas in a non-linear way and even skip some bosses, but then you won't get all the achievements of course. Which is not a big issue, because the game is good enough to do another playthrough.There's a good amount of lore in item descriptions and dialogues. Combined with a huge, labyrinthine world containing many secrets, it's a boon for explorers. The secrets can be easily found without looking at a wiki, though. The game requires some backtracking if you want to explore everything, but backtracking in this game isn't tedious at all.The combat system is very good compared to other platformers. Requires some getting used to, but you'll be executing combos with ease after a few minutes.However, you may find Salt & Sanctuary quite imbalanced. Some weapons and spells are far superior than others. Not a big issue as there's no PvP, but depending on which skills you choose you may find boss fights either frustrating or boringly easy. Finding these OP combinations may be considered part of the game, though, as long as you don't use a wiki.Speaking of wikis, there are many things which aren't explained in-game, like encumbrance system (apparently you get slower after reaching 25/50/75% encumbrance) or damage scaling on weapons. Some items have hidden properties. However, you don't need to know everything to beat the game and you can easily say if an item is better than your current one by seeing if the stats are green or red. One thing worth knowing is that you can invest more than 1 point in most skills (but you probably won't need this on your first playthrough anyway) and that you can reclaim skill points using grey pearls. Also, it makes a huge difference whether you're holding a weapon as one-handed or two-handed.Personally, I find the lack of in-game explanations interesting, a bit like in most roguelikes. I have checked a few minor things on a wiki or asked a friend, but it turned out it was completetly unnecessary as it made the game too easy. Once you get to know the areas and enemies it should be relatively quick and easy to start a new character and make the same progress, if you're really unhappy with your choices.One final tip: DON'T PLAY AS A MAGE. It's OP as ****. I defeated almost every boss in just a few seconds using spells. I guess the developers will fix the balance a bit in the future, but right now choose mage only if you don't mind making the game too easy. On the other hand, it required some training to use the spells effectively, but it was rather disappointing to not even see what most bosses' attacks are.Also, try using a gamepad instead of a keyboard. Some things are easier on a keyboard, but you may find a controller more natural for this kind of game, like in most platformers.If you're stuck or want to make sure that you're progressing through the game in the correct order, there's an excellent ""Spoiler-Free Where Do I Go/What Do I Do Next"" guide on reddit.

												This game is basically everything I wanted from it. Captures the Souls combat formula perfectly in 2D, incorporates aspects of metroidvania games to fill in the rest of the mechanics, and just feels well put together (especially for such a small team) whilst not being overly short or simplistic. I've played all 3 of the main Dark Souls installments and perhaps it's just familiarity causing it, but I found this legitimately more challenging at many points than Dark Souls 3 was. Level design is excellent (and would probably appeal to people who preferred Dark Souls 1's looping paths and interconnectivity and abundance of shortcuts) and the platforming aspect isn't neglected either; there's some neat tricks introduced as you go deeper. The price of entry seems fair, I could see myself spending multiple playthroughs at likely over 10 hours each (2-3x more for the first, NG+ an option) with this. Strikes me as very replayable with as many interesting build options that the game gives you. Magic isn't awful like it has been for the last 1.5 Dark Souls games either, so there's that. Virtually anyone could run this, and I've not heard of many technical issues (more than could be honestly said for some of its inspiration). All in all I had a lot of fun and the similarity to niche games many of us have previously enjoyed helps to both highlight where it does well in emulating the thrill of said games, but also shows off the ways that it feels like an entirely new experience divergent from those games. Really all I could complain about here is enemy grab attacks. Mostly unfun in the Souls games and mostly unfun here too when they come in to play, but that's just a select few enemy types that often have avoidable mechanics if cautious.			"

												Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, and both the ""Souls"" series and the ""Castlevania"" series should be very, very flattered. I went in not knowing what to expect, and found myself on a patchwork island, where each death, though knee-punchingly frustrating, was completely avoidable. I have two different characters, and what was nearly impossible for one is a cakewalk for the other, and vice-versa. I'm having a fantastic time with Salt & Sanctuary, but I do have two complaints: One, there needs to be a map. I understand that some people may disagree, and that's fine, but if there is an in-game map, you have the option to ignore it. You don't have the option to will one into existance if there isn't one, and options are always good. The second complaint is that the soundtrack is way too minimal. There are about 4 or 5 songs that I can recall, and two of them make up 90% of the game. Also, those songs are about four bars long. Those two things are just small complaints, though, and I really am enjoying this game. Looking forward to what Ska does in the future! Hail the Salt!			"

												I've been waiting for this game since January, and let me say, this game lived up the it's expectations. After the first boss, I've come to the conclusion that Salt and Sanctuary (S&S) is a 2d Dark Souls. S&S has all the same Souls-like mechanics: Light, Heavy, Block, Parry, Rolling, stamina draining actions and commitment to your actions. The combat is smooth. Heavy and Light attacks, parrying and blocking all come together to give a combat depth I've not seen in a game since Dark Souls. The added jumping attacks give another dimension to the combat.,,Each weapon has a class, and these classes have different move-sets (like Dark Souls) which add even more depth. In addition to weapons there are incantations (spells) to add more variety than just your average hack and slash.The platforming is precise unlike Vladis Story, Platforming in S&S feels fluid, and it hasn't gotten in the way of combat, yet. I died on the first boss a few times because it was so intense, but the difficulty isn't unfair like in some games (Vladis Story for example). It feels very fair, I only died to the boss from my mistakes, not because of some unblockable RNG combo. I almost died from a normal enemy because of my mistakes as well.There is also local co-op which is very well laid out and was the most fun I had in a long time on a PC game. Salt is the best couch co-op game I've played on PC in a long, long time. Overall, If you like titles like Dark Souls, Zelda, Ori and the Blind Forest, or even Vladis Story (which I didn't like), then, I think you'll enjoy this game. S&S  is even worth it at full price.

												(Excuse my english, i am no native, but i felt this review is better written in english, hope it helps!)The first thing if have to say, that i dont like the direct comparism to the Souls Series. Its more often called ""2D Dark Souls"" then its called by its real name. Yes, its true that the game takes a lot of things from the Souls Franchise and its easy to see and say where the inspiritation came from. But it mixes it up with its own unique ideas wich make this game very special. The 2D perspective and the controlls give this game the possiblity to use jump'n run mechanics and also some metroid or castlevania elements mixed up with pretty well working combat system wich wants to figured out by the player. The combat is challenging as it is in the Souls Series but it has its own flow coming from the faster movement of the players characer. The list of weapons and armor is large, there is a huge skill tree, many possibilites to build yor character.The worlds in this game look amazing and beatiful, very detailed you can see that the devs loved what they did. There is a very unique vibe that you can feel while playing the game. Its all dark and sad, but in the same moment this sadness is broken up by the funny design they have choosen for your character and the npcs. The worlds dont equal each other and so do the bosses. There are various enemies, wich are all well designed mostly feel well placed and not just put there just to be there.There are not many downsides for this game. In some situations the game is a bit unfair, cause you will die without having the chance to escape or win the fight. It takes some time to figure out the Sanctuary, Creed and weapon enforcement mechanics. Escpecially the Sanctuary/Creed thingy is a bit confusing. But thats all.To put it in a nutshell: If you are a Souls-Fan like i am, you will love this game, if you like well planed and lovely designed 2D metroidvania games, you will love this game. If you like challenging hack'n slay with tactical combat, you will also love this game.8.5/10			"

												If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then Salt and Sanctuary says a lot about the ""Souls"" genre.  I was never really interested in the Dark Souls games, but something about S&S just drew me in.  I have watched other people play the various Souls game on Twitch so I do have a concept of what those games are like.This game is essentially a 2D Dark Souls - page for page - albeit a less challenging one.  That's not to say this game doesn't have a learning curve, especially if you are new to the genre, but once you learn a few things and pick up on the powerful builds it becomes much more forgiving.  There is some platforming, but it's not particularly challenging with the exception of one optional area.  Even then, I managed to get past it in about 10 minutes.Pros ---A great blend of 2D platforming and action.  Worthy of the Metroidvania title.Absolutely gorgeous and unsettling artwork and atmosphere.Long campaign considering the price tag.Extremely addictive gameplay.Replay value.Cons ---Some weird design oversights, especially regarding itemization.Level design has a few questionable areas.Feast or famine when it comes to builds. Steamroll or struggle.Extremely limited soundtrack.A lot of these cons can be explained by manpower.  From what I understand this game was made primarily by 2 people and they should feel extremely proud of what they have accomplished.  Mouse and keyboard are passable, but do yourself a favor and use a gamepad, especially if magic is your thing.Buy this game.			"

												This game is basicly a 2D Dark Souls. with out being Dark Souls.If you like Dark Souls you'll have an easier time understanding what I'm trying to say in my review.This game is alot like Dark Souls the combat centers around timed blocking rolling and attacking with a heavy emphasis on patience and stamina management. However there are ALOT of diffrences between this game and Dark Souls. Firstly is the 2D layout which changes everything in removing a dimension the develeopers added everything that makes this game shine.The maps are more focused on vertical climbing with a hefty dose of platforming you just couldn't fit into a 3D game.The map layout is also much much easier to memorise with it removing a whole movement axsis and being desgined in one of the easiest memory formats.as I said above theres more platforming in this game which is why there are also special ablities called ""brands"" which are just awesome and fun to use and give the game a sort of MetriodVenia feel as you explore around and aquire the ablity to walk on walls or turn light into bridges or kickflip off walls.Another huge change from Dark Souls is the currency system. In this game there are two main Currencies Gold, and Salt. Salt is your EXP used to upgrade your weapons armor and charter ablities and Gold is used to buy new weapons and armor.Theres Also the titular Sanctuaries which are neat little areas that the player can customise to an extent. Each Sanctuary is detecated to a creed the player can choose to join this new creed or invade the Sanctuary and take it over claiming it for there own creed Sanctuaries belonging to the player's Creed can be customized alowing the player to choose what merchents go where as well as what Sanctuaries can be fast traveled too and a couple of other nifty things.The game world is also diffrent from Dark Souls in addition to being 2D the game shifts its focus to a world with a bigger focus on Seafairing soilders of the medevil ages as apposed to Dark Souls's more spiritualy focused world giving the game the feel of some kind of old timey Lovecraften horror story.Over all the game is good with a great soundtrack creative boss desgines a challenging diffculty and perhaps most importantly. the game is just fun.I'd tottaly recomend this game to any Dark Souls fan or just anyone looking for something diffrent.can't wait to see if the Dev ports Charlie Murder to Pc!

												Salt and Sanctuary is a 2D hardcore action RPG which is obvious Dark Souls clone, but offers enough deep gameplay to stand tall on its own.The game might not be original in the mechanics, but the original art style and sounds blow me away.There are about 100 different monster types, including 23  bosses. As was the case in Dark Souls, figuring out when it's best to block or roll is very important. The game also offers a wide variety of weapons with unique move sets.There's even stats for Strength, Dexterity and Magic that scale your weapon damage output on an E through S ranking system.Salt and Sanctuary wants new players to feel lost and makes memorising its locations part of the challenge.Each area is littered with secrets, hidden items and shortcuts that were previously separated by hours of playtime.Overall, despite some minor bugs, Salt and Sanctuary is one of the early contenders for indie game of the year.10/10 would die few dozen times.Praise the Salt!

												Salt and Sanctuary is a neat and very unique title, mixing 2D platformer with action role-playing. With a very well done art style as well as good level design you'll find yourself noticing just how linked every zone is with the rest of the world Zones lead into one another very well from many hidden paths. The game also offers many different combat styles to pick from with a very well done skill tree that lets you build your own mix of skills and talents. Something most people will see right away is that the game seems to take a lot from the Dark Souls series. You will get a very strong Souls vibe, but don't let that turn you away, this game has so much new to offer to the mix you'll soon find it to be far from any of the Souls titles. So, if you'd enjoy a dark, bloody, and very rewarding fast paced RPG with very high replay value, speed running potential, as well as a neat little story to tie it all together, please give this a try!TldrPros:Art styleGameplayCharacter progressionMusic*Level and monster designCons:*Music (Almost every boss having the same intro and theme hurts immersion, still good tho.)Story NPCs were a bit lack lusterA bit shortYou'll find monsters with grab attacks being a cheap death rather than fun, this can get a bit annoying.

If Castlevania: Symphony of the Night and The Dishwasher had a baby, this would be it.As a huge Dark Souls & Castlevania fan, it ticks all the boxes for me. Challenging enough to keep me playing, and the level design is similar to DS1, where each area can interlink and join seamlessly for a nice exploration experience.Very similar play style to souls games, where it’s up to you to figure out where to go, and what to do, but that adds to all the fun. There are a lot of classes, and it has my favourite chivalrous, heavy armor bearing knight, the Paladin.The art style and animation is really nice too.TL;DR = Buy it if you liked Symphony of the Night and Dark Souls 1.

												I know it's popular right now to say that a game is ""the Dark Souls of this genre."" Well this is one of those real legit uses. It's a Lord of the Fallen level shameless homage, just transplanted into a 2D platforming Metroidvania world. You have sanctuaries that act as bonfires, resting at them replenishes health, stamina and item usage but respawns enemies. You have salt instead of souls (though the level system is a bit more unique, each level gives you a point to put into a skill tree instead of directly increasing stats). You can hit a button to switch between one-hand or two-handing a weapon, dodge, have equipped weight limits, can parry into a big counterhit, build as a rogue or warrior or wizard or cleric or whatever. Yadda yadda. What's impressive is that they took all of these features and transplanted them into 2D in a way that works. There are things like Covenants to join, but abandoning one will mark you as a sinner, there are upgrade paths for weapons that require finding obscure materials, there are shortcuts to unlock and annoying fast enemies and poison status effects and the ability to leave messages for other players, it's all here. Plus local co-op.You probably already know if you like Souls-like games by now, and if you do, then get this because it's a good one, and oddly cute in its mimicry but no less brutal or compelling with some messed up monster design and serious challenge. A little brother to the real series and just at the right price. About my only complaint is the sketchy art style sometimes looks a little too rough in an un-stylized way, and there's some heavy overuse of tilesets. Remember how every area in a Souls game looks basically unique? Not so here. Quite a lot of identikit caves and castle halls. But then that's really just window dressing after all.			"

												The PC port runs great and smooth as near as I can tell and it's a damn sight more readable on a PC screen than a PS4 TV.Salt and Sanctuary is Dark Souls translated to 2D. Full stop. Almost every single design decision is ripped completely from Dark Souls 1 and 2. There are a few tweaks here and there: boss elemental/damage type weaknesses are emphasized so having a diverse weapon set is handy. Weapon balance is almost as out of whack as Demon Souls. And the lore goes a long way toward writing something that feels more properly fantasy, where the mystery is appopriately fantastical, dense, but has an actual answer, than Souls ever did with its goofy pastiche and dull ""all is lost, all valor is pointless"" world.A lot of you are already clicking the buy button, and that's fine. The game does not disappoint. The graphic design has some issues; the world got attacked by the Gears of War color stealing aliens so everything is murky and tough to read, but the core interconnected world, loads of bits to collect, stuff to upgrade, different weapon styles, enemies, bosses, exploration it's all Souls. I recommend it on that measure heartily.The problem is, we already had this genre in 2D. It was called a metroidvania. The difference here is that the combat borrows more from Souls than anything else in 2D. You seldom really honestly ""dodged"" anything in a Souls game. You used the dodge ability constantly, of course, but nine times out of ten, you were using the iframes imparted by the dodge to get through the attacks. It's the same way here. Where Metroid or Castlevania will ask you to learn positioning and react to boss attacks, most attacks here are simply handled by dodging through. It dumbs down the combat considerably*, even though the author does his best to throw in ""can't dodge must jump"" attack patterns every now and again. But, this is the same guy who gave us the quite good Dishwasher games, which are far tougher and more interesting mechanically than any Souls game combat-wise. So to see a simpler product here is a disappointment.All that aside, don't let me discourage you. Salt and Sanctuary is solid. Everything you loved about Dark Souls is here and it's certainly an enjoyable playthrough. But that we got a PC port of this before Dishwasher Vampire Smile feels like a crime.To add a couple of more compliments and complaints I had no room for elsewhere: the game is absolutely full of secret nooks, paths, and rooms loaded with shortcuts to other zones and junk to find. There are not a lot of weapons, but there are certainly loads of spells, materials, and clothes to locate. Sadly, the inventory system is a mess, a massive pile of unsortable little icons arranged with no rhyme or reason except kinda in the order you picked them up. No hint on shop vendors as to what you have or how much when you go shopping. Fast travel is convenient and checkpoints and shortcuts are common enough to ensure no boss has a tedious boring long walk a la Dark Souls 1.*That's not to say that iframe dodging has no place in a side scroller. Shank, Dishwasher, Streets of Fury all make it work, but those are games whose primary focus is on combat depth and variety. Combos, swiftness, flow, etc. Castlevania and Souls don't focus on that aspect. Different subgenresEDIT: By the way this is a better RPG than Witcher 3.			"

												A typical quest intents to make you a hero but end up finding out your deplorable fate in the surreal world and the endless circles that will haunt you for a while. Salt and Sanctuary is an incredible 2D platformer developed by SKA studio. The game focuses on combat, puzzles and timing platform, but if you pay enough attention to everything around, you will slowly notice the insanely detailed story behind the lifeless world and its lore; It is very huge world put in a small simple 2D game and this makes S&S more valuable than anything i've ever played. For the price tag, this game is a steal even at full price because its the contents could be easily worth around $30 or more so don't hesitate if you want to pick it up, you can't go wrong with this price. Let me explain it, the game was developed by a very small indie studio, only 2 people to be specific and it took them about two and a half years to develop; and the gameplay, well, it's tough, the first playthrough will take you around 25-30 hours. Its difficulty exceeds the standard videogame for sure so my advice, if you find some areas too hard, you will need to go back to the old areas and grind for some levels; trust me, being overleveled is one of the pleasure in this game but that's not all, when you backtracking and farming, you will propably find some secret areas as well as learning enemy's attack patterns and this is the key that help you survive. You will just barely scratch the surface of this game in the first playthrough, there are plenty of build combinations, secret areas, lore and hidden mechanics need to be explored; i still find out new mechanic even after 50 hours lol, for example: i didn't even know that you can counter with a pistol until my 3rd playthrough and it just showed me how crazily deep the combat system was. Now the level design, it's just simply genius, pretty much every area is interconnected, you can easily get lost and this will happen frequently since you don't know where to go and don't have any map or rada or gps like others moderm games; you just have to go with your instinct and when you reach some hardcore platforming sections, a single mistake or failed timing can wideout your entire grinded hour. My recommendation, check out  this guide  if you have hard time figuring out where to go next. Now the most beautiful thing that makes S&S my all time favorite is the art style and its lore. Remember the first time i saw S&S, i thought it was a comedy game lol. But after playing it for couple of hours, the atmosphere hit me really hard; it's really dark and depressing, some areas could turn out really creepy. But everything you see propably has its own story,  you have to collect and connect informations in order to image the whole picture and trust me, the details of this picture will blow your mind. Make sure you check out  The Drowned Tome  after finishing the game, it's a really well-written fan book which collects all pieces of information to explain the lore. Sure there are still mysteries and questions left unanswered. all these things will up to you and your theories. The story, gameplay, art style, atmosphere ect just simply make S&S my all time favorite video game.The only downside of this game is balancing, greatswords and greathammers are way too powerful compare to others weapon and this just make daggers, spears kinda poinless. But there's already a  mod  to rebalance everything. Make sure you keep an eye on it if you're interested. This is definitely my 2016 GOTY!  "

												This game is brilliant. It's the first 2D Souls game that I believe to be an evolution instead of a copy. It runs well, and is highly responsive with controller. The graphics and particularly the animations are well executed, especially after parries. The subsequent reposte is always brutal and elicits the same feeling you get in DS. I see other reviews that mention they are trying to avoid the comparison, but I think this is a love letter to those games. They captured both the aesthetics and the gameplay mechanics, yet it has a unique flavor of its own. The only thing it's missing for me is true multiplayer (internet), but that's a minor complaint.

												A spectacular Metroidvania with a Dark Souls feel. The graphics, character models, and environments are varied as well as extremely detailed. Each area is very distinctive and sticks out in your memory; which is good since there isn’t a mini map. Though I thought the lack of this feature would be a huge issue, it ended up driving me to learn the environments and find how each area leads into the next. For a game attempting to emulate the core design elements of Dark Souls, it ends up working well. The combat is fluid, great customization options for your characters, and the sound design is great. + Great graphics+ Fantastic level design+ Spectacular and informative sound design+ Wonderful customization+ Engaging combat+ Epic bosses+ Challenging but fair difficulty+ Local Co-op+ New Game Plus option+/- Lack of Mini Map (Pro for some, con for others)You may find yourself a little lost on occasion and will need to hunt for story elements, but if you’re a fan of Dark Souls or its sequels this will not be new to you. In short, if you enjoy Dark Souls and like Metroidvania games, buy this title ASAP. You will not be disappointed.			"

												Visuals, audio, soundtrack - Solid.Very pleasing to the eyes and ears, Good diversity between locations, you will see quite a variety of landscape and the enemies that reside within.It is a challenging game, in the way of button mashing = fail.Game requires recognising enemy patterns, learning your openings, learning when to dodge and when to block is fairly key to success.Extensive customization through class selection, skill selection, armor, weapons, spells, consumables.There are quite a few buffs, debuffs, strengths and weaknesses, stats to adjust for the different damage types you'll encounter.The game is deep.. Don't let the 2d aspect fool you. Campaign is around 20 hours for sure, first play through.Has New Game +'sIf you like Dark Souls, I'm sure you already know about this. Don't hesitate, it is 100% worth it at full price!Only issue I have with this game:The item belt (consumables) is shared with spells / prayers.. So, playing a caster class can become a little messy with how many items you have to scroll through - your health potions, stamina potions, antidotes, etc - share the same linear cycle bar as spells and prayers. Meaning in some areas, where you need 4 consumables on, plus 4 or 5 spells... That is way too much to cycle through when things get frantic..D-pad Left, D-pad Right.There is no seperation for consumables vs spells, like in dark souls.It can be dealt with fairly easily through inventory management, like how you can consume an antidote from inventory, without it being on your belt.Just go into areas with the bare needs equipped, once you learn what is needed in that area.

												I'm writing up a preliminary review post-haste because a few friends were wondering how I felt about this game.Please keep in mind the following facts about me:1.  I'm 37 years old and I am a huge Terraria, JRPG and Skyrim fan.  I also regularly replay Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow.2.  I am not particularly fond of extremely hard 2D games.3.  I simply cannot play a Dark Souls game, even though people slam the title in my face constantly.  I just don't enjoy the mechanics.  Dark Souls feels too much like the Witcher to me.  I *love* games that start you out helpless and weak.  I equally love reaching a point in those difficult games that I finally work hard enough to master the mechanics and become a badass.All this being said:Salt and Sanctuary is already my GOTY 2016.  It is a breathtaking game.  I haven't even scratched the surface but I've tried out all the different classes, I've gotten a couple nifty items, I struggled HARD on the first boss but then got through the next two somewhat easier.  The aesthetics and ambience are stunning and to me, there is no comparison.  Many games try to force in an ""artisan"" feel but rarely am I taken back by how lovely it actually looks and *FEELS* in action.  This is only magnified by how amazing Salt and Sanctuary looks and plays at 1440p.  Time permitting, this game is at the top of my list far above anything else.  I don't call these games ""souls"" games or any monickers like that.  To me, it is a love letter to the Castlevania games on the GBA and NDS.  SO many games attempt to grab those tags.  This one here, it is everything I've been searching for to replace those Castlevania games I wish they still made.  My score:  10/10.  I only own 3 other games out of nearly 430 that I would come close to rating that high.  To me, this game is a must-own.(Please add cloud saves though, so I don't have to keep copying my saves back and forth between my laptop and PC!)			"

Since my first experience with original Dark Souls (back in days, where everyone though ""It's unplayable with keyboard"" and I beat it in three days), I never experienced such a joy in one game. Beautifully crafted, with massive world, ton of items and very entertaining gameplay. Basically, you get Dark Souls in 2D world, with almost exact same game mechanics, such as stamina-based combat, brutal difficulity and great scenarios. Also, platforming side of game is very nicely made, almost on level of old PSX Castelvania. Definitely recomended to everyone.			"

												I've heard this game being characterised as ""Dark Souls in 2D"", but I think that analogy doesn't really fit.I'd rather call it Megaman with halberds.So yeah, it's fun.It's basically a 2D Jump-n-Run game with an elaborate combatsystem in a gloomy medieval setting. It's your job to traverse a grim and dismal world filled to the brim with monsters in order to achieve ... something. The story is rather flimsy but I haven't missed it so far.What the game does have is a well oiled central mechanic (the combat), fast-paced and enjoyable gameplay, an atmospheric, sinister world, challenging bossfights, and responsive controls. I do recommend it, it's well worth the money being asked for it.			"

												Salt & Sanctuary is an extremely well made game by a very talented studio. It's not perfect but it's a fantastic title overall. Just BE WARNED that it is far more Dark Souls than it is Castlevania. Pretty much every Souls trademark game mechanic has made it over to S&S including its brutal difficulty. Still if you have the patience and the skill and love 2D action/exploration games this is a must play.PROS: - gorgeous artwork and effects - wide variety of character builds - solid gameplay with some real weight behind the combat - offline co-op!CONS:- no map. 2D space doesn't offer landmarks to navigate like 3D does, there's a reason Metroidvanias have them- occasional garbage boss, area, or enemy that can frustrate- extremely DARK game. hope you have a setup with next to no screen glare!Also PRO TIP this game is very hard to tank so don't think going sword & board is going to be an easy first playthrough. Magic starts weak but ends up OP as heck.			"

At first even basic enemies destroy you but as you progress and become familiar with it you can feel your skill level rising, and it isn't just the gear you get or the skills you upgrade, it's you who's getting better. The game is brutal and punishing but oh so rewarding. The feeling you get after taking down a boss you've been stuck on is so satisfying. The game runs and looks amazing as well, the atmosphere is truly top notch. The levels are also huge and have tons of items and paths to take and the world connects so nicely its amazing. Huge customization options and tons of different ways to play. No joke a 10/10 game, anyone whos considering buying this please do.			"

												A very simple explination of this game would be ""2D Dark Souls"". But this game is far more than Dark Souls remade in 2D. Salt & Sanctuary is a fantastic game that has had me coming back for more, and I only just recently finished the game. There are many different ways you can play through the game and how you approach enemies. I've made several characters to test out several different ways of playing the game and to see all the different items and enemies S&S offers.There are so many things that you can find by exploring the terrain. ""High Risk High Reward"" is a pretty fitting saying for S&S, because going way off the beaten path to fight the biggest, toughest foes, and traverse the most unwelcoming of terrains, you can find some rather amazing items, or a new area to call your sanctuary.There are more than just a few bosses that will stand in your path, preventing passage to new areas, in most cases. There's never just one way to go about taking down these challenging enemies. Each boss has their own unique attack patterns, fighting stages, fighting arenas, buffs, debuffs, weaknesses, strengths, and health. Some bosses take a lot more damage from say, a sword, than a blunt weapon like a great hammer. The non-boss type enemies you encounter can also prove challenging to face, and usually arent just mindless meatbags you can take out without even thinking about what strategy you're going to use to face said enemy. Certain enemies can drop immensely useful items that you can use to level up certain weapons/shields/armors. There is a wide variety of enemies, who all have differing attack patters and such.There are so many different weapons, armors, and shields to choose from and use. Not only are the a ton of equipment to choose from, you can also upgrade the equipment you have to make it better. Most every weapon type is viable and good. Some, better than others. Magic, for instance, is immensely strong late game, if you know how to use it.Melee is still my favorite way of playing the game, but it does make you play the game smarter and carefully.The skill tree is really really massive and complex, so i'll just say that if you can think of something to spec into, you probably can do it in S&S.I probably left some things out.sorryIn short, if you're interesting on a game that's vaguely like Dark Souls, and a game that's punishingly difficult but also immensely fun and enjoyable with a lot of replay value, I HIGHLY recommend Salt & Sanctuary. The 18 Dollar (USD) price tag is way too small for such a well made game that has so much to offer.			"

												an energetic sidescroller beat-em-up which not so much riffs on Dark Souls as rips out its teeth and installs its own glinting replacements in its jaws. they're good replacements. shiny and chrome. in spite of the radically different inputs, I'd say the biggest difference from Dark Souls is just that enemies tend to have small movesets, and those tend to be more intuitive, which I really liked; after enough hours of wildly thrashing skeletons in Souls games, you start to wish enemies were a little easier to learn, a little more predictable. S+S takes great care in that, with enemy telegraphs feeling more like what you'd see in a Castlevania. it tightens things up for a less fridgeperson-speed game.apart from that, it's 2D Dark Souls, right down to the interface. if you don't like Dark Souls, maybe you'll like it in 2D more. if you do like Dark Souls, you'll enjoy rediscovering it in 2D, and maybe being slightly baffled at -just how far- they go to make their game feel just like it.

												This game mixes what Dark souls has from ambient(including enemies, weapons, objects, armours...) with a metroidvania gameplay style. If you liked dark souls you ll surely like this game. The maps are splendid and intertwined intelligently.About the bad things, the game is short for my liking (around 20 hours for the first playthrough), the coop and PVP is offline, not online, and the design is made to kill you in every corner... if thats considered bad ;)if you have any doubt you can always ask me directly :)			"

												This game deserves every piece of praise I, and anyone else, can give. As a man who considers the original Dark Souls as nothing less than a masterpiece, I can say that this game does it's ratio of challenge and reward very well. The game has tight controls, good level design, splendid art, and delightful gameplay. While there are some hiccups in the game, very few games can say they do not suffer from problems as well. Even after playing this game on another PC platform, and spending hours with it there, I felt the game was worth the purchase here. Overall, buy it, its more than worth it.			"

												This game is just a work of art. Like everyone is saying, Salt and Sanctuary feels like Dark Souls. The difficulty is not too bad for a seasoned Dark Souls player, and it's gameplay is very smooth and fluent. It has lots of replay value with the massive skill tree and classes. What I love most about Salt and Sanctuary is the experience first time through. It reminded me when I was first played Dark Souls, being thrown into the unknown what a single clue what to do. If you are a Dark Souls or an adventure type gamer, please try Salt and Sanctuary; you won't regret it :)			"

 If Dark Souls were a Platformer First of all I'm a Dark Souls Fan so my review will tend to compare the two.  Gameplay   First of all there are different starting classes and you get told the absolute minimum.  You can remap all buttons. Light Attacks, Heavy Attacks are forming different attack-patterns depending on your input and weapon. Dodge-Rolls differ in speed and length depending on your Equip-Load. You can jump and also attack while in mid-air. Parries are a thing. Static Healing-Potions that refill at every ""Bonfire"" or Sanctuary in this case. Enemy's respawn on death and Sanctuary activation. Raising your Level only possible in Sanctuary's Heighten your Level grants Orbs which can be used for Status-Upgrades. Instead of Souls, Salt is rewarded upon enemy defeat which serves the same purpose. (Maybe Salt is more appropiate sometimes.) On death Salt either gets acquired by the enemy your were slain by or manifests in an enemy if you died of a different cause. Defeat this enemy to regain your salt. If killed by a boss, you have to reduce the bosses health to a certain amount to regain your Salt Can't kill friendly NPC's  Graphics   Smooth 60Fps Clean Animations Bloodsplatter-Effect is nicely done Atmospheric Symplistic drawn-like artstyle but not unpleasant to look at. Dark Parts actually dark No graphical adjustments apart from resolution and full-screen  Audio   Most of the time there's only SFX and no background music When the music kicks in it's appropiate and fits the scene Boss themes are adding to the fight Nice Soundeffects, especially while whacking the enemy. Satisfying.  Negative Points or Differences to Dark Souls   No real possibility to feel out the enemy's power level ( aside from some with obvious giantism-build )Either you get smacked and may survive or you just ""DMC"" your enemy away. No online play ( aside from seeing other people die, like bloodstains in DS ) ♥♥♥♥ing Slimes are the new DogsAll in all, if Dark Souls were a platformer it would be very close to this game.It's fun to play and you have the same kind of motivation as in Dark Souls to keep goingwhilst banging your head against the wall.

												I put off buying this game for a long time. To me, it just looked like a longer version of a flash game and a rip-off of Dark Souls.Was I ever wrong.This is perhaps one of my favourite games of all time. I'm not kidding. It's comparitively short to the Souls series it pays so much homage to, but it is similarily gripping, and the price is extremely reasonable, sale or no sale. I have to thank Jerma985 and HolyMackerelTheThird for getting me into this game. I saw bits and pieces of Jerma's gameplay and that's what convinced me to give it a chance. Beautiful story, smooth gameplay (despite 2 or 3 bugs), and a feeling of real accomplishment and surreal disturb/awe.Graphics: 9.5/10 (While the indie art style isn't really new, the character, boss, and environment design is inspiring)Story: 10/10 (From side arcs to the overarching mystery, just amazing. Much less open to interpretation and variation than a Souls game, but being able to understand everything while still being kept in the dark is very helpful and compelling)Gameplay: 10/10 (Smooth and perfectly difficult, with a well-designed learning curve)Score: 10/10 (Perfectly aligns which each moment and never feels old. The final few locales are especially chilling)Mechanics: 8.5/10 (Fluid controls on keyboard or controller. Only complaint is the difficulty/inavailability of magic compared to melee that was common in the early Souls games as well. Skill curve on rolling and attacking and memorization and intuition is all an amazing blend. The glitches, most commonly found in speedrun attempts, imo, should be patched, they break the illusion this game has. You will probably only encounter one to two glitches your entire first run though, much less than any AAA title. The only one I ran into on accident was area skipping by being thrown down a shaft in the ziggurat and surviving a drop to the ruins)Overall: 9.5/10 (The same score as Dark Souls 3... if they release a hotfix to correct the bugs it would achieve the coveted 10/10 that I have not yet bestowed upon any game...)

Posted: October 8, 2016
												This is an early impressions review.So...2D Dark Souls. And in a lot of ways that describes to extreme detail what you're going to be seeing. If you've played Dark Souls, a lot of the mechanics will become instantly familiar. You have melee combat with sword and board, dual wield, or two handers, block and parry mechanics, health restoring items that restock at checkpoints, a currency to level up that you gain from each kill, lose at the point of death and must recover, often unforgiving difficulty, replays of other players deaths, messages from other players, and so on. The basic framework is that of taking dark souls and porting the mechanics pretty much directly to a 2D game.That's not a bad thing, at all, as a framework to build on.You've still got a grimdark setting, still a lot of zombies early on, and the overall aesthetic is ALMOST fantastic. And this is where we start to hit our first snag. The vast majority of things in the game are an intensely monochrome palette. I wouldn't mind this so much if they'd found ways to make enemies stand out more. A lot of the enemies just blend right in to a lot of the background, leaving me halting for some unknown reason for a moment until I get smacked and realize what's going on. This is by far my biggest complaint, and while it doesn't ruin the game entirely it does make some sections frustrating for entirely the wrong reasons. I can chuckle it off when I die to a boss mechanic that is avoidable but I just didn't execute properly, but getting destroyed because I literally couldn't see what was hitting me as an unintended side effect of the art design is a whole other level of frustrating.Souls veterans might also find occasional missteps in where it almost copies the formula but doesn't quite. Smacking against your shield seems to impose no penalty on enemy melee recovery for example, and I found myself working a lot to improve my parrying skills because blocking often, although not always, had problems. The dodge roll works about how you'd expect after some practice, and melee combat felt good.The level up system, I'm not a fan of. It is daunting, honestly in some ways it's more opaque than Dark Souls. You have an absolutely massive, sprawling skill tree to travel along, and making a plan early on can be very difficult, especially when you haven't had as much of a stab at the mechanics yet. Respecing is extremely limited, which comes in the form of grey pearls that can only refund a single skill point each and are only good for an occasional total oops...complete respecs are entirely out of the question. The very complex skill tree and the lack of solid respecs might be fine individually, but put together I'm not a fan of the system.Overall here, there's a lot to like. The combat is solid, and for anyone that's waiting on their next genuine Souls/Born fix this should be pretty good. It could absolutely stand for some improvement, but so far I'm enjoying what's here and I don't see why that should stop.			"

												I haven't writen a review in awhile. I've always been a fan of the ""Metroid/vania"" game genre but haven't been able to find one that really brings something new to the table. Simply put this game combines the known formula of the Dark Souls series and combines it with a 2D combat platformer. For me this was just the combination that I was looking for. Extremely high replability. Dark and creative handdrawn creature models. Just as unforgiving as the dark series. If you are on the fence about this game I highly reccommend it as something both new and old.			"

												I'm a bit new to the whole Dark Souls type games, and only got around to them after finishing Bloodborne in its vanilla stages, and I fell in love with that game. After doing so, I just had to pick up all of the Souls games, and seek out any other games that might give me that same rush I experienced downing a tough and grueling boss, where you had to become quite intimate with its phases, abilities, and move sets all while learning your own. Where as in other games, most bosses are simply just a regular enemy with a lot more HP. In a Dark Souls or Bloodborne experience, the normal enemies are tough, and there are mobs and other types who might do just as well as they would a sub boss, or stand in. That is to say, the games aren't unfair...they are, you just have to learn the mechanics, and will be punished from the get go. Except here, it teaches you...drives you. This is why I was happy to try this title out, and while it doesn't feel as ""tough"" as its 3D progenitors, as I'm admittedly only about five hours in at the time of writing this, I still find it as a good fill in for those games when I want to change things up, but still want to retain that magical feeling of accomplishment, and falling in love with every boss and becoming more personal with them than I would with other bosses in other games. This hearkens back to my childhood love and challenge I found in the NES title of Castlevania, which a lot of games like these and God of War owe a great debt to, and even echo quite a bit in some ways. It really makes me feel nostalgic at the same time, because I really loved seeing my favorite horror icons turned into these challenging boss fights, before I even knew what a ""boss"" was in my little mind. The original Castlevania, like these newer, modern games make every boss unique, and in need of adjusted strategies or approach. Where as many games these days add bosses simply to increase the amount of hours you are required to play, and while this is great in concept, most become clones of a previous boss, or a simple change up. While these games aren't free from falling in that trap of repeating, you can tell, love and care was given in these games, which make up for it. You can pick up on the lore and history from their drops, their attire, and even move sets and mechanics can hint at something a little deeper if you look a little closer.If you've played Bloodborne, or Dark Souls, or Demon's Souls, and you happen to love them and need a fix, definitely do yourself a favor and pick this one up! The only negativity I've found is a few slight frame rate issues, which more than likely occurred due to a program I had not closed out of in need of updating, as well as the more ""cutesy"" and ""chibi"" style of the friendly characters and npcs that seem to contradict or at least give a stark contrast to the overall dark atmosphere, because make no mistake, while it looks like it could fall in the category of something a little more child friendly, there is plenty human gore imbued. Which honestly, isn't really a problem for me. I wouldn't really call this a review so much as an impression, but maybe you're someone who happened to read through this, and in need of convincing to pick this game up. Well, if you like what you've read, and seen, and or have played games like this before, stop reading and pick this one up! Do it. Now!			"

												I tried, o how i tried to love this game. 500 + hours of Dark Souls 1/2/3 games, loved every minute of getting wrecked in them. This game however, tries so hard to be Dark Souls, that it forgets what makes the Souls games awesome, a FAIR challenge.In this game, rolling is busted and hardly works, there's no stat to increase HP, the controls are clunky and fail to give the player the required fast and crisp input to complete the gimmicky bosses and over-used platforming sections. Not to mention that most of the deaths in this game come from either missing a jump, and dying, or getting hit off a ledge and dying that way. Thats not fun at all, there are hardly any fun 1v1 enemy encounters, it's constantly throwing multiple enemies at you that stunlock you, or send you flying, becuase if anything touches you, you GO ♥♥♥♥ING FLYING OFF THE SCREEN. Most enemies can 2 shot you, if there's 2 enemies on the screen, be sure as hell they will combo you around the screen like a ♥♥♥♥ing Super Smash game. The main problem with this game is that there are too many arbitrary and artifical ways they make the game harder. ""Here, fight this boss on a series of crumbling ledges that also periodically shoot fire at you"" this is the definition of a gimmicky boss, sure it takes some skill, but the amount of trial and error required to get passed some of these poorly designed encounters, leaves the player feeling frustrated even after a win. Everytime i beat a boss in a DS game for the 1st time, i was so happy at what i had just accomplished, knowing i just completed a difficult, but fair fight (barring some cheesy♥♥♥♥♥bosses in DS2 of course). Another issue is that the game also reduces your total amount of HP everytime you are hit, another artifical way to increase the difficulty, even with the ring which helps reduce the amount of HP lost from taking those hits, its still completely unnecesary. It just feels like the devs made the game to make players feel bad, ""hope you like fighting on ledges that 1 misstep and your dead while 5 enemies are constantly chasing you and archers are launching arrows at your face! isnt it great how hard our game is!?"" Its like the game just laughs at you and doesn't respect the player like a Souls game, which always builds up the players skills, making every new area a fun new challenge that's teaching you the ropes at the same time as kicking your♥♥♥♥♥In the end, i think if there was far less crushingly difficult platforming and less ledges/cliffs/holes in the ground, i would have maybe stuck it out (The controls certainly don't help). But im sick of trying my best in a given section, only to have a trash mob enemy hit me once, and throw me flying off a ledge to my death. The Souls-like mechanics are well done in some places, the way Salt(Souls) work, fat rolling, weapon/armour variation and  the tech tree is OK for what it is, the atmosphere is nice as well, but the game severly lacks the balance from a Souls game. That is to say, the balance of difficulty vs frustration, which is what keeps the player playing, that feeling of ""Man, i got my♥♥♥♥♥kicked, but i totally made some mistakes, and i can do better"", not ""Hey this boss will 2 shot me no matter what happens unless I play perfectly for the next 5 mins"" and ""Why am i fighting 5 enemies on a bunch of narrow platforms, this is cheap and makes me feel bad!"". Im a patient man, having just finished casually speedrunning DS3, beating Doom on Nightmare (which was hard as ♥♥♥♥, but so fun!), but this game will test the patience of any gamer i can think of. Be wary of this game, as it will crush your soul so hard, youll boot up a Kane and Lynch game while cutting yourself for reprieve.-Rebuff			"

												Salt and SanctuaryBoy oh boy where to begin.Let me start by saying that this game is absolutely amazing and the perfect spritual decendent of Dark/Demon Souls. You will find yourself completely absorbed into the in-game world and grow to love, hate and fear the characters you meet over the course of the story. This game also allows so much diversity for any playstyle you can think of. Want to be a walking tank that use heavy weapons, go for it. Want to be a mage with little armor, but punishes enemies from a distance, feel free. Want to be a gun and dagger weilding assassain, you can be. The options are literally endless. The only problem that exist, if it can even be classified as one, is that if you are underleveled or unprepared for an encounter, the game will have no mercy on you. You will spend all your time trying to beat that one troublesome boss and you will hate the game for a bit. But some will argue that that only makes the game better, and they honestly have a strong point.			"

												This game is pretty great. It has a good atmosphere, dark and gloomy, and I feel like the cartoonish art seems to help it. The lighting is also really good, The bosses also seem to reflect the atmosphere, they aren't exactly the cheeriest guys.The classes are also pretty great, even if the mage is way too overpowered. You got tank guys, warriors, mages, clerics, a great number of playstyles. I really like it, and it's definitely worth the $15 investment for such a good experience.However, one complaint: tree of Men. Anyone here familiar with the Dark Souls Boss, Bed of CHaos? The one that knocks you into pits 24/7?Imagine it, with an actual boss health bar, on a 2D game, where the safe platforms, there are flamethrowers, and axes being thrown at you. If this isn't the worst boss I've ever fought, then I'll pay you.			"

												Bought this game at the very end of Winter Sales cause I was intrigued, the reviews were quite high and the price was in my budget zone... so I went ahead even tho I wasn't really sure of my purchaseI seriously didn't expect what happened next...The game is simply put phenomenal. - Artstyle is perfeclty on point: gory and visceral during fights, sense of despair and suffering and decadence as you proceed traversing forgotten ruins, abandoned villages, foul marshes and pitch dark caves: fantastic!- Music and sound fx are good, even tho, for the latter, I wish weapons had a bit more of... ""viciousness"" to their sound and maybe more variations for monsters grunts and screams- Controls are absolutely great and responsive. No complains at all: everytime I died it was cause I royally screwed up my timing so it's always you and your fault only.- I loved every single level I played: the art style was always appropriate and never had the sensation that the devs got bored at some point designing their levels (I really loved the color scheme and the art of Hagar's Cavern). Also, levels were nice to explore and very satisfying when a secret room or treasure were found... and I absolutely loved the Vertigo brand :)- Great variety of monsters! and the majority of them pose an actual treat (dam you Spindlebeasts and your cuteness!!). - Boss fights are (almost everytime) challenging and you'll find your controller (highly recommended btw) to have gained some dents here and there and that it's now even more ergonomic as it perfectly allows your phalanxes to rest easily where you previously squeezed so bad trying to deliver the final blow. Such unstressful fights!- Replayability is quite high in my opinion, as the game gives you a very wide skill tree to fiddle with (you can respec too: not limitless but it allows you to re-adjust stuff) and allows different approaches each time you play.Really.. I can't recommend this game highly enough.A must have!			"

Not to mention the fact that on multiple forums or places I've gone, mainly steam, ign or s&s wiki; the devs are there to give a response! How awesome is that alone. I think their feedback and involvement in the gaming it self is HUGE compared to most games where any developer is nowhere to be found.On to S&S..ratings:Graphics/Art: 9 - I'm a harsh critique but also a DIE HARD fan of souls games, namely...you guessed it dark souls =]. But what Ska brings to this game is a wide variety of environments and detail, not necessarily engaging with; but combating and fighting to breath through. Anytime you make it past a certain zone or boss, the next area is a complete new feel with entirely different monster's and atmosphere.Sound/Music: 9 - The music fits the bill, end of story. If you want to put your headphones on and rock out to some Underoath or August Burns Red, then it won't harm you one bit in the aspect of needing to hear the timing of enemy movements or shots.Controls (Controller based): 8 - I bought this game on PC and PS4, for both i used a controller. The controls in this game are right on as far as whats important slotted where. The only issue i have with controls, since i consider HUD/inventory...stuff like that a 'controller' in the game, is that the INCANTATIONS have GOT to have their own mechanism under a controller or keyboard. Some boss fights, regardless of my ""class"" (paladin, hunter, mage....i've made quite a few), i end up ""searching"" with d-pad right/left for my potion or incantation to use in the mix of potentially 10 items.Replay value: 10 -  10....If you like souls games, the ONE (for arguments sake, lets call it 'issue' with dark souls is that, I myself, too often want to play multiple classes and try multiple spells or weapons or whatever it is). The length of this game is great in the sense that you can do that, and not get tired out of the gameplay itself. The mobs won't get overly boring, or bosses either.Uniqueness: 8 - I was debating on 7 for this one. I understand they reference dark souls multiple times and the game it self is a reference to that, but since the beginning of games, games are based on another. There are always outstanding, but just like music its hard to think of a entirely new lyric and rhythmic song when you have tour favorite band stuck in your head. And the way Ska brought upon this phenomenal 2d RPG game is amazing. But it is majorly based on dark souls IN MY OPINION.Difficulty: 9 - This category can be widely disputed especially when your talking about new game plus and so on. With that being said, i feel the BASE difficulty is a great start to ease the player into the game as well as add plenty of bosses with different move sets and resistances to categories of damage that it makes the player adjust accordingly. Overall a bravo to Ska for their time and effort invested in this game, i certainly hope of the idea of entire expansions or anything of that sort added in the future. Great job Ska. "

												Just bought this game because watching the trailer i loved the style. It reminded me a lot of a game called The Dishwasher:Dead Samurai and Vampire Smile, which when i saw SkaStudios knew instantly that this game shares a lot of the charm i loved in The Dishwasher:Dead Samurai and Vampire Smile., Highly recommend this game as well as The Dishwasher:Dead Samurai and Vampire Smile. Ska Studios is awesome!			"

												TL:DRHoly crap. Rarely do I come across a game this amazing (especially now that Steam is one step up from Google Play), and I've played thousands of games in my 35 years. Its a 2d Metroidvania RPG. If you dont know what that means, go back to gamer school cuz I don't have time to explain it here. This game is awesome, period. Ive been playing for 4 hours at this time, and I feel like I've barely scratched the surface of what this game offers._________________________________________________________________ Its amazing, probably one of if not the best Metroidvanias I've ever played. Chars are very customizable, theres plenty of weapons, armor, and magic to choose from. And each item has an awesome description in the inventory. I'm a sucker for world-building like that.  You even get to choose a god, which affects certain things. You can change your god too, but your first god wont like that unless you get forgiven. The graphics beautifully are done in a really unique hand drawn style, not quite standard cell shaded and they are f'n perfect for the tone and setting. The game's tone is pretty dark. Lots of blood splatting out, undead and gross monsters shambling about, gore, dead bodies and so on. Char development is done skill tree style (more like skill web), Its pretty fluid - you can make many different pure builds, hybrid builds, or jack of all trades build work. You can cosmetically customise your char when you start out too, which is awesome as most Metroidvanias have a set protagonist. Theres many different classes to pick from when you start, but that only sets your start - like I said the skill tree is really fluid. Want a thief that uses magic? Go for it. A Paladin that doesnt use heavy armor but relies on speed? Yep. Anything is possible. Of course, some builds are easier to play than others - theres plenty of guides out there to assist with builds if youre overwhelmed. But the game is balanced enough that as long as you understand the base mechanics, you should be able to make any build workI was really surprised that its a PS4 port, because it actually works - no bugs, lags, glitches or anything so far that you typically find in ports. The controls are well done, and both K+M & controller are fully customizable (THANK YOU DEVS! I dont have to rant about people with physical disabilities and non mappable controllers in this review!). Theres a slight annoyance lining up your char to pick something up or go down a ladder on rare occasions, but its so very minor that it really isnt a big deal. Other the controls are pretty well done, although theres no way to interrupt an attack/roll/etc once you start, so youre committed and there appears to be a slight (intentional)  lag when using a healing potion which can really suck with a monster in your face. But you'll get the timing down pretty fast. You'll need it. Dying is handled decently, as some areas and battles can be difficult. Theres ""sanctuaries"" (save points/rooms) and when you die, the enemy takes your salt (xp) and you lose some gold. Go get your salt back by killing the enemy, and youre good as new, minus a little gold.If you say you like Metroidvanias, theres no way your library can be complete without this game.			"

												Quite literally the 2d reincarnation of our beloved Dark souls. It'll have you banging your head on your desk and or giving your keyboard the licking of a life time. The environment is just as much if not more your enemy than the npc mobs and bosses. I'd give this game a 7/10 only because it's missing some key features (online co-op/PvP) and the occasional broken mechanic ( I-frames bugging out or getting stuck on enemies) . Overall this game is well worth the price and the challenge. If you can handle it. Hoping for more online features soon.			"

												   Christ I love this game. From the moment I got it I was hooked. This game took over my life for a couple of weeks, and I honestly don't mind. The easiest way review this game without constantly gushing about it is with a pros and cons list so lets get started. (Keep in mind this is coming from someone with no Dark Souls experience so there's not gonna be any references to that)PROS:- The combat is very refined. You can tell a lot of love went into making it.- Animation is really smooth. - The boss fights are super fun and can get really intense.- There's a lot to chose from when it comes to weapons, armour, and magic.- A lot of the enemy design is really cool.- Offline Co-Op, because who doesn't love that.- Really high replay valueCONS:- Keyboard controls are god awful- Occasional cheap bosses that will frustrate the hell out of you- The music is just kind of... there. Nothing really memorable of even that good. Mediocre at best.NEUTRAL:- The art style tends to be hit or miss with most people. Some like me find it charming, while others find it to be eh.- This game is incredibly hard. If that doesn't appeal to you then you might as well move along now.- If you like a strong story in a game aswell as good gameplay then this might not be for you. The story feels like it's just there to be there   Overall this is a beautifully crafted game with hours upon hours of fun. The pros HEAVILY outweigh the cons. Pick up this game whenever you can. Salt and Sanctuaty gets a 9/10(P.S. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A CONTROLLER)			"

												If you do enjoy a fast paced game with Souls mechanics and a Rpg leveling system with a Path of Exile themed skill-tree, this game is for you.The movements controls are a bit clumsy especially when they involve stairs (To let you go under or on them) but overall it's a pretty solid action game.I only reached the first boss and even when knowing his patterns thanks to Vaati's video I still died, at start it does feel easy, I won't lie, but then you do notice your HP bar bein' at like 10%, using one of these Red Shard potion, go into the next fight and die from your worst death because they don't heal you instantly like an Estus but progressively over time, that ♥♥♥♥ed me up hard especially considering the long animation to chug on them or the ""real"" Estus.This ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of a dog running straight for my throat totally got me aswell.To summarise it, a lot of games recently try to claim themselves ""Souls-Like"", which makes cringe a lot of players, but in my books, if Bloodborne was the Lovecraftian Darksouls we waited for, Salt and Sanctuary is the Tales of Grimm we never dreamed to ever recieve.It is grimm, a lot of carefull detail has been paid to the lighting of this game as much as the environement and you can tell it right off the boat.When Dks3 isn't keeping it's promises and waiting for Overwatch to kill my time, I turned myself to Salt and Sanctuary which -will- end up devouring hours.Thanks to the producers for this game, which is, in it's own right, a master-piece.

												If you've ever wished Dark Souls and Castlevania:SotN would get their freak on together, buy this game. Great gameplay and exploration that really fuses the best aspects of Souls-style games and Metroidvanias.Tough, deliberate, but fair combat. The right amount of hidden areas and backtracking once you unlock new skills. The skill tree system does a great job blending both hard requirements to use equipment and stat balance.Already finished one playthrough, started a second character, and moving into NG+ with the first.Really hoping there's more content or sequels released just for how well this game was executed.

												I have been big fan of Souls series since the release of Demon’s Souls. The risk and reward style of gameplay along with slow and methodical combat was something that has just clicked so well with my love of horror games and RPGs. Having so far had no option to get PS4 and my PC being far too old, I had to skip out on Dark Souls 3, but I am keeping an eye on indie titles that take heavy inspiration from the From Software’s series such as Dark Maus, Eitr and Salt & Sanctuary. Finally after four months of waiting PC gamers has gotten the chance to get their hands on Salt & Sanctuary, probably the most promising independent endeavour to copy the Souls series’ formula.Overall Salt & Sanctuary is a great game with minor flaws such as unwieldy UI or boss difficulty being rather low or easily exploitable, yet one broken mechanic makes speedrunning very fun.read the full review at: https://thegoodbadgaming.com/2016/05/23/review-salt-sanctuary/ "

												Definitely one of my new favorite games and easily the best platformer i've ever played. I went into this game expecting an homage to dark souls and i got that and so much more. the combat system, the salt used for levelling up and upgrading equipment, the sparse story told through item descriptions and npc interactions...it's jsut so lovely and perfect. the many sanctuaries around the world that can be upgraded with various npcs that provide various services as well as area bonuses. like dark souls, salt and sanctuary has something like covenants (called creeds) that you can level up in and collect bonuses from. the skill tree is massive and reminds me of path of exile's humungous skill tree. regardless of your starting class, salt and sanctuary allows you to create a fully customizable character that can be proficient in anything. i really like the branding system. i've only found 2 'brands' so far, but one allows me to use certain obelisks to reverse gravity in certain areas and walk on the ceiling. the other allows me to jump off walls. i'm sure there are more out there and i'm curious to see how they help me progress through the world. the 2D platforming nature of salt and sanctuary combines with the branding system to allow for more vertical gameplay than dark souls could pull off. i also really like the way you can unlock shortcuts between the sanctuaries and that there are even little hidden checkpoints that act like sanctuaries and restore your health/potions while on the way to certain bosses. the 2D nature also gives a certain advantage to the bosses in that they only have to attack in one of 2 directions. it adds a certain level of challenge to not being able to dodge left or right, but only forward and back. the many different weapons have their own attack patterns that add some depth to the combat and the fact that you can transmute them into other, potentially more powerful weapons is pretty amazing.all in all, i can honestly say that i like this game as much as the souls games. if you like dark souls and platformers, don't wait-just get it. the only downside to this game is that there's no multiplayer. but there's local co-op, which is almost as good.

												If you want to play Dark Souls III, but you are short on money, buy this game.If you want to play Dark Souls III, but your PC can't run it, but this game.If you want to play Dark Souls III, but you keep dying and you are salty... Get this game instead. You'll still be dying a lot and you'll be salty as ♥♥♥♥, but hey, at least it's not Dark Soul III. Close enough, though. Picture yourself something between castlevania and dark souls in 2d. That's pretty much it... Yeah. A lot of weapons, spells, skills, huge areas to explore, bosses to kill, places to die in, covenants to join, etc. It's pretty fun. I loved how covenants work, btw. You join one and you can claim safehouses in the name of your covenant and recruit people in there. Traders, mages, blacksmiths, etc. Be adviced, though... There is no online game (At least, so far), but you can play locally with a friend on same PC if you get yourself a sellsword NPC in your sanctuary.It's a good game. Took me a while to buy it, since I payed and cancelled my credit card (Had to save for it from skins/cards/drops sales and it's totally worth it). So, to keep it short...Tl/Dr: Good game, good price, good combat, good ambient, enemies and areas. I'd say it's a 9/10. Do recommend.			"

												A very good take on Metroidvania with the look and feel of Dark Souls. Usage of 2D instead of 3D creates enough novelty for the experience to be pleasant and not feel like a straight copy. I found some ideas to actually be better than From Software's IP: the name dropped sanctuaries for instance or the addition of a small level-up bar on the bottom left of the UI. Lore/Story was pretty clever and felt really well laid out through the levels, NPCs and item descriptions. I felt it was much tighter than Dark Souls' sequels on that specific point.The only real issue I have with S&S is the lack of luminosity backed by a palette of blurry greys. It all comes together as a dire choice between burning you retina or halving your DPS/dropping your shield by lighting on a torch in your spare hand.A tenner well spent.			"

												I feel like all the negative things I read about this game reflect some of my favorite aspects of it.  It can be quite difficult and frustrating, especially the leveling/currency system - you lose all your xp since last time you leveled (you can only lvl if you make it to a sanctuary) and 10% of your money when you die - but this challenge just makes the game that much more fun and rewarding (I'm sure there's a quote about how death makes life worth living or something out there somewhere).  I've rarely experienced such a sense of joy and relief as I do after trudging through a dark dungeon full of difficult foes, bloodied and fatigued, sure that my next encounter will cost me my life, my salt, and my gold, and then.. through the next door.. could it be? Yes! Sanctuary!Yea, the character/class system is sort of simple.. but not THAT simple.. I've definitely played much simpler.  I love building characters and enjoy a lot of options when doing so, and this game still satisfied that desire.  There is still a considerable web of passive skill nodes to choose from, the web is just pretty straightforward in this game and not at all overwhelming. I don't mind overwhelming personally, I like my skill trees as complex as possible, but sometimes its nice to not have to think for 30 minutes every time you level up.  I still had a lot of fun making my character while playing through this game, and I'm already excited about building a different class on my next play through.The music is awesome.The atsmophere is great.  I've never felt so immersed in a 2D environment before (except when I was playing Hotline Miami maybe). Some people have complained about the lack of map and complicated level design - it's called exploration people. This game actually gives you a sense of it for once it instead of spoon-feeding you every step of the way. The world (island) is surprisingly large and intricate, especially considering it's all 2D. There's all sorts of interesting places to explore, and you have to keep running all over the place the entire time, checking for new paths you might have missed or been unable to traverse previously, instead of just going straight ahead the entire time.Yea, I don't know what else to say.. this is one of the better RPGs I've played in recent memory (and I play a lot of RPGs). For what it is I would give it a 10/10.  I have no complaints (which is rare, trust me)!			"

												Salt and Sanctuary is a 2D action adventure game that is basically like a hybrid of Dark Souls gameplay with a bit of Castlevania sprinkled in. It is a bit of a Metroidvania game but like Dark Souls it has no minimap and the difficulty is hard enough that you will die plenty.The game's art style may seem iffy when starting the game; it's a bit sketchy and looks a little like a flash game, but make no mistake - the game itself is absolutely massive. It's easily the size of your typical Castlevania game and the slower paced gameplay makes it seem even larger. Considering the size and scope of the game which rivals Dark Souls series, it's a bargain even at the non-sale price.The gameplay has about the same pacing as Dark Souls in its combat, and it also has the ability to block, and roll, amongst other things. However, a minor qualm is that sometimes enemy attacks aren't telegraphed that well in advance, making them hard to dodge in time. Besides that, though, it does one of the best approximations of Souls combat in 2D and features a ton of different types of builds.The amount of platforming in the game is more significant than souls, which I suppose makes up for the fact that you can't really fall off ledges in a 2D game unless there is a lot of platforming. I think they went a little overboard with it, falls probably killed me more times than actual enemies, unless you count enemies hitting you off ledges as being ""killed"" by one.The amount of lore in the game is quite nice and the game is more text heavy than your typical action indie game, with each inventory item having a ton of lore and even the level up screen having segments of legendary tomes. But, like Dark Souls, it doesn't interrupt the game unless you wish to read the lore. The lore itself, however, is quite solid.This game is basically what that cheap Dark Souls ripoff Slashy Souls SHOULD have been. An amazing version of Souls in 2D that pretty much has everything a fan of dark action games should want.Overall the game is fun and the people who will get the most kick out of it are those who have played the Souls series and are looking for more similar gameplay. However, anyone looking for an extremely fun Metroidvania should also give it a try.			"

												So I'm a big fan of the Souls series so when I saw this game, I had to have it. Salt and Sanctuary follows a simple premise, you're a warrior out on a quest to save a princess, like I said it's simple. When players start they'll notice a lot of similarities between this game and Dark Souls. For instance the UI has a similar makeup. It's simple and to the point. The character creation screen is also similar to Dark Souls in that you can create your class, origin, starting gift. The artwork of this game is really nice in my opinion, it has a very dark feel to it though the character's faces leave much to be desired. There is actually music that plays throughout the game, something that we haven't seen in Dark Souls which for this game is a welcomed aspect. There is a slight learning curve if you're familiar with the Souls games, the switch from 3D to 2D makes it apparent. However, if you're familiar with metroidvania games like this then it won't be too difficult to transition, just come in with an empty cup. This game isn't necessarily easy but it's also not necessarily hard. It's a little difficult getting started but once you do it eases up. You will probably have to grind in some sections just so you can level up and apply black pearls (skill points). Speaking of the skill system, it's pretty open. It reminds me of the Sphere Grid in Final Fantasy X, actually it's almost exactly like that. For those of you who don't know, you level up and for each level you get a black pearl or skill point which you can apply to things like Dexterity, Strength, Magic, or even a mastery like Heavy Armor. Multiplayer is a lot of fun in this game but unfortunately it's only available in shared screen so you'll have to be in the same room with each other and have an extra controller. You can access multiplayer by having a ""Stone Sellsword Statue"", once you do you need to place it in YOUR sanctuary, think of sanctuaries like bonfires. Once the statue is placed you can choose another character in your game for your buddy to play as. I've seen it mentioned before but there is no mini-map, your best bet is to make note, try to remember, or see if you can find a map online to follow. You will get lost, you will come to the same place over and over again. I've caught myself doing it a few times already. Combat is simple like Dark Souls and you'll recognize that as well. The bosses are interesting, some of them are tough, some are frustrating, and some are a complete waste of space. Overall, if you enjoy Dark Souls or metroidvania games then you will enjoy Salt and Sanctuary, period.			"

												Truly a beautiful game. I played it for a bit and it just amazes me how it could turn from  ambient peace  to  GTFO  in a short span time (falling off platforms, being an idiot, and unicorns). I never played dark souls before (I only saw some videos) but I can clearly see how this game looks like it. The art style is amazing, the controls are alright, and it never crashed during my playthrough.			"

												Salt and Sanctuary is an amazing game especially for those who are a fan of Souls like games. I myself have completed Dark souls 2 and Dark Souls 3 and when I first saw Salt and Sanctuary, I was very skeptical about it being 2D and not 3D. Fortunatley the game plays smoothly and rewards the player if they explore and go out of their way to look for more loot and side areas. The boss fights are definitaley not easy and take many many many tries, first boss took me 9 tries before I finally defeated and boy did it feel rewarding. This game is worth every penny unfortunatley there are some flaws about this game, one of the main flaws is that there is no multiplayer but that can easily be looked over cause this is game that I can either spend a few minutes or hours on at a time before going to play with friends. Next problem is the game always shows controls in xbox or playstation icons not on keyboard which is not that bad of a problem but nontheless it is denfinitaley annoying. In conclusion Salt and Sanctuary is great for the player who wishes to spend a small amount of time on a game then move on to play with friends or another game. It has good graphics and an interesting design with a smooth combat system and a wide variety of areas and enemies, I highly recommend this game to anyone including those out of the Soul series that are searing for a challenge.

												I know it has been said many times already but this game really does feel like 2-D darksouls. You have a roll, a similar saving mechanism, and insane difficulty. Even the atmosphere is similar. This game shouldn't just be written off as a Dark Souls clone though, it has its own unique quirks to offer such as the skill tree which is pretty cool how you can choose how your character changes and of course it is a platformer which is a completely different style. Overall 8.5/10 for me. 10/10 if you really like difficult games.			"

												A game that combines Castlevania-style platforming Metroidvania gameplay with the timing-and-execution based weighty combat of the Dark Souls/Bloodborne series of games.And go figure, it actually pulls it off rather well. The Souls games have often been compared to 3D Castlevania, and this basically feels like it's looped all the way back to its sources. And it feels good.The vertical nature of exploration in a 2D game adds a fresh spin to fans of the Souls series (and loads of deaths by falling), whereas those coming from traditional Metroidvanias will enjoy the challenge of a more in-depth combat system from what they might be used to.Pros:+Good map design, lots to explore and plenty of area variety+Loads of area interconnectivity and secrets+Plenty of weapon variety including special hybrid weapons like Sword Whips and others; most playstyles are viable (yes, even cleric builds; looking at you, Dark Souls 3)+An excellent translation of Souls-like combat into 2D, very satisfying+Skill tree allows for flexible builds without pigeonholing you into certain loadouts (e.g. needing Strength for Greatshields in Souls games), weapons do not have stat requirements+Local Co-op+Asynchronous Multiplayer features suchs as gravestones and corpses of other players, and a robust message system+In-game Challenge system increases replay value for skilled players+Lots of lore sprinkled about, not in your face but it's there if you know where to look+Good price for the amount of game you get+You can parry with a gunshot!Cons:-The complete lack of a map may be daunting for fans of traditional Metroidvanias-Fast travel is available a little too easily and early in my opinion, somewhat devaluing area interconnectivity at times-Weapon tiering feels a little arbitrary-Some platforming segments can get frustrating due to requiring precise jumps-Character art is... stylized. Very stylized. You might want to wear a mask or full helmet.-No inventory sorting options, items are sorted in order of pickup, no storage box-Local Co-op currently denies certain key items for player 2, not recommended to use a main character for Co-op-No direct online multiplayer			"

Genre: 2D/Metroidvania/Dark Souls likeThis game is a Dark Souls clone, but it's also a metroidvania game, which means that you can go back to areas you already visited, and get some items that you couldn't get before, but can now with some new unlocked abilities, etc. Game has a big open world to explore, smooth and fun gameplay, and fun abilities. As for boss fights, only few of them were good in my opinion, rest were meh and most of them were easy. And this was really disappointing to me. But I guess, you can't do boss fights much better in 2D, though they could have at least improved bosses design, because only few of them look nice, while last boss looks epic. 3 of 4 last boss fights were pretty good though. Other big disappointment to me was a design of the whole world. World is boring, gloomy, dark, and in my opinion could be done much better. All areas are kinda similar. All in all, this is an amazing metroidvania game, but if I analyze it as a Dark Souls clone too, it's not that amazing, but it's still pretty good.And why exactly is this game a Dark Souls clone? Well you have stamina bar and stats like in Dark Souls. You have salt instead of souls, boss ears instead of boss souls, sanctuaries and shrines instead of bonfires. Creeds instead of covenants etc. Also you can parry(but you can't backstab), etc.Verdict: Amazing metroidvania game, pretty good Dark Souls clone. Boss fights and areas could be done better, but few of boss fights were pretty good though. Has smooth and fun gameplay and big open world to explore. If you want an amazing metroidvania game, get this, if you want a good Dark Souls clone, get this too. All in all, a pretty good game.Personal rating: 7.5/10 "

There are quite a number of mechanic problems and enemy layouts/designs that needs some serious work but its still a really good game and definitely worth that 16 dollar price tag.			"

												There is actually not a lot more to say to what thousands of enthusiastic reviewers wrote before me about this great game which I fully recommend hereby!Salt and Sanctuary is a great 2D Dark Souls. It transfers the game mechanic, atmosphere and difficulty perfectly fine into a 2D platformer world. The graphics might be sometimes a bit pale, but very lovely in the end.For someone like me that loves Darks Souls, although I have never finished a single one - shame on me - sometimes it is so difficult to get into it again after a certain pause -, this is just one of the best 2D platformers on Steam right now. How did they catch so well all of the Dark Souls spirit?All my respect. I had a lot of work to do for tonight, but instead of going on with it I lost myself in this great game for 3 hours straight. Damn it.			"

												So, just completed the game, then went through the whole thing again on new game plus. I have to say, this is one of the most enjoyable games i have ever played. As a fan of the Souls series, i was a little skeptical about Salt and Sanctuary at first, but as soon as i had killed the first boss, all of those doubts where gone. S&S perfectly captures the feeling and atmosphere of any of the Dark Souls games, despite this being 2D and a platformer. For a game only costing £13, i got 44 hours out of it on one character with NG+. Its also the first game ive ever played that ive wanted to get 100% achievments with, so really tried to get everything done. Every boss is enjoyable and fair (Except the witch of the lake, screw her), every area is very fun and enjoyable, and the platforming and jumping puzzles are hard enough to push you to keep trying ever when you fail. The soundtrack is amazing, especially the final boss track. Also, with two endings to get, it really gives you a reason to play NG+, aside from the added challenge of course.I really cannot recommend this game enough. For the amount of play time you get, its well worth the £13, and honestly, i would be more than happy to pay upwards of £30 for this masterpiece.Praise The Salt!			"

												""Dark Souls is difficult but fair, S&S is unfair in it's difficult"" is what a most these negative reviews say. Dark Souls fair? Maybe I'm unlucky, but I've come to many garbage short comings in dark souls, and S&S is no differnet. Both games have their bugs, though dark souls has much more in my experience. Now don't get me wrong, I love dark souls I've played the first for 150 hours and the third for 300 hours, the second... like 40, but I'm not here to talk about how much I love Dark Souls. I'm here to debunk alot of these negative review complaints.Git gud.In all seriousness, people have complained about the dodge mechanic. Yeah, it's not easy to use, but it's not easy in dark souls 2. You learn how to make it effective. I've made a character that can dodge everything; once you understand the mechanic it becomes very easy. Folks have also complained about the blocking, in which I rebutle with, ""What?"" if anything, the blocking is overpowered. Some have argued against the skill tree, but they don't provide enough info on why they hate it; the skill tree system seem pretty good to me. Some one eve complained about stamina, just raise you're willpower, that increase stamina. others have complained about health, which raises through overall level and not alot. If you wanna tank get some solid armor and upgrade it, at nearly 300 hp I can soak a♥♥♥♥♥♥load of damage with heavy armor. Another complaint is that you can't finish the game with starting gear, I disagree. People have also said that the keyboard controls are♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ yee they are, but you can rebind them to fit your needs. My last point is that the game isn't even that hard. I had a harder time in the first Dark Souls.So to close my stupid rant with, Git Gud.

Personally I hate platforms, but this game is amzing, plus I have loyalty to Ska Studios, I've loved their games for a while. only platforms I ever play: Dish Washer was good, Vampire Smile was good, ZP2K9 and ZP2KX where Amazing, and I Made A Game With Zombies In It was hilarious but also not a platformer.

												Fantastic 2D Dark Souls clone with superb level design, a large dose of platforming, a dash of Metroid and a difficulty level that's just right (most of the time). There's the rare control issue mostly to do with animation timings but nothing you can't adapt around the few times you'll run into it.			"

												This game is pretty great. The controls are solid, the weapons are fun, the art style is cool (except for peoples faces, which are froglike at best), and every single thing you can click on has a lore-filled description.HOWEVER!Just like the Dark Souls games, which this game is heavily inspired by, it has some janky-ness.One of the big things in this game is platforming, as you would expect, and for the most part, it's pretty fun. But there are aloooooooot of ways to fall down plattforms. And there is no silver cat ring. If you like heavy armor, prepare to learn the laws of gravity. There is no feeling quite as sad as realizing you won't make a jump across the abyss because you forgot to take your shirt off.Also, not a huge fan of certain bosses having 4 nanoseconds long windups for certain attacks, but that's just a minor thing.Oh, and The Red Hall of Cages can go suck every single phallic object in a 94 mile radius.

												So I randomly stumbled across this when I was done with Dark Souls 3, and I was feeling a bit empty inside since I had few interesting things to play. I figured I'd give it a shot, as the graphics looked appealing to me. Overall I'd say this is a good game, with a rather good character progression system, and a great gear system. Some fights can be a bit irritating, as large enemies have a tendency to push you back a lot, and even block you off from certain areas. My main irritation so far has been the boss fights, as the ones I've done so far (6 or 7) have been kind of lackluster. They start out with a set of moves, and progressively as the fight goes on, they just become faster. I'd much rather have phases in the fight, rather than linear difficulty progression, and adding new moves when you reach said phase would make it a lot more interesting.That being said, I can definitely recommend this game if you enjoy combat-heavy metroidvania games, and liking the Souls series doesn't hurt.

												Was looking for some metroidvania, stumbled upon Salt and Sanctuary from Ska Studios who made The Dishwasher back in the day, and was very pleasantly surprised!This game is really good, just finished it after 24 hours and started my new game plus. It really plays like a Castlevania game with elements from Dark Souls/Demon Souls. Really like the artwork, altough a little strange at first it really has its own style.All the bosses were varied and challenging. The music is pretty sparce and I would have liked to have more soundtrack for more variety but the music that is there is very fitting and works great.If this was a AAA game there would already be a sequel in the making, but I ask myself, what would I want from a sequel from this game. It pretty much got everything I want from it, even Local Co-Op.I am one happy gamer daddy and higly recommend this game.Good job Ska Studios!			"

I was confused for a long time about how to claim an empty sanctuary so I was playing with pretty much no check points and I was like WTF this game is really hard.			"

												You explore connected areas in the classic Metriodvania style, the bosses have distinct strengths, weaknesses, and behaviors intentionally similar to Bloodsouls-Darkborne, and the character progression is satisfying.The game may seem difficult at first, especially with that Witch of the Lake, but after I went through the trouble of over-gearing myself, the game went from hard to laughably easy. The bosses really aren't that tough when you step back and actually prepare for them.I can easily recommend this game for its asking price.			"

												The best mix of Metroidvania and Dark Souls I've seen yet. First, there's many ways on how to sequence break (any%) your way to the ending. Next, you get tons of different weapon types to choose from, including bizarre ones like Sword Whip and Great Scissors. Finally, if you're especially masochistic (or seeking a more difficult challenge) you can set built-in challenges from character creation for even more replayability; there's NG+ as well. Heard the game was on sale, and I sincerely recommend you give this game a shot.			"

												A fantastic combination of Dark Souls and a Metroidvania game. Like the Souls games it is inspired by, Salt and Sanctuary features an in-depth dark fantasy story that requires going beyond playing the game to fully understand. The bosses and enemies feel unique and terrifying. Exploring previously explored areas with new abilities nets you interesting new items.The one major complaint that I have is some balancing issues. Some weapon types are just worse than others. This can lead to finding some interesting weapons, only to find out they don't work very well. Most of the time, however, this isn't really a problem.This game is a fantastic combination of some of my favorite genres. If you are not a fan of Metroidvanias or Dark Souls-like games, you probably won't like this, but if you do even a little, I would completely recommend this game.			"

												This is the best game of the year, period. I don't think anything will change that, at least for me.I sunk good 24 hours to finish my first go on it, and oh god, was it satisfying.Everything, starting from controls (gamepad recommended) and graphics, ending with boss design is flawless. The game is insanely difficult, and there were moments where I had to do some grinding, specially prior to the last boss, but every encounter felt different somehow. Which, imo, is a good sign.I, myself, am not a hardcore gamer, but not a single time did I felt frustrated in any way.Extra props for the soundtrack. Especially that final location. So good.I do highly recommend this game if you enjoy Dark Souls and Castlevania. Can't wait for the DLC. Make it happen!			"

Product received for free
Disclaimer:Product received for free for reviewing purposesSka Gaming experimented with the style of Dark Souls and the result is very pleasant. Through the 2D platforming logic of Salt & Sanctuary, we get a roguelike feeling that follows the footsteps of From Software, together with the graphics identity of Ska Gaming, which gives the studio’s signature, we get a very good roguelike game that you definitely have to try out.Read the full review on Hyper Light Up[www.hyperlightup.com] "

												I'm a big Souls nut, everybody knows that.I've spent countless hours on the series as a whole, strarting with Demon's and ending with... Bloodbourne.I couldn't play DS3, not only because my system couldn't play it anymore without dying on me, but it also was a step back after DS2, and just not as fun for me as it was before.I needed a fix, and fast.And i found it in Salt & Sanctuary.Let me get it straight: i love Ska Studios, always loved.I adore their recognizable art design - dark, gruesome, and somewhat cartoony.And this game has it too, but it also has every good aspect that Souls had.But it's not a ripoff, oh now.This game has enough of it's own content to NOT be considerent a ripoff.First of all, this game has covenants too, yes, but now they're called Creeds and they're one of the basis of gameplay.You see, every Creed has it's own special things and specializes in different things.Every covenant even has their own replenishable healing items which act differently, and i'm not even talking about abillity to get into your posession through covenant leader such things as Stamina recoverers, throwable items and buff items, which all replenish when visiting the Sanctuary (but only of your own creed, every other creed's sanctuary will have the items that you may got while working for them).Or, what about combat?It's much more awesome than in Souls.Not only you can do secret COMBOS with almost any weapons, it also has two different ways of parrying (traditional and bloodborne method that actually now works with crossbows too) AND you can attack in air.Leveling Up became much more complicated. Much. More.With every level you now get a Pearl that you can use to get nods in you Skill tree. Each nod has something different, like raising your one stat by one point, up to 3 on one node, or leveling up your specialty in, for example, whips, which also raises your agility by some points. Yes, now you don't need stats to wield someithng, but you need to be more leveled in that category, which even includes armor. I don't really like that much, but it's interesting, at least it's different from souls.Everything in the skill tree, even the ammount of healing items you can carry (you can also raise them at Creed's leader, though, but only for a creed).Also, i could say that this game is really a metroidvania, it even has abillities which needed for progression, like wall jump. Which is cool, i like that.But the most important part in this game for me was it's lore, world, plot, all that.I won't say much but i'm really, really interested in this world. I want to know more. About the island, about the world, about salt, about everything.This game is my favourite ""Souls"" game right now, and probalby will be forever.I'm deeply in love with it, and i can not recommend it enough.Good work, Ska Studios.p.s. WHERE'S THE DISHWASHER? I WAS WAITING FOR IT FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW SINCE THAT INCIDENT HAPPENED, WHERE IS IT?!			"

												For a Dark Souls clone is sure is well made, it is difficult like Dark Souls, except, this game is even More difficult, considering that the enemies cannot be walked through...and being a 2D game you cannot walk around them, so you gotta either roll or jump (if they are small enough) to get past them, wich isnt always a possibility when the bosses are ganking your into a wall and not giving you the chanse to ♥♥♥♥ing roll out of the way!so thats something that needs to be changed, theres fair, challenging and OMFG GET OFF ME!!and this game is the latter word.what it could also use is the Dark Souls Boss Doors that stops your from just runing into a boss room and being trapped, some might argue that its ""obvius"" but since it is a dark souls clone and everything looks grim and putrid, its not that easy to spot what is and isnt a boss room, sooo if you got a ton of salt and you accidentaly step into a boss room that youre not prepared for, well sucks for you, you just lost all your salt!atleast dark souls/bloodborn gave you a clear warning that its a boss room, this game srly need that.so if anyone reading this is a Dark Souls fan or just a saddist who loves to torture themselves, then this game is for you.Yes i hit Recommend because if you are what was stated up below, then it is a recommendation, if youre not, then well, the reviews would probably throw you off eitherway.

												It's basically Dark Souls but in 2D. That's... not bad at all honestly. The game has a great artstyle that brings out the whole grim feeling that you'd get while playing Dark Souls. The human characters (yours and NPCs) look weirdly out of place but I guess there is some reason for that somewhere, seen as the rest of the models look okay.Combat rewards both the fast paced gameplay and the methodical and slow approach, though since the game has only two dimensions, it becomes trickier to move around in case you screw up. Generally you can perform some cool moves both on the ground and in the air, like a beat-em-up game so to speak, but you also have a Stamina meter.Thing is that I felt like my ""dodging"" options were limited, but it promotes other ideas like parrying and blocking, which you'll need since enemies can go into attacking loops.Something to concider would be the leveling system and how you can unlock certain perks on the Tree Skill that they have going on. Instead of a bland ""+1 on stat"", you get to unlock which weapons you can wield, which armour you can wear, etc etc. I'd argue that leveling up in this game feels more rewarding than Souls games due to your required control over your character's build.But overall, it just comes down to whether you would be okay with a 2D Souls-like game or not. Personally, I was not, but I didn't think the game was bad.			"

												This game is basicly a 2D Dark Souls. with out being Dark Souls.If you like Dark Souls you'll have an easier time understanding what I'm trying to say in my review.This game is alot like Dark Souls the combat centers around timed blocking rolling and attacking with a heavy emphasis on patience and stamina management. However there are ALOT of diffrences between this game and Dark Souls. Firstly is the 2D layout which changes everything in removing a dimension the develeopers added everything that makes this game shine.The maps are more focused on vertical climbing with a hefty dose of platforming you just couldn't fit into a 3D game.The map layout is also much much easier to memorise with it removing a whole movement axsis and being desgined in one of the easiest memory formats.as I said above theres more platforming in this game which is why there are also special ablities called ""brands"" which are just awesome and fun to use and give the game a sort of MetriodVenia feel as you explore around and aquire the ablity to walk on walls or turn light into bridges or kickflip off walls.Another huge change from Dark Souls is the currency system. In this game there are two main Currencies Gold, and Salt. Salt is your EXP used to upgrade your weapons armor and charter ablities and Gold is used to buy new weapons and armor.Theres Also the titular Sanctuaries which are neat little areas that the player can customise to an extent. Each Sanctuary is detecated to a creed the player can choose to join this new creed or invade the Sanctuary and take it over claiming it for there own creed Sanctuaries belonging to the player's Creed can be customized alowing the player to choose what merchents go where as well as what Sanctuaries can be fast traveled too and a couple of other nifty things.The game world is also diffrent from Dark Souls in addition to being 2D the game shifts its focus to a world with a bigger focus on Seafairing soilders of the medevil ages as apposed to Dark Souls's more spiritualy focused world giving the game the feel of some kind of old timey Lovecraften horror story.Over all the game is good with a great soundtrack creative boss desgines a challenging diffculty and perhaps most importantly. the game is just fun.I'd tottaly recomend this game to any Dark Souls fan or just anyone looking for something diffrent.can't wait to see if the Dev ports Charlie Murder to Pc!

												After playing over 29.8 hours of Salt and Sanctuary, and over 9 characters later.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I still find it fun and challenging.  The tough enemies, limited heals, and vast world really helps to make the game enjoyable.  The combat is a real blast, and having to understand the enemies movesets, either makes or breaks you. =)It's great to see that there is more games transitioning to being difficult, instead of the ""easy holding your hands"" type of games that have been coming out alot lately.Pros-------------Salt and sanctuary is very fun.The combat is great and very player friendly. Customizable for any play style, and a nice challenge for those that like to play a tough game.The world is huge and there is lots of places to explore.Lots of different Creeds (covenants), in fact 7 of them currently.Cons-------------No Multiplayer Matchmaking  (at least there isn't currently)Parkour areas are very annoying and many times almost impossible.Some classes are better to choose than others, as the Mage, Paladin, and Hunter are the only classes with free points in the skill tree to start off with.Some bosses are too easy.--------------------------------------------------------------------------I highly reccomend this game to all gamers as it challenges you.  It is a great game to play and if there was Multiplayer, I believe this would be one of the best games out right now, and would easily beat Dark Souls 3.Good luck hunting some Salt!			"

												**I just completed Salt and Sanctuary with 100% of the achievements earned and it took me about 30 hours. With that being said, I think that I've seen all that this game has to offer and I find it hard to recommend this game to others.**This game clicked for me immediately from the moment that I started playing it. I defeated the optional tutorial boss after only a couple tries. The first boss is very powerful and can be difficult for a freshly created character to defeat. If you defeat the optional boss, you get some endgame upgrade materials and an achievement. This is similar to the opening for a Souls game and I just ignored that similarity at that time.After the first few bosses and some quick salt farming, I found that the game had a very similar gameplay loop to Dark Souls. You kill some enemies, collect salt, level up, kill the boss and unlock a shortcut to a previous part of the game. This is imitation as a form of artless flattery. The game has a wonderful art design but it just copies the Souls series a little too closely. After some time, you get the ability to place guides at your sanctuaries. These guides sell a horn consumable that you can use to teleport back to them. After returning to them, the Guides allow you teleport to any sanctuary your visited just by talking to them. This essentially invalidates the need to unlock all the shortcuts the game offers you. There's very little point to them and you get nothing like the relief and achievement you would feel unlocking a shortcut in Dark Souls.After some significant gameplay progress, I found that there was just too many similarities to the Souls games in general. Too many npcs and game mechanics were just copy and paste with a name change. It started to feel less like homage and more like plagiarism. Even the end of the game has a choice much like the first Dark Souls and it made the finale less satisfying to me because of that fact.The bosses have some issues as well. Because everything happens in 2D, it's just a matter of dodging through the boss and hitting them after they do an attack. I defeated almost all of the bosses on the first try. There was only a few at the end of the game that gave me some issues, and that was simply because they had homing projectile moves or grabs that did very high damage. If a boss was challenging, it felt like they were just cheap. There were very few unique boss mechanics, most of the bosses are just damage sponges. I can only recall a few bosses that required some thought and that was just because you were required to attack a spot that you wouldn't expect. One boss had minions attached to it you needed to defeat and another boss was a sentient weapon, the wielder was immune to damage.The next issue I had was the platforming. The jumps throughout most of the game were reasonable but the final few levels required far too many blind faith jumps. In the end it was just a matter of killing yourself until you memorized what path the devs expected you to take. It seems like they should have just taken a break and finished these final levels with fresh eyes. They are rushed and filled with artificial difficulty.The final thing that I'd like to point out is the music. It gets incredibly repetitive. It's very rare that I mute the music in a game. I had to do that with this one. The electric guitar felt out of place and I just got tired of hearing it. The boss fights use the same song until the last few fights at the end of the game. The sanctuary song never seems to change, it's always the same tune. The sounds in general were fine, except for one water dripping effect in caves that was very jarring and artificial.In closing, I'd definitely recommend this game on sale for 50% or greater. There's no doubt a fan of Metroidvanias would get his/her money's worth out of it. But I really want to impress upon others that as a complete experience, from beginning to end, this game is a flawed gem. It's similar to the Souls series but in a way that I found to be less than enjoyable.			"

												If you enjoy Dark Souls games, you will most likely enjoy this game as well, but don't expect a straight-up DS clone. There are a lot of important differences between the two, the most obvious difference being that S&S is 2D; of course there are differences in control schemes as well. S&S offers a bit more challenge imo and the lore is a lot more obscure to the point where you may not think it even has lore if you're not paying attention. Unlike DS, there is no clear path through S&S and there are significantly less items than DS. All things considered, this is a great game for a DS fan, but is quite a bit different from a traditional DS clone.			"

												Dark Souls + Metroidvania done right.I think it's fair to say that if you like these two genres, you are doing yourself a disservice if you don't play this game.What an incredible surprise this game was. Really blew me away. I bought this game on recommendation from some guys online who love Dark Souls and I was sort of worried I might not enjoy it... GAME IS SO GOOD!!!!- Tight controls, great combat - seriously great: Parry, Counters, Dodging, Combos, Magic (!!), good fighting requires learning about your opponent and calculating the right times to act and how to act.- Great level design (one giant world with lots of loops like Dark Souls 1 - very, very good!)- Magic is just great, really surprised me with this one. I decided to go mage and had a blast but also still had a good challenge.- METROIDVANIA!! Dark Souls + Metroidvania... I cannot stop weeping. Two of my favorite genres of game design... my tears are great.- Bosses... wow. This really got me. There are so many well designed bosses - not pushovers at all. Some are optional, but all of them are excellent.- The art. At first, I thought it was a little weird, but the art did grow on me. It's weird and creepy and perfect for this setting.- The lore! This is hidden mostly, kind of like Dark Souls (in the right ways). The strange bits are tied together near the end, though. Very interesting story as it turns out and I actually enjoyed it :)10/10, highly recommend			"

												I like this game, but I also don't like it. If there's anything this review should teach you, it's this : ""Salt and Sanctuary is a good game"". Now boy I have a lot of complaining to do.Have you played this nice little game called Dark Souls? It's pretty fun, you should give it a try. If you have played it and decided to see what Salt and Sanctuary had to offer, you might or might not realize that Dark Souls inspired a few elements and design decisions in this game. Did I say a few? I meant the whole thing. Bosses, gameplay, NPCs, builds, world, EVERYTHING looks like it could have been copy pasted from a real Souls game.I know this is all intended, I know you're supposed to see it as ""heavily inspired by Dark Souls"". But it just feels like theft, and makes the game look like it has no soul for me (Did you see what I just did there? Man I'm funny). Sure, the world and enemies are original, and the gameplay is kinda different because of the 2D. But the devs went too far in my opinion. There are mechanics from DS that have been implemented in S&S even though they make no sense : a sin system that does nothing (it had to do with multiplayer in DS), covenants (how useful), NPC quests (bad rewards and forgettable personalities), weapon scaling (doesn't work well at all with the tree of skill system)... And even when stolen design elements do work, they're still ripped off from another game, something I personally dislike very much.You could just say I'm making a big deal out of that whole Dark Souls thing, and that it doesn't really matter. 'cause the game is great. The world is good and connected, I really like the lore, the gameplay isn't bad, the music is neat, I shouldn't have that much to complain about to begin with. It's just that it all feels bittersweet. Okay I just have to mention this though. Am I the only one who finds some of the bosses' names funny? Like 12 year-old aspiring writer edgy? Hoo, the Crazed Alchemist, watch out he's crazy! Or the Untouched Inquisitor, who just made me laugh my♥♥♥♥♥off when I saw it (perfect name for a sexually frustrated priest in my humble opinion). No? Just me? Ok cool.To conclude  : if you don't like Dark Souls, don't play this game. If you haven't played Dark Souls, dude, you should. If you have played Dark Souls, it's very likely you'll like this game, if you don't mind the whole ""ripoff"" thing. Also ♥♥♥♥ the Witch of the Lake			"

												TL DR: Someone thought how Dark Souls would be as a metroidvania and made this game.I played this game months ago and playing it for a few hours made me rage so hard that I was even going to delete it. I wanted to give it another chance and now, I saw the true potential in it. Atmosphere	Dark and pessimistic rooms, blood and gore, destruction, dead people in the background, old and scary environment is what you will see in this game if you want to play it. It really gives you the feeling that this game is properly designed for its purpose, which is making you feel vulnerable. It makes you feel like you are always in a danger, which you almost always are. Carefully designed traps and map design also boost this feeling. Overall the atmosphere is way too good considering that this is a metroidvania game. If you enjoy horror games or the atmosphere in horror games, you will enjoy the scenery. Gameplay General idea of the game is that you have to die in order to win. Dying is not an end, instead it is a step for you to both improve yourself and improve your character. You collect what's called salts in order to buy skills and items that help you kill your enemies. If you die, you lose your salts to the enemy that killed you and you have to kill that creature in order to obtain your lost salts. Returning to the place that you died usually gives you more salt than before since every creature resets if you die or if you save the game in a checkpoint. Which is also good because that means you can farm salts with killing creatures using checkpoints.Most of the time actions are fluid and react really fast. Your characters reaction time changes with how much you carry and what weapon you choose which makes a great addition to the game and adds depth. If you want to be tanky and take lots of hits, you move like a truck which means you can't even swing your sword in time, however if you don't wear heavy armor or any armor whatsoever, you fly like a butterfly and sting like a bee. But don't forget that you also take so much damage so that even 1 hit might kill you. Map is carefully designed so that every part of the game is connected without loading screens. Going left,right,up,down always takes you to new places. While this should make you feel like you lost your way, game somehow points you to the right direction without being obvious. Locked doors or unactivated elevators prevents you from going to the wrong places. Also there are candles in the background that lets you know that you are about to fight a boss. It is really helpfull considering that fighting with a boss requires preperation. Every part of the map is actually pretty smart. I didn't feel like getting swarmed by creatures or feel like something was wrong.  My only problem with the gameplay was that rolling left and right is not well designed, most of the time I found myself getting stuck in front of a boss or getting damage while rolling even if I manage to roll behind an enemy. It was the main reason why I raged so hard.Overall the gameplay feels like a good rpg game, fast and responsive with any weapon. Hit register is also properly designed which is a huge plus. SoundtrackThe soundtrack of this game is really heavy, you can even say that it is psychologically heavy. It stresses you out as it should do, makes you feel the atmosphere even more. You always feel stressed while leaving safe zones because you constantly expect dying in every step, soundtrack of this game doubles that stres with sometimes heavy and sometimes fast musics. Monsters There are many enemies created which are ranged and melee with a lot of different styles. You have to find a tactic for each of them since some of them have a heavy attack which you can foresee easily while some other creature uses magic that hits any floor in the visible screen. I overall enjoyed having a lot of different enemies in different areas, it made the game feel longer and harder to master.Bosses are another topic that this game is pretty good about. All of them are different with their attacks, styles, damage types, weapons and sizes. You literally have to find a strategy to beat all of them because it really is not easy to kill them in the first time. Summation	This game make you feel both stronger than everything and weaker than anything at the same time. You try to kill an enemy for an hour feeling rage and hatred, then eventually you beat it and feel like you are on the clouds. Also the depth that this game has is huge, it even has religions which I still couln't master. You can create lots of different game styles with different skill paths and you can even change the items that you use to completely change the gameplay of the game. Also just search its skill selection screen and you will understand what I'm talking about when I say depth. I found myself struggling to reach the outer circle of the skill tree because it is huge.I think this game deserves 9/10 easily. That -1 point is for the fact that rolling is still♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off. If you love games that are hard but rewarding and also have depth that will make you searching the internet every half an hour, don't even think about it, just buy this game and play it for many hours.

You always feel stressed while leaving safe zones because you constantly expect dying in every step, soundtrack of this game doubles that stres with sometimes heavy and sometimes fast musics. Monsters There are many enemies created which are ranged and melee with a lot of different styles. You have to find a tactic for each of them since some of them have a heavy attack which you can foresee easily while some other creature uses magic that hits any floor in the visible screen. I overall enjoyed having a lot of different enemies in different areas, it made the game feel longer and harder to master.Bosses are another topic that this game is pretty good about. All of them are different with their attacks, styles, damage types, weapons and sizes. You literally have to find a strategy to beat all of them because it really is not easy to kill them in the first time. Summation	This game make you feel both stronger than everything and weaker than anything at the same time. You try to kill an enemy for an hour feeling rage and hatred, then eventually you beat it and feel like you are on the clouds. Also the depth that this game has is huge, it even has religions which I still couln't master. You can create lots of different game styles with different skill paths and you can even change the items that you use to completely change the gameplay of the game. Also just search its skill selection screen and you will understand what I'm talking about when I say depth. I found myself struggling to reach the outer circle of the skill tree because it is huge.I think this game deserves 9/10 easily. That -1 point is for the fact that rolling is still♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off. If you love games that are hard but rewarding and also have depth that will make you searching the internet every half an hour, don't even think about it, just buy this game and play it for many hours.

												If you enjoy Dark Souls games, you will most likely enjoy this game as well, but don't expect a straight-up DS clone. There are a lot of important differences between the two, the most obvious difference being that S&S is 2D; of course there are differences in control schemes as well. S&S offers a bit more challenge imo and the lore is a lot more obscure to the point where you may not think it even has lore if you're not paying attention. Unlike DS, there is no clear path through S&S and there are significantly less items than DS. All things considered, this is a great game for a DS fan, but is quite a bit different from a traditional DS clone.			"

												I got turned onto this by a Dark Souls fan, and I usually hate this kind of thing, so I was wary.  I've sunk a couple of hours into it and I must say, I'm opening up to the idea of a challenging game like this.  I think 2d makes it accessable to someone like me who can't get into Dark Souls.  I detect notes of Castlevania, and almost and even Zelda like aspect.  You upgrade stuff, get items and unlock progress as you go along.  Getting your♥♥♥♥♥kicked?  Do a little grinding and level your stats and abilities.  It's tough, but I'm suprisingly diggin on this one!  Give it a shot, but expect a learning curve.  Look online to the WIKIS for a leg up and make sure you learn some combos and tactics.  Tough but fun!			"

												Well, This might be the best Souls-like game out their. it might be even better than some of the Soulsborne titles. Platforming doesn't suck, combat is more arcade-like in nature( which is a good thing.) I had ZERO bugs or glitches my playthrough. This is a game with INSANE value. Best Indie game I have ever played. If I had to find a problem with the game, it is that you occasionally get juggled during combat for massive amounts of damage, and you might need to start farming for salt late game. In my opinion, that does not detract from the game at all for me, but it might upset others. Its tough-as-nails fun that you can invest 40-50 hours at least into the game( not mentioning optional areas or NG+) This game is worth every penny you can give it. "

												Many people have tried to translate the Souls genre to two dimensions. Salt And Sanctuary suceeds. A true souls-like, and a great sidescroller to boot! If i had to say something bad about this game, it would probably be that at the moment build balance is a bit lacking. Greatswords are very strong (greatscissors are beyond op), and everything else is rather weak by comparison. This may be just me, but right now it seems like there's very little reason to not wear heavy armor, and quite a few bosses are made much easier by using a shield. The human character models aren't terribly impressive either. On the other hand, pretty much everything else is brilliant. Overall, a solid 8.5/10, potentially a 9/10 after some balance tweaks.			"

												Alright, let's talk Salt & Sanctuary.Welcome to the two dimensional version of Dark Souls that will have you writhing, groaning and begging for more.  Taking a page from the generic ""masochistic"" platformer and implementing the theming and basic game mechanics from everyone's favorite challenging medieval ""kill things until you get killed, repeat until satisfied"".  Salt & Sanctuary is an excellent source of enjoyment for anyone who lives in either of those metaphorical apartment complexes.  The intriguing blend of scarce plot and heavy gameplay that forces the casual player to rethink his life choices and gives the keyboard warrior a chance to dance in revelry.   All styles of player will find an enticing challenge as they march through the choatic wasteland of the mysterious island that tells a better story in twenty odd hours than a certain tv drama can do in six seasons.  Not to say that you NEED to remember the story to enjoy it or whatever you bought this for.  Maybe there's a girl on its production team you want to impress so you bought it and left it running on your laptop to log  ""play hours"" overnight so she'll think you are a fan.  Hey, i'm not judging.  I've done a lot more for a lot less.  Anyways, if you are considering jumping into the pit of gleeful frustration, think no further.  You won't regret buying this game.Okay, after attempting to gild the lily, to be fair i've gotta talk pros and cons.  When in Rome, I suppose...Pros:-Fun, rewarding gameplay-Challenging boss fights (except you Carsejaw, you need a sharper sword and maybe some steroids.  Yeah, some anabolic enhancements would serve you well, gotta lay off the pizza too! It's difficult, but hey, the Nameless Scarecrow Emo Punk needs you at your best, like, yesterday. Sheesh.)-Intersting, non distracting plot, and some sub plots to experience-No map! (Screw you Dora and your all-encompasing Backpack, we don't need you.)-Replayability-Wonderful, dark and menacing art style-Gore!!!-Tons of enemies to bully and farm-Cool cults/factions/religions to manage-Awesome endingCons:-Stiff learning curve for new platform players-Some overwhelming bosses, some underwhelming (i.e. That ""Disembowled Husk"" gave me more grief than I've experience in a long time, and this is coming from a Red Sox fan.  Aaaaannnd Carsejaw gets another mention here, thought i'm sure you saw this coming...)-Lack of online co-op-Wiki has some holes, if you utilize those things. I know I do-No map! (Okay good, I remembered to come back to this.  Sure, it is a problem, especially near the beginning of the game.  This aspect made both lists for several reasons, a Pro because you pick up the layout easier than you think, and the mental struggle is just part of the implied difficulty of the game.  But still remains a con as sometimes finding things can be a bit troubling.  I woudn't have even realized the floating castle existed if I didn't have the little map from Google images saved on my phone to leave open while I explored things.)-I want more! There are several things that I hope the developers add into the system, and as it stands, i can't wait to find out what happened to a few of the major characters in the storylineAlright, here's hoping this gets read maybe once or twice.  Hopefully by a pending customer.-Cheers-			"

												I'm really bad at reviewing games from this genre because they're so complex and explaining why they're good is very difficult.

I specialized myself into mage class as I was supposed to do, lost track of time, finished the game, started the new game +, but I realised that I was bored of mage, so I started a new game with the knight and understood the replayability of the game.Now I spend my life tracking salt and killing bosses.

												I absolutely loved this game, I have played all the souls games and i love the inspiration this game takes from it, the combat is amazingly fun and difficult. the combat still feels like a souls game even in 2d which i love. one of the best things is the slightly more casual way the game plays, its much more pickup and play than the souls games and i really like that. the only thing a havent liked so far is the caged human boss, it felt too much like the bed of chaos from dark souls, it felt like i just had to be lucky that too much fire didnt come my way so i could win. the skill tree is also really cool, but i think it should just be a bit more linear, it makes it hard to plan out strategies for building your character, other then that everything else it absolutely amazing, i also love the art style. i really hope that one of the developers sees this review because i really liked this game and i want to play more like it, id recommend to anyone who likes a challenge			"

If you don't like the sound of that, leave.If you do, you will not be disappointed. I love the art style and tight action platform experience, the sound track really puts you on place, though the repetitive boss fight music does get a little samey after a while. Not played enough to fully explore the depths of it, but I will do, and so far I absolutely love it.**Edit**Now started a NG+ :) I disagree with people complaining about lack of a map, it doesn't need one as I think the existing map is actually a little small.What I like+ Message bottle, + Diverse skill tree/progression+ Decent amount of weapon types+ Combat systemWhat I didn't like- Small map- Limited number of enemies at one time (Big fan of The Dishwasher so I am reminded of that)- GravityOverall still a fantastic game, but like any game like this, you always want MOAR.P.S.

General information about gaming and both the Souls and Metroidvania genres are required to understand some of these points.+ It's a 2D Demake of Dark Souls, in the best possible way.+ Boss designs are far, FAR better than in Dark Souls 2. (Honestly i might even go as far as to say that it rivals Dark Souls 1 sometimes.)+ It's longer than Demon's Souls, took me exactly 20 hours on my first playthough. Good length for a 20 buck game.+ Metroidvania elements are handled nicely, you get upgrades that are required to progress the game world akin to Symphony of the Night and Super Metroid.+ You can wavedash. (Kinda.)+ Combat is a ton of fun.+ There's a metric ton of gear and different types of weapons.+ Bonfire system is better than in Dark Souls.+ There's a passive skill tree system similar to Path of Exile, it's interesting and fits the game well imo.+ Multiple endings.+ Support for local co-op...- ..But not for online co-op. :c- Some of the bosses are quite cheap.- There is no map, why? 2D Navigation doesn't work the same way that it does in Dark Souls.- While there is definitely a good replay value here, the lack of online features waters it down a bit.- Artstyle that ranges from ugly to downright beautiful, contrasts the world a bit weirdly sometimes.- Too many enemies with grapple strikes.- Lackluster soundtrack.- Cthulhu mimics tbh fml smh.In the end, i will say that this is without a doubt one of the top 3 indie games i've ever played. You should definitely check it out if you can. When this game shines, it shines bright.			"

												Without a doubt, the best platformer I've ever played, and easily in my top 10 games of all time. There are a few annoying / cheap enemies, but everything else shows a staggering amount of polish and careful design. Other studios could really, really take a lesson from these guys on how not to go beyond the scope of a project and make sure what they do is done very well. That said, the game is also freaking huge, so don't worry about content. TLDR: Buy immediately, play by yourself. Some moments and areas are truly awe-inspiring when you reach them.			"

												Many people have tried to translate the Souls genre to two dimensions. Salt And Sanctuary suceeds. A true souls-like, and a great sidescroller to boot! If i had to say something bad about this game, it would probably be that at the moment build balance is a bit lacking. Greatswords are very strong (greatscissors are beyond op), and everything else is rather weak by comparison. This may be just me, but right now it seems like there's very little reason to not wear heavy armor, and quite a few bosses are made much easier by using a shield. The human character models aren't terribly impressive either. On the other hand, pretty much everything else is brilliant. Overall, a solid 8.5/10, potentially a 9/10 after some balance tweaks.			"

												I never played this kind of game before, but everybody seemed to like it so I had to try.I choosed my class, saw that there was a class called Chef. Wtf. Skipped and choosed mage.I arrived to the first boss. Raged. Cried. And remembered that I was a mage. Threw my sword, took my wand used my spell and killed the boss. I was happy. I specialized myself into mage class as I was supposed to do, lost track of time, finished the game, started the new game +, but I realised that I was bored of mage, so I started a new game with the knight and understood the replayability of the game.Now I spend my life tracking salt and killing bosses. Oh wait I've got tests tomorrow !(Totally worth it)			"

												I absolutely loved this game, I have played all the souls games and i love the inspiration this game takes from it, the combat is amazingly fun and difficult. the combat still feels like a souls game even in 2d which i love. one of the best things is the slightly more casual way the game plays, its much more pickup and play than the souls games and i really like that. the only thing a havent liked so far is the caged human boss, it felt too much like the bed of chaos from dark souls, it felt like i just had to be lucky that too much fire didnt come my way so i could win. the skill tree is also really cool, but i think it should just be a bit more linear, it makes it hard to plan out strategies for building your character, other then that everything else it absolutely amazing, i also love the art style. i really hope that one of the developers sees this review because i really liked this game and i want to play more like it, id recommend to anyone who likes a challenge			"

												Just beat the game and here is my honest opinion.At first glance, I didn't think this game was going to be any good. But, after everyone kept saying it is a lot like dark souls, I thought I would give it a try.The character models look goofy and they added a cook as a playable starter class for humor and I thought this was a bad start. After starting my Paladin, and killing some mobs. I really saw that this game had potential.Pro's+Story - really indepth put together even if stealing most of the game mechanics from dark souls.+Class optimization (specs) you can make your character the way you want to play.+Weapons - Lot of different variety and adds to cool character builds+Zones - Doesn't force you to play in one area to long and adds a ton of hidden spots you can't access till you get special abilities thought out the game.+Bosses - Some are very challenging and each are very different in terms of what they are weak to and strong at. So you can't just run in and hack. You need to added items to your weapon or buff defense in certian ways.Cons- Lack of explination - if I wasn't a dark souls lover, I wouldn't have a clue about half the game. For example, you wash ashore from the beginning, not knowing wtf you are doing or what to expect and you meet an old man. He asks you if you worship the new gods or the old one. (this effects your safety zone) Each god sells different things and some have different strenghts / weakness in terms of spells or what not. - Prepare to use the Wiki website... a lot. Not that I have a problem with it since I have had to do this with all the dark souls games, but for anyone new. They would be like what the hell does this thing do?Overall, for $17.99, this game is solid. The game has a good pace to it and I didn't feel like it was holding my hand. Combat felt rewarding and fun and the exploration factor is top notch. "

Yes, Salt and Sanctuary takes a LOT of inspiration from the Souls games, but it does so with respect and adds its own unique spin on things. What makes Salt and Sanctuary truly great is how not only do they bring their unique spins to the formula, but they still provide the same feeling of accomplishment given in the Souls games for a fraction of the cost with just as much impact! If you want a fun and fulfilling gaming experience, give Salt and Sanctuary a shot!			"

												I cannot sing enough praise for this game. It's been a long time since a game grabbed me like this one.PROS:The atmosphere. It's dark, gritty, and sometimes hard to look at. This only adds to the charm of S&S. Character and level design aren't the prettiest things I've ever seen, but because of the way it presents itself it only makes you get into the game that much more.The difficulty. If you're an elite Dark Souls player, you probably won't have a terrible time getting through this game. That's not to say you won't die more than a handful of times, but even when you do it keeps you coming back for more. This game has an incredible way of having you walk away in frustration, only to come back a few hours later to see yourself cruise through the parts you were having issues with before. The gameplay. If Dark Souls and a metroidvania game had a baby, it'd be this game. 2D side scrolling, platforming, dodge rolling, items and armor everywhere, secrets to discover around every corner, teeth grittingly hard bosses/enemies. There is just so much done right in this was that was clearly learned from watching the best of the other games.Creed selection (for the most part, more on this below) feels like it really makes a difference. Each creed has different items, abilities, and perks. Depending on your play style, one creed may seem like garbage compared to another only to have them flip-flop their importance as you progress further on into the game as your character changes. The story (or lack there of). Like Dark Souls, if you just want to cruise through this game with a giant hammer crushing enemies without having to get indepth with it, then this game lets you do that. If you want an indepth interesting story, the lore is there for you to find. It doesn't force anything on you if you don't care to see it. That's rather refreshing.CONS:Bugs/Glitches. I had the luck of not running into too many bugs, but the few I did run into weren't gamebreaking. More of an annoyance when they occasionally occured. Such as falling through an elevator floor or long jumping(which isn't something you're supposed to be able to do) to my death into a pit. Once again, it didn't happen very often, but it did happen. Luckily, the developer seems really involved in the game still, so hopefully these get ironed out.One Creed in particular is incredibly overpowered. I won't go into detail about which one it is, but once I found myself apart of that creed the game became MUCH much easier. I thought it may have been just because I was a heavy melee character, so I switched to spell caster in NG+. Spell casting + This Creed = Devastation of the Highest. It only made things more easy. The last boss melted before my mighty laser beams without even touching me. So while for some this won't really be a negative, but for others such as myself it made it hard to justify giving any other creed a chance in NG+. Luckily, you can't stumble across this creed until later on into the game.If you're into Dark Souls and/or Metroidvania type games, do yourself a favor and pick this wonderful game up. You'll be glad you did.			"

												I won't go incredibly in depth in details that have to do with the game itself so take this into consideration, I simply intend to list out some clear positives and negatives that seem rather obvious to begin with but are important to know before you consider investing in a game!Positives- This is extremely like a platforming Dark Souls as most people like to point out.- The game itself is honestly beautiful if you enjoy this type of art style.- Although it's often proven to be extremely difficult, there's always an easier route if you just have enough patience.- This is honestly what I see as the Dark Souls for when you don't want to actually play Dark Souls, it's like a Dark Souls-Castlevania love child.- Combat is fast paced and doesnt let you relax and go completely numb while you play (this could be viewed as a negative)- New game plus is an interesting feature that doesn't let you get bored easily and lets you do as you please without having an entire sense of been there, done that.- Very few bugs from what I have found.Negatives- This can often be too difficult if you aren't used to pc games.- Local Co-op is a bit too limiting if you ever want to play with friends, not everyone can just show up at your house and plug in a controller! (I have friends all over the country who are dying to play this in a group ): )- Although some of the classes are really good, certain ones like the hunter seem too underwhelming to begin with even though they have a really fun looking concept and design.- Character customization is pretty limited, although it makes sense for the type of game this is.- There's absolutely no real direction as to where you're going, so it's really confusing unless you take the time to look up a guide. Side note: There are keys you receive from bosses so please don't think I'm ignoring that!    These are just a few of the things I've noticed that stand out about this incredibly unique game. I enjoy what story there is and I highly recommend this to any fan of platformers or any of the Dark Souls franchise (I've played 1-3). This game is incredibly original in the way that it works a lot of things out and even allows you to do combos with specific weapons. I always have favortism towards mage classes and this does very well in combining the idea that mages still need to use swords sometimes, this is just one example of a few ideas that the game incorporates. All in all, this is one of my favorite games and I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to try something similar to what they normally know yet still so different and unique that it doesn't feel like a white washed game you see everywhere.

												I hate Dark Souls. All of them. I absolutely love this game.How is that possible when Salt and Sanctuary is a virtual copy of it? It comes down to two pretty simply differences between the two.First, it's 2d. The gameplay just works better in 2d. Yes, Dark Souls has better game feel for exploration (although not by much) because of the 3d expansive world. However, just like how spikes of death ♥♥♥♥ing suck in Ocarina of Time but are perfectly fine in a Link to the Past, Salt and Santuary lays out everything in front of you.How many traps have killed you in Dark Souls only because there was no way to see them ahead of time and you simply had to know or react quickly enough even when going slowly? There are traps in Salt and Sanctuary, but it goes about them in the original Castlevania way. Just go slow. Nothing will come out of a blindspot. If something is attacking you, it's because you aggroed it, and you saw it.Second, its learning curve actually lets you learn how to play. The zombies in level 1 (and level 0) take more than two hits to kill and only take 5-15% of your health per attack. Plus, you get a regen ring. This lets you actually experiment with combos. Remember the entry level zombies in Dark Souls? How they take only 1 hit to kill? Maybe even TWO! Yeah, not enough experimentation. Plus, if you do get hit, it's like a third of your health.God help you versus your first big monster.Once you get to level 2, Salt and Sanctuary starts with the ball rocking. Level 3 is even more so. The main two limitations of the game are simply:1) Gold is useless except for flooding your inventory with 99 of each consumable for new game+.2) Bosses can be extremely easy compared to trash.As a tip, if you want easy mode, pick paladin or knight. Make sure you have a shield with 100 block of the approriate kind of damage(s). Get as much stamina as possible. You are literally invincible with this setup. No, seriously. If you ever wanted to play Dark souls with 100% damage reduction, just play one of these two classes. Shields must be used more sparingly in the beginning, but by concentrating on upgrades, stamina, and endurance, you can cheese the final boss EASILY.If you want a harder game experience, choose hunter or any other squishy that relies on dodging instead of blocking.I absolutely love this game.

												 Overall great game. Took me awhile to finish because the Queen of the Lake is stupidly hard but this game is 100% worth every dollar. The combat is great and the skill tree is huge, probably gonna take multiple play throughs to really get into it. Art style is solid and dark just how youd expect it to be. If this game was trying to compete with DARK SOULS i think its def a close contender. I personally love the soul series but cannot play the 3rd installment, this game made me forget about DARK SOULS for a decent amount of time. Only downside to this game is interaction with people on the island and story seems kinda spread out. You only meet 2 people in the game that give any real details as to whats going on on the island... Felt that was a bit off but oh well. All in all I rate this game 9/10 and you should pick it up if youve been considering it.			"

												Pros~ Amazing artistic and sound design.~ A lot of interesting areas.~ Wide variety of playstyles.~ The lore and story in this game is alright.~ Decent skill-tree system that can prove to be a little bit confusing at first.~ The charms you add on your weapon is a welcome feature. They provide even MORE variety to your weapons.~ A handful of bosses have made me angry. In this type of game, that spells out greatness.~ NG+ is truly NG+... Poison damage is so strong.Cons~ Dodging is VASTLY superior to using a shield. I let go of my shield very early on.~ No sense of direction, often leading to confusion.~ The NPCs you meet are not that interesting.~ The ending choices are too obvious.~ There are a few bosses that felt repeated and some were just disappointing.~ You get an OP weapon very early on, that can lead to bosses being quite useless to fight.

												Best local co op fun I've had in a while.  I've been playing this with my friend for a while on his PS4, and I'm psyched to finally have it on Steam for myself. The game is a 2D Dark Souls, in essence. There are even some things that the game does even better than Dark Souls IMO. The staple Souls attributes are here, 'bonfires', 'estus flasks', 'covenants', etc. The famous 'lose all your currency when you die' is here too, and now enemies actually acquire your currency (salt) and become stronger instead of just dropping it (although I believe Bloodborne did this as well).If you know Dark Souls, you'll probably know that even though this sounds like hell, it's a fun experience that is full of intense gameplay and hopefully some character building trial and error moments. 100% recommend this game if you have someone to local co op with (I don't think it has online co op). Couch Co Op is fading away, and this is the most fun I've had in a local Co Op RPG for a long time.Even if you don't, you will be very familiar with this game and most likely enjoy the experience if you like Dark Souls. If you haven't even played Dark Souls, this is a nice place to start experiencing that type of game, as $18 is a steal for this much content.			"

												I'm not someone who usually gets into Soulsbourne style or Metroidvania style game.And yet, Salt and Sanctuary has managed to capture me.If that isn't a testament to this games quality, I don't know what is.However, all the places where this games quality shines bright cast light on the games shortcomings.The sound design and player character models in this game are really bad. The co-op is great fun but anytime you come to a platforming section it becomes painful to play. Mind you, this isn't a problem in the single player AND there is a glitch that lets one player do all the platforming and then sling-shots the other player to the location of the one doing the platforming. Have one player pause and the other player do the platforming. When the player finishes the platforming, have the other player unpause to be teleported to the other player.Given that the game was only made by two people (and given the games price) I can overlook it's shortcomings. After all, what this game gets right it absolutely nails. Only having three relatively minor complaints about a game made by two people is a big win in my book. I hope the inevitable sequel fixes my issues with the game.			"

												WARNING: WALL OF TEXT INBOUND! tl;dr 8/10.Let me preface this by saying why I'm getting about reviewing this game only now having owned it for a while (actually, being gifted it by my friend Ly, thanks fagt <3). I always figured that nobody's going to see my review, and the game's recommended as it is, so I figured I'd let others speak instead of me. Well, now that Steam actually displays the few reviews posted in the last 30 days, I figured, why the hell not.Also, I have to say, going in, I'm a HUGE Soulsborne and Metroidvania fan, so this game REALLY hits the sweet spot for me. I may or may not be a tad biased since I was EXTREMELY hyped for the game, but I'll try to keep this as objective as possible.GRAPHICS:This one's a mixed bag. While the hand drawn artstyle is really pretty to look at, and in my opinion it's really cool, something that may put others off to the point of not playing the game is the character design. The human characters are, well... to put it lightly, weird. Imagine trying to describe to someone what 'anime' looks like and then them subsequently completely missing the point. The characters have round heads, no noses, wide mouths and REALLY bulgy, insectoid eyes. Honestly, this didn't really bother me, but I know some people will despise it, so take it as you will. For me personally, it wasn't a big deal.The rest of the game is really well done. The details are crisp and everything runs smoothly. One other noteworthy thing is the animations. They are exceptionally well done, and wielding some weapons, namely daggers, will make you feel like nothing short of an absolute badass. Overall a solid 7/10.SOUND:Also a strange section. The ambient sounds, enemy shrieks, weapon swings and the like are all amazing. Very well done and extremely polished. What's not really AS good, however, is the music. Not that the music itself is bad. It's that there's only 3 or so tracks in the entire game. EVERY boss, except for the last one, has the same exact theme. Absolutely every single one. Now that might not be a bad thing if you like the track itself, but it WILL get repetitive after a while. Again, it didn't bother me all that much, but some of you might be put off by that fact. I'll give it an 8/10.GAMEPLAY:Aaaah, the meat and potatoes of this review. I'll try to structure this section as well, but bare with me if I go on tangents. I'll try to keep this as concise and to-the-point as possible.Since this game doesn't try to hide the fact that it was heavily inspired by the Soulsborne franchise, some of the things it NEEDED to get right were the combat and the exploration. And it nailed those.The combat is VERY satisfying, largely owing to the extremely tight and responsive controls. I do recommend playing with a controller if you can. Anywho, the combat feels meaty, impactful, and most of all, satisfying. Swords swoosh and whirr through the air and you can hear meat being sliced. Hammers thunk with a great amount of force, crushing bone and armor alike. The screen shakes a bit and there's blood absolutely EVERYWHERE. Really good stuff. And, since you'll be doing combat for like 90% of the game, that's a good thing too.The level design is amazing. The world is HUGE, and while it might not take you over 50 hours to explore everything (it'll probably take you around 20 hours or so), the exploration never gets boring. Almost every bit of every level is crammed with stuff to find, explore (and kill), and there are secrets galore. I can assure you that if you just rush through the game, you'll have missed at LEAST 40% of the game, if not more. One other thing S&S takes from Souls is the shortcuts. The levels are very interwoven, to the point that very late game areas can link all the way back to the first couple of areas of the game. That's pretty insane.However, not everything is fine and dandy. Some of the gripes I had with this part is the following:a) You can clearly see a degradation in detail attention in the later portion of the game. Probably due to the fact that the producers tried to wrap the entire thing out and push it to the market. The later areas in the game just don't feel as polished or filled with details as the first few do. Some feel outright void of life and feel more like corridors placed there to keep you from going in a straight line rather than being fun to explore.b) This game needs a God damn map, period. Unlike Dark Souls, which is a 3D game and it's much easier to gather your bearings in it, this one's 2D. It's flat. The entire game feels like an ant hill with the amount of secret pathways and shortcuts leading to and fro. And there's absolutely nothing to help you figure out where you are or what leads where. Kinda infuriating, but then again, that might just be me sucking at finding the right path or remembering where I was.There are a couple of key differences in this game as opposed to the Souls games. First off, there's this huge thing called the Skill Tree. If you've played Path of Exile, you'll be right at home. If not, imagine a huge web of nodes all connected some way or another with lines. As you play and kill stuff, you'll be gathering Salt. Salt is used to level up at Sanctuaries (hueh). Every level you gain, you get an item called a Black Pearl. You spend these pearls to unlock nodes in the tree. The nodes either boost one of your stats, or they unlock higher tiers of weapons or armor for you to wear. While it may sound daunting at first, I actually prefer this to the way Souls handles levelups. It allows for much more flexible character development.Similarly to Dark Souls, instead of bonfires you have Sanctuaries. At the beginning of the game you get to pick a Creed (Covenant) to join. You gain said creed's special item with which you claim empty sanctuaries. Once claimed, you can rest at a sanctuary. You can also 'place offerings' of small statuettes of various NPCs, such as merchants, mages, clerics, blacksmiths, etc. You'll find these statuettes as you play, too. Very cool stuff. There's also one more form of sanctuaries called Shrines. You can light them and rest at them, but you can't level up or offer statues to it. They're more like convenience checkpoints than true sanctuaries.Next up is the armors and weapons. Like in Souls, there's a boatload of both, but unlike in Souls, the armor here is strictly categorized into two categories; heavy and light. This is supposedly to prevent people from switching from 2 ton armor to dresses willy-nilly. I actually really like this but someone else might not, so take it as you will.Weapons are divided more diversely, and I'm not going to list all of the types here. What's important is that there's a large variety of both weapons and armor, and no matter the build you want to try, you'll find something that suits your playstyle.Speaking of playstyle, one other flaw I've noticed is that slower, tank builds are at a slight disadvantage over light builds that prefer dodging instead of blocking. This is because a LOT of the bosses in the game tend to have attacks that'll knock you flat on your back. It doesn't help that some of these are unblockable, so if you want to play a heavy build, it might just be a test of patience for you.When it comes to bosses there's also a huge variety that you'll come across. What I didn't really find fun, however, is that at least 3 of the bosses are nearly direct copies of bosses from Dark Souls. There's Artorias, Nito and Seath. You'll know them when you see them. Impossible to miss. I get drawing inspiration from a source, that's cool. But outright copying some of the stuff is stretching it a bit. Not a deal breaker for me, though. At least I knew how to deal with the bosses.Overall, I love this game to bits. It gets a rock solid 8/10. Get it if you're a Souls/Metroidvania fan, or if you have money to spare. You really don't have anything to lose.			"

												This is pretty much how I would want a 2D Dark Souls to be like, that's what they went for and they achieved it with flying colors.Of course, the game does stand on its own very well, even if you don't call it a 2D Souls game. The game has a pretty intruiging story and world, a hefty amount of optional bosses, and a bunch of customization with armor and weapons.Also, hitting things is very satisfying and fun... which is... pretty good in a game where you do that a lot.I reccomend it. Yahp. The Witch of the Lake will make you salty though.  "

												If you like the Souls/Bloodbourne series and were looking for a different interpretation of it, this is it. Dark Fantasy..check, Challenging..check, Mysterious World and Lore that force you to figure things out and check every nook and cranny..check, Very cool weapon Models and Armor..check,Mysterious kinda creepy npc's you do not know are good or evil..check. The world is very grainy and saturated focusing on certain colors that make it pop, art style is very gloomy, and sets the mood very well. Few minor issues I have with it is some times frame rate is a bit jerky, and just like the Souls series some enemies can seem cheap, and the hit boxes can seem off a bit. This game is definitely worth every penny, I still find myself sinking hours into different builds, and play styles. YOU NEED a controller either xbox 360 or PS4 and set it up to your playstyle, and read up on builds, and craftable gear. The game does not tell you anything about transmuting items and such, and the skill tree for a new comer could be very overwhelming, and if you mess up you end up with a lackluster unusable character. All in All I would say 90/100.			"

												I highly recommend this game especially in local coop which is way funnier than dying alone (except when you get mad and ragequit). This game has several similarities with the Souls serie. Dark magic is a bit cheated compared to close fighting, that's why it's better for 2 players with 2 complementary builds.But nevermind, this game is beautiful, it's insctinctive and has a real challenge. at leat 30 hours to finish it correctly ( yeah, when you don't know where to go, it seems really long. Don't stop in the middle of the game cause it's a real maze and you'll have a hard time when you'll start again.)I didn't like the blacksmithing system, not very intuitive, too complex. i would have loved if there were more differents weapons.The skills system in kinda cool and very wide, it allows you to specialize as dark souls you can chose a warrior and build it like a mage for example. (armors, weapons, and stats)Nevertheless, i felt Something special in this game. Its experience is totally Worth its price whether you're alone or 2.If you want a real and original dark souls like in 2D with challenging bosses and dark graphics , this game is the only one worthy. Good job to the devs, i hope there will be a second op "

												This game is 100% worth the price, and I would highly recommend it to anybody.I've never played any Dark Souls game before, but picked up Salt and Sanctuary while trying to build up my game library. When I got around to playing it, I was instantly a huge fan.The combat in the game is smooth and fun to master. I was a huge fan of the overall atmosphere and art style. There is also an impressive amount of lore hidden in the descriptions for items, monsters, etc. "

												This is the absolute best Souls-Like game I played so far. (Okay, there aren't that many tbh).It does everything right what I loved in the Souls series and adds some bits and pieces here and there. The combination of fighting and platforming works surprisingly well and is fun to play.Controlls and movement are well made and feel good and fluid. The character responds emediatly to all your button presses.Salt is a bit less fast than the souls series, but does also require a good reaction.Enemies and bosses are fun too. I myself found a few of the bosses a bit annoying and frustrating, but that were just a few of the many that are in the game. And dificuty is always subjective. ;DI'd say Salt is a bit easier then the souls series, although its dificulty is of a slightly different kind. (Hard to explain).So... if you loved the souls series and aren't an enemy of platforming then you should grab this game. And even if you don't know the Souls games, and are a friend of challenges you should grab it. ;DIt was a great experience and totally worth its price.			"

												This game is essentially Dark Souls in 2D and as a Linux gamer I couldn't be happier about it.It has a similarly dark and surreal plot and atmosphere, interconnected level design, and gameplay that generally favors skill over stats. It gives a very satisfying sense of progression by keeping individual zones short and distinct, and letting you level up frequently and without hours of grinding.The only thing missing is online multiplayer, but even so I definitely had more than 18 euro worth of fun playing this gem.

												Just beat the game and here is my honest opinion.At first glance, I didn't think this game was going to be any good. But, after everyone kept saying it is a lot like dark souls, I thought I would give it a try.The character models look goofy and they added a cook as a playable starter class for humor and I thought this was a bad start. After starting my Paladin, and killing some mobs. I really saw that this game had potential.Pro's+Story - really indepth put together even if stealing most of the game mechanics from dark souls.+Class optimization (specs) you can make your character the way you want to play.+Weapons - Lot of different variety and adds to cool character builds+Zones - Doesn't force you to play in one area to long and adds a ton of hidden spots you can't access till you get special abilities thought out the game.+Bosses - Some are very challenging and each are very different in terms of what they are weak to and strong at. So you can't just run in and hack. You need to added items to your weapon or buff defense in certian ways.Cons- Lack of explination - if I wasn't a dark souls lover, I wouldn't have a clue about half the game. For example, you wash ashore from the beginning, not knowing wtf you are doing or what to expect and you meet an old man. He asks you if you worship the new gods or the old one. (this effects your safety zone) Each god sells different things and some have different strenghts / weakness in terms of spells or what not. - Prepare to use the Wiki website... a lot. Not that I have a problem with it since I have had to do this with all the dark souls games, but for anyone new. They would be like what the hell does this thing do?Overall, for $17.99, this game is solid. The game has a good pace to it and I didn't feel like it was holding my hand. Combat felt rewarding and fun and the exploration factor is top notch. "

												Pretty much everything an RPG/Platformer hybrid should be.Breakdown:Touted as the 2D version of Dark Souls (which I have yet to play) seemingly everywhere, this game is full of a wonderfully depressing and cold atmosphere from your character's trek from the shipwrecked shores to every withered and abandoned old location on the island. While the storyline itself may not be all that deep or full of details, the aesthetic will more than make up for the gaunt narrative and keep you very engaged in what's happening. The level design is fantastic, and the enemies (particularly the many bosses) all with distinct flavors restore faith that today's fantasy can still be dark, brooding, and heavy, and not just ridiculous scenes of elves skateboarding down elephant trunks while shooting orcs.Despite falling victim occasionally to two of the cardinal ""ways to make a platformer instantly not fun"", the controls for the most part are very responsive and easy to learn, leaving most of the skill to timing and strategy, as platforming should be. The RPG elements are well placed as well, and find a good balance between build diversity without winding up a glorified rock-paper-scissors match.Drawbacks and things to consider:This is both an RPG and a platformer in true terms. Not a drawback at all, unless one of those isn't your type of game.As mentioned above, the combat can occasionally drift into two easy problems many platformers have: stunlocks, and being knocked around like a pinball. Stunlocks work both ways, with some enemies that are supposed to be difficult easily being cheesed by just mashing X, and vice versa some enemies that just whack you every single time you just got off the ground, making it an unofficial one-shot. Pinballing happens with some enemies that do almost no damage but knock you off a ledge to your immediate death with a single blow. Pinballing is way less common than stunlocks in this game, with neither showing up too much, but I feel compelled to include their mention, as at least in my opinion, taking all control away from the player and giving them no way to fight back can quickly lead to great frustration.Dying a whole lot isn't a bad thing. I feel like everyone wants a game to be a challenge, so long as they feel it's actually still possible. What is never a good thing however, are weirdly placed checkpoints that force you to retrace steps before getting back to where you were. I don't mean the ones with enemies on the path, I mean when you literally just walk or jump around for five minutes with no threats. Minor complaint.The art is amazing, and would be perfect if not for the cartoon look of the human characters that seem straight out of Cook, Serve, Delicious!'s customer line. Seriously I don't get this part, when everything else was done so well. I recommend just wearing a full helmet to solve the problem.Verdict:A unique experience is rare in games today, and this one actually delivers. This game is a lot of fun, with memorable bosses. I recommend it strongly.			"

												Do you like dark souls' difficulty and opressive atmosphere?Do you like 2D platforms/metrovania style games?You found your game. Peper and sovereignty is for you! It sells it's self as a D&D style platformer but it would be easier to drop the pretences and just say it's a 2D dark souls, if you play dark souls it's hard not to feel the comparison. Bond fires are sanctuaries, you got a stamina bar that contribute to all your actions, weapons are equiped in the same way and can be shifted from one handed to two handed and the game has said dark atmosphere that works well here as it did in Dark souls. Compairing it to Dark souls isn't an insalt here, because it definantly understands why dark souls is good and understands how to apply difficutly and story to add to the immersion.My complaints are mostly that it doesn't seem to be as lore rich as dark souls, or at least I couldn't find where all the lore was so maybe I'm mistaken and there is a tone I missed. My other complaints is that the villen is weak. In dark souls the villen was enthrapy and what those did to try and avoid the slow doom the world was walking towards, here it's some kind of demon or god that traps people... because... I didn't fully follow why and that goes back to the lore issue I said before.But it's still a grate game and if you've played all the other souls games and are looking to scatch that difficulty itch then this will fill the spot nice			"

												Salt and Sanctuary wants so badly to be 2D Dark Souls, and succeeds nicely in some parts, but fails in unexpected ways. The artwork is bleak, foreboding, and drawn in beautiful detail, with great variety in both enemies and environments. The music is typically just unobtrusive enough to be atmospheric, if a bit monotonous, but the sounds of combat at least have some ""oomph"" to them. Aesthetically speaking, it's a well done game, and the fights are viscerally satisfying.However, this game also being a sidescrolling platformer causes frustrating problems to arise: -Grabbing/climbing ledges isn't always reliable; it's difficult to determine where the actual window for contact is, and sometimes a running leap will send you sailing UNDER the ledge you meant to grab, often to your death. -The game uses an equipment burden system much like Dark Souls', but the platforming requires you to be agile. If you favor heavy armor or weapons, you'll have to juggle/remove equipment much more frequently or risk falling to your death because you couldn't clear a jump, which leads me to wonder why weight was implemented at all.-A long fall won't always kill you, but it's impossible to gauge the lethality of a drop because your ""camera look"" function barely extends the view beyond the edge of the screen. Combined with the overall gloominess, it means you'll be taking literally blind leaps more often than you'd like.In short, even when you know the ins and outs, you'll die more often to sudden falls than enemies by a very wide margin, which diverges sharply from the ""tough but fair"" learning curve of Dark Souls. I can't really call it a bad game, but it's certainly less intuitive than its inspiration.			"

												This is quite a lengthy review that I have cooked up here, so if you aren't looking for a long read, I'll sum it up! This is a good game, if you enjoy yourself some Dark Souls but feel like it needs some 2D platforming for that MetroidVania feel, then this is for you!Salt and Sanctuary..oh lordy there's a lot to say about this game! Awesome weapons, enemies, and abilities later in the game make this fun, even before one takes into account the Souls feel to it. And it has more of a plot that is stated than Dark Souls! You play as a sailor, be you a knight or a mage or even a chef, and (without giving too much of the tutorial stage away) find yourself stranded on a random island in the middle of nowhere. A few steps up the beach and an old man tells you that you aren't the first to find yourself here and lets you pick one of three creeds. The only advice he gives you is to take a nearby sanctuary for your creed, but no other direction is really given. The game pushes you forward with two objectives: find the princess you were on the boat with, and survive. As you get further and deeper into the labyrinthian island, survival becomes your primary concern as you find enemies who can (and will) hit you with all kinds of attacks that will leave you open to be murdered by other enemies.As you traverse the island, you come across a few other people on the island who are there for different reasons. A knight who is on a quest to defeat an evil dragon, as is his want. A thief who is trying to find treasure. Some random swamp guy sitting in (you guessed it!) a swamp who sells things, mostly dealing poison damage. The NPCs have quite a bit of distance between them, so the journey feels a balance of both lonely and occupied, especially if you play co-op or bring in merchants, blacksmiths and alchemists to your sanctuaries.As far as game look and feel go, the game looks great. There isn't a ton of color on screen at many times but when there is, it usually looks great. The swamp is a dark, mossy green color and the caverns underneath a dungeon area are very blue and purple with the glow of the crystals and mushroom-like objects. While outside, due to being an island full of creatures and overloaded with salt, the sky is a very dull overcast with salt raining down, almost like snow. The gameplay is also very responsive. The controls are on point with little delay, the hitboxes on enemies are mostly on point; some bosses won't get hit if you attack them as they attack the area you dodged from.The enemies are plentiful and hard hitting and the bosses feel awesome when you fight them and defeat them. For some Demon's Souls nostalgia, the tutorial boss will most likely kill you! Although it is possible to kill the tutorial boss, and doing so rewards you with two crafting materials, one of which there is only *one* of in the game. Most of the bosses have attacks that are mostly easy to dodge and, with a little effort, you will prevail. HOWEVER, there is a certain boss towards the last few areas of the game that is an absolute NIGHTMARE!The game also has a really cool mechanic (in my opinion) where when you get hit by an enemy, you lose a small percentage of health that can't be healed with potions, much like Dragon's Dogma. Using spells or resting at a sanctuary of shrine will fix that, so it's good! And whenever you perform an action that takes stamina or focus (jumping, rolling, attacking, spells) the stamina will decrease as well. I feel that this makes field combat and platforming much for hectic, as that rush to recharge your depleted health/stamina bar feels all the more necessary.The game does have its flaws, the worst one (in my opinion) is the lack of music. The game does have boss music (with a really cool final boss theme) and a calming theme that plays in sanctuaries, but out in the rest of the game there's only the occasional guitar playing. Even the boss music plays during every boss bar the final one. The silver lining here is that the final dungeon in the game has a theme to it that practically shouts ""The end is here!""The weapons, while cool looking, aren't plentiful. There's only a few greatswords in the game and barely any greathammers. Compared to the weapon selection in Dark Souls III or II or even Demon's Souls, there could (and should) be many more. On the bright side, weapons and armor don't have durability!All in all, I believe that this game is a must have for those who love the Souls series. Minus the three dimensions, it has all the same things that Dark Souls has, including new game plus but minus random invasions from people with terrible internet connection. The lack of music does make it feel lonely at times, but it's still a great game.Assuming you got this far into the review, thank you for your time! Enjoy your day :)			"

												You can't compare this game with Dark Souls, the only resemblance is that it's hard.The lore is phenomenal.The puzzles are great, the ambiance is really dark and oppressive.The game design is really good, the bosses require different mecanics.You can acquire other gameplay actions like jumping on walls or dashing, which allows the player to discover new zones that were inacessible before.You can co-op, but only in local :/Dat last boss doe :o25h of joy!

												This game was a awsome experience. I felt like i was exploring when i was getting lost over and over untill i knew where i was going and trying to puzzle together the story through the amezing scenery, weapon/armour descriptions and hints just like in dark souls and i also had allot of fun fighting a massive variety of monsters and epic bosses with a big variety of weapons and spells. Even though the game looks and feels like dark souls i could instantly tell it was made by ska studios with the whole art style and combat like the dishwasher and charlie murder which i have also played the living hell out of so if you played this game and liked it you might also want to check out those games.Anyway please ceep making games they are always really really good.

												This game is the most infuriating expirience i have ever encountered, even more so than Dark Souls, Darkest Dungeon, all of them. it is increadibly confusing to navigate, there are terrible ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t moves that so many enemies can on hit you with, the bosses are absoulte ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, and there is nothing you can do to fix yourself or improve your skills beyond minor level adjustments. I cannot begin to convay how much this game infuriates me with blind, impotent rage, and that is why it is the most fun i have had in a long time with a game like this, because there is no expiriance like baring down on a boss for literal hours and wearing them out until you finally strike the final blow and that feeling is better than any ♥♥♥♥♥♥ you could ever expiriance.

												Fantastic pick up for a wonderful price. I honestly knew nothing about this game coming in to buying it. Actually I had just finished Dark Souls III when i found this game under the reccomended for you section and decided to give it a shot. I WAS NOT DISSAPOINTED IN THE SLIGHTEST, the intensity of the combat is exactly what i was looking for and the customization of your character and build is right up my alley. My only minor complaint is that certain bosses are a little clunky and if they have multiple hits in an animation you will only need to block or dodge through the first one. Besides that theres nothing i can complain about in this game art work is wonderful, combat feels great and the overall atmosphere of the game is solid and tense. TL;DR Pick this game up, it has alot of replayability and you wont be sorry. 9/10			"

												You might want to call the cops because the enemies and bosses in this game will a salt you with all sorts of deadly weapons and magic...Pun aside this game is quite the challenge for anyone looking to test their skills. You will get salty, you will cry, and you will conquer. This is by far one of the best 2-D games I have ever played. The enemies and bosses have neat desgins, the landscape has that beautiful but eerie feel to it, and the inventory menu is easy to manuver things around. Well worth the price. Also make sure to bring plenty of french fries.			"

												As someone who played dark souls 1-2 on xbox religiously when they came out, Salt and Sanctuary brought it back. It feels just as dark souls 1 did when i first played it and that makes it worth the money by itself. Even though this game is basically a 2D dark souls, it does bring in alot of different elements that dark souls lacked. A combo system, skill trees, and the sactuary system.Its hard for me to really describe what this game is like but if you are thinking about getting it, DO IT.Any fan of dark souls will love this game and even if you just like the 2D aspect of this, give it a try. 10/10 WOULD SALT AGAIN			"

												Overall, this game was fantastic,  I wish there were more games in this genre, especially with the ridiculous amount of depth, upgrading, and customization this game has.  I don't often beat games twice, but I did with this one.  This is one of the best games I have played based on pure enjoyment, depth, and price:Positives+Fighting mechanics+Extensive skill tree+Multiple Classes+Can mix classes+Platforming+Is not a brawler+Lots of bosses+Never became too difficult+NG++Took me over 25 hours to beat the first time+Actually inspired a 2nd run throughNegatives-RNG for boss moves can produce no-win situations-A few bugs - such as bosses freezing or minions entering boss fights-Jump has an arch (can not jump straight up)-Some bosses can knock you off ledges with one hit or one combo kill you-Some bosses frustrating (It often changes depending on your class) "

												Salt and Sanctuary is an action-rpg platformer that owes a great deal to Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, Dust, the Dark Souls series, Bloodborne, Phantasy Star Online 2, and Final Fantasy 10.  S&S, like certain characters in its story, is envious.  It grasps, it clutches, it steals whatever it can get its hands on, trying desperately to become the one thing it can never be.  But I found as the initial impressions (""Jesus Christ this is exactly Dark Souls wow they're not even trying to hide it"") wore off, I was surprised at just how much the game actually stands on its own.The surface mechanics of S&S are stolen from a few key sources.  From Dark Souls, it takes covenants, the style of item usage, much of its UI, stamina-dependent combat with parrying, heavy hits and stunlocking, as well as many of its general area concepts.  It even goes so far as to crib smaller details, such as letting the player wear 4 rings and giving many enemies tracking attacks, ala Dark Souls 2, right alongside the larger ones, such as needing to retrieve your souls, er, salt, from where you died.  From Bloodborne, we have certain mechanics revolving around offhand weapons, boss enrages below certain health thresholds, enemies themselves taking your salt rather than it simply dropping somewhere (unless you die from a fall), and quite a few enemy designs.  From Dust and SoTN, it takes much of its platforming and some later area designs.  From FF10, it takes the sphere grid.  From PSO2, it takes its style of equipping and utilizing spells and incantations.  And if all you saw were screenshots, or if you only heard about the game without playing it through, you might be forgiven for thinking it's a total rip-off in every way.What I found as I played through it to completion, however, was that S&S is more than the sum of its black market body parts.  To start at the surface: It does several things differently on a mechanical level from Dark Souls.  Magic in particular, I found very interesting.  Though you start with a ring equipped (if you start as a mage) that nullifies this effect, you have to be mindful of elemental imbalance that accrues and eventually hurts you if you cast too many of the same element's spells in a row.  I also like how your secondary resource, Focus, caps your maximum stamina as you burn through it, forcing you to choose carefully when to use magic, and presenting some interesting challenges for hybrid builds.  Magic feels satisfying and fun to use, growing more and more powerful as you progress until you can rely on it for every encounter with the right ""pure mage"" build, without feeling so crazy overpowered that it removes all challenge, like sorcery can be in Dark Souls 1.I also appreciated the balance the game strikes between Dark Souls' surfeit of similar weapons, and Bloodborne's dearth of wildly different ones.  Most of the weapons I ended up using, I got not from the world or from NPC vendors, but via alchemy, a system similar to boss soul weapon smithing from Dark Souls, but with components that can come from a variety of non-boss enemies as well.  As it turns out, there are a ton of different weapons you can only get this way, and a lot of them are cool as hell.Where S&S felt a bit less balanced, to me, was in its armor selection, which felt skewed more towards ""fashion souls"" in the light armor category, leaving a heavy armor character with often-unusably-heavy armors that didn't differ very much from each other, visually, except in color.  This is partly due to sprite design and character proportions not giving you a good view of what you're wearing, but where are all the fashionable heavy helms, for instance?  And you need an insane amount of Endurance to wear anything with half-decent damage mitigation.Dark Souls is known for telling its story obliquely, through item descriptions and such.  Salt and Sanctuary, however, I found to have a pretty straightforward story, told mostly through NPC dialogue.  There's a ton of flavor text in item descriptions and on the sphere grid, sorry, Tree of Skill.  But I found most of it to be just kinda... there.  It doesn't seem to point to any kind of coherent central narrative, but rather serves to flesh out the multitude of nations and stories that seem to exist (or that we're meant to think exist... somehow, I doubt much has been written beyond these short blurbs) in the ""S&S universe"".  But to be honest, maybe I'm over-exposed to this sort of thing by now, but nothing really stood out to me in the writing of this stuff.  I found it all pretty bland and easily skipped over.  That said, the main story that S&S tells is actually a pretty interesting one, if a bit simple in the end.  It has a compelling hook, some interesting windings (I can't really call them twists per se), and a satisfying conclusion with a choice of endings.  In any case, the main draw here is the gameplay, which is excellent.I appreciate the separation of gold and salt into two different currencies, while keeping salt the primary resource for character improvement via blacksmithing, alchemy, and leveling up.  This means gold becomes more of your ""noob support"" currency, letting the player spend it freely on usable items and some early-game special armors and weapons, letting you get a bit of a leg up at first and recover more easily from large salt losses.  Gold, though, doesn't seem to have too many uses in the late game.  Mostly, it just goes down the toilet when you die, thousands at a time.  I started just buying 99 bags of salt at a time near the end, and sitting there mashing RB for a relatively quick 9900 salt, just to get the gold spent somehow.  But that's tedious as hell, so I stopped doing it and just let it waste away to pay the cleric who revives you.  My theory is that Patches is from this universe, and this is why he hates clerics so much.I really like how your levelups are separated from your skill tree, how the skill tree is laid out, and how the presence of a limited-use item to respec a single skill point gives you some choices to make when building your character.  What's not immediately apparent is that you can put more than one point into the stat-boosting spheres on the tree.  Though, this isn't terribly useful on NG, I found.  It's better to rush to the sphere corresponding to the tiers of equipment you want to use.  And since I finished the game at level 81 my first time through, using a tier 4 greatsword and some tier 4 heavy armor pieces, I didn't really have enough skill points to start stacking stat-ups.While the visual design takes a lot of its cues from other games as far as general concepts go, I found the atmosphere of S&S to be well within bounds of being its own thing.  World feel and atmosphere are done very well in this game.  It especially starts ramping up towards the second half, once you're into and beyond the Castle of Storms.  There's some really cool stuff there!Movement and combat feels good.  I especially enjoyed some of the brands you get that change your movement around in unexpected ways for a game that feels like this.  Those little dashes of SoTN were a great and welcome addition.  The first brand you get, though, is particularly cool.  I'm not even going to say what it is, just cause I don't wanna be the one to spoil it for you if somehow you don't know.  And it influences level design in later areas in some really clever ways.All in all, Salt and Sanctuary is very much worth your time.  It's an extremely enjoyable and high quality game.  My first playthrough took me about 18 hours, and I know I missed a ton of stuff, especially in the last third when I was just kinda blowing through it not exploring too much due to the difficulty of a lot of the enemies.  I'm very much looking forward to finishing my mage playthrough, and I already have a Bloodborne beast hunter and a thief waiting in the wings.  Good stuff!			"

												With 60+ hours into the game, I have beaten the story (both endings) and have experienced most, if not all of the content the game has to offer. If you like games that are ruthless, punish you when you die but reward you if you can learn your environment and enemies, then it should be right up your alley.This game definitely has a lot of the Dark Souls series' elements to it. I'd say it is the metroid-vania take to the series (which makes me like it better personally). Here are my thoughts, the good and the bad:Pros:- Harsh gameplay, both enemies and environments- The art style and overall darnkess to the game- The classes, weapons, and skill tree will give you a huge variety of options to play with- Brutal boss fights- Great poise system- You really feel accomplished when you finally overcome an obstacle- Great replayability (New Game + after you beat the game)- The mystery surrounding the islandCons:- Not gonna lie, your character isn't the only thing that will get salty while playing this- The game won't hold your hand, which can make it hard for new players to get into without a sense of direction- The ability to refund in your skill tree requires a certain item, and the deeper you get invested, the harder it is to change direction. This isn't necessarily bad, but for characters you have invested a ton of time into, you basically have to commit to the path you end up deciding on.Overall I think this is a great game, if not one of my favorite RPGs for the genre. Personally, I only recommend the game as I have enjoyed my time playing it (bar the occasional saltiness ;P). If you like platformers and RPGs, give it a try!			"

												Your skill isnt enough to beat Dark Souls like mine? Well then this is for you. It limits the whole Dark Souls experience to 2D and combines it with a lot of Ctuhulhu feeling. But! Theres always progression! Also I think there are still some mysteries I didnt discover yet, also there are multiple clases and a neat really huge skill tree, which allows to develop your char like you want. Also its quite addictive. :-)			"

And it influences level design in later areas in some really clever ways.All in all, Salt and Sanctuary is very much worth your time.  It's an extremely enjoyable and high quality game.  My first playthrough took me about 18 hours, and I know I missed a ton of stuff, especially in the last third when I was just kinda blowing through it not exploring too much due to the difficulty of a lot of the enemies.  I'm very much looking forward to finishing my mage playthrough, and I already have a Bloodborne beast hunter and a thief waiting in the wings.  Good stuff!			"

												Some games cause rash. A rash you can not scratch. And when you don't get more of the scratch to the itch that plagues you, you end up sitting in a dirty street, cooking up a bottle of Jenkem over a burning trash can, injecting it into your worn out cockvein. This is not a review about a game that helps you, but one that only makes you just a little more broken.Salt and Sanctuary is a strange game. Many people say this is the lovechild of Dark Souls and Castlevania: Symphony of the knight. I beg to differ in this judgement. After playing and completing this game I can say that this felt more to me like a mixture of ghost's n' goblins regarding the visual athmosphere, mixed with a platforming experience close to Ninja Ga(y)iden and a combat system like final fight, all dipped into a semi deep RPG manager with a rather large world you need to explore without any map whatsoever.Apparently this game was created by a 2 man development team consisting of 2 brothers. That is to say rather impressive. The last game with such a small dev team I played was Dust:Elysian tale. And coincidently it was an Action RPG like this. Seems like those are a go-to place for Indie devs. Not complaining though, at least not about those 2. Well, maybe a little. This game has no story, and what little of rudimentary tropes there are fly directly out of the window the second the game finishes the tutorial sequence with a supposingly impossible boss fight against everybodys favourite tentacle monster, never to be seen ever again.A thing I have to give Salty Sanctuary is, that it appears to be a highly customizeable game. You can play a caster, a ranger or a knight, even with slight variations inbetween each class competently, resulting in a completely different game experience. That, and limiting yourself even more if you wish to a no-magic mode, nude mode, or even if you so desire (no idea why you wanted to but hey) a permadeath mode.I played this game like so many other on PC with keyboard and mouse while my character was a medium armored knight with a big weapon. I refused to use magic and was able to conquer the thing without ever using a shield. Not gonna lie here, the first 1 or 2 hours into the game were so bad that i contemplating requesting a refund for this. For some reason the menu management is really bothersome. When i tried to acces different screens or option menues those windows usually closed when i tried to browse them. Almost anytime when i was trying to use the mouse, the game refused to register the clicks or blended the mouse out of the screen, which caused me to end up more then once buying several units of items not in one stroke, but buying them one by one, sometimes several dozens. It sucked. The presence of of monetary currency that is not ""Souls"" left me dumbfounded, as many of the items you can buy for money stop being useful 2 hours into the game. Next time just say each and everthign for salt.The combat system is fittingly deep. You can chain weapon combat of smaller arms together and juggle opponenets around while big weapons usually oblitere them in one strike. The combat is meaty, full of blood and explosions. Quite fun. Dishonorable mention: The hitboxes. This game has one of the worst problems with hitboxes I have ever seen in a game. It's even worse than Dark Souls 2. Usually it's enough not to hit the enemy, but the thin air before him. Many enemies have difficulties judging your attack reach as well. This is all topped of with an almost useless dodge roll that has no invincibiliy frames whatsoever. You can still manage to win the game with it only, I am the living proof of that, but its more difficult than it needs to be and the utility is just not present in the same magnitude as you would expect it for a game that is shamelessly dickriding on the success of dark souls. Some of the bossfight were either also flat out boring or ridicously imbalanced (With one or two of them so much dysfunctional that I am willing to give a golden♥♥♥♥♥♥♥award for one of the most broken ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t bossfights in my entire life), but honestly said, the combat with those is rather mixed up most of the time and you can tell that the dev trieds really hard to make the frequent boss battles as interesting as the limitations of a 2D engine would humanly allow. So I am willing to forgive that. With the exceptions of Bosses stealing Souls and not giving it back when you defeat them. That needs to change.What little music is in the game is pretty nice. It fit's the athmospere of the game and sometimes even gave me flashbacks to ye good old diablo 2, when you listen to guitars being stringend at the sight of some nicely piled up corpse mountains. However, therein lies the problem. There is not enough music. At all. When i finished my first playthrough i felt like i only listened to maybe 6 tracks, excluding a brief and exclusive track for the final level and the unique theme for the final boss. Here's hoping if there will ever be a S&S2, that it has a significant bigger track library. Hopefully even with NPC voiceacting, because that is sadly missing as well.Overall visual design of S&S deserves praise. It's very good, with a small exceptions. The enemies, bosses, weapons and armor designs are top notch. There's a lot of them and they are all clearly distinguishable from oen another. Given some of them are flat out stolen from other games and rebranded, but they all look nice, faithful to the golden age of videos games in the 16 bit era. The Player characters and friendly NPC's do not get a cut from that cake. They are flat out ugly and look like anorexic deformed aborted cat fetuses, You can customize them but thats like putting a pig dress and painting it with make Up. It remains a pig, no matter how you look at it. This goes as far that some of the characters even get grossly distorted eye disabilities as if there was an invisible carrot floating over their head that genuinely freaked me out the first time I saw them. Luckyly you don't have to endure that for long, once you get a full encased helm to shield your eyes from the butt ugly mug of your toon, so that you have a splendid time exploring the dark and depressing dreadful landscapres to their fullest extend. I would say that the world feels, just like dark souls 2, like an amusement park of atrocities, but the well connected and vastly different from each other levels actually do make sense within the content of the game. No spoilers though.The game is surprisingly big for it's price. To the point where I wondered how many more hidden corridoors the devs could have put behind gated walls. If you like exploring, you will like this a great deal. Not explicitly the most difficult 2D game I have ever played, as the nature of a grindy action rpg bites itself in the♥♥♥♥♥the more knowlegdeable and skillful you get and your gear advances. But thats what NG+ is for. If you like a RPG game with considerable jump-run episodes, above averge difficulty with reward-faktor of if you like to insert some nasty burning♥♥♥♥♥♥into your urethra from time to time, you can consider this pleasantly presented brawler with a price tag below 20 Euros as recommended. Remember: Winners don't take drugs. Except Jenkem. That's 100% natural. Good Evening. "

												Salt and Sanctuary wants so badly to be 2D Dark Souls, and succeeds nicely in some parts, but fails in unexpected ways. The artwork is bleak, foreboding, and drawn in beautiful detail, with great variety in both enemies and environments. The music is typically just unobtrusive enough to be atmospheric, if a bit monotonous, but the sounds of combat at least have some ""oomph"" to them. Aesthetically speaking, it's a well done game, and the fights are viscerally satisfying.However, this game also being a sidescrolling platformer causes frustrating problems to arise: -Grabbing/climbing ledges isn't always reliable; it's difficult to determine where the actual window for contact is, and sometimes a running leap will send you sailing UNDER the ledge you meant to grab, often to your death. -The game uses an equipment burden system much like Dark Souls', but the platforming requires you to be agile. If you favor heavy armor or weapons, you'll have to juggle/remove equipment much more frequently or risk falling to your death because you couldn't clear a jump, which leads me to wonder why weight was implemented at all.-A long fall won't always kill you, but it's impossible to gauge the lethality of a drop because your ""camera look"" function barely extends the view beyond the edge of the screen. Combined with the overall gloominess, it means you'll be taking literally blind leaps more often than you'd like.In short, even when you know the ins and outs, you'll die more often to sudden falls than enemies by a very wide margin, which diverges sharply from the ""tough but fair"" learning curve of Dark Souls. I can't really call it a bad game, but it's certainly less intuitive than its inspiration.			"

This game won't be for everybody but if you like exploration, secret finding and some difficult emenies/bosses. Give it a go.			"

												From my 10 hours of gameplay so far I must say this game is absolutely amazing at how they pulled off a dark souls similar game in a 2D platformer style. There aren't many games that makes me want to come back for more other than this game, even when I get so salty in my defeats, it doesn't leave me feeling like giving up, this game makes me want to try, and try again to achieve my goal without feeling repetative.The gameplay is great, it had a nice dark fantasy art style that has a great difficult vibe to it, and the world layout with it's short cuts and routes are very well done.It's a heavily inspired by dark souls game but it's still great and doesn't feel all that unoriginal.I'd give it a 9/10, I would give it a 10/10 if it had online coop.

												When I saw this game for the first time, I knew I was going to enjoy it. Yes it's true, it looks like a 2D Dark Souls and is very similar in a lot of aspects.Pros:+ Beautiful graphics and atmosphere (character face is meh, wear a helmet and its ok.)+ Tons of enemies. Some may look similar texture wise, but they will most likely have different abilities.+ Tons of weapons. There are weapon tiers (1-5) which determines how bad or good a weapon is. HOWEVER, most weapons are viable. In fact, one of the best weapons is a tier 2.+ LOTS of movesets based on weapon type and the weapon itself.+ Good timed ""checkpoints"". If you die you probably won't have to walk for 3 hours back to the same spot, provided you unlock a shortcut (if you explore a bit).+ Puzzles, laberynths and parkour.+ Game rewards patience and skill, although you can facestomp for a while if you want.+ Optional areas and bosses with their unique rewards for the completionists out there.+ Good replayability potential. While you will get tier 5 at the end of 1st playthrough, you won't be even near to be at maximum upgrade, unlock all spells, weapons etc.+ Best boss soundtrack I've heard in a while.+ Decent lore, but the main plot isn't really explained until the very end. You need to explore and talk with NPCs.+ You are supposed to die in the tutorial.+ 1st blind playthough lenght: 22-25 hours. Worth spending a few more in NG+.+ NG+! NOTE: You are forced into it when you beat final boss. There are no ""new items"" or enemies in NG+, just more salt and difficult enemies.+ No performance issues. (Nvidia 710M 60fps 1366x768). Your laptop may be using integrated graphics card by default.+ Almost no hard grinding, even base 5% drops can happen with patience. Item drop also increases with a stat.+ Achievements are not hard, but some of them require spending some time into them.Cons:- No sorting system, not even automatic nor manual. Items are sorted as you find them, not tier or type based. And sometimes they get misplaced.- Game misses a lot of information. You don't know what type of damage do some weapons do. Some are clear, but not others. This is ""bad"" because some enemies can be almost invulnerable to slash damage (swords, reapers?) but take full damage from strike damage (hammers, some axes?). Same thing for magic, although it is pretty clear if you are dying to a fireball or a lightning.- You can't respec all perks. You can respec a few ones but that's it, you won't switch from the best swordman to the best mage with any item (soul vessel in DS2). Eventually you will become able to do a bit of everything while having a main class.- The creed system is good overall, but has some flaws: Some items are creed limited because they focus on a class type (warrior creed, mage creed, etc) and because you can't ""freely"" change creeds, its a bit annoying to get certain basic items.- Some weird stunlock. While being between 2 enemies can probably get you killed, there is no reason to get knocked over and over again by low tier enemies while you can do nothing.- Some items are only obtainable MAYBE ONCE per playthrough and no enemies drop them. Other are also this limited, but some enemies have a 5-10% chance to drop them.NOTE: On the plus side, you can transmute weapons: Literally switch from a weapon to other of the same category, keeping almost all the upgrades.- While almost all weapons and builds are viable, only a few guarantees that you dont get stomped vs some bosses over and over again unless you get lucky with their attacks.- Slow roll is too punishing, you rather have a♥♥♥♥♥♥weightless weapon with fast roll than the best one with slow roll. Still, heavy armor is best armor unless you are a mage.TL;DR: Yes, its a 2D Souls game. It's a new game, has its flaws, but will most likely get fixed or even improved. Incoming mod support has been heard. Definitely worth buying if on sale.			"

												After spending hours of frustration in this game I finally beat the thing. Not at all a perfect game its rather lonely. The only way that I know of to play with other people is to have them in the room with you. Which is an impossibility. I couldn't find a guest option, if it even exists which I found no evidence off. Not being able to play with friends online hurts the game quite a bit.The content is a mixed bag later on. Difficulty seems to be there mostly in leaps of faith. The community doesn't help much either as they'll tell you to jump just to troll you. Which early on I became sceptical of any help they might provite. Bosses range from painfully easy or extremely difficult. Do note that I played through the game as a squishy caster so it may very from play style to play style.Magic was far too shallow for my tastes which honestly hurts a lot of games in my opinion. Salt and Sanctuary does away with having 4 virtually identical forms of magic just with different damage or a different color. Which was nice but didn't make up for how shallow it was.Finding magic was an absolute nightmare. I had to look it up online to find a secret passage just to get my second spell. Since I started with a fireball. It shouldn't have been tucked away like that in the beginning. Having access to your first spells and a mage early on was key to my overall success and having novice spells tucked away on a secret place really harms this for me. Mind you, I don't mind questing for spells. I quite in joy it. But If I haven't even got my barrings in the game or know what I'm doing this is a rather poor decision. The end of the game was built up to fairly well with the little bit of diolog scattered through the game. Although its not much of a surprise, if at all, I wont spoil it. The community of the game does that for you as soon as you step onto the beach. Although the note in a bottle are more Cryptic clues from the community, it did lead me to the final conclusion I would have come to on my own long before facing the last boss. Even with that gripe, I found the story to be just enough to keep me interested in the world we where in. Which is a plus.Punishment for death seems a bit steap. Sure, losing all your salt to a boss and some gold seems okay, but I died 99% of the time to falling damage alone. The game is DARK! Not ""OMG, Like that's gross and stuff. You know, like Scary"", well it is, but dark as in ""Where the heck am I going. I can't see a darn thing!"". Which becomes frustrating because it artifically pads out the game far longer than It really needs to be. You might thing that falling to my death is my own fault. A few times it absolutely was... But not the majority of the time. Most the time it was just remembering when and where to leap. I ended up just ignoring large chunks of lost salt because It absolutely wasn't worth the effort to find the bat that'd spawn then spend the next 5 minutes trying to kill the darn thing because its everything you hate about bats in most 3D games only with a monsterous amount of health.Salt is used for everything. Just about. Armor, weapons, leveling. Which si fine. Having something else outside of normal experience seems fine to me. I can't really complain about that, its a bit different but not in a bad way.The skill tree is an absolute mess with a tone of redundancy. It looks sloppy and it feels sloppy. Even after I got used to it I found it to be more of a chore to work with than actually fun. The passive bonuses you get from it replace what would be called Attributes or stats in other games which pads out the leveling even further. I feel like there must have been a cleaner way to create it. Although its not as bad as other games which tie spells into their trees it still wasn't a very pleasent experience. At least it didn't fall into the same trap of trivializing old spells. But the game does that for you anyway. Which I guess its not fair of me to judge that on since most RPGs seem to trivialize your early spells.Athetically, there really isn't much I can say about the game. It fits for the theme. Some of the bosses looked really interesting and a few of the enimes where legitamently terrifying. Though the ones that where usually threatening didn't look that intimidating and the ones that looked trully nightmare enducing where push overs. I didn't care for the over all design of the game, baring a few boss and enemy designs I found particularly interesting.The game was Bundled into the Metroidvania summer sale package. And I can't honstly say this is a good Metroidvania game. The returning to old Locations to unlock new things or find new items is all there, but progression is pretty locked on that and few sectret items you find actually change up how you go about exploring the world. I found myself just looking up how to get to the next boss because I got so tired of stumbling my way around in the dark I just wanted to get the game over with. Which isn't a good thing. Compared to other Metroidvania games exploring the world you are in shouldn't be a chore until you want to unlock 100% of everythign. And even then most that time looking for random upgrades, bits and bobbles should be fun and exciting. Salt and Sanctuary didn't capture that for me. I found myself despising the areas I was in more than looking forward to that next discovery.I think for me, the major recomendation factor lies entirely with Multi Player and its magic system. Since It doesn't allow for online co-op and the magic system is still too shallow for me. There isn't honstly enough here for me to recommend based on my tastes alone.If you like the Dark Souls type games and a cryptic story with a dark setting. You'll Probably love this game. If You're looking for a Metroidvania game or a Deeper skill system in your RPGs this game really isn't for you. And Since I'm in the latter camp, I can't recommend this game.			"

												Funnily enough as I kept dying, my salt never really left me. It just came back a little stronger as I got up.All kidding aside... the only times I felt bad about dying were when my partner and I were platforming; and I was a bit too fast for them and fell offscreen to my demise, or failed to do offscreen wall jumping.Game is fun as it is. Although... having my partner wait in the menu as I do jumps for them makes things a bit too easy, as they just teleport to where I am, doesn't it? I wonder how many people didn't know that.			"

												In the same way that Stardew Valley was a love poem to Harvest Moon fans, This game is that for Dark Souls fans. It's challenging without being totally impossible (so long as you figure out the tricks). It's honestly just overall, very well made. The combat choices are awesome, probably the only complaint I have is that crossbows/guns feel too much like a handicap rather than an actually viable weapon choice on the offhand.			"

												It lives up to it's image of being a 2D Dark Souls.  My only gripes are the fact that there is no kind of map whatsoever, which often leads to hours of running around the map trying to find something to progress the game.  Also, the game has this dark border on the edges of the screen.  It eats up a lot of screen space and only disappears when you're outside of dungeons and such.  This may not seem like a big deal but since 90% of the game takes place in said dungeons it feels like you're playing on a monitor half the size of what you're actually using.  There is no brightness setting to take the edge off this effect and no way to disable it.That said, the game is fun.  There are tons of possible builds, tons of weapons, and tons of areas teeming with blade fodder.  I'm 26 hours in at this point and still haven't finished it.			"

												Wholeheartedly recommending this game. It's a very clever dark souls demake that wears its influences on its sleeves. Just like Dark Souls it has an eclectic selection of weapons and possible builds, a broad world to discover, and that gratifying feeling when you defeat a boss or reach that checkpoint.It however also has that metroid feel, with the levels looping into eachother and new items giving access to new areas. My second playthrough had a different order of areas and that feeling of almost cheating the games intentions is one of the best.It isn't a perfect game by any means, however. The artstyle is lacking when it comes to human characters, the sphere grid leveling is more basic than it lets on, and the lack of a map makes it hard to tell which route you have to take to get to the cleansing lady for example. That said, the game as a whole is a blast, especially for this price tag. A dense experience that is great, even when you consider it maybe not being too original.			"

												When I saw this game for the first time, I knew I was going to enjoy it. Yes it's true, it looks like a 2D Dark Souls and is very similar in a lot of aspects.Pros:+ Beautiful graphics and atmosphere (character face is meh, wear a helmet and its ok.)+ Tons of enemies. Some may look similar texture wise, but they will most likely have different abilities.+ Tons of weapons. There are weapon tiers (1-5) which determines how bad or good a weapon is. HOWEVER, most weapons are viable. In fact, one of the best weapons is a tier 2.+ LOTS of movesets based on weapon type and the weapon itself.+ Good timed ""checkpoints"". If you die you probably won't have to walk for 3 hours back to the same spot, provided you unlock a shortcut (if you explore a bit).+ Puzzles, laberynths and parkour.+ Game rewards patience and skill, although you can facestomp for a while if you want.+ Optional areas and bosses with their unique rewards for the completionists out there.+ Good replayability potential. While you will get tier 5 at the end of 1st playthrough, you won't be even near to be at maximum upgrade, unlock all spells, weapons etc.+ Best boss soundtrack I've heard in a while.+ Decent lore, but the main plot isn't really explained until the very end. You need to explore and talk with NPCs.+ You are supposed to die in the tutorial.+ 1st blind playthough lenght: 22-25 hours. Worth spending a few more in NG+.+ NG+! NOTE: You are forced into it when you beat final boss. There are no ""new items"" or enemies in NG+, just more salt and difficult enemies.+ No performance issues. (Nvidia 710M 60fps 1366x768). Your laptop may be using integrated graphics card by default.+ Almost no hard grinding, even base 5% drops can happen with patience. Item drop also increases with a stat.+ Achievements are not hard, but some of them require spending some time into them.Cons:- No sorting system, not even automatic nor manual. Items are sorted as you find them, not tier or type based. And sometimes they get misplaced.- Game misses a lot of information. You don't know what type of damage do some weapons do. Some are clear, but not others. This is ""bad"" because some enemies can be almost invulnerable to slash damage (swords, reapers?) but take full damage from strike damage (hammers, some axes?). Same thing for magic, although it is pretty clear if you are dying to a fireball or a lightning.- You can't respec all perks. You can respec a few ones but that's it, you won't switch from the best swordman to the best mage with any item (soul vessel in DS2). Eventually you will become able to do a bit of everything while having a main class.- The creed system is good overall, but has some flaws: Some items are creed limited because they focus on a class type (warrior creed, mage creed, etc) and because you can't ""freely"" change creeds, its a bit annoying to get certain basic items.- Some weird stunlock. While being between 2 enemies can probably get you killed, there is no reason to get knocked over and over again by low tier enemies while you can do nothing.- Some items are only obtainable MAYBE ONCE per playthrough and no enemies drop them. Other are also this limited, but some enemies have a 5-10% chance to drop them.NOTE: On the plus side, you can transmute weapons: Literally switch from a weapon to other of the same category, keeping almost all the upgrades.- While almost all weapons and builds are viable, only a few guarantees that you dont get stomped vs some bosses over and over again unless you get lucky with their attacks.- Slow roll is too punishing, you rather have a♥♥♥♥♥♥weightless weapon with fast roll than the best one with slow roll. Still, heavy armor is best armor unless you are a mage.TL;DR: Yes, its a 2D Souls game. It's a new game, has its flaws, but will most likely get fixed or even improved. Incoming mod support has been heard. Definitely worth buying if on sale.			"

												After spending hours of frustration in this game I finally beat the thing. Not at all a perfect game its rather lonely. The only way that I know of to play with other people is to have them in the room with you. Which is an impossibility. I couldn't find a guest option, if it even exists which I found no evidence off. Not being able to play with friends online hurts the game quite a bit.The content is a mixed bag later on. Difficulty seems to be there mostly in leaps of faith. The community doesn't help much either as they'll tell you to jump just to troll you. Which early on I became sceptical of any help they might provite. Bosses range from painfully easy or extremely difficult. Do note that I played through the game as a squishy caster so it may very from play style to play style.Magic was far too shallow for my tastes which honestly hurts a lot of games in my opinion. Salt and Sanctuary does away with having 4 virtually identical forms of magic just with different damage or a different color. Which was nice but didn't make up for how shallow it was.Finding magic was an absolute nightmare. I had to look it up online to find a secret passage just to get my second spell. Since I started with a fireball. It shouldn't have been tucked away like that in the beginning. Having access to your first spells and a mage early on was key to my overall success and having novice spells tucked away on a secret place really harms this for me. Mind you, I don't mind questing for spells. I quite in joy it. But If I haven't even got my barrings in the game or know what I'm doing this is a rather poor decision. The end of the game was built up to fairly well with the little bit of diolog scattered through the game. Although its not much of a surprise, if at all, I wont spoil it. The community of the game does that for you as soon as you step onto the beach. Although the note in a bottle are more Cryptic clues from the community, it did lead me to the final conclusion I would have come to on my own long before facing the last boss. Even with that gripe, I found the story to be just enough to keep me interested in the world we where in. Which is a plus.Punishment for death seems a bit steap. Sure, losing all your salt to a boss and some gold seems okay, but I died 99% of the time to falling damage alone. The game is DARK! Not ""OMG, Like that's gross and stuff. You know, like Scary"", well it is, but dark as in ""Where the heck am I going. I can't see a darn thing!"". Which becomes frustrating because it artifically pads out the game far longer than It really needs to be. You might thing that falling to my death is my own fault. A few times it absolutely was... But not the majority of the time. Most the time it was just remembering when and where to leap. I ended up just ignoring large chunks of lost salt because It absolutely wasn't worth the effort to find the bat that'd spawn then spend the next 5 minutes trying to kill the darn thing because its everything you hate about bats in most 3D games only with a monsterous amount of health.Salt is used for everything. Just about. Armor, weapons, leveling. Which si fine. Having something else outside of normal experience seems fine to me. I can't really complain about that, its a bit different but not in a bad way.The skill tree is an absolute mess with a tone of redundancy. It looks sloppy and it feels sloppy. Even after I got used to it I found it to be more of a chore to work with than actually fun. The passive bonuses you get from it replace what would be called Attributes or stats in other games which pads out the leveling even further. I feel like there must have been a cleaner way to create it. Although its not as bad as other games which tie spells into their trees it still wasn't a very pleasent experience. At least it didn't fall into the same trap of trivializing old spells. But the game does that for you anyway. Which I guess its not fair of me to judge that on since most RPGs seem to trivialize your early spells.Athetically, there really isn't much I can say about the game. It fits for the theme. Some of the bosses looked really interesting and a few of the enimes where legitamently terrifying. Though the ones that where usually threatening didn't look that intimidating and the ones that looked trully nightmare enducing where push overs. I didn't care for the over all design of the game, baring a few boss and enemy designs I found particularly interesting.The game was Bundled into the Metroidvania summer sale package. And I can't honstly say this is a good Metroidvania game. The returning to old Locations to unlock new things or find new items is all there, but progression is pretty locked on that and few sectret items you find actually change up how you go about exploring the world. I found myself just looking up how to get to the next boss because I got so tired of stumbling my way around in the dark I just wanted to get the game over with. Which isn't a good thing. Compared to other Metroidvania games exploring the world you are in shouldn't be a chore until you want to unlock 100% of everythign. And even then most that time looking for random upgrades, bits and bobbles should be fun and exciting. Salt and Sanctuary didn't capture that for me. I found myself despising the areas I was in more than looking forward to that next discovery.I think for me, the major recomendation factor lies entirely with Multi Player and its magic system. Since It doesn't allow for online co-op and the magic system is still too shallow for me. There isn't honstly enough here for me to recommend based on my tastes alone.If you like the Dark Souls type games and a cryptic story with a dark setting. You'll Probably love this game. If You're looking for a Metroidvania game or a Deeper skill system in your RPGs this game really isn't for you. And Since I'm in the latter camp, I can't recommend this game.			"

												I have a hard time getting into 2D games anymore even though I played them growing up. But this game is amazing and it's very addictive, this is basically Dark Souls 2D, it's very well made and very fun to play. The combat and controls are smooth, the environments are awesome, dark and intriguing, the graphics are even really nice to look at. A lot of weapons and enemy types so far. Do not hesitate if you love 2D games and especially do not hesitate if you love the Dark Souls series or even just a good rpg, this game is great and you won't regret purchasing it. I would love to see this continue as it's own series because I would buy them all. This game deserves to be in the spotlight, it's that good imo.			"

												It is very rare that a copy of something can perfectly mimic the original source like SaS does to Dark Souls, but by ♥♥♥♥ing god does it nail it. Excellent combat, fantastic atmosphere, great level design and fantastic bosses create a game that lives up to the expectations of Dark Souls and it's legacy.Pros: -Excellent combat- captures what makes the Dark Souls combat system work with a combination of skill, rewarding sound effects and satisfiying, intelligent encounters that make you feel good.-Fantastic level design- beautifully interconnected levels had me slapping my head at how seamlessly these levels bled together, and unlocking shortcuts it always fun. Level design gets a bit dickish towards the end, however.-Great bosses- a ton of unique and interesting bosses that provide an array of interesting and tough, but always fun, challenges.-Atmosphere- say what you want about the artstyle (which I think is fine) the incredible atmosphere of a lot of these locations is great. Standouts include the Hall of Red Cages, the Dome of the Forgotten, and some more areas I don't wanna spoil.* Cons-No map- A lack of some kind of map led to a very confusing layout that can often confuse the average player.- Some dickish bosses- while every boss was challenging, not all of them felt fair.Overall: 8/10.Buy it.

												game is fairly buggy and doesn't seem as if it has been receiving any support since may. my introduction to the game was being killed by a marauder in the tutorial area who stopped having a hit box. have also had other issues such as my salt getting tied to inanimate objects on death that cannot be interacted with, a known and documented bug that has not been fixed.has a lot of your bread-and-butter PC port nightmare problems. borderless windowed seems to occasionally have an issue with the task bar gets stuck on top of the window, which i haven't been able to figure out how to fix other than to restart the game completely. the game had different gamma on full screen when i first played, but after realizing the game was running at 1920 x 1080 instead o my native resolution (thx,) now it seems it only runs with a murky, low-contrast gamma (I -believe- this is the intended way it is supposed to look, but there are no brightness settings to alleviate the issue of feeling like I'm playing a game with cataracts. I don't care how dark and gritty your game is trying to be.)I couldn't get co-op working with a keyboard at all. It would prompt P2 to press space bar, but pushing space did nothing. Other fun design flops are the fact that in the default keybinding, the inventory is bound to the escape key, but if you try to set P2's controls to copy the default for keyboard, you literally CAN'T bind the escape key because the escape key cancels the input for key binding. Genius! Never mind the fact that they key binds or button mapping you set up in single player *DOES NOT* transfer to co-op and you have to rebind everything. Annoying.other than that, the game is simply trying way too hard to be dark souls (name checks out.) It is essentially 2D dark souls without they clean, readable animations and with a lazy ""hurp burp save the princess"" canned story. The Souls games have excellent stories and lore, but I guess whoever wrote this one had no ideas other than perpetuating lazy damseling nonsense. there's a PoE / FFX-esque skill grid for level ups, but as far as I can tell it is only for mundane RPG stats. There's also very little explanation of what each stat does and you are left to infer, which while your basic ""strentgh"" and associated stats are fairly straightforward, others would likely be a problem for people not familiar with a souls-type game (which it is largely copying by the letter.)It's dark, it's gritty, it wants to be souls, and the game can bug out and you can lose all your not-souls with no change of getting them back because the developers don't bug fix the game. It's lack of inspiration would be maybe forgivable, but for as many problems as I've had with it and its evidently now-nonexistent supprt, I simply can't recommend it. For almost $20, you should just go buy Actual Dark Souls and play that instead.			"

												Salt and Sanctuary is an exercise in tedium. When you first start playing this game it feels very good. The graphics are great with a nice crisp art style, the combat animations are pretty nice, and movement is at a nice smooth pace.Then you start making progress and realize it just doesn't work.It's designed to mimic dark souls but the execution is just not there. Time and time again you will mis-judge a roll assuming you will make it through their legs only to get stuck and killed, and you will be falling to your death non stop the entire game. The controls are the hardest enemy in the game by far.It also makes strange design choices with mana and fatigue that make the game more of a slog than it should be, as you have to routinely go back to a bonfire even if your hp is full because your stamina is a mess. And this happens frighteningly fast, especially if you use magic. It's just not good. It has alot of promise and feels great when you start out, but quickly becomes just flat tedius and you will be begging for it to end after your 100th falling death.			"

												I see everyone complaining about how ""This is a bad rip of Dark Souls"" ""Dark Souls Dark Souls Dark Souls"". If you will just stop comparing and look at it from an individual perspective you will find that this game is rather brilliant for multiple reasons.1. ITS NOT 60 DAMN DOLLARS! You are getting a really good game for less than $20.2. The level design is fun and entertaining especially considering this is a 2D sidescroller.3. It's just pure fun. Yes it's difficult at times but in no way is it not fair4. It's skill tree is not that bad when you sit down and study it.The only thing I would like them to fix with this game is the hit boxes. They tend to extend further than the weapon being used and can be quite frustrating to predict when the blow will land.Overall I give this game a 7/10. I'll give it a 9/10 if they fix the hit boxes.			"

												Salt and Sanctuary is a really fun and difficult game that mixes  Dark Souls with Castlevania. As fun as it is, the game ""borrows"" way too much from its Dark Souls inspiration IMO. There's a difference between paying homage to a beloved game and ripping off almost the exact same UI, fonts, sound effects, even the weapon scaling and the way they list defenses (ex. a whole list of things like vs Strike 28.2, vs Slash 14.7, vs Fire and etc- done EXACTLY the same way Dark Souls did it). They have a message system near identical to the Souls' orange soapstones (messages in bottles), there's item lore that's done in the exact same way the Souls' games do it, and they even have candles and a level up system so close to the Souls' bonfires you'll have to recheck to see what game you're really playing.I jest of course!While most parts of the notoriously tough Dark Souls could be overcome by a competent player, some skill, and a lot of trial and error there are parts of S&S that I find to be borderline bad design. There are for example some axe tossing enemies whose axes can magically increase in range and arc to almost never miss you, teleporting skeletons that will make you pull your hair out, false floors during boss fights that probably shouldn't be in there, super strong wraiths in early areas of the game that swarm you and lob exploding grenades at you, etc etc. In these cases yes skill is still necessary but many times it feels like the difficulty is cheap.Enough of the bad though! The way this game handles its skill tree is very cool and thankfully DIFFERENT than Dark Souls for once. You can use black pearls (1 is awarded upon each leveling up at the candles) to branch out into many different areas of expertise or stack points into a single area like Increased Strength. Go far along another path to gain the abilities of another class that started off near that circle (you'll see what I mean, it's tough to explain). I started off as a paladin but quickly discovered that I wanted to be able to cast an enchant weapon miracle, which was a class 2 cleric spell. So the next 10 or whatever levels I put points all along the way towards that Cleric class 2 goal. I find the skill tree / hub thing to be very awesome the way they did it.Also unique to this game as far as I'm aware are the small stone characters you'll find scattered about the world. You can then offer them to a sanctuary and have them turn into real people who'll live in the building and help you out later. These guys can range from miracle-selling clerics to blacksmiths who'll upgrade your weapons and armor to Leader characters who will exchange enemy parts for rewards (example batwings or ears). To keep any one sanctuary from becoming too OP there's a limit on how many of these guys can reside at any given sanctuary. Another great idea!There are many many weapons which you'll use to kill things ranging from swords to pitchforks to crossbows and halberds. Many of these weapons are very fun to mess around with, even if you don't have the stats currently to deal gobs of damage to your enemies. The halberd for example seems to be able to hit an enemy twice with one of its attacks. The bow and arrow is almost a necessity against the aforementioned axe-throwing S.O.Bs however the aiming mechanics of bows in general leaves much to be desired and I ended up wasting a ton of arrows just trying to HIT anything. Luckily foes killed by your bow will almost always have arrows on them to reclaim for later. The paladin starts off with a morning star and it's pretty friggin' awesome too. The only thing that would've made this game even better is for the devs to scale back the giant damage that every greatsword seems to do. They have the range, they have the damage.. They outclass almost everything else that I've gotten so far. I'd like to see a bunch of random end game players who AREN'T all using greatswords, wouldn't you?Graphically, I love this game. Yes I know bloom effect has been done to death but I think it adds to the eerieness this game is trying to pull off. The art is hand drawn and every glove and helmet you equip shows on your character. Your character also seems to be constantly on crack, as their eyes dart around in a most creepy way in eternal paranoia! Music is very good though that high-pitched shrill shrieking sfx at the menu screen is pretty grating. As for sound effects they are exactly like those found in Dark Souls so if you liked how that sounded you'll like this too.tldr;Game is awesomeGame rips off too much from Dark Souls, which I feel helped get this title a lot more sales than it would have otherwiseIf they didn't copy so much of Dark Souls it'd stand out better than it does (and it already does)The original ideas they do have are great, we need to see more of themEnemies are often cheap which sorta' sucksI'm just being honest with my criticismsRecommended!

												A true 2D BloodSouls(Bloodborne+DarkSouls) experience with several additions. I've played this game on the PS4 a lot and I loved every second of it.If you're a die-hard BloodSouls fan, then get this game. You won't regret it.The only thing that's kind of messy with this game is dodging big bosses. When you try to roll past them you get pushed back from their large hitboxes. It makes for some unfair moments, but it doesn't make the game a bad experience as a whole.This game also lacks online co-op which doesn't make sense because it has online messages like in the BloodSouls games.

												Really really really hard core game.I have dark souls 1,2,3 and I thought this game should be easy going since I'm a hard core player. But I must admit this game is really different from dark souls. You can't dodge like what you always do in dark souls, which makes this game difficult for me.Anyway, I admire outstanding graphics design and music and its difficulty. If you love hard core action game, like me, just purchase this game. You won't be disappointed.			"

												I see everyone complaining about how ""This is a bad rip of Dark Souls"" ""Dark Souls Dark Souls Dark Souls"". If you will just stop comparing and look at it from an individual perspective you will find that this game is rather brilliant for multiple reasons.1. ITS NOT 60 DAMN DOLLARS! You are getting a really good game for less than $20.2. The level design is fun and entertaining especially considering this is a 2D sidescroller.3. It's just pure fun. Yes it's difficult at times but in no way is it not fair4. It's skill tree is not that bad when you sit down and study it.The only thing I would like them to fix with this game is the hit boxes. They tend to extend further than the weapon being used and can be quite frustrating to predict when the blow will land.Overall I give this game a 7/10. I'll give it a 9/10 if they fix the hit boxes.			"

												Okay, this is really good. At first I thought it was just a Dark Souls 2D, but I did not realize that 2D and 3D are two completely differet things.It's already been explained by several reviews - Salt and Sanctuary is a good mix of Dark Souls and Metrovania games. Regarding Atmosphere and Art Style, Salt and Sanctuary is much more gloomy than Dark Souls. But it seems to lack the sense of slowly approaching dread, perhaps due to its art style; but I don't really mind. The gameplay is very fluid and polished. It's very obvious that much work was put into this work. I've only gone so far as the Sodden Knight and some more, but I am yet to meet any unfair challenges.The levelling system is quite needlessly complex, however. It's not too difficult to understand, but I believe that it could just have been replaced with a simple level-up system. I don't dislike it, but it's not one of the game's stronger points. "

												This game is exactly what I expected it to be and therefore it can definitely be recommended, because my expectations were pretty high.Salt and Sanctuary succeeds in creating a perfect mixture of Metroid and Dark Souls. For some, this might be a reason to call the game's design bland and pretentious, but isn't it better to play something you wanted to and be happy in all aspects than having a completely innovative experience with faults, bugs and design flaws all over a product?The gameplay is extremely smooth, so far (after 8 hours of playtime on release day) the levels offer alot of variety, the difficulty is unforgiving and the item amount and skill tree as complex as it could be.I love the game and have no doubt that players who are looking for exactly these type of games will too.1 point minus for the lack of online multiplayer and 1 minus for the slightly intransparent inventory system, but still this sums to a very good 8/10.I will keep this review updated as I advance more into the game.

												Such an amazing game!It combines Dark Souls game elements, with a whole lot of other and unique ideas. This is compared to the Dark Souls series all the time by most people and that's completely fair but it is uniquely different and has its own amazing ideas, regardless if it was 3D or 2D.Salt is your upgrading ""currency"". Once you spend Salt to level up, you then spend that level on the skill tree.YOU are the one who decides what tree path to take. The skill tree is large and adequate and offers the options for a wide variety of different builds. You use Salt to upgrade your weapons and armour. You must acquire specific items to upgrade your equipment, similar to Titanite in Dark Souls. You get prayers and magic.You get a wide variety of enemies and the bosses are enjoyable, fun and fairly challenging.If you enjoy the Dark Souls series combat, you will love this.The game screams of quality. Everything is well thought out and polished. No bugs, no glitches. I can not fault anything yet.The best thing? This amazing game costs 12GBP at discount price. That's 3 times less than triple AAA titles all the while being much better than most.Get this game and support the developers!			"

You really need a controller for this, I think. I don't feel m/k controls naturally with in this game. Pick it up! Brutally hard and unforgiving in the best kind of way (except for very few cheap deaths thanks to limited view - I.e falling off a cliff).  Tight controls, find of weapons and gear, and a fleshed out world make this an extremely enjoyable experience.			"

I haven't had a chance to play much on the Steam version, but I did Platinum (gain all achievements) on the PS4 version of the game.This game is a masterpiece, and it shows that the devs really have a great passion for what they do. With only 2 people, they have crafted a game with far greater depth than many AAA teams have ever hoped to achieve. The game is not perfect, and at launch of the PS4 ver. there were many bugs that found their way into release day - but, here's the thing: this guys give a s***.There have been 2 huge patches on PS4, which fixed a ridiculous amount of bugs, and even added brand new features. Anyhow, I'll try to keep this a spoiler free review.What the game has:1. Replay Value - Multiple endings, NG+, tons of potential playstyles.2. Combat - Amazing 2D sidescroller combat, think Dark Souls meets Castlevania.3. Exploration - While not as interconnected as Dark Souls 1 due to the nature of 2D sidescrolling, the game still feels connected, many areas have multiple ways in and out (if you look) for them, items are waiting for you all over the place. In fact, what this game has up on Dark Souls, is it's verticality and platforming. It feels so great in a game like this.4. Lore - It is just as vague as it's inspiration, but not an ounce (or ML for the rest of the world) short of mystery and intrigue. As with souls games, read as much as you can.5. Story-based skills - There are skills you obtain, called Brands, as you progress the story. I won't spoil what they do, but they add significantly new ways to play the game.6. ""Craftable"" weapons - If you've played Dark Souls, you know what I mean.7. Unique NPC system - There are NPCs found in the world, including 'quests' with a few in particular. Others are simply your typical merchants. However, there are others that you are able to bring to your 'bonfire' as you see fit to provide you services. You must use a consumable to do so, but it is a great feature. These NPCs also include one in particular called, ""Leader"" which allows you to level up your 'covenant.' O ye there is covenants.8. Covenents - See #7What the game does not have1. Online Multiplayer - It's unfortunate, but there is no way to play online with other users (at the time of this writing). There is a message system and local coop only. 2. No Online MP is literally my only complaint.The Steam ver. runs as expected. I have no performance issues with the game or anything like that.			"

												Everyone just calls this 2D Dark Souls (Dark Souls being the primary inspiration) but this is really its own thing. It has its own style, an ongoing sea theme and art style and shields that are actually worthwhile to use... but most of all its metal. Basicly the first non-tutorial level has floors made of meat and theres so much more meat and meat and meat I LOVE IT! MEAT!I'll actually say that I like this more than Dark Souls, having started both around the same time. That's right, go ahead and start your grills and pyres but I like this more than Dark Souls. It reminds me in a wierd way of Mega Man Zero and although I don't generally play platformers I feel a bit nostalgic for some reason when I play this.The musics pretty good, bosses are cool and varied as are weapons and armor, and there is plenty of meat.

Product received for free
												I wanna get something out of the way first - Yes, Salt and Sanctuary feels exacly like a Dark Souls. You might say: ""They should be ashamed for trying to cash in on the success of Dark Souls."" I wholehearthedly disagree with that. While the concepts ARE simmiliar, there is also a lot of inovative things, some of which I've missed in the Dark Souls series. Let's start off by explaining the battle system. You have a fast and strong attack, a block and a roll. This means you can either rely on heavy armor and blocking or light clothes and dodging. Your weight affects your speed and the usefulness of the dodge move, so most of this works the same as Dark Souls. However, the two dimensions provide a much thougher challenge, it's harder to get breathing room and you can get caught and slaughtered much faster. I must also say that the adition of two weapon sets was a great idea. You can change between them even during battle and this can be very useful and prevents you from being restricted by a certain fighting type.This brings us to the variation of the enemies. The vary in both how they look and how they attack and some are stronger than others. While you won't have much trouble slaughtering the first couple of zombies, you will soon encounter much thougher and meaner enemies, some of which can kill you in a couple of hits. There are also bosses, a decent number of them actualy. You will need to kill them in order to advance the story and this might provide quite a bit of a challenge. They are still (usualy) not unfair in the terms of mechanics, but they do get stronger the more damaged they are. The skill system is great. The number of skills and choises to make is simply astounding. It imediately reminded me of Path of Exile, however it IS quite a bit more simple. This does not mean it lacks depth or different builds, however I do recommend looking up a guide if you're starting out, because otherwise you can quickly screw yourself over later on. You can unlock the option to equip better weapons and armor, while other options include mostly attribute upgrades.The last thing I wanna talk about is graphics. The game has a quite unique and beautiful aesthetic which is dark and depressing. The characters looked like giant frog-people, at least for me. As for the soundtrack, to be honest, after not playing for a couple of days, I've already forgotten it. It was simply not remembable for me, however this relies mostly due to personal preferences.I have to mention one thing that's been bothering me a lot. There is no map. This is actualy quite a big of a deal, because you will quickly get lost in the huge world, which has many different locations and corridors. The fact that you will have to backtrack quite often makes orienting even more confusing.  Conclusion: If you ever wanted to play Dark Souls in 2D, now is your chance. Even if you haven't played Dark Souls, you will most likely still love Salt and Sanctuary. It's a well designed and polished product, expecialy considering the fact it was made by two people. Rating: 8.7/10			"

												I really don't know if i should recommend this game... It's a lotta fun, but some of the game mechanics are just so frustrating. The negatives:Not being able to fast travel to every checkpoint without placing a certain item there, it just makes backtracking annoying. When you wanna go back to an area because you just gained wall jumps or whatever, you sometimes can't. That's stupid. You'll have to teleport to a different checkpoint, walk to where you gotta go, and yada yada, that's 20 minutes you're never getting back. Also, as a bonus, you can get knocked off of edges by enemies or just get killed by them, making the walk even longer. Also, some of the bosses, they just suck. A few are so easy you can't tell if you've stumbled into an earlier area since you just 3 shot it,some bosses are so hard because of stupid attacks that one shot you or throw you off some dumb edge. I think it's safe to say i hated 80% of the bosses. The positives:Movement is fun, dashing and wall jumping makes it less tedious, if only a little, to backtrack to earlier areas. The regular monsters are a lot of fun to fight, with satisfying effects when you kill them.The platforming is solid, for the most part, with clever intigration of the abilities you gain throughout the game.Every weapon i've used has some fun combo's to learn and use in bosses. Not fighting game level complex combo's,but more like a cross between fighting game and action game combo's.I liked strategically placing things at checkpoints. (apart from that a fast traveler is one of them)The bosses that i did enjoy were great, it was a lot of fun to learn to dodge them and go in for some hits before having to roll away.(Almost) all the bosses had cool designs, even though their names were rather uncreative.(I haven't played any co-op, so i can't give my opinion on that.)Overall, I liked the game. I'm a fan of the soulsborne franchise, and this is an interesting spin on those games. I think you should give it a try, for sure, at least if you enjoy the soulsborne franchise.			"

												Just finished my first playtrough, and I really enjoyed it. You have the whole world to explore, 2D platformer puzzles with unique mechanics, enjoyable battle mechanics, levelling system similiar to PoE (Path of Exile), An arsenal of equipment that you can upgrade and transform, challenging enough to keep you immersed to the game, sidemissions that you can complete for rewards, optional bosses etc.If you like the souls series or similiar dark fantasy game, this is the one game you SHOULD play. 18€ for a game like this feels like a bargain. The only downside I'd say, is that the game is quite short for someone who dashes trough the story. And the ♥♥♥♥♥ by the lake. I'm still SALTY about that.Overall, great game, fantastic atmosphere and gameplay. 9.5/10			"

												Great game.  Controls are very smooth.  Combat-  every move feels important.   Your abilities will slowly degrade between sanctuaries.  That sound terrible, but it keeps you from living out of your backpack for the whole story.   For example,  your health bar's max capacity can be reduced by a grevious wound and your magic bar use degrades your stamina cap.   The main purpose is to break the campaign into smaller excursions.   The net effect is that you spend time thinking and caring about the area you are in.   I am not a big fan of platformers, but this game stands out because you get moments of furious action preceded by a nice build-up.			"

												There is a very difficult formula when creating games that are supposed to be difficult. Most of them end up undershooting and everything is extremely easy and boring, or they overshoot and the game becames impossible and frustrating.Salt & Sanctuary, however is the perfect execution of the difficulty formula. A truly difficult game shouldn't keep you downtrodden and hopeless. Salt & Sanctuary doesn't do that. It is merciless, beyond belief but even as it repeatedly kills you it makes a solemn promise to you: Observe your enemies, practice and play defensively and you will master me. It's not an easy road, but for me it's one worth taking.Everything else about the game is equally superb. From the eerily quiet and ambient soundtrack to the masterful artwork that went into this game. Controls are executing flawlessly and game play is addictive, extremely difficult but also extremely rewarding when you start realizing how the game was actually meant to be played.Being entirely honest, this game may just possibly be my favorite Metroidvania game, and this includes Symphony of the Night which I've beat at least 10 times.

												I love this game.  Calling it Dark Souls in 2D is a fairly simple summation, so I'll also add that it plays very much like a really hard Castlevania game.  If you haven't played Dark Souls, do yourself a favor and check it out, but definitely get this game anyway.  The game also doesn't suffer from some of what people get frustrated with in Dark Souls, such as hit detection, random enemy behavior, accidentally striking walls, and poor jumping.


YouTube™ Video: 2spoopy - Salt and Sanctuary (PC) 

			Views: 26		

			Today we play an excellent cross between Symphony of the Night and Dark Souls. Bet you didn't even think it was possible, eh? ***** Salt and Sanctuary is copyright Ska Studios, 2016.		

Furthermore, with the salt and gold system, you don't feel like you're losing terribly much progress when you die as there are a fair amount of things you can buy with gold instead of salt.  Also interesting is the idea of making offerings to get different shopkeepers, blacksmiths, and so on to come to individual sanctuaries as well as making different sanctuaries stronger.  All in all, it's a very fun game and again, if you like Dark Souls, you owe it to yourself to pick this up.			"

												Honestly only got this because people were calling it 2d dark souls, and in a way it is, but it is different enough to be it's own game, and pulls it off extremely well.PROS:The story is unique and deep and hidden maybe even more than dark souls', but it is great. Lots of weapons (not as many as say, dark souls, but enough to stand out and all of them are good in their own way, no ""zweihander types that everyone uses because it is flat out better than everything else"" stuff)Difficulty is on point, even in ng+ with max gear(although it seems the enemies are REALLY buffed up in ng+ so it might be harder than new game). It is challenging, but rewarding.Platforming is integrated well into it with things like the different brands(or movement abilities you unlock through out the game), and a super jump as well as agile enemies to go with it and breaking and vanishing platforms.Art style for the environments is fantastic, dark and bright at the same time adding atmosphere Level designs are complicated enough to get lost in and allow for actual exploration Music is greatBosses and enemies look intimidating and unique CONS:Most of the bosses are all big humanoid turned beast types that I personally don't mind because the fights are unique enough and they look different, but I know some who would not like this and that is one of their biggest complaints with the souls series.Needs more music, although all of it is good I'm pretty sure some of the bosses used the same track. It'd be better if they all had their own themes.Dat fall dmg thoYou can only use the guns, crossbows and wands as an offhand slot that replaces your shield, but bows are a main weapon? This isn't really a bad thing, it just bugs me a lot, wish it was a bonus way to use them, not the only/forced way. NG+ may scale up way too much. I'm only at the first sanctuary right now, so this may not be a thing. I was using a dagger that one hit the enemies here in ng, but in ng+ it takes around 4 hits/the amount it took for an unupgraded starter dagger to do in the first playthrough(using tier 5(highest there is) fully upgraded dagger) so, yeah. Read somewhere that there are 7 ngs so if my maxed out highest level weapon can't handle ng+1 in the first area, then it might be too hard. We'll see. "

												I'll admit, I've been a fan of Ska Studios since Vampire Smile, so I absolutely have some bias in favor for them (In case people don't know, Ska Studios's main developers consist of only two really cool people). Regardless, Salt & Sanctuary is a beautifully visual and ambitious game that does indeed take a lot of its inspirations from the Dark Souls games.Having recently gotten into the Souls games myself, the controls do take a bit of getting used to. But once that's squared away, it's easy to see just how well the Souls influence affects S&S in just the right way. A prime example is dying and losing your salt, thinking ""Alright, I'm just going to rush there, get my salt back, and get back to my sanctuary"", and then getting skwered by spawning bandits and attack dogs (I'm not bitter at my stupidity, I swear). The visual asthetic is a little muddy when things get close and I sometimes miss bottles and salt on the ground, and I wish there was an easier eye-catching jump between picking up an item and seeing what it is off to the side, but that's a personal gripe and as with the controls one gets used to it over time and it becomes easier to see. The addition of a skill tree helps easily visualize what build one wishes to go for.The sound and ambiance is quiet and foreboding. A trademark of Ska Studios alongside the visceral juiciness of blood and blades, the music and tone is well-played throughout the game (so far, in my case) and the boss music is appropriately tense and reactive to the situation in comparison. Executing an enemy has a satisfying SQUELCH and even opening bottles sounds weirdly gratifying.Storywise, there isn't much. There's text in the beginning to give some opening composition, but it's brief and gets the subtly gets the point across that the story may not matter all that much.The game is deep, beautiful, and lavished with evidence that this was made by Dark Souls fans, for Dark Souls fans. With Ska Studios's signature elements and talent, this is the best of both worlds and highly recommended. Even if I am a biased fan.			"

For anyone who's not a Souls fanThis is an outstanding RPG with a deep skill customization system and absolutely outstanding visuals. It's fairly difficult, but you are able to overcome almost any obstacle with a little thinking, and of course, with experience from your faliures. For 18 €, this is a must-buy. Local Coop is highly recommended, but it's just as great alone.For anyone who is a Souls fanThis is an outstanding RPG with a lot of influance from the Souls series (mainly from the land of Lordran), but with a much deeper leveling system, and with the inclusion of an ingenius local coop. Online summoning and invasions are not available, but Salt and Sanctuary is diverse enough that it doesn't need these elements to still be just as enjoyable as any Souls game. If you are afraid that it's not different enough from Dark Souls, don't be, it has an amazing vibe to it that's exclusive to Salt and Sanctuary.			"

												Buy this game. It's amazing. Yeah, the art is, uh, creatively stylized, and there's not much music, but It's Castlevania Souls. Seriously it's Castlevania Souls, with all the good that could possibly imply. Do you like SOTN? Do you like Dark Souls? Do you like Terraria?Wait, what? Don't worry, there's no building or procedural generation in this game, but it's the first game to really out-do Terraria in terms of providing a solid 2D action experience with a customizable playstyle and appearance. It's also the first metroidvania game to offer those things. And it's seriously atmospheric and overall just a lot of fun.The game obviously draws a ton of inspiration from Dark Souls, but if you're a casual gamer or just bad at games, don't let that scare you away. While Salt & Sanctuary is challenging, it's much more forgiving than those titles.Useful information: it has same-screen co-op and PvP! It does not have network play at all, although it does have passive multiplayer elements (messages and gravestones, which are like bloodstains in Souls).			"

If you enjoy the Dark souls genre of games, this is the game for you. 2D games can be a little over done but this excells in everyway. Mechanics are similar to dark souls but with it's own twists. Highly recommend.			"

												Absolutely amazing game has me easily hooked and loving it with the Dualshock 4! Some people say it has clunky controls so far i haven't had a single problem with it.Bosses are fun and challenging which is fun trying to dodge them, Items are scattered like a Dark Souls game and its awesome it reminds me a lot of one but easily has it's own unique ways and styles.

												it's literally 2D dark souls, it has all that great action combat that will feel very familiar to souls veterans and is just as satisfying as games that follow the same formula. The artstyle is great, despite it looking like a glorified flash game, it perfectly fits the world and, atmosphere of the game and it certainly wouldn't be the same game without it. Despite it following the souls formula a little too closely it does try to be unique, by introducing  the creed system which basicaly gives you a religion that you can change, depending on what character you are making, (warrior, assasin, cleric, etc) and, while it is basicaly the same the thing that makes it stand out is that not all the sanctuaries belong to the same creed and you can drive away those creeds and put in your own. Contibuting to how the game tries to feell unique is by closely relating it's lore to the sea which to me is what truly made this game feel like it's own thing and, not just another dark souls clone.

												A very good Metroidvania game with a touch of Dark Souls. A large touch.Pros:+ Nice interconnected world+ Satisfying combat+ Sense of achievement upon defeating bosses+ Magic isn't terrible+ Decent amount of viable buildsCons: - Controls are mediocre- The 'Wounding' system sucks balls- Most deaths come from falls. Dark Souls was bad for rolling off cliffs, but this is ridiculousOverall a very fun game that, like Dark Souls, will likely take multiple playthroughs before getting bored. Recommended.			"

												This game is phenominal.  I'm a Dark Souls veteran and an avid metroidvania player, this game is a dream come true.  The graphics are visually stunning, the gameplay is rock solid, the world is massive, and the charcater development is great.Imagine playing Castlevania: Sympony of the Night with better graphics, an advanced character customization skill tree level system, and Dark Souls style challenge.  It's a tremendous value for the asking price.  You explore the world, find wepoans and armor which can be enhanced and upgraded in the vein of DS complete with stat scaling.  As you explore the branching path sof this massive world, you find metroidvania style upgrades that allow you to reach new areas.  There's even a new game+.There is no in-game map, which might put off some people given how massive this map is, but it also adds to the sense of fear and exploration not knowing precisely how the areas are connected, and when it's time to go back and cash out your salt (souls) to level up, or risk losing everything.As someone who makes a point to play almost every Metroidvania on steam and otherwise, this game for me ranks pretty high up there.  Unlike some other MVs, this game isn't some 2-3 hour and done trip, this is one you can sink a lot of time into on your first play, and with the option of NG+ it's even better.			"

 Similar concepts/mechanics/theme to the Dark Souls series. Is a 2D platformer game, so expect a need for platform jumping skills. Local co-op requires a least a controller. Camera has priority focus on the main player, so the main player can literally mess up the camera for the second player No online multiplayer. Boss designs are really neat and requires awareness of their attack patterns to beat. Not the best graphics, but the game has a good artstyle. "

												This game is an amazing addition to the challenging arpg genre! If you like hard games this one is for you! Its 2D playstyle and level system change the formula of the arpg genre keeping it fresh and different while maintaining the complexity and the freedom to beat the game how the player sees fit. I found the amount of bosses and their drastically different move sets forced me to change up how I played making the momment I beat them that much better. As I fought my way through the world several times I would find new paths and bosses leading to areas I hadn't even caught a glimpse of in my other playthroughs. Even the first boss which seems unbeatable could be beaten with enough skill, and I love how the game rewards you for beating all of its trials. The gameplay allowed for so much freedom of choice and the bosses were so much fun I had to 100 percent this game. 10/10 prepare to die alot!			"

												Salt and Sanctuary is basically a loveletter to the Dark Souls franchise developed by a team comprised of two. Thought i'd point that out first of all because the final product is pretty damn impressive.The game has some pretty good controls, they felt natural as soon as i started playing. (I say natural, not identical to Dark souls because it isn't.)Also, you can play with a controller (which i recommend) and better yet, you can play local with a friend! So get that Stone Sellsword and call upon your homie to embark upon a very salty adventure.Sidenote: Next to a Stone Sellsword, you need to have an already made character in another slot on your machine, your friend will pick one of your other characters to help out with.The early areas in this game are relatively forgiving as compared to the later parts where you're expected to have learned how to handle yourself which is nice.  I would say there is a slight difficulty spike halfway through maybe but it's nothing you shouldn't be able to get past in a few cases of trial and error.That's not a bad thing of course, we live in a time where most games continuously hold your hand throughout your playthrough so a game that expects you to... well, get good, is nice enough.There's an enormous skill tree to tweak to your liking, a lot of armor you could wear and a good deal of weapons to choose from, always nice.I personally cleared my first playthrough at just under 15 hours i think but i'll still be playing more of this game because there are NG+ options like in Dark souls and you can always experiment with different builds.The enemies are plentiful and some a right♥♥♥♥♥♥♥to learn to fight but that's part of the experience really.The bosses are different in many ways and where you may 'first-try' one boss, you can die six times on the next, only to defeat it the seventh but regardless it should feel nice and rewarding when you do.  I know i felt like that.Personally, i couldn't wait for this to go on sale so i bought it as soon as i had the money for it.If you're a fan of 'souls like' games this should be a game for you so i definitely recommend picking it up.Hope you enjoy this game as much as i do and PRAISE THE SALT.

 Similar concepts/mechanics/theme to the Dark Souls series. Is a 2D platformer game, so expect a need for platform jumping skills. Local co-op requires a least a controller. Camera has priority focus on the main player, so the main player can literally mess up the camera for the second player No online multiplayer. Boss designs are really neat and requires awareness of their attack patterns to beat. Not the best graphics, but the game has a good artstyle. "

												This game is an amazing addition to the challenging arpg genre! If you like hard games this one is for you! Its 2D playstyle and level system change the formula of the arpg genre keeping it fresh and different while maintaining the complexity and the freedom to beat the game how the player sees fit. I found the amount of bosses and their drastically different move sets forced me to change up how I played making the momment I beat them that much better. As I fought my way through the world several times I would find new paths and bosses leading to areas I hadn't even caught a glimpse of in my other playthroughs. Even the first boss which seems unbeatable could be beaten with enough skill, and I love how the game rewards you for beating all of its trials. The gameplay allowed for so much freedom of choice and the bosses were so much fun I had to 100 percent this game. 10/10 prepare to die alot!			"

												Salt and Sanctuary is a metroidvania with ""Souls"" - like elements.  They did a fantastic job combining the two.  Its everything about those two genres done right with their own flair to it.  Weapons feel and act different as you find and create more and more equipment and its always exciting to use them.  Enemies have this odd air to them, mostly because you are unaware of what they are capable of (♥♥♥♥ing Spindlebeasts for example)... The bosses are by far fun to fight even the final boss and a few of the secret ones.  The artstyle is all handrawn and you can see how much effort was put in this title.  They husband/wife duo did a great job creating this game and I recommend this to anyone who loves a great metroidvania title like myself.			"

												You know already: 2d Dark Souls clone. Metroidvania. Looks great. Developed by 2 people. What's more to know?S&S has a great game hidden beneath a very rough outer shell. The first playthrough is harsh. The difficulty and the very real possibility of falling to your death impede Metroidvania exploration. The lack of a map doesn't help either. Several ingame mechanics are never explained like the creed system or the crafting system. If you know Dark Souls conventions you can guess some of it, but not all.If you do manage to finish the game though, every subsequent playthrough will be a blast and the real core of the game will shine - finding out how to play with different classes. At that stage you can compensate for shortcomings you didn't know your character had on the first playthrough. But getting there is unpleasant.The combat system has a lot of flaws. Two-handed weapons are way too strong. Heavy armor is basically useless. Magic flip-flops between completely broken and underwhelming one-trick pony and the elemental imbalance system is suppressed from the get-go. High level enemies drop crap noone needs and vital crafting materials are limited to one per playthrough.But all of these problems are a testatment that I played long enough to be actually aware of them. There is a brilliant game right here. After I finished I immediately started a new game+ and a new character with a different build. And I still want to play more. I'd advice everyone not comfortable with the harsh first playthrough to make liberal use of the wiki. As long as you don't spoil yourself on the crafting or on boss tactics it provides the missing information in game.Overall a diamond in the rough.			"

												Fantastic game!Here are the questions you need to ask:Do you like Dark souls? Do you like Metroidvania games?If the answer is yes to both stop reading and buy this NOW!But even if you only like one of these or are unsure. This is an atmosphereic, challenging and very fun game.This game isn't so much inspired by Dark Souls as Dark Souls is it's Daddy and little Salt & Sancturary is trying to be lik his big idol in every way. Luckily though Ska Studios know what they are doing and basically all the things that are good about Souls games are in here. Down to the mysterious atmosphere, the simple but tight and challenging combat and the item flood where no item is useless and you decide how to play.It's an excelent game and the asking price is a joke for what you're getting content wise. I truely hope Ska Studios sells millions of copies, god knows they deserve it :)			"

												Game needs work but its still a good game.  Even though the game is 2D you can get lost quickly and end up in an unwanted boss fight (I lost 9000 salt because of that).  The stagger in this game is brutal which makes it fun.  From what I've taken in from the game light armor seems to be the best because you can roll fast obviously but heavier armor slows you down and you still take the same amount of damage.  The sheilds are so forgetable during fighting so your best bet is to two hand a weapon if you are scared of getting hit just roll.  The one thing that irks me is the money system,  There is gold and salt.  Salt is used for leveling up weps and yourself.  Gold is for purchesing♥♥♥♥♥♥but the part that irks me is that you farm all this money but when you die a large portion of it is taken away to pay a mysterious cleric to revive you so if you have 6000 gold then when you die they take out 700 gold.  Thats freaking crazy!  They should have stuck to the salt as a leveling currency and a trading currency.  But nonetheless this game is fun and the updates to come will make the game better.  If you like Dark Souls you will like this.			"

												best Dark souls clone ever!!!to be saying that it is inspired from dark souls would be an understatement of the century , however it is by far the best 2D games ever to grace on PC.two person  (husband and wife -James & Michelle)SKA  Studio has a very high pedigree in what the do .check out their earlier games.-->The graphics is true to the mood and lore and are grim and dark .lot of blood splattering and nice touches.-->The combat is fast ,fluid ,brutal and challenging with light attack ,charge attack ,parry and whatnot .they don't even bother to explain the mechanics in detail since it is assumed that you would know if u have played souls games-->tons of replaybility due to plethora of classes and hhhhuge skill tree and customisation .many secret areas and tons of weapons to unlock with different combos and movesets.the only negative i can think of is no online CO OP and PVP.local co op and PVP is present and is very good but pointless on PC version !!!!Day 1 purchase for me since i was looking fwd to it .now they just need to release DISHWASHER series on PC and well...NIRVANA!!!!

												Excellent game. Difficult but satisfying combat, nice platforming elements and unique art style all contribute to an excellent game which is essentially 2D dark souls with castlevania platforming. Yes, I know we've all heard '2D dark souls before' but no other game has done justice to that comparison. It has its own unique elements so it cannot be classified as a total clone. Runs pretty well so seems decently optimized. Combat is pretty brutal, until you get your hands on a greatsword/hammer/axe. Ng+ seems to scale way beyond what dark souls does in terms of enemy hp.

Posted: June 9, 2016
												While it has some quirks I really like and have beaten this game, but most of the folks I recommend it to seem to hate it.  So I guess I will focus of the love-it-or-hate-it aspect:-  As of this writing, this game has a complete lack of any item sort, manual or otherwise, and works with a hidden slot system (ex.  If you delete item 3 in your inventory and are left with 5 items the items will move together, but the next item you pick up will go to slot 3 and not slot 6).  For a game that boasts over 600 types of items for swapping and fashion good luck finding anything unless you sell/discard every peice of equipment you are not currently using.  There is no positive to this and I honestly find it a tad inexcusable.*  The Island has a lot of interconnections between the areas and lacks any sort of hand holding to guide you through it other than minor npc interactions .  It really helps build the world around you as you explore, unless you have a bad memory and refuse to take notes as you go.  There are also many optional areas and you might even find yourself working backwards through the ""intended"" way to go.  There is a lack of information in general, which encourages the player to experiment with things.  This is a huge plus for me but if you like your games linear you will probably hate it unless you like to follow walkthroughs, which can take away from the feeling of exploration but to each their own.*  You can build your character to match your preferences, but it has a more old school twist of having to spec into weapons and armor before you can use them.  The item you need to change points is pretty rare, and it is not a full respec, so you really have to commit to something.  Some weapon types have been given a lot more love than others in terms of availablility and movesets, but if you play blind you won't know until it's too late to really change anything.  There are also some lower class weapons and armor that really outshine some of the higher tier stuff.  I kind of like having to live with my choices (gives me replay value) and I can say that you can finish the game with any half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥melee setup (I cannot confirm magic...), but it's not everyone's cup of tea.*  Gameplay-wise, the control scheme can take some getting used to, but you can remap every important action which is great!  Some of the movement and actions are a bit clunky though.  Dropped inputs can and will happen, especially when attempting to weave button presses such as trying to use an item after your heavy attack animation is finished (with plenty of stamina).  Sometimes you just can't seem to grab a wall or ledge that you would normally be able to and plummet to your death.  Enemy grab attacks have phantom range and there are no invincibility frames for being hit, so you can easily be stun locked to death.  There are some seemingly (I admit I could be wrong!) required jumps that you need to be lightweight in order to make safely, so low endurance heavy armor types will need to strip to progress.  Etc.  Etc.  Once I got used to the quirks I had quite a lot of fun with it, but it's still an indie game.  If you are looking for expert level polish you won't find it here.I honestly think that if you think you can work through the quirks it is really worth a try!  Games with this level of exploration are fairly infrequent and I am enjoying it from start to finish.			"

												It's really a good game for us DS palyers, I really appreciate and enjoy it these days. Great combination of Dark Souls and Castlevania. Excellent job for Ska Studios! Many thanks!But I still want  to say something. Now it is 9/10 in my mind, and I hope it will be 10/10 in the near future. 1. Basically, the system for weapons and classes is rich, but the balance is...not that good I think? When I started using Greatsword in the first round of the game, it dropped  into easy mode. Most of the small battles during the game can be settled in two, or even one hit by the Greatsword. However, when I tried to start with Hunter or Mage, it became quite tough. Maybe it's because I didn't find a reasonable way to play with such classes, but still, the difflculty curves of different playing methods varies a lot. Anyway, weakening  strong weapons is not my purpose. But I really don't expect such issue to harm the gameplay. 2. The style of the map design is quite similar to Dark Souls, from macro view. Different regions interconnect with each other. But many shortcuts seems non-sense when we can open them in the late game. Meanwhile,  Sanctuary and Shrine, which share similar task with the Bonfire in DS, are a little too covert to locate. I know it is a good 2D cross-boundary game (is this description right?), but with strong monsters without small map...hmm..well, more than half of the deaths in may first round game were falling. Rookies may fell depressed when they die because of this, if they are not familiar with DS series. So my point of this passage is, maybe a little swift is needed to make the game softer.3. Chinese! Chinese! Chinese! I heared someone is working on Chinesization privately in China, and I think it will come soon. Many DS players in China do not want to try this game only because it doesn't have Chinese! What's more, it will be of much help for us to undersdand its world view and script, and recommend to our friends.P.S. 头一次写英文的游戏评测，蹩脚的英语大家见笑了- -！不过能两个人做出这样的游戏真的令我很震惊。我希望能够尽绵薄之力使这个游戏变得更好，并且把它分享给更多的中国朋友，尤其是魂系列的爱好者。感谢Ska Studios，希望将来能够玩到你们更多的优秀的作品。			"

Boss designs are really neat and requires awareness of their attack patterns to beat. Not the best graphics, but the game has a good artstyle. "

												There's a bit of interesting development geneology going on with Salt and Sanctuary. By regressing from Dark Souls' 3D back to 2D, we've arguably come full circle, back to classic Metroidvania. One wonders why we ever embarked on this silly quest for 3D to begin with.Yes, I said it, it's Dark Souls in 2D, I'm not sure what kind of insightful commentary you expected. There's lots of weapons to collect, all with slightly different mechanics and movesets, there's lots of enemies and creative ways to die, interesting and mindboggling boss monsters, all that. True to it's progenitors form, there's very little story but lots of atmosphere, the world is doomed and you don't even know what the main quest is. Also there's no ingame map which is utterly inexcusible.At the time of writing I've played about twenty hours and finished two thirds of the game. Will head into NG+ soon. It's great, it's Dark Souls, I'll take whatever I can get.Verdict: Great game, buy it if you're into the Souls series or Metroidvania.			"

												Would you like some salt with your Dark Souls?Salt and Sanctuary seems to be one of those games that I play for half an hour, close, and then immediately reopen. The game delivers a bloody good time with a dreary atmosphere and narrative to boot. The soundtrack is very Diablo-esque with some more Perfect Circle and Castlevania influences (that alone should be enough to convince you). Sure it still has a few quirks, like the main menu does not pause the game despite there being no online multiplayer (so only stop when you're sure you're safe), upgrading equipment feels a bit underwhelming (but still necessary) when there COULD be new loot right around the corner, and checkpoints are nonexistent, as instead of bonfires, you have very rare Sanctuaries where you level up, hire shops, and heal. So yes, you have to do a lot of backtracking, but you'll need to do all the level grinding you can to hold your own against the tougher enemies.I should point out that this game is not for everyone. It's barely for me, but I can't put it down. A second player is almost a necessity. It's going to make you salty, but you're going to enjoy every minute of it.			"

												This game is easily summed up as; ""Painfully Fun"". It's 2D Darksouls, nothing more to it, if you like darksouls you'll like this unless you absolulty hate 2D platformers. That said, it does it's fair share to make the platforming bareable example being how you cant fall off ledges unless you're either jumping or constantly wanting to move in that direction, I can't do the system justice but it definatly makes the platforming in this game a whole lot better than other games. Theres a few lacking aspects in this game, and it's extremely easy to be overpowered that said it's also extremely easy to be underpowered aswell and get stomped into the floor. A plus to this game is how well it managed to take the asthetic of darksouls and turn it into a 2D game, which as Sonic 06 Showed taking something from one dimension to the next is quite difficult yet this game managed to pull it off. Regardless of anything said in this review it's a good game and well worth the purchase, as it's the best 2D platformer I've played in a while.			"

												Salt and Sanctuary is a fantastic metroidvania game that incorperates mechanics from the Dark Souls franchise to make a very rewarding experience. I highly recomend this game to fans of the Metroidvania genere and Dark Souls series, and even people who are fans of modern rpgs like Dragon Age or The Witcher who looking for something new.The art style is intentionally bleak at first, grey hopelessness and undead enemies paint the dreary shoreline with woe as the enemies shamble about... then you enter a dark cave. The fog is gone, there is no grainy filter anymore, the color is vivid and everything pops, it's jarring, it's frighting, and it's beautiful. Each area of the game has it's own themes, and even the horrifying places like The Red Hall of Cages, while spattered with gore, are beautifully and thoughtfully done.The enemies are tough, but you get visibly stronger as you level yourself and your weapons up, and when combined with responsive controls, you get revenge on tough enemies pretty quickly. Leveling up seems daunting at first, but with a little research, you'll find a goal near the end of a tree, and map out a handy path of upgrades. Salt and Sanctuary is also pretty build heavy. If you're interested in doing well in this game, I'd recommend doing some reading while the game downloads and installs. There's all kinds of weapons, armors, and styles of magics to specialize in. You also choose a creed as you play (think Dark Souls covenants) and these decide which sanctuaries (bonfires) you have available to upgrade and what kind of equipment is available to you. Furthermore, each of those sacnctuaries has 4 upgrade slots, so you have to think about what to upgrade the sanctuaries with as I have yet to find a way to undo the upgrades. Bosses are a big part of the game, they are unforgiving and require keen observation to recognize very punishing attacks. If you are stuck on a boss, you are stuck because you are not good enough. Luckily, you can get good outside on those tough enemies, and it feels less like grinding when you're fighting for your life in some of the later areas. Just like the Souls series, while the bosses drop loot and lots of experience (or salt as it's called), the real reward is catharsis. When I beat one boss I was stuck on for hours, I beat him because I leveled up my greatsword a few times, and leveled up a few times more. I didn't just win, I whooped him. At first I was only doing 4-5% of his health per attack, and I couldn't find many opportunities to attack, after some dramatic frustration and leveling up, I was carving away huge chuncks of health, unconcerned about his attack. It was a very visceral kind of success, and that describes what this game is well.			"

												This is my favorite game in the style of Dark Souls.  It is 2D; something is lsot in the transition to 2D, but so much more is gained. The vertical combat is actually enjoyable and there is a much needed boost to mobility. I have played a tank with some miracles and I have specialized in maces. I cannot say how magic or rapiers valanced out, but I could see how they would contribute to an entirely different playstyle.  With heavy armor the character feels like RIchter from Castlevania: of Blood; lighter armor and the character feels like Maria.  This is the first Souls game where I enjoy a lightly armed and agile character. I love everything SKa Stuidios has produced. And Symphony of the NIght is pretty much my favorite game ever. So this should make my biases obvious.			"

												Very fun Metroid/Souls-like style hybrid. The visuals have a great feel ripped right out of Lovecraft, with smooth controls and well laid out levels. Interestingly, I didn't find the difficulty all that bad, and I've only felt like I got cheesed a couple of times. This may also be the first game I've ever played where playing as a caster is easier from the get-go. Souls veterans may have an easier time, but I don't think this one is quite as challenging. There is one thing (maybe a drawback for some) I do have to mention though. The lore of this game gets a little confusing at times. You need to read absolutly EVERYTHING here to get into the story. That includes all character dialogue, item descriptions, and skills. Again, this is very much in the spirit of a Souls game, but newcomers to that style of story-telling should be aware of it. These games do not present an easy to find narrative.Overall, I very much recommend this to people who enjoy Metroid and Souls style games. You absolutly do not have to be a Dark Souls verteran to play and enjoy this. The learning curve goes up smootly, and with some persistance, every challange here can be overcome.			"

												I like this game.  It's fun, it's worth your time and your money.  Comparisons to Dark Souls is inescabable, but this game really has far more in common with classic Metroidvania's than it does the souls series and.  Imagine an inferior Symphony of Night with Dark Souls levelling system and enemies who can kill you in a few hits and you've got a decent idea of what you are in for.Positives are the game is beautiful, the combat feels meaty and appropriately visceral.  When you smash the living crap out of a zombie you really feel it through the screen and the abundance of gore and sound design.   You kinda have to play it to really appreciate how bloody satisfying it is to crush your enemies and watch the body parts fly across the screen while the screen shudders with your power.   It's glorious.   The level design is also interesting, not quite the masterpieces that are classic metroidvanias but varied and packed full of varied environments and enemies that challenge you in different ways.  The problem comes from the fact that most of the game's ""difficulty"" comes from bad platforming (there's a reason there is no platforming in Dark Souls, playing this game will make you fully comprehend why they didn't even include proper jumping in the Souls series) and enemies/bosses whose attacks are wildly different than their sprites and animations.  You can definately appreciate the meticulous way Souls bosses are designed to be tough but fair while playing this game, where bosses can sometimes string together unavoidable death-combos, meaning that there is a significant element of luck to beating them.  It might take several tries to clear a boss, not because of skill, but just because if whatever RNG determines which attacks they do happens to hit a certain order there is practicly nothing you can do to survive.Anyway, In DS when I die it always feels fair or earned, here you just roll your eyes the 10th time miss some jump and fall to your death.  In a game where dying can potentially cost you hours of progress in terms of Salt(souls), it feels like a pretty poor decision to put so many 'make this jump or die' segments.  The game is full of them, especially towards the end, and it's a problem.  For every death to an enemy I think I had 5 deaths to just bloody falling off some ledge that my character decided they weren't going to grab this time, or when my air-dash move just decided not to go off.  It's frusterating and makes you understand exactly why there is no platforming in Dark Souls. The plot makes no sense whatsoever, and I never really felt like I was being guided along a journey.  The designers really adopted the minimalist story design of DS, but they didn't seem to realize that DS does a ton of world building and storytelling through the visuals, gameplay, and the overall layout of the game.  You always feel like you have a direction and a goal in Dark Souls.  Here I'm just kinda going from area to area killing bosses who I have no clue about or why they even exist or really what I'm doing aside from a vague 'save the princess' mission that I still don't fully understand.   TL:DR?   Flawwed but fun game.  Get it if you are a fan of either Dark Souls or Metroidvanias (but especially the latter) but be prepared to deal with some occasional poor design. "

												As many other reviewers have stated, this game very much pays homage to Dark Souls. It doesn't hold your hand, and it is reasonably hard. There is obviously a lot more platforming since it is a 2D presentation, but the controls are tight, so this works out fine. I really enjoy this game, but it would be even better if there were an online co-op/mulitplayer. Everything is better with friends. You can share a screen and play this via local co-op, but I don't really play games often with a local friend so this sucks for me. Either way, it's still fun as a single player game.Check it out! For just $18 and steams return policy, there is no reason to pick this up. If you like metroidvania style games, and dark souls, then you'll like this.			"

At first I was only doing 4-5% of his health per attack, and I couldn't find many opportunities to attack, after some dramatic frustration and leveling up, I was carving away huge chuncks of health, unconcerned about his attack. It was a very visceral kind of success, and that describes what this game is well.			"

												This is my favorite game in the style of Dark Souls.  It is 2D; something is lsot in the transition to 2D, but so much more is gained. The vertical combat is actually enjoyable and there is a much needed boost to mobility. I have played a tank with some miracles and I have specialized in maces. I cannot say how magic or rapiers valanced out, but I could see how they would contribute to an entirely different playstyle.  With heavy armor the character feels like RIchter from Castlevania: of Blood; lighter armor and the character feels like Maria.  This is the first Souls game where I enjoy a lightly armed and agile character. I love everything SKa Stuidios has produced. And Symphony of the NIght is pretty much my favorite game ever. So this should make my biases obvious.			"

												Very fun Metroid/Souls-like style hybrid. The visuals have a great feel ripped right out of Lovecraft, with smooth controls and well laid out levels. Interestingly, I didn't find the difficulty all that bad, and I've only felt like I got cheesed a couple of times. This may also be the first game I've ever played where playing as a caster is easier from the get-go. Souls veterans may have an easier time, but I don't think this one is quite as challenging. There is one thing (maybe a drawback for some) I do have to mention though. The lore of this game gets a little confusing at times. You need to read absolutly EVERYTHING here to get into the story. That includes all character dialogue, item descriptions, and skills. Again, this is very much in the spirit of a Souls game, but newcomers to that style of story-telling should be aware of it. These games do not present an easy to find narrative.Overall, I very much recommend this to people who enjoy Metroid and Souls style games. You absolutly do not have to be a Dark Souls verteran to play and enjoy this. The learning curve goes up smootly, and with some persistance, every challange here can be overcome.			"

												I like this game.  It's fun, it's worth your time and your money.  Comparisons to Dark Souls is inescabable, but this game really has far more in common with classic Metroidvania's than it does the souls series and.  Imagine an inferior Symphony of Night with Dark Souls levelling system and enemies who can kill you in a few hits and you've got a decent idea of what you are in for.Positives are the game is beautiful, the combat feels meaty and appropriately visceral.  When you smash the living crap out of a zombie you really feel it through the screen and the abundance of gore and sound design.   You kinda have to play it to really appreciate how bloody satisfying it is to crush your enemies and watch the body parts fly across the screen while the screen shudders with your power.   It's glorious.   The level design is also interesting, not quite the masterpieces that are classic metroidvanias but varied and packed full of varied environments and enemies that challenge you in different ways.  The problem comes from the fact that most of the game's ""difficulty"" comes from bad platforming (there's a reason there is no platforming in Dark Souls, playing this game will make you fully comprehend why they didn't even include proper jumping in the Souls series) and enemies/bosses whose attacks are wildly different than their sprites and animations.  You can definately appreciate the meticulous way Souls bosses are designed to be tough but fair while playing this game, where bosses can sometimes string together unavoidable death-combos, meaning that there is a significant element of luck to beating them.  It might take several tries to clear a boss, not because of skill, but just because if whatever RNG determines which attacks they do happens to hit a certain order there is practicly nothing you can do to survive.Anyway, In DS when I die it always feels fair or earned, here you just roll your eyes the 10th time miss some jump and fall to your death.  In a game where dying can potentially cost you hours of progress in terms of Salt(souls), it feels like a pretty poor decision to put so many 'make this jump or die' segments.  The game is full of them, especially towards the end, and it's a problem.  For every death to an enemy I think I had 5 deaths to just bloody falling off some ledge that my character decided they weren't going to grab this time, or when my air-dash move just decided not to go off.  It's frusterating and makes you understand exactly why there is no platforming in Dark Souls. The plot makes no sense whatsoever, and I never really felt like I was being guided along a journey.  The designers really adopted the minimalist story design of DS, but they didn't seem to realize that DS does a ton of world building and storytelling through the visuals, gameplay, and the overall layout of the game.  You always feel like you have a direction and a goal in Dark Souls.  Here I'm just kinda going from area to area killing bosses who I have no clue about or why they even exist or really what I'm doing aside from a vague 'save the princess' mission that I still don't fully understand.   TL:DR?   Flawwed but fun game.  Get it if you are a fan of either Dark Souls or Metroidvanias (but especially the latter) but be prepared to deal with some occasional poor design. "

												As many other reviewers have stated, this game very much pays homage to Dark Souls. It doesn't hold your hand, and it is reasonably hard. There is obviously a lot more platforming since it is a 2D presentation, but the controls are tight, so this works out fine. I really enjoy this game, but it would be even better if there were an online co-op/mulitplayer. Everything is better with friends. You can share a screen and play this via local co-op, but I don't really play games often with a local friend so this sucks for me. Either way, it's still fun as a single player game.Check it out! For just $18 and steams return policy, there is no reason to pick this up. If you like metroidvania style games, and dark souls, then you'll like this.			"

												When I was first told about Salt and Sanctuary it was billed as ""2d Dark Souls"".

												Game needs work but its still a good game.  Even though the game is 2D you can get lost quickly and end up in an unwanted boss fight (I lost 9000 salt because of that).  The stagger in this game is brutal which makes it fun.  From what I've taken in from the game light armor seems to be the best because you can roll fast obviously but heavier armor slows you down and you still take the same amount of damage.  The sheilds are so forgetable during fighting so your best bet is to two hand a weapon if you are scared of getting hit just roll.  The one thing that irks me is the money system,  There is gold and salt.  Salt is used for leveling up weps and yourself.  Gold is for purchesing♥♥♥♥♥♥but the part that irks me is that you farm all this money but when you die a large portion of it is taken away to pay a mysterious cleric to revive you so if you have 6000 gold then when you die they take out 700 gold.  Thats freaking crazy!  They should have stuck to the salt as a leveling currency and a trading currency.  But nonetheless this game is fun and the updates to come will make the game better.  If you like Dark Souls you will like this.			"

												best Dark souls clone ever!!!to be saying that it is inspired from dark souls would be an understatement of the century , however it is by far the best 2D games ever to grace on PC.two person  (husband and wife -James & Michelle)SKA  Studio has a very high pedigree in what the do .check out their earlier games.-->The graphics is true to the mood and lore and are grim and dark .lot of blood splattering and nice touches.-->The combat is fast ,fluid ,brutal and challenging with light attack ,charge attack ,parry and whatnot .they don't even bother to explain the mechanics in detail since it is assumed that you would know if u have played souls games-->tons of replaybility due to plethora of classes and hhhhuge skill tree and customisation .many secret areas and tons of weapons to unlock with different combos and movesets.the only negative i can think of is no online CO OP and PVP.local co op and PVP is present and is very good but pointless on PC version !!!!Day 1 purchase for me since i was looking fwd to it .now they just need to release DISHWASHER series on PC and well...NIRVANA!!!!

												Excellent game. Difficult but satisfying combat, nice platforming elements and unique art style all contribute to an excellent game which is essentially 2D dark souls with castlevania platforming. Yes, I know we've all heard '2D dark souls before' but no other game has done justice to that comparison. It has its own unique elements so it cannot be classified as a total clone. Runs pretty well so seems decently optimized. Combat is pretty brutal, until you get your hands on a greatsword/hammer/axe. Ng+ seems to scale way beyond what dark souls does in terms of enemy hp.

												While it has some quirks I really like and have beaten this game, but most of the folks I recommend it to seem to hate it.  So I guess I will focus of the love-it-or-hate-it aspect:-  As of this writing, this game has a complete lack of any item sort, manual or otherwise, and works with a hidden slot system (ex.  If you delete item 3 in your inventory and are left with 5 items the items will move together, but the next item you pick up will go to slot 3 and not slot 6).  For a game that boasts over 600 types of items for swapping and fashion good luck finding anything unless you sell/discard every peice of equipment you are not currently using.  There is no positive to this and I honestly find it a tad inexcusable.*  The Island has a lot of interconnections between the areas and lacks any sort of hand holding to guide you through it other than minor npc interactions .  It really helps build the world around you as you explore, unless you have a bad memory and refuse to take notes as you go.  There are also many optional areas and you might even find yourself working backwards through the ""intended"" way to go.  There is a lack of information in general, which encourages the player to experiment with things.  This is a huge plus for me but if you like your games linear you will probably hate it unless you like to follow walkthroughs, which can take away from the feeling of exploration but to each their own.*  You can build your character to match your preferences, but it has a more old school twist of having to spec into weapons and armor before you can use them.  The item you need to change points is pretty rare, and it is not a full respec, so you really have to commit to something.  Some weapon types have been given a lot more love than others in terms of availablility and movesets, but if you play blind you won't know until it's too late to really change anything.  There are also some lower class weapons and armor that really outshine some of the higher tier stuff.  I kind of like having to live with my choices (gives me replay value) and I can say that you can finish the game with any half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥melee setup (I cannot confirm magic...), but it's not everyone's cup of tea.*  Gameplay-wise, the control scheme can take some getting used to, but you can remap every important action which is great!  Some of the movement and actions are a bit clunky though.  Dropped inputs can and will happen, especially when attempting to weave button presses such as trying to use an item after your heavy attack animation is finished (with plenty of stamina).  Sometimes you just can't seem to grab a wall or ledge that you would normally be able to and plummet to your death.  Enemy grab attacks have phantom range and there are no invincibility frames for being hit, so you can easily be stun locked to death.  There are some seemingly (I admit I could be wrong!) required jumps that you need to be lightweight in order to make safely, so low endurance heavy armor types will need to strip to progress.  Etc.  Etc.  Once I got used to the quirks I had quite a lot of fun with it, but it's still an indie game.  If you are looking for expert level polish you won't find it here.I honestly think that if you think you can work through the quirks it is really worth a try!  Games with this level of exploration are fairly infrequent and I am enjoying it from start to finish.			"

												It's really a good game for us DS palyers, I really appreciate and enjoy it these days. Great combination of Dark Souls and Castlevania. Excellent job for Ska Studios! Many thanks!But I still want  to say something. Now it is 9/10 in my mind, and I hope it will be 10/10 in the near future. 1. Basically, the system for weapons and classes is rich, but the balance is...not that good I think? When I started using Greatsword in the first round of the game, it dropped  into easy mode. Most of the small battles during the game can be settled in two, or even one hit by the Greatsword. However, when I tried to start with Hunter or Mage, it became quite tough. Maybe it's because I didn't find a reasonable way to play with such classes, but still, the difflculty curves of different playing methods varies a lot. Anyway, weakening  strong weapons is not my purpose. But I really don't expect such issue to harm the gameplay. 2. The style of the map design is quite similar to Dark Souls, from macro view. Different regions interconnect with each other. But many shortcuts seems non-sense when we can open them in the late game. Meanwhile,  Sanctuary and Shrine, which share similar task with the Bonfire in DS, are a little too covert to locate. I know it is a good 2D cross-boundary game (is this description right?), but with strong monsters without small map...hmm..well, more than half of the deaths in may first round game were falling. Rookies may fell depressed when they die because of this, if they are not familiar with DS series. So my point of this passage is, maybe a little swift is needed to make the game softer.3. Chinese! Chinese! Chinese! I heared someone is working on Chinesization privately in China, and I think it will come soon. Many DS players in China do not want to try this game only because it doesn't have Chinese! What's more, it will be of much help for us to undersdand its world view and script, and recommend to our friends.P.S. 头一次写英文的游戏评测，蹩脚的英语大家见笑了- -！不过能两个人做出这样的游戏真的令我很震惊。我希望能够尽绵薄之力使这个游戏变得更好，并且把它分享给更多的中国朋友，尤其是魂系列的爱好者。感谢Ska Studios，希望将来能够玩到你们更多的优秀的作品。			"

												I played through this entire game in co-op and had so much fun with it. Currently going through a NG+ in co-op. We cleared the main game in about 18-19 hours (didn't do any sidequests/level up devotion). Review: Please note that I won't really touch on graphics/art because what you see in the screenshots is what you get. Characters/Classes:There are many different ways to play this game. You wanna cast spells? Go for it. You wanna shoot things in the face? That's an option. You wanna be Thomas the Tank Engine? Well, you can only be a tank, sorry. What's really nice is that you can customize your character to unlock skills from other classes. Upgrades and Skill Tree:You can transmute weapons and masks (don't think you can transmute armor) into a higher class, but you'll need to unlock the class of weapon/armor to use it. You can also just straight up upgrade weapons and armor.  Also, if you want to hold more potions, you have to unlock them in the skill tree. The skill tree itself is pretty straight forward. Though, the one thing I didn't really like is the fact that you can't actually increase your health - it's all based on your level. That means a level 50 mage and a level 50 knight have the same amount of HP from what I can tell. That's really just a minor thing and kind of forces you to really look at what your equipment protects against and to be careful. Map/Level Design:I'll have to emphasize the Metroidvania tag of the game so keep in mind that you'll get lost and possibly do some backtracking. My only complaint is that there's actually no map in game whatsoever, so while the first few hours was fun to just wander, it also became annoying. There's a vague guide out there that will at least tell you the order of things. Other than that, each area is unique, holds new enemies, which means new patterns to remember. Sound/Music:While I was eating dinner after playing for a few hours, the boss music got stuck in my head. Really, there are only two tracks in the game that really stand out to me, and that's just because one of them is the boss track and the other one makes me think something bad is gonna happen. Sound effects are good enough.Gameplay:Combat is smooth and satisfying. I love parrying enemies and then stabbing them and kicking them off. Oh, and stomping on their heads? Or if you have a tower shield, jamming that into the back of their heads? Doing those are incredibly satisfying. While it's incredibly satisfying to pull off and to watch, it doesn't seem to do too much damage against the tougher enemies - that might be because I wasn't building strength or had the best weapon at the time. Equipment weight has an affect on your running speed and as a result, it looks like it has an affect on jump distance. There's also a ""glitch"" that allows you to long jump, but I haven't mastered it. Also, I've had issues fighting enemies around ladders - mostly because I end up CLIMBING the ladder. Getting co-op can be a little annoying because you need to have a specific item to allow the second player to join in. You can start off with the item so player 2 can join pretty much immediately, but if you don't, you need to find it. Also, keep in mind that player 2 will need to have already created their character because you can't make a new character when you're joining a game. With that said, I think co-op makes the game easier, especially if one of you is the tank and the other is a ranged character. You still have to pay attention to your health and be careful, but you can take a few more risks since you have someone watching your back.There's also two ways to revive your teammate. One is to make it to a sanctuary or shrine. The other is to buy the revive prayer (this is a class 2 prayer).Tip: If you're playing co-op, keep in mind that you can teleport to each other if you're far away enough by opening the inventory and closing it. Tip 2: Get revive if you're playing co-op. It'll make the things easier (getting your souls salt back is less frustrating). It's also nice for boss fights since without revive, if one of you dies, the other person has to either beat it alone, or die. Overall:This is an easy recommendation. Salt and Sanctuary is definitely challenging, and at times frustrating. If you're looking for a tough metroidvania with local co-op and some Souls elements, definitely grab it.			"

												I have yet to play a dark souls game, but have heard a lot.I heard about this game from word of mouth, and decided to check it out.This♥♥♥♥♥♥is pretty hardcore, like an unforgiving version of a PS1 Castlevania game. There could and should be less grinding, but it is very rewarding customizing your character, and splattering your enemys bloody remians on the wall as you pass through. Be warned, this game will rub the salt in your open wounds when you die, again, and again, and again.... "

												I had a hell of a time with this game. I strongly recommend this to anyone who enjoys games in the metroidvania genre.Pros:-Massive character build customization-Enormous world with large variation in themes-Excellent atmosphere-Unique and nightmarish enemy and boss designs-Combat is visceral, fast, and satisfying-Challenging in a fair way, still lets you feel powerful-High replay value (in-game challenges, tons of classes and builds)Cons:-Controls may be difficult to grasp at first-No map, may get lost-Some mechanics may be obtuseOverall: 9.5/10			"

												I really like this game. It reminds me a lot of the Souls games, and that's good, but it's also a game all it's own. It has a very dark and pretty atmosphere. And it uses that darkness really well putting you in areas that you cant see at all with out a torch or light charm. It's difficult but not over barring, if you prepare, and its platforming is really great. Adding in different elements to it as the game progresses that encourage you to go back and re-explore an area for items you couldn't get to at the your first time through.There are cons too, like some ridiculous drops and enemies stunlocking you to death, but nothing too bad.

												This game is a gruesome experience.  In a good way!  It will bring you up and cut you down.  It will bring you a sense of comfort once you get to know the particular kind of weird and gruesome an area has to offer, then sweep that comfort out from under your feet by showing you something on an entirely different scale of weird and gruesome that you never imagined possible.  It will get you so lost in the beautiful, horrible atmosphere that you won't care how many times you have to die and come back.  It wil get you so actually lost in the world but in the process will let you discover secrets and shortcuts that connect the world and help you immensely as you progress.  No matter if you choose to be an assassin weilding an arsenal of toxic weaponry, a mage with unparralelled control of fire and lightning, a paladin with the healing aid of the gods, a hunter weilding whip and pistol, or a chef weilding their trusty frying pan (yes, this is a thing you can choose to be), this game will both challenge and reward your favorite playstyle.There's 23 different zones to discover, 23 different bosses to defeat, a hundred different kinds of enemies to slay, and seven different creeds to pledge yourself to that will aid your preferred playsyle.  Not to mention the number of items, weapons, attire, charms, and rings you can get.I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys metroidvania-style games.  It is more than worth the price of the game.  I just beat it, and I'm eager to take on NG+ and start a whole bunch of new characters to try out new playstyles.  I'm certain I'll be playing this game for a very long time.  To the makers of this game: You are amazing.  Thank you for bringing this into existence.			"

												Awesome game, but I feel like there is a lot wrong with the Kraken wyrm boss fight. After he lands, he'll do one of his attacks/actions immidiately without pause. If you get unlocky and he decides to pounce at you, you're done. His standing fireattack is really weird to roll through, often pushing you in weird directions (his tail slap does this too). Finally, for me he suicided by jump attacking to the left a whole bunch. Every boss fight felt pretty smooth except this one. Overall still a really cool game that takes a lot from dark souls and adds a bit of spice.			"

												Yes yes it's a platformer Dark Souls clone that's not quite as hard as dark souls but appears to copy it in many many ways. But let's remove ourselves from first impressions and actually look at the game for what it is and not just what it appears to be or what it's not.It does have a stamina bar for your attacks and your rolls. Fun? Yes. (That's not a dark souls unique feature by the way.)Does ""salt"" kind of sound like ""soul""? Yes yes. You die, you lose it, you go back for it and you move on. Maybe just like Dark Souls, but who cares - it's fun anyway.Yes yes, sanctuaries are kind of like bonfires. You establish them in designated places, you travel between them, you revive at them and level up at them. But there is something new too! You can place your chosen NPCs in them AND sanctuaries come in different types (based on which faction they belong to). So there, not like Dark Souls at all!Oh, and the level-up tree - totally not Dark Souls. More Path of Exile. Aside from the whole fact that you collect salt and when you have enough - you level up at the bonfire i mean sanctuary and get a point to distribute...Oh i forgot to mention, it wasn't that hard of a game because i played a mage. ""Hidden easy mode"". Like Dark Souls.Alright alright it's just like Dark Souls.But it's also a decent platformer with a pretty big convoluted world, many secrets, many weapons and their upgrades, armors, spells, memorable boss fights. What's not to like? "

Absolute Perfection!Ever wondered what Castlevania would be like with Dark Souls mechanics?  Look no further, this game is an absolute gem. With an art style similar to Darkest Dungeon, and the core of Castlevania and Dark Souls you couldn't ask for a better game. My only gripe with it is I wish there was more, that's not saying there isn't alot to do, ng+ and all that jazz.  I'm at the end of the game just wrapping up side areas and such, and figured I'd drop a review to show some love.   But anyway here's the pros and cons:ProsGraphics are fluid even on older hardware runs like a champ.Symphony of the Night+Dark Souls=Yes Plz.Combat mechanics are great, lots o' blood filled joy abound.Level Design pretty straight forward, lots of hidden stuff to find.ConsSome of the bosses can be cheesed to death or outleveled quite easily.If it had been closer to Symphony of the Night in scale would have been absolutely epic.Leaves you wanting more.  (Which can count as both a pro/con I guess)But seriously if you're still reading this, buy this game.			"

												Basically 2D Dark Souls. Despite the heavy focus on platforming it captures the nature of Souls games really well - from the feeling of loneliness and dread to the methodical skill based combat. Any Souls fan will feel right at home. You might say S&S borrows too much from Souls games but it also puts its own spin on a lot of elements, albeit not always successfully. All in all this may be the best Souls knock-off yet, 3D games included.			"

												Very fun Metroid/Souls-like style hybrid. The visuals have a great feel ripped right out of Lovecraft, with smooth controls and well laid out levels. Interestingly, I didn't find the difficulty all that bad, and I've only felt like I got cheesed a couple of times. This may also be the first game I've ever played where playing as a caster is easier from the get-go. Souls veterans may have an easier time, but I don't think this one is quite as challenging. There is one thing (maybe a drawback for some) I do have to mention though. The lore of this game gets a little confusing at times. You need to read absolutly EVERYTHING here to get into the story. That includes all character dialogue, item descriptions, and skills. Again, this is very much in the spirit of a Souls game, but newcomers to that style of story-telling should be aware of it. These games do not present an easy to find narrative.Overall, I very much recommend this to people who enjoy Metroid and Souls style games. You absolutly do not have to be a Dark Souls verteran to play and enjoy this. The learning curve goes up smootly, and with some persistance, every challange here can be overcome.			"

The gravity is ruthless. ^_^Heard and read a lot of 'kinda DS' opinions and won't argue with those guys because they have a point. But it is more than just 'kinda mashup of Castlevania and DS' game. It has its own style in all parts of the game. For example soundtrack is a lot different from DS series. And this hand painted graphics! A lot of users complain on it but I think is's beautiful!What about cons? I see only the one, Salt and Sanctuary have no online multiplayer, only the local coop with PvP possibilities. No random helpers, no invaders. Only your friend beside you. From other side it is a pros for someone.So I'm recommending this game for all dark fantasy fans and especially for DS and Castlevania fandoms followers.Will preorder Salt and Sanctuary 2 without any doubts.

												To start, I liked the Souls series, but never completed one (Reached Ornstein and Smough in DS 1 and currently playing DS 2). Salt and Sanctuary seems like the younger brother, following family tradition in it's own special way, and it's ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. There were times I felt the game was unfair but stuck with it and figured out what needed to be done and Passed it with no problem.  Gameplay, weapons, and the ♥♥♥♥ing combos are outstanding. The world is incredibly interconnected, but possibly too well, as bosses seem extremely close to eachother. 5 minutes walk and 15/20 enemies and I'd found 2 more bosses after the last one? Seems like there should be DLC for this, to add more to it or possibly promise to make S&S 2. Another thing is this game NEEDS a map, like seriously, it's incredibly overwhelming trying to remember which areas are connected to where, or what sanctuary I should go to to get to a certain NPC who sells boss sets (2 of them are seemingly equidistent). Also possibly think about implementing online multiplayer? Local is great, but many people now have gaming friends who are miles away and cant just pop 'round for a game.			"

												This has to be one of the only games to really capture the spirit of what the souls series is. It has a great soundtrack, the controls are tight, the combat system is awesome. The only gripes I have with it are: -Hitboxes are (just like in souls games) sometimes wonky -Systems are not explained thoroughly (I. E. What the hell the difference between creeds is), but the fanmade wiki does a good job at explaining them -Most importantly: This is a 2D game with a lot of branching paths and no map. You will at times get absolutely lost. Still an absolute recommendation to everyone who can't get enough of soulslike games.			"

The whole art of this game (music, efects, landscape) is almost perfect imo.However, there are a few things about mechanics that doesn´t make me comfortable.The hitboxes are irreal. There aren´t too many weapons to transmute. There aren´t a map (I know dark souls hasn´t got one, I played 300 hours of DS), or at least make the  shortcut system easier to remember.All in all. This game is great although it´s designed by an indie company.Buy it, and enjoy.			"

												I really enjoyed the dark souls franchise. However I felt like the 3d environment didn't really appeal to me. This game has a concept I've been dreaming of for ages! The darkness and difficulty of dark souls but with a 2d environment with jumping and attack combos added. I've only played this game for a short while so far, but I'm already in love! :D			"

												Awesome game. Might be a little frustrating to get used to the 2d gameplay if you are not experienced but its worth it. The only con for me right now is the quite irrelevant lore. I know it pays homage to dark souls but it just cant hold me.			"

												Finished Dark Souls 3 and Bloodborne, in that order, and still thirsted for more; yes, I know, there's still DeS, DS1 and DS2. But, as I stumbled upon a YouTuber playing this ""little"" 2-D platformer reminiscent of SoulsBorne, I was intrigued. For $20, I thought why not? I purchased it. And, although, it does have the overall structure and leveling mechanics of a Souls-type game, I couldn't help but think that the devs also got some inspiration from Metroid. I LOVE Metroid! And, I LOVE Bloodborne (more than Souls) - perfect mixture of the platforming genre with the action-RPG genre! I strongly recommend picking this one up!Addendum: This game has a high replay value - <$20 cover fee is a steal. I typically don't replay games, but I found myself replaying as a different build. My initial playthrough was a mage - never used a magic build before in any RPG; it was great, but easy as hell. Now, my second playthrough as a cleric with passive prayers - that's a bit more challenging.			"

												I kinda wanted to beat the game before I wrote a review, but lone behold, here I am. So if you are a fan of the Souls games, then its kind of a no brainer that you'll like this game, they got a lot of the Souls elements down and even some that Salt and Sanctuary did better, but what I found horribly wrong was the skill tree, when I first saw it, I was in aw, but when I looked through it, there was literaly nothing unique about it, ""spend a point to upgrade strength"", ""spend a point to upgrade dextarity"", ""spend a point to upgrade magic"", its basically the most uncreative skill tree I've ever laid eyes on. But enough rambling on about the skill tree. The game looks great, the game feels great, the bosses are creative (and mostly spoiled thanks to the trailer), and the covenent system is wonderful. The game is worth a shot even at full price.			"

												It's basically a 2D Dark Souls, with way more platforming elements, as a result of it being 2D. It's worth the full price, and if you can't afford Dark Souls 3 yet, like a lot of the other reviews have pointed out jokingly, then yeah, get this, it's worth it. I'm loving it so far.			"

												For some reason, I wasn't expecting to like this game because I hate RPG titles with so much passion. But when I saw the limited-but-active combat system, I felt like it was the Castlevania game we'll never get. In fact, it is crazy to think that this game does everything better than Lords of Shadow: Mirror of Fate. The apprentice has beaten the master.Salt and Sanctuary is a 2D character-action game with RPG elements. With a focus on grinding and surviving, the game does have enough depth with the Tree of Skill since each class give you a chance to level up in a certain path. Using whip-based weapons, wands, poleaxes and, my favorite, the reapers. Each weapon behave in a way that you may feel confortable or not and giving the choice to the player is sommething that I appreciate. You can have a Mage using Wands and Staves as expected or you can do something a little odd and go for Magic and Axes. A Knight has access to Swords but can use Reapers and acquires gear that will make that Knight look like a Lord of the Underworld, a Leader of the Damned.The difficulty is real, I'm not too familiar with the Stamina system as I'm more used to pure character-action games like Bayonetta but Salt and Sanctuary has impressed with the presentation (beautiful art design) the actual freedom for the Tree of Skill, the overall design and the boss mechanics (and they are impressive to fight as awesome to look at) as well as the Brand system where they give you permanent upgrades to help you explore the world. The salt system can be frustrating at first but taking your time is a guaranteed pass for your survival. Patience is all you need.			"

												This game is perfect for someone who wants to enjoy the classic Metrovania style with welcome change to combat and progression. Dark souls is a clear insparation to how combat works in Salt without being a carbon copy with the addition of combos and how magic is treated (Magic has its own MP bar but it as you use it you take a hit to your max Stamina). Bosses  arnt as challenging as they are in Dark Souls but that doesnt mean that they are a cake walk. The story is told through random NPCs, Beastiary entries and items and  does an amazing job of not only telling the story of the island but the entire world itself which is so F***ed up (No seriously take all the worst aspects of history and you have the world of S&S). For the price, this game is not something any fan of the genre should pass up on and i REALLY hope they do a sequel or at least some DLC.			"

												7/10This game is fun because of the main mechanics, but the game is very unbalanced and unpolished. A few bosses towards the end are downright unfair because they can oneshot you with an unavoidable attack if you get unlucky with attack patterns and the boss' position. I've played through this game three times now with three different builds (greathammer, magic only, and gun only) and each time was very boring and unfair because of this problem. The game's difficulty is also very uneven, with the game becoming extremely easy if you have a fully upgraded weapon at the end. Meanwhile, the platforming in the game is all-around horrible.The game's artstyle is horrible and most will agree with this.Even with all these problems, I'm still looking forward to a sequel to this game that will (hopefully) have more polish and testing before being released.

												What a beautfiully crafted game I have played today,Two words: Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥Aside from the gorgeous and completely original photoshop art style,I'd like to focus on the gameplay, which is heavily based upon dark souls, which I find fun.I'm not that type of person who goes for graphics, but for gameplay.Mostly I play the cartoony games instead of the realistic looking ones as they mostly have more creativity.In this case that's what I think about Salt and Sanctuary,Salt and Sanctuary may have kind of stolen the gameplay type, but I find it much better then dark souls in every way. The game has a huge map for an drawn indie game and has fresh enemies you can't get enough of,bosses which make you sweat while playing.I played Charlie Murder (an other game of ska studios) a year ago and I loved it as well.The game was heavily inspired by Castle Crashers, and they nailed that as well.

												I didn't think a 2D dark souls would feel so much... dark souls. It's incredible how the game feels like it, and the difficuly level is really adequate for the genre. The world seems to be very big and you have to go back to previous areas with the abilities you collect fighting your way through the very well designed bosses you find. I found some bosses to be incredibly hard compared to others, so I feel like the weaker ones should be adjusted accordingly to provide a better challenge. Character progression is not based on raising the stats like in dark souls, but in a manner much similar to Final Fantasy X's sphere grid, where you decide how to spend your level up. The result is the exact same as dark souls though. Buy this game if you like metroidvanias, but also if you like dark souls. Do not buy it if you get easily frustrated.			"

												Salt and sanctuary - One of the most dark souls-esque games I've ever seen/played. I could tell just by playing five minutes of the game that is was heavily inspired by dark souls (Don't know if it was intentional or unintentional). Despite it's ridiculous dificulty, I very much enjoyed the game. How it played, the bosses, leveling tree and all of that. I've spent many of my hours playing this game, looking for secrets, trying new builds and other things. I very strongly recomend this game to anyone who is looking for a game that provides many days worth of game play, or someone who is looking for a challenge.			"

												Already finished it on PS4 with a friend, now I'm going through solo on the PC version.This game is usually compared to Dark Souls because of the soul/salt system and the way checkpoints (bonfiers/sanctuaries) work but I think it's closer to Metroid type games. Granted, Dark Souls also takes heavily from those games but Salt and Sanctuary also involves lots of platforming and gaining new abilities like wall jumping to reach areas you couldn't get to earlier. But what's even more important is that this is an excellent game in its own right!			"

Product received for free
												I'm writing this review with the perspective of a Dark Souls fan. The first thing I noticed when I first launched the game was the controls, they're bad, for example RT is to roll. I played for about half and hour thinking that I would simply get use to it, but I really was not enjoying it. I then rebound the controls to be like Dark Souls, and I loved it. I'll put my control scheme at the end of the review. This game does carry a good amount of mechanics from Dark Souls, like rolling, equip load, two handing, and a few others, however, there is no hotkey to twohand a weapon. My only real complaint about this game is something you really can't do anything thing about. Due to the nature of this game, being 2D and all, it is in fact not very hard and not sophisticated. Not to says it's easy, but not quite Dark Souls. All in all, it is a good game and I would recommend it. My first playthough of the game was about 15 hours long, and I am aware that I did in fact skip two whole areas and a few other things I could have done if I backtracked.My control scheme (360 Pad):Block/Offhand: LBRoll: BAttack: RBStrong Attack: RTUse (Interact): Right Stick (Clicking it)Jump: APrevious Item (Hotbar): Left on D-PadNext Item (Hotbar): Right on D-PadUse Item (Hotbar): X(Hold) Use Torch: Down on D-PadSwitch Loadout: Up on D-PadInventory: Start Button			"

												I really like this game. It reminds me a lot of the Souls games, and that's good, but it's also a game all it's own. It has a very dark and pretty atmosphere. And it uses that darkness really well putting you in areas that you cant see at all with out a torch or light charm. It's difficult but not over barring, if you prepare, and its platforming is really great. Adding in different elements to it as the game progresses that encourage you to go back and re-explore an area for items you couldn't get to at the your first time through.There are cons too, like some ridiculous drops and enemies stunlocking you to death, but nothing too bad.

												This game is a gruesome experience.  In a good way!  It will bring you up and cut you down.  It will bring you a sense of comfort once you get to know the particular kind of weird and gruesome an area has to offer, then sweep that comfort out from under your feet by showing you something on an entirely different scale of weird and gruesome that you never imagined possible.  It will get you so lost in the beautiful, horrible atmosphere that you won't care how many times you have to die and come back.  It wil get you so actually lost in the world but in the process will let you discover secrets and shortcuts that connect the world and help you immensely as you progress.  No matter if you choose to be an assassin weilding an arsenal of toxic weaponry, a mage with unparralelled control of fire and lightning, a paladin with the healing aid of the gods, a hunter weilding whip and pistol, or a chef weilding their trusty frying pan (yes, this is a thing you can choose to be), this game will both challenge and reward your favorite playstyle.There's 23 different zones to discover, 23 different bosses to defeat, a hundred different kinds of enemies to slay, and seven different creeds to pledge yourself to that will aid your preferred playsyle.  Not to mention the number of items, weapons, attire, charms, and rings you can get.I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys metroidvania-style games.  It is more than worth the price of the game.  I just beat it, and I'm eager to take on NG+ and start a whole bunch of new characters to try out new playstyles.  I'm certain I'll be playing this game for a very long time.  To the makers of this game: You are amazing.  Thank you for bringing this into existence.			"

												Awesome game, but I feel like there is a lot wrong with the Kraken wyrm boss fight. After he lands, he'll do one of his attacks/actions immidiately without pause. If you get unlocky and he decides to pounce at you, you're done. His standing fireattack is really weird to roll through, often pushing you in weird directions (his tail slap does this too). Finally, for me he suicided by jump attacking to the left a whole bunch. Every boss fight felt pretty smooth except this one. Overall still a really cool game that takes a lot from dark souls and adds a bit of spice.			"

												Yes yes it's a platformer Dark Souls clone that's not quite as hard as dark souls but appears to copy it in many many ways. But let's remove ourselves from first impressions and actually look at the game for what it is and not just what it appears to be or what it's not.It does have a stamina bar for your attacks and your rolls. Fun? Yes. (That's not a dark souls unique feature by the way.)Does ""salt"" kind of sound like ""soul""? Yes yes. You die, you lose it, you go back for it and you move on. Maybe just like Dark Souls, but who cares - it's fun anyway.Yes yes, sanctuaries are kind of like bonfires. You establish them in designated places, you travel between them, you revive at them and level up at them. But there is something new too! You can place your chosen NPCs in them AND sanctuaries come in different types (based on which faction they belong to). So there, not like Dark Souls at all!Oh, and the level-up tree - totally not Dark Souls. More Path of Exile. Aside from the whole fact that you collect salt and when you have enough - you level up at the bonfire i mean sanctuary and get a point to distribute...Oh i forgot to mention, it wasn't that hard of a game because i played a mage. ""Hidden easy mode"". Like Dark Souls.Alright alright it's just like Dark Souls.But it's also a decent platformer with a pretty big convoluted world, many secrets, many weapons and their upgrades, armors, spells, memorable boss fights. What's not to like? "

Absolute Perfection!Ever wondered what Castlevania would be like with Dark Souls mechanics?  Look no further, this game is an absolute gem. With an art style similar to Darkest Dungeon, and the core of Castlevania and Dark Souls you couldn't ask for a better game. My only gripe with it is I wish there was more, that's not saying there isn't alot to do, ng+ and all that jazz.  I'm at the end of the game just wrapping up side areas and such, and figured I'd drop a review to show some love.   But anyway here's the pros and cons:ProsGraphics are fluid even on older hardware runs like a champ.Symphony of the Night+Dark Souls=Yes Plz.Combat mechanics are great, lots o' blood filled joy abound.Level Design pretty straight forward, lots of hidden stuff to find.ConsSome of the bosses can be cheesed to death or outleveled quite easily.If it had been closer to Symphony of the Night in scale would have been absolutely epic.Leaves you wanting more.  (Which can count as both a pro/con I guess)But seriously if you're still reading this, buy this game.			"

												Basically 2D Dark Souls. Despite the heavy focus on platforming it captures the nature of Souls games really well - from the feeling of loneliness and dread to the methodical skill based combat. Any Souls fan will feel right at home. You might say S&S borrows too much from Souls games but it also puts its own spin on a lot of elements, albeit not always successfully. All in all this may be the best Souls knock-off yet, 3D games included.			"

												Amazing game. Great replayability too. Graphics are wonderful (except the characters but I understand thats the artistic style.) My wife even enjoyed it enough that we played it COOP for about 12 hours straight. The game is really difficult and while that can be annoying it adds to the joy when you finally down that boss that had been stomping your face. If you are wanting something new and refreshing, this game is it. Wife approved.			"

												To be honest, I don't even like Dark Souls games so I won't compare these. This game is beautiful. Seriously, I'm tired of 8-bit colourful sh*tty visuals and music that indie loves.And this is hand-drawn gothic ART. I can't even imagine, how many hours of work it took. And I envy you, Ska Studios. Graphic, music, gameplay, difficulty - everything feels like wax-polished to almost perfect condition.So I will die again. And will be revived by mysterious cleric. "

												Salt and Sanctuary is probably going to be one of the few games I actually end up replaying. It's very much like a Souls game, but it's also got a great metrodvania feel. Pros and cons are as follows:Pros:Typically tight controlsGreat art style that emphasizes colors and shading when it needs to(Except for those faces)A lot to exploreA large amount of customization for such a small gameRewarding when taking down bosses or getting through tough areasMeh:Not as difficult as it could have been. It's typically balanced, but it's not going to challenge you to be pushed to your limits. It definitely rewards patience, but bosses and enemies become predictable very quickly, lowering the difficulty of the game. Some parts will still feel difficult, but it's not overbearing, in my opinion.Cons:Stun lock. Enemies will knock you down and start chaining attacks, giving no time for recovery and feeling cheapStarts to drag a little towards the end. The world felt a little worn, but it's still great to explore. Just a little more variety would have been appreciated. It's a good game. Great even. It's really enjoyable, and it's probably going to end up being one of those indie game gems. It's a solid 9/10.			"

The game is what would happen if darks souls had his first game released as a nintendo game. Pros: + Nice Soundtrack+ Hard Enemys like the original souls games+ Great Graphic Stile which supports the atmosphere of the game.+ Old known enmies and a lot of referneces to the original souls gameCons:+ like all souls games this game is pretty hard and is probably not the game for casual gamers+ Boss fights getting a bit borring since the almost everytime have a big sword and try to hit you multiple times while you   just block+ unfortunatly online modus is ab bit poor compared to the souls games			"

												Dark Souls combat and leveling systems translated into a 2D world with a healthy dose of Metroidvania platforming and exploration. An unlikely combination, but one that works surprisingly well and still keeps all aspects of it fairly satisfying.Only downsides are that there is no online co-op (it's local play only) and the unusual art style which might turn some people off.I heartily recommend this game to all Soulsborne and Castlevania fans alike.

												Salt and Sanctuary is familiarity with a twist. Being a fan of the Souls games and Symphony of the Night, I was intrigued to discover this game, even more so when I discovered it was by the people who made Charlie Murder, which admittedly I didn't play much of. Not a fault of the game mind you, I'm just not that good at beat 'em ups. This however, I did, my time on record with this game should be evidence enough of that. All the important things from Dark Souls and SoTN are there. The platforming works well enough, a few explorative aid power ups to be found but nothing major. Points off for all that Dark Souls fall damage though, especially since a la SoTN a heavy attack will send you flying gayly across the screen usually to your death, especially in areas with a lot of dropoffs (i.e. Red Hall of Cages, Hager's Cavern, Crypt of Dead Gods, etc). The combat works great, it took the most important and best aspects of the Souls series in terms of the combat which translates surprisingly well to the two dimensional plane. The dodging, the parrying, the stamina and equip load management, it's all there and works just fine. The bonfire stand-ins, called sanctuaries, though fewer than the bonfires were still work just fine, smaller more temporary respite in the form of shrines offer no opportunity to level up but do heal and usually signal a boss is nearby. Covenants, or in this case creeds are present and do a few things to benefit the player, unfortunately unlike Dark Souls changing from one to another is not painless. The level up system is different from the Souls games or SoTN but still works well, a comparison was made to FFX's skill sphere system and the comparison is apt. Your ability to wear certain weapons and armor, which are divided into tiers, is determined by picking the appropriate enabling skill in the skill tree, which does limit what you can use and makes you pick and choose very carefully where to put your upgrade points. Two currencies abound here, salt (souls), and gold. Salt is for leveling up and upgrading gear, gold is for purchases at NPC vendors. Upon death, which in this type of game is bound to happen, you lose all your salt, which if you kill the offending enemy or spawned bat (no bloodstains here) you reclaim them, if you don't die on the way there that is. You lose about 10% of your held gold as well, which is not recoverable. Technically it holds up, I only encountered one minor issue that resolved itself in seconds. I think I covered just about everything, overall this is one of my favorite games of the year so far. There's a lot to recommend here, and for roughly eighteen dollars there's a lot of fun to be had, a solid 8/10.			"

												Very good game, basically Dark Souls 1 in 2D. Sadly with the same balancing problems. With some fine tuning for the bosses and a slight nerf to magic dmg (combined with some better access to survival for mages, because the mage tree has literally 0 defensive nodes) the game could be 10/10, so far 8,5/10.

												This game is extremely fun if you liked any of the Dark Souls games and if you like platformers, It is quite challenging since they don't allow you to just stack butt loads of health. You gain health by leveling, roughly two levels is 5 health. You gain stats by putting points into the Skill Tree, not just allocating points into whatever you want. The melee weapons do have a little combo in them, according to your equipment load as well. Magic is really well done in this game, you lose your maximum stamina everytime you use magic, but you gain a little bit of it back after you use a potion. The game can be unfair, but hey, that's what happens when you play a ""Souls""-like game, nothing will be fair. Some bosses are challenging, some are fairly easy. There are even some moments where you can execute a monster by stomping their head in or stabbing them in the face while they're stunned. The visuals are nice, sound effects are wonderful, and music is pretty niceTL;DR : If you like any of the Souls games, platformers and blood flying  you should try this game. Challenging, fun, and for the price, it's well worth it.			"

												Okay, it's a ""souls game"". The term has been damaged by From Soft lately though. So let's call it what it is: A damn good game, a vortex for your free time, and a world that you get more and more keen on learning all the shortcuts through. And then you get branded, and can explore the world upside down. And then, you get to do even more platforming. And reexplore.As a souls player, you know the mechanics already (even though, most evilly, the default setup of the controller is not like dark souls at all!). Take care of your distance to the enemy. Time your swings. Use the animation. Block. Roll. Parry. In contrast to the ""real"" Souls, even jumping can be quite helpful. The 2D nature of the game gives jumping (i.e., platforming) a deeper importance anyways. The biggest asset of the game though, IMO, is its world. I just need to know more. I haven't beaten the game yet, but I am not driven to find the ""exit"". I want to dig deeper, and deeper. And thankfully, so far, I have been able to. Even in the light of Dark Souls 3 being released this year, IMO, S&S is the best souls game this year - if you only consider single player.I hope Ska Studios get a non-hotseat, i.e. true online, multiplayer to work - this would make S&S the definite souls game of 2016. Until then, all you can do is confuse/trick/help others with your messages in bottles (or, as far as I have found out).That being said, if you don't play Dark Souls to PVP vs. newbies, you should buy this game. Easily a 7/10 (in a world where you would use 0 to 10 out of 10 and not 8.5 to 9.5 out of 10, like most gaming media seem to do). Enjoy!			"

Product received for free
												To start, I liked the Souls series, but never completed one (Reached Ornstein and Smough in DS 1 and currently playing DS 2). Salt and Sanctuary seems like the younger brother, following family tradition in it's own special way, and it's ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. There were times I felt the game was unfair but stuck with it and figured out what needed to be done and Passed it with no problem.  Gameplay, weapons, and the ♥♥♥♥ing combos are outstanding. The world is incredibly interconnected, but possibly too well, as bosses seem extremely close to eachother. 5 minutes walk and 15/20 enemies and I'd found 2 more bosses after the last one? Seems like there should be DLC for this, to add more to it or possibly promise to make S&S 2. Another thing is this game NEEDS a map, like seriously, it's incredibly overwhelming trying to remember which areas are connected to where, or what sanctuary I should go to to get to a certain NPC who sells boss sets (2 of them are seemingly equidistent). Also possibly think about implementing online multiplayer? Local is great, but many people now have gaming friends who are miles away and cant just pop 'round for a game.			"

												This has to be one of the only games to really capture the spirit of what the souls series is. It has a great soundtrack, the controls are tight, the combat system is awesome. The only gripes I have with it are: -Hitboxes are (just like in souls games) sometimes wonky -Systems are not explained thoroughly (I. E. What the hell the difference between creeds is), but the fanmade wiki does a good job at explaining them -Most importantly: This is a 2D game with a lot of branching paths and no map. You will at times get absolutely lost. Still an absolute recommendation to everyone who can't get enough of soulslike games.			"

The whole art of this game (music, efects, landscape) is almost perfect imo.However, there are a few things about mechanics that doesn´t make me comfortable.The hitboxes are irreal. There aren´t too many weapons to transmute. There aren´t a map (I know dark souls hasn´t got one, I played 300 hours of DS), or at least make the  shortcut system easier to remember.All in all.

												Finished Dark Souls 3 and Bloodborne, in that order, and still thirsted for more; yes, I know, there's still DeS, DS1 and DS2. But, as I stumbled upon a YouTuber playing this ""little"" 2-D platformer reminiscent of SoulsBorne, I was intrigued. For $20, I thought why not? I purchased it. And, although, it does have the overall structure and leveling mechanics of a Souls-type game, I couldn't help but think that the devs also got some inspiration from Metroid. I LOVE Metroid! And, I LOVE Bloodborne (more than Souls) - perfect mixture of the platforming genre with the action-RPG genre! I strongly recommend picking this one up!Addendum: This game has a high replay value - <$20 cover fee is a steal. I typically don't replay games, but I found myself replaying as a different build. My initial playthrough was a mage - never used a magic build before in any RPG; it was great, but easy as hell. Now, my second playthrough as a cleric with passive prayers - that's a bit more challenging.			"

												I kinda wanted to beat the game before I wrote a review, but lone behold, here I am. So if you are a fan of the Souls games, then its kind of a no brainer that you'll like this game, they got a lot of the Souls elements down and even some that Salt and Sanctuary did better, but what I found horribly wrong was the skill tree, when I first saw it, I was in aw, but when I looked through it, there was literaly nothing unique about it, ""spend a point to upgrade strength"", ""spend a point to upgrade dextarity"", ""spend a point to upgrade magic"", its basically the most uncreative skill tree I've ever laid eyes on. But enough rambling on about the skill tree. The game looks great, the game feels great, the bosses are creative (and mostly spoiled thanks to the trailer), and the covenent system is wonderful. The game is worth a shot even at full price.			"

												For some reason, I wasn't expecting to like this game because I hate RPG titles with so much passion. But when I saw the limited-but-active combat system, I felt like it was the Castlevania game we'll never get. In fact, it is crazy to think that this game does everything better than Lords of Shadow: Mirror of Fate. The apprentice has beaten the master.Salt and Sanctuary is a 2D character-action game with RPG elements. With a focus on grinding and surviving, the game does have enough depth with the Tree of Skill since each class give you a chance to level up in a certain path. Using whip-based weapons, wands, poleaxes and, my favorite, the reapers. Each weapon behave in a way that you may feel confortable or not and giving the choice to the player is sommething that I appreciate. You can have a Mage using Wands and Staves as expected or you can do something a little odd and go for Magic and Axes. A Knight has access to Swords but can use Reapers and acquires gear that will make that Knight look like a Lord of the Underworld, a Leader of the Damned.The difficulty is real, I'm not too familiar with the Stamina system as I'm more used to pure character-action games like Bayonetta but Salt and Sanctuary has impressed with the presentation (beautiful art design) the actual freedom for the Tree of Skill, the overall design and the boss mechanics (and they are impressive to fight as awesome to look at) as well as the Brand system where they give you permanent upgrades to help you explore the world. The salt system can be frustrating at first but taking your time is a guaranteed pass for your survival. Patience is all you need.			"

												Salt and sanctuary, more like frustration and salt in wounds. But oh boy the feeling when you get past a boss in this sidescroller darksouls(esque) metroidvania. Artstyle doesent hit on all the people, but if you are not a graphic needy person, or dont mind too much on the artstyle and want to try a semi difficult game, pick this one up.Only downside what i think of is sometimes missing certain paths and need to backtrack but its all good when you find your bearings and get some salt. And keyboard controls arent too easy to use, would recommend a controller.This game is not too hard to learn, and totally worth atleast 15€Definetly recommended.			"

												This game is really fun. It's not only very difucult, but it's also very fun and clever. There are spots in the game were you really have to think about what you're doing, and when you're too frustrated at the game for killing you a thousand times, other people can think for you with helpful messages. Although most of the time they're reaslly vauge, they will usually lead you to awesome items, or another piece of the story that will lead you deeper into the hidden lore of this amazing game. If you do not like a challenge, then I would not suggest this game to you. On the other side, if you love games like Dark Souls, I would HIGHLY recommend this game to you.			"

												The game is pretty good. A 2D version of Dark Souls, but somewhat easier, and therefore more fun. One thing I HATE about this game is the multiplayer element. This game seems like it would be a lot of fun on multiplayer, but they made it so that you need to play on the SAME COMPUTER, one using the keyboard and the other a controller. And (correct me if I'm wrong)  you need a console controller. There's also the problem of the monitor size. Now, my brother's computer monitor is massive, but say for instance someone has a small laptop. You can't do co-op on that. It's a shame because, as I said, this game would be really fun on multiplayer, if you could play on different computers. And you'd have more freedom that way, not being limited to where the host is.Update: This just in, apparantly co-op can ♥♥♥♥ with your game! I recently read a comment on the wiki page on multiplayer saying that a key essential to progressing was turned into a bag of salt after a co-op match. While sounding rather funny at first, know that this can completely break your game and make you have to start over. This needs to be fixed.Edit: Also, when you get later on into the game, you'll find a boss or maybe an enemy that you just can't beat. You're too high level to re-spec now, and since the only multiplayer is split-screen local co-op, you likely won't get any help, which has happened to me.			"

												A mix of Dark Souls and Rogue Legacy. A fast-paced, action-focused interpretation of the dark souls mechanics. This game is excellent. I powered through 30 hours in just a few days, with simultaneous playthroughs on various computers because I didn't want to stop. You don't get the same sense of exploring an ancient world, though the team did make a huge effort to provide compelling lore to their setting, but if you enjoy action-packed combat, challenges and progression, buy this.Also, you may have heard the bosses are ""gimmicky"". This is the salt of people that can't hack a challenge and take it out on a game's review score. I never encountered an unfair boss, despite running fragile builds with little defense and almost never blocking. Some bosses seemed impossible at first, but careful study and practice let me cut through them like butter.			"

												When everything clicks this game stand tall as everything you could want in a 2D Dark Souls, but when it flaws rear their ugly heads it will have you raging harder than Dark Souls ever did.  Like everyone else my main problem is with the impercise timing and hit boxs.  One fairly early boss, a cyclops, has a competely unavoidable swing if your standing at his feet.  The grabs enemies do have weirdly long and big hitboxes too often seeming to suck you to them.  Platfroming will kill you a lot at first as well because of strange jump timing. Other than that the combat is quick, brtual, and bloodly.  Weapons types are varied and interesting.  Magic and Spells are powerful and have many uses. Evironment and enemy design are creepy and unnerving.Overall 8/10 would buy (but maybe wait till its on sale)       "

												I could wax lyrical about this game but I'll keep it down to simple pros and cons.Pros:. Beautiful environments, hideous enemies and bad♥♥♥♥♥weapons. It looks good!. Enormous world with seamless transitions between areas. No loading screens!. In-depth, tactical combat and genuine challenge. You feel skillful when you win.. Enormous skill tree and hundreds of items. You can make the adventurer you want.. Other players online leave gravestones and corpses behind in interesting places. See how your friends are dying!. Local co-op is smooth and fun and very rewarding.Cons:. The platforming can be very tricky and downright unfair. Enemies kill you plenty but falls kill you more.. The story is oblique and sparsely referenced. You don't feel like you're part of any narrative aside from whatever you're telling yourself as you play. There IS a story there and a good one too, but you have to read the skill tree and item descriptions for it.. Not all skill build paths are equally viable. Light armour for instance, has few good items, but you're tripping over plate mail. Magic almost trivializes the game with how strong it becomes.. Hurtboxes and hitboxes are sometimes wonky. Prepare to get grabbed and slashed by attacks that you thought you had avoided.. Certain enemies are arguably unfair. A particular boss is notorious for 1-shotting you and the fight is gruelling.Overall recommendation:Beautiful, challenging, sometimes frustrating but immersive in spite of itself, this game rocks. Buy it!			"

Posted: June 24, 2016
												I have to say, it has been a while since I have discovered such a gem. When I heard about Ska studios' ambitious project to create an RPG game I was a bit skeptical. After all, they are comprised of only two people; a husband and wife. Even with several years of development, ""Surely a two man team could not deliver something exceptional."" I thought in my mind. Perhaps it was my low expectations that lead to me absolutely falling in love with the game. Or perhaps the game is just very well made. I am leaning towards the latter. Well before I inevitably type your eyes out of your sockets let's elaborate on what this game is shall we? Salt and Sanctuary is a simple Metroidvania style RPG game with Dark Souls gameplay elements. It works, very well in fact. For those who dislike long reviews; the game is good and you will enjoy it if you like Dark Souls and Castlevania. Heck, you may love it if you just enjoy 2D games.For  those who want to know a bit more about the game, let's get into the meat of the review. Yes, the game is a Metroidvania Souls game, but it is much more than that; it has its own unique lore behind everything, areas that astound you the more you progress, enjoyable weapons with unique movesets, all manner of different playstyles, combine that with a very different artstyle and you have a game very full of enjoyment for a low price. Some dislike the artstyle, but I find it interesting that you can take such cartoony looking character models and make them menacing or somber. Perhaps it isn't the artstyle itself I adore, but the way the developers were able to present it as to bring out feelings from the player such as fear, melancholy, terror, etc. All from 2D character models and environments. It sort of solidifies the fact you do not need extremely beautiful graphics to produce a good game. The bosses are interesting as well and you can see the influence drawn from the Souls series; but not so much to be considered a rip off. Some seem almost inspired by a Lovecraft novel. The music was surprisingly enjoyable if not a bit anemic. I have to say, the music near the end of the game was a pleasant surprise and you will never expect it. The gameplay is very fun once you get the hang of the way your character moves and attacks depending on your weapon of choice. Magic is also an option and it is definitely fun if not a little weak early on. However that is remedied later; you will become a human nuke. Don't worry. Did I mention how satisfying it is to kill enemies? Because it is. Blood spatters everywhere and if you are using a sharp weapon you can catch certain enemies being decapitated. There's also a quaint little message in a bottle system similar to Dark Souls' message system and it is a nice touch. Now for the problems. Remember my doubts about a two man group producing a polished game? Well, some of that will come to light while playing the game. Exclusively in the balance department.... Build variety is there, but the game is very imbalanced unfortunately, favoring greatweapon gameplay and shunning all other forms of gameplay other than magic. Wielding a greatsword by far is the easiest way to beat the game; add being a user of prayers and the game becomes trivial. Simply buff yourself and your greatsword and prepare to one-shot most enemies. Strength/Wisdom is definitely the way to go. If you play as a dexterity build you will be strong, but you will never be as strong as a strength or strength/wisdom build mostly due to the fact that many ranged weapons that scale off of dex do not do much damage, and the best dexterity weapons in the game are a bit weak. Heck, a strength/magic build is completely viable and is very strong given there is a weapon that equally scales off of both. It's mostly the dex weapons that have the issue, being a little useless. Add in also the fact that all pistols act like shotguns, that right there makes pistols a bit niche. You also give up a charm slot which is extremely risky given that charms give you all manner of powerups with your weapons. Would I really want replace my charm that increases weapon damage with this crappy pistol? No thank you.Some bosses feel a little bit cheap, given the fact every time a boss hits you, you fly 10 feet. That right there is an annoyance, and I wonder why Ska made that a feature with every boss in the game. It only leads to certain bosses comboing you to death, and leaving you with sadness. Some bosses also have unavoidable attacks if you aren't in the perfect sector, and this can lead to even more frustration. There's no online multiplayer, only local coop. Definitely a huge con for replayability, but expected given the size of the team. The default controls are very awkward and I changed them instantly when I found out you could remap buttons. Simply put, fiddle around with what makes you feel comfortable and do NOT play this game with a keyboard whatever you do. Music is a bit anemic like stated earlier but I give SKA a pass since they did not have a dedicated composer. In the least the music towards the end is very memorable. This is also an honorable mention; near the end of the game there are platforming sections and a certain enemy that will be mentioned shortly..... Let me tell you that these platforming sections are the most annoying platforming sections in a video game and while not required to progress, make it difficult for you to access optional areas. Now these enemies I mentioned prior are in the same area as these platforming sections; they have low health but are an instant kill if they hit you and there are three of them bunched together. They are cheap and I bloody hate them. Those of you who have played this game and are reading this, you know which enemies I am speaking of! Now if all these problems I mentioned were to be patched? I would have to say that this game would be close to perfect. It is a 9.0 out of a 10.0 for me in it's current state and personally, is a must buy for Souls and Metroidvania-style game fans. There's nothing quite like it that I have played personally, and you can't help but give credit to this lovely husband and wife team for putting out such a masterpiece amongst such a boring plethora of video games.

Amazing Atmosphere, hard and annoying (the good kind!), and awesome looking enemies and bosses. Add in a bit of platforming (which is flawed, but its good enough to satisfy) and nerve-racking exploration, you got yourself a really good game. I just wish I had gotten it sooner :)			"

												Prepare to die... in 2D! Most people wouldn't really think a 2D Dark Souls-ish would work out, but Salt and Sanctuary does exactly the opposite. The combat system/controls is similar to the Souls series with 1 or 2handing weapons, parry & riposte, combat rolling and equipment load among others. The leveling system is different, where you need to spend points in a MASSIVE talent tree (if you would spend a life time on it then you could truly become a Jack-Of-All-Trades).The levels themselves are quite short (but shouldn't be considered a bad thing), for example that when i defeated the first boss i managed to find the third (and later on the second) boss in as short as 10 minutes. It is worth checking out for anybody who is into Action RPG's. Stay salty my friends.			"

												I have played every souls game for at least 100 hours each and I must say this game lives up to the quality I've come to expect. All the core mechanics are here: Range, melee, magic builds and hybrids, stamina management, equipment/weight management, fashion, and my beloved parrying to name a few so I felt right at home. I love the tweaks they made to this system as well, you get 2 weapon sets to adjust, and when one is equipped, the other doesn't effect your weight. Also parrying animations are legit and can distance other opponents. There are different combos you can perform from standard X, X, X ground combo to X,Y,(X or Y repeated) air combos. Using magic is really satisfying as well in my experience whether you need to zone or distance yourself.Initially I didn't feel very drawn in to the world until I discovered that this game has something no other souls game has. Something I hold very dear to my heart and is becoming harder to find in any games these days. That thing is local co op. I had already played an hour before my older brother picked up the sticks and joined me, so I made a new mage/dex build while he went holy knight. We have been hooked ever since, I love how dynamic our methods in fighting can become as we increase our abilities to crush our foes. There is just nothing like playing along side a sibling or good friend in a game that requires both of you to always be on your toes. It is harder with two people and that is just the way we want it.Now I haven't been exposed to Metroid or Castlevania so I can't use those as reference, but I love the way maps are designed for platforming, moving up and down, it all feels really smooth. Exploration is great as your field of view won't show you everything and you never know what you will find next. If my brother would die late in a stage's progression, I would have to make a choice to either return to a sanctuary and revive him or keep moving forward hoping I find a new one. Sometimes I found one, sometimes I came across a boss who wanted nothing more than to rip me to shreds. Oh and bosses have more than 1 phase like Dark Souls 3/Bloodborne.All in all I highly recommend this game co op or not, it makes you work for success, and feel like a total badass while you do it. We are still learning a lot and have a long way to go, and I can definitely see the replay value this game has to offer. I give Salt and Sanctuary 3 thumbs up, 5 gold stars, and a burrito from your favorite mexican restaurant.			"

												Salt and Sanctuary is practically Dark Souls and Bloodborne mixed together and then put into a 2D game. The game is a lot of fun, but it can also be quite frustrating. The controls are slightly weird and it can take a little bit of time to get used to them, but they are responsive. The graphics in the game are great. There are sanctuaries in the game, which act the same as bonfires in Dark Souls. Also, the salt that is in the title for the game is also supposed to represent the player's mood while playing the game. Sorry this isn't the greatest review. I'm literally struggling to stay awake to write this. Also, I'm sorry for any grammar errors.For a better look at my opinions on the game, check out my video on the game:

												This game is absoulutely amazing. I've become relatively new to the Souls series, and after playing a good fair of dark souls 3 and absoulutely loving it, I went on and bought dark souls 1 and 2. I now beat Dark Souls 1 and am continuing on to dark souls 2, but there's something I noticed in dark souls 1 and 2 that is somewhat lacking. Dark souls 3 is fast paced. I began to look for another game thats fast and is like the souls series, and i found this game. This game is absoulutely amazing and is deserving of a ""good souls clone-ish"" title. You'll hear it a lot that people will call this game a soulsborne clone, which it is, but not in a bad way. Its very obvious that it took a large insperation from dark souls, the sanctuary's are like bonfires or the firelink shrine, the bosses and roll mechanic, the block and parry mechanic, lots are dark souls mechanics. now before you take this as a sin, please note that it doesn't try to duplicate a souls feel, it makes its own. coming from an onslaught of souls games, i can safely assure you this game feels GREAT! it's combat is simple and easy to get behind, of course it will take a little bit of effort. its dificulty and exploration is much the same as souls, but in its own 2d feel. In fact i'd much more compare this game to a castlevania meets dark souls vibe, as that how it plays, and this game is the glue that makes it work. Very much worth a buy.			"

												I have not played a 2D action game in a long time and Salt makes me think I have been missing out.Great game with fun mechanics and good amount varied weapons and spells.Aesthetically and atmospherically similar to a Souls game, but that's where I feel the comparison ends.Only gripe I have is that default controller scheme annoys me, but it can be changed so... just do it.My first impression and gameplay if you want to see some.

												Im about 3/4 through my first play-through and I am loving it. The best way i can describe gameplay would be its like a perfect mix of Castlevania and Dark Souls. It copy and pastes alot of the mechanics from Dark Souls like parrying, rolling Iframes and estus flasks but it does so to a fantastic quality. Combat is fluid and satisfying. Difficulty curve is what you could expect from any souls games BUT with less anti-fun-insta-death mechanics. This game doesnt hold your hand at all, it gives no explanation to alot of the indepth mechanics of creeds, however the community has got a great wiki that is there to help. Only downsides i could mention is that it does not have cloud storage, creeds could do with being a bit more straightforward, and unfortunatly there are some weapon builds that just straight up suck. Daggers are just bad, even the highest level ones with loads of investment. Do your research before you invest since there is no way to reset your skills.4/5			"

												This game gets compared a lot to Dark Souls, and not without reason, but it definitely doesn't feel like some cheap rip-off. It has a beautifully macabre atmosphere and mysterious mythos, and the animations feel very lively. It does a very good job of capturing the essence of what makes the Dark Souls franchise appealing, a learning curve so vast it seems insurmountable until you start to climb it, and applies it to 2D action platforming to considerable success. If you like RPGs, and especially if you like Dark Souls, and you're looking for something that demands more care and persistence than the stereotypical brainless AAA fare, you will almost definitely love this game.

												~2 Hour Review:You only stop playing when you rage quit, and you only go back to prove you aren't a ♥♥♥♥♥ that rage quits!You better put on hemroid cream now, because your♥♥♥♥♥is going to get destroyed!~25 Hour Review:This is truly a mixed bag of Salt, while it is clearly worth recommendation it isn't without flaws that people should consider. Game difficulty isn't dictated by mechanics but instead opting for number inflation. Instead of new traps, tricks, and pitfalls to be concerned, with your only worry is just how hard something is going to hit and in which basic form it comes.   To the game's credit the monster design, visually, is amazing! However, there is a distinct lack of actual combat variation going on. Combat becomes very repetitive with the same mechanics applied really no matter the encounter. Further compounding the issue of combat being stale is the lack of equipment and items in the game. There is a very limited list of weapon subtypes and a just as limited  number within each of those groups. Individual weapons fail to really feeling unique amongst the peers either. Almost as slim as the weapons is the ""story"" behind the game. Very interesting individual elements, but nothing is really fleshed out and you are just left with small bits of each character.In terms of character creation there are options but the game is clearly balanced to favor two very specific character types. Either a ranged high damage mage or a brick wall knight/paladin, both builds giving you the ability to simply avoid or negate damage.  It just feels as though the game ran out of funding and had to be wrapped much sooner than the ideas behind it would want. The items, the story, the balance all feels shorted. The basis of what Salt and Sanctuary is approaches the quality of Castlevania: Symphony of The Night. It just feels as though its development was cut short and overall the game suffered. Hopefully we get a Salt and Sanctuary sequel that takes what we have to a new level of refinement and expanse.			"

Some of the sticks are metal, some have three prongs, some are a series of very thin sticks wrapped tightly together to form rope, and some are lanched through the air via explosions.			"

												THIS IS A MODERATELY POSITIVE REVIEW. Like other reviewers, I find the game's artwork and (mostly) responsive gameplay to be pretty great. In terms of value and attention to aethetic details, it's pretty amazing. However, a few major things bring down the experience, and prevent it from being the perfect game you're looking for:--1) If you're a keyboard user, you'll find that no effort was made to effectively port the game over. Menus and interface are all designed (and visually remain) for controllers. It's always annoying.2) The RPG elements are lazy. At first this doesn't seem the case, but over time you realize you won't be unlocking any skills or new abilities through the skill tree. It's an RPG facade, the picking classes, the leveing up, which makes the game feel a little incomplete.3) The writing is awkward. Some of it's supposed to be awkward, but from the very first line, you get these weird things, ill-used contractions, improper capitalizations, odd word choices, in ways that seem like non-native errors than artistic decisions. (When you start the game, it reads ""Please don't turn off your whole entire computer when this icon is showing."" Hm.) Since this is not a text heavy game, it doesn't really matter beyond making you feel that you're not playing a fully polished game.--I've never played Dark Souls or Castlevania, but it was fun just coming in and playing around.Also, an annoying bug where I can't hire the mercenary in the sanctuaries. None of the menus work with a keyboard the way they're supposed to, grr.			"

												Salt and Sanctuary is a 2D metroidvania with some of the elements from Dark Souls thrown in. My opinion is that the game is more of the former than the latter.The game makes you choose a class and a gift before it throws you into an open world where you can go in which direction you want to get your face crushed in any way you want it to. The combat is satisfying, but it takes a while getting used to, being somewhere inbetween soulsgames' stamina-directed combat and metroidvania games' platforming combat.The bosses are fun, figuring them out and then figuring out how to kill them without them killing you has not felt this good for me since Dark Souls:PTDE. The bosses fight you fair, no undodgeable instakill strike or wombo combo that is super hard to dodge. Usually it is your lack of healing or a dumb mistake on your parts that kills you, like not keeping distance properly or not keeping track of the boss' tells. Almost every time I fought a boss, I knew how to improve when I had failed.Moving on to your character, when you level up you gain skillpoints. The tree in which you put them is very confusing at first, but through experimentation and a good dose of trial and error can one persevere. Mminmaxing, however, is not required. The game is forgiving with skillpoints and resets if you just want to try something out. My tip though, pick one or two weaponclasses and one armourtype and stick with them.The story and lore is convoluted, hidden, in your face, then convoluted some more. Just like in Dark Souls.Do I recommend this? Certainly. This is a good starting point to get into Metroidvania games or Dark Souls games. Even veterans of either series should check this game out.

												Just as much of an homage to Symphony of the Night as it is to the Dark Souls games, this action rpg platformer features solid level design, frustrating bosses that feel great to dominate, and fluid character leveling.  There is a decent variety of weapons, spells, and items to aid your quest, and a good variety of horrific monstrosities and environmental challenges to impede your progress.My only problems were minor, and included the very strange character designs that somewhat clashed with the more realistically designed environments.  Also, being a 2d game, the bosses can sometimes corner you against a wall, all but assuring the player's defeat.  Co-Op, while fun, feels tacked on and makes many boss fights trivial.  Also it's very easy to become very powerful, and while the power trip feels good it renders parts of the game very easy.Sometimes there were minor bugs, involving enemies with grappling attacks warping me beneath the map.All that being said, fans of action RPG's, action platformers, and IGAvania games should definitely look into this game.  It's length is short, but the fun combat, vast character leveling, and NPC questlines give it great replay value.			"

												Dark Souls and the attention Lobos Jr. gave the game brought me here and it didn't disappoint. For a game in 2 dimensions it has a surprising amount of depth. Yes getting knocked off platforms a lot is annoying but there is no problem in the game that can't be solved by just getting good, and that's what I loved about the Souls series. It is a real challenge. Some bosses are incredibly hard and took me way more tries than most of the bosses in Dark Souls. In addition the game adds new mechanics at a steady rate that keeps the game interesting and fun. Not to mention it is very replayable and you can cater your character to the style and role you want them to be. Knight? Yes. Hunter? Yes. Wizard? Yes. Assassin? Yes, Ninja? yes. Chef? Still yes.I definitely recommend this to anyone who loves a challenge.			"

												A friend of mine gifted this gem to me, and I am very glad he did.Now, I will say: This game is brutal. Very brutal.I will also say that there are people out there that will sit there and try to claim that the game's actually easy.Whatever, okay? I'm a diehard Dark Souls fan, and despite a gameplay time of over 2000 hours accumulated on all three games, I still had a lot of trouble getting through a good chunk of this game.The bosses are memorable save for a few, the environments are just as tricky to traverse as the bosses are to fight. There is very little online interaction, instead you simply get messages from other players online and have to rely on the friend next to you on your couch for help. There will be some things (like the Witch of the Lake) that actually really are utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and unfair, but honestly...it's up to you to adapt and conquer that. This game has a very steep learning curve, and you will likely hate it at first. I know I did. I hated the absolute ♥♥♥♥ out of this game when I first tried it. Over time, as I got better and was more comfortable wih how things worked, I began to like it more and more.If you do try it, I'd say at least make sure to not compare it to Dark Souls left and right (because it's nothing like Dark Souls, if we're being honest), and to be easy on yourself when you fail.

												~2 Hour Review:You only stop playing when you rage quit, and you only go back to prove you aren't a ♥♥♥♥♥ that rage quits!You better put on hemroid cream now, because your♥♥♥♥♥is going to get destroyed!~25 Hour Review:This is truly a mixed bag of Salt, while it is clearly worth recommendation it isn't without flaws that people should consider. Game difficulty isn't dictated by mechanics but instead opting for number inflation. Instead of new traps, tricks, and pitfalls to be concerned, with your only worry is just how hard something is going to hit and in which basic form it comes.   To the game's credit the monster design, visually, is amazing! However, there is a distinct lack of actual combat variation going on. Combat becomes very repetitive with the same mechanics applied really no matter the encounter. Further compounding the issue of combat being stale is the lack of equipment and items in the game. There is a very limited list of weapon subtypes and a just as limited  number within each of those groups. Individual weapons fail to really feeling unique amongst the peers either. Almost as slim as the weapons is the ""story"" behind the game. Very interesting individual elements, but nothing is really fleshed out and you are just left with small bits of each character.In terms of character creation there are options but the game is clearly balanced to favor two very specific character types. Either a ranged high damage mage or a brick wall knight/paladin, both builds giving you the ability to simply avoid or negate damage.  It just feels as though the game ran out of funding and had to be wrapped much sooner than the ideas behind it would want. The items, the story, the balance all feels shorted. The basis of what Salt and Sanctuary is approaches the quality of Castlevania: Symphony of The Night. It just feels as though its development was cut short and overall the game suffered. Hopefully we get a Salt and Sanctuary sequel that takes what we have to a new level of refinement and expanse.			"

Product received for free
												A friend of mine gifted this gem to me, and I am very glad he did.Now, I will say: This game is brutal. Very brutal.I will also say that there are people out there that will sit there and try to claim that the game's actually easy.Whatever, okay? I'm a diehard Dark Souls fan, and despite a gameplay time of over 2000 hours accumulated on all three games, I still had a lot of trouble getting through a good chunk of this game.The bosses are memorable save for a few, the environments are just as tricky to traverse as the bosses are to fight. There is very little online interaction, instead you simply get messages from other players online and have to rely on the friend next to you on your couch for help. There will be some things (like the Witch of the Lake) that actually really are utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and unfair, but honestly...it's up to you to adapt and conquer that. This game has a very steep learning curve, and you will likely hate it at first. I know I did. I hated the absolute ♥♥♥♥ out of this game when I first tried it. Over time, as I got better and was more comfortable wih how things worked, I began to like it more and more.If you do try it, I'd say at least make sure to not compare it to Dark Souls left and right (because it's nothing like Dark Souls, if we're being honest), and to be easy on yourself when you fail.

												If you came for a 2d dark souls clone, you came to the right place. Salt & sanctuary has solid combat mechanics with the useual  build possibilitys (magic, dex, strength) has great aspects from the metroidvaina, and platforming genres. But the boss's are less  than memerable. Boss's range from stupidly annoying to blaitenly easy (if you don't have the right skills and equipment) with maybe two or three at most you'll enjoy fighting instead of checking off the list of boss's to kill. overall It's a good game, but i'd say get it at a steam sale unless you really want to play/buy it.

												This game is incredibly fun.  I never played Dark Souls, but my understanding is that it's DS-like in a 2D metroidvania style format.  The game is everything you want in a game like this.  Challenging, but not overly so.  Beautiful.  Deep.  Fun.  Tons of replay value.ProsAmazing art styleVery fun combatTons of replayabilityLots of options for different character builds and weapon/armor/magic typesGreat level/area designGame is a challenge, requiring you to really think about your strategies for every bossAMAZING soundtrack - especially the final boss fight (gave me goosebumps)Cheap - the pricetag on this game is very cheap for how much replayability you get and how fun the game isConsSome builds aren't as effective as others - but honestly i think that's intentional for people to be able to challenge themselvesSome people complain about the RNG - but in my experience, the times I was crying about RNG were times that I wasn't properly prepared for what I was fighting (like stat resistances to enemy damage, that sort of thing)Honestly, I only added the cons because I couldn't really find any.  Those 2 cons I listed aren't really negatives to me, but might be to some people.Anyway, if you like games like this, this is a must purchase.			"

												I'm a big fan of the Souls games, so have been keen to check this out for a while. It certainly lives up to its reputation as a 2D Souls-like; in fact, 80% of the time it feels like a complete cloning of those games. I don't have a problem with that. I actually welcome it.Where Salt and Sanctuary has really fallen apart for me is in those Soul-like moments when the game's systems don't allow for the limitations of 2D space. The bosses I've faced are all in small arenas and, of course, they only move left and right. Therefore, your only real choices are to roll, and hope the hitboxes don't mess up (which they frequently seem to do), or use a shield. The problem with the latter is a lot of enemies hit so quickly that your stamina is drained almost instantaneously, making it an unviable option against bosses like the Queen of Smiles who often stops at the edge of the screen, meaning you have to throw yourself into the way of an attack just to continue the fight.Tracking on enemy ranged attacks is overpowered, meaning that you'll often roll through attacks, only for an enemy to throw an axe or explosive bottle backwards to hit you. This is a real problem in a 2D environment.I've died a lot in this game. I expect it. I love the challenge. But a lot of the time I don't feel like it was my fault, and that's a problem. I know most people will argue me on this point - when I started looking into these issues, most people who raised them received little in the way of response beyond 'get gud' - but I thought it important enough to mention.I love the approach the developers have taken, but the execution has too many holes for me to recommend Salt and Sanctuary.

												just to start i dont usually play platformers. ill start with the problems i had with this game, first biggest complaint is that many enemies have grapple attacks and if you get caught while fighting two or more you can enter an infinite loop of being grappled to death. to follow that up enemies often just appear which means that at any point blowing the last of your stamina to finish the group might end up getting you kileld because now you have no stamina and theres new enemies around you. next im going to mention the bosses, they are either complete pushovers or they kill you with a single attack making any amount of healing useless (such as a homing shotgun or just knocking you off an edge). lastly i felt that armor just weighed too much, i only used heavy armor and a greatsword and i have to invest 55 levels into weight (it wasnt even the heaviest set!). now for the good, i think the level up system was intuitive, the fact that you decided which venders were in your sacntuary, the fact that health potion upgrades were something you leveled into rather than found. going back to my first point i would personally not recomend it if you arnt a big platformer person like myself. for me i would give this game a 5. it was described as a dark souls like platformer, which it is, but it misses the fairness of the dark souls games (i.e. when you die in a souls game you know what you did wrong, but in this you just get frustrated because you are dying to things that just seem a bit like rng to avoid).

												Good game with an ugly porting.Sometimes you can't click the icons, so you have to wait until it works again, or you have to click many many times, and it isn't even a solution that works for granted. This occurs when you are buying items or talking to NPCs (Trinket for example), and is so annoying, it's so clear that this version of the game wasn't tested enough. You can use arrow keys to get rid of this problem, but sometimes it doesn't work either, so the better solution i've found is to point at the icon and then press space; seriosuly, what's wrong with these icons?Also, the game's indications are wrong, a bad porting again, if you have to buy an item, the game will say to press B (X box key) in order to confirm, while you have to press space on PC. Even if these are minor inconvenients, they makes clear that the developers didn't pay much attention to the adaptation of this product.The game is good and I like its style, but it's annoying to spend 5 minutes in order to purchase an item, just because the program doesn't recognize that i am clicking an icon. I hope they will resolve this.I'm downvoting the game, because even if i'm enjoying it, some problems have to be solved.			"

												I want to like the game, but I just can't. I keep trying to, but I can't. its not a bad game but its a platformer that tries to take its roots in dark souls. that just doesnt work, there are too many things that are specific to a game like dark souls that dont work in a platformer. you get caught on enemies way too often and lose part of your max health because you cant roll through an attack if an enemy is closer than your roll distance. oh, that scumbag cleric pickpocket, patches was right clerics are♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.. tiny boss areas was a huge complaint in the souls series, every time a boss arena was too small people complained, cough cough dark souls 2 cough cough but tight boss areas is a part of platformers.... what makes dark souls hard definitely makes salt and sanctuary hard, but what made dark souls fair just doesnt work as well in a platformer.

			Views: 98		

			You can get the game from Steam here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/283640 Massive Thanks to the Developers and Publishers for the Steam review copy!		

If Dark Souls had a little 2D brother... this would be it!Game Details:A doomed sailor is shipwrecked on an uncharted island. In fog-shrouded valleys, where grinning, mossy corpses cling to rusted arms, shambling figures begin to stir. Beneath crumbling, salt-worn structures, labyrinthine passageways lead to unspeakable evil, long forgotten by man.Salt and Sanctuary seamlessly combines fast, brutal, and complex 2D combat with richly developed RPG mechanics. Discover, craft, and upgrade over 600 weapons, armor pieces, spells, and items as you explore a cursed realm of forgotten cities, blood-soaked dungeons, desecrated monuments, and the fallen lords they once celebrated.From Ska Studios, the award-winning indie studio behind a long list of stylistic, visceral, and brutally executed action titles that includes The Dishwasher: Vampire Smile, The Dishwasher: Dead Samurai, and Charlie Murder, comes Salt and Sanctuary, the studio’s most ambitious title to date.Recommended?Yes!

												What I didn't like is that my previous save got deleted in the process of finishing my first run so I couldn't go back and explore after finishing the game.Then I started NG+ only to find that I had lost all my abilities.Not a happy camper.First game I guess I screwed up all of the questlines by missing a key bit of dialogue or doing things out of order. I also completely missed one of the abilities that unlocks new areas.In the achievements the most rare ones are the questlines (even rarer than the first boss on the ship!), so for SKA's next game it would be a good idea for NPCs not to disappear if you haven't talked to them if you do things in your own order (would also solve times where people can miss key abilities like air dash), as the game is clearly designed to be done in any order with multiple areas which link together, branching paths, optional areas, etc.Also, because they've gone to the trouble of having different resists etc, when you take arcane damage it should show as arcane damage. Same as when you deal damage - the magic portion should be a different colour to signify the different elements - that way you can at least learn on your own instead of having to read the wiki for EVERY boss.Overall, I enjoyed the game. The art is bad but the theme and atmosphere are top notch and overall it works even if a lot of areas look similar and there is NO MAP :steamfacepalm:The controls are quite unresponsive which can be frustrating but I understand that this is the way the game is designed to punish you for bad decisions.Overall I enjoyed it and highly recommend it. It's designed to be frustrating so it definitely achieves it's goal.			"

												TL;DR:  Bought the game, played 10 hours straight because it was that good. Looking forward to play more. Great game. Challenging beat 'em up platformer RPG. An excellent 2D game inspired by the Souls and Castlevania series as many mentioned already.Melee is fun and viceral, magic melts faces and is satisfying once you get used to the aiming system, and I didn't try archery yet so I can't say anything about it.As the game progresses, some abilities are unlocked that are used to access areas which weren't accessible beforehand.Dodging isn't as bad as some people say, it is just different than what we're used to from Souls game, especially about timing and ""pushing then dodge"" mechanic.Music has a lot of electric guitar in it, so this can be a plus if you like that.Atmosphere is gloomy which fits game's theme well.Difficulty is overall well balanced in my opinion, as challenge seemed to steadily increase with gameplay experience, making areas and bosses feel evenly difficult (actual difficulty vs perception of it).Weapon ranges can be visually tricky at times since they hit farther than the tip of the weapon. Range is actually determined by the ""slash"" visual effect rather than weapon's length itself. Just need to gauge distance accordingly.No voice acting. That would have been a nice additional touch, but considering Ska Studios' size, it is understandable.  In the other hand, might as well have none at all than having laughable voice acting some triple-A developpers dare to feed us with.Price tag is very reasonable for the game's high quality.Overall, a nice game that is worth buying. Should appeal to people who were craving for a new Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, and/or fans of Souls series that also like platformers like Metroid/Castlevania.			"

												You like Dark Souls? You like metroidvanias? Then you'll like Salt and Sanctuary.The game is basically Dark Souls in 2D. I know a lot of games are compared to Dark Souls without reasons nowadays but this one takes a lot (by that I mean A LOT!) of ideas from DS (which isn't a bad thing since souls games are very good games).Pros:- Gorgeous atmosphere and artstyle- Nice music- Rewards exploration- Huge skill tree like in Path of Exile- You can build your character as you like. Starting with a mage doesn't mean you'll never wear heavy armors nor shoot any crossbow.- Works really well with kb/m- The game is challenging and forces you to take care of your suroundings (lots of traps, which you can use at your advantage!, damn slimes that hides into the trees to fall on you,...)- Quite open with some variations in the level (like the forest where you have to carefully jump from tree to tree to avoid falling to your death)The gameplay is very satisfying too. You have one normal attack, one heavy attack + a falling attack when you use heavy attack while jumping. You can switch between two loadouts (I'm a mage so I have my weapon + my magic wand on one, and a shield instead of the wand on the other), you can roll, block and jump.Cons (I didn't find real issues for the moment so all of these are nitpicky):- The mouse cursor isn't locked to the game window (I use DualMonitorTools to fix that)- By default, aiming is super weird (I think it is a bug?) when you play with kb and mouse. It's fine once you enable the mouse cursor in the game options (then you aim with the mouse)- Some popups here and there on mouse over would be great (on the icons at the bottom left of the screen, on items you chose when you create your character and when you complete a ""work"" for a leader,...)- Some bosses come where/when you don't expect a boss, it's great for the element of suprise but it makes you lose all your salt (basically xp)All in all, I really like it so far. I think I didn't enjoyed a metroidvania so much since Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow on GBA.			"

The chef class is a literal meme in its entirety. Weapons.. Now weapons my boy... I succeeded quite well with a tier 0 spear for quite awhile just solely on the factor that its strongattack shred through literal everything.

												Buy this game as soon as you can, it's difficult, it's a 2D Souls-clone, it's got a beautifully dark world, and it hates you.There are also differences between this and Souls. An obvious example is that it uses salt as your experience rather than souls. There's also that it uses gold as its currency whereas salt is purely for leveling up.Rather than using salt to increase your stats like souls in Dark Souls, you use it to increase your level which allows you to gain Black Pearls, which you spend on skills.

												这个游戏是朋友介绍的。在玩到第一个避难所放下烛台之后的下跪升级，加点，让我第一个联想到了黑魂。后来看到介绍说开发者借鉴了黑魂。这游戏还是很赞的。和黑魂一样，一定要和小怪正义的单挑，否则前后夹击很快就gg了。boss战感觉不错，由于刚入手才打完第一关boss就不多做评价。对于这款游戏还是推荐入手的。机器配置入门级的可以那这个游戏过一把抖m之魂的瘾。好了，不多说了，我要去玩屁股了。			"

												TL;DR:  Bought the game, played 10 hours straight because it was that good. Looking forward to play more. Great game. Challenging beat 'em up platformer RPG. An excellent 2D game inspired by the Souls and Castlevania series as many mentioned already.Melee is fun and viceral, magic melts faces and is satisfying once you get used to the aiming system, and I didn't try archery yet so I can't say anything about it.As the game progresses, some abilities are unlocked that are used to access areas which weren't accessible beforehand.Dodging isn't as bad as some people say, it is just different than what we're used to from Souls game, especially about timing and ""pushing then dodge"" mechanic.Music has a lot of electric guitar in it, so this can be a plus if you like that.Atmosphere is gloomy which fits game's theme well.Difficulty is overall well balanced in my opinion, as challenge seemed to steadily increase with gameplay experience, making areas and bosses feel evenly difficult (actual difficulty vs perception of it).Weapon ranges can be visually tricky at times since they hit farther than the tip of the weapon. Range is actually determined by the ""slash"" visual effect rather than weapon's length itself. Just need to gauge distance accordingly.No voice acting. That would have been a nice additional touch, but considering Ska Studios' size, it is understandable.  In the other hand, might as well have none at all than having laughable voice acting some triple-A developpers dare to feed us with.Price tag is very reasonable for the game's high quality.Overall, a nice game that is worth buying. Should appeal to people who were craving for a new Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, and/or fans of Souls series that also like platformers like Metroid/Castlevania.			"

												Go buy this game now.If you are a Dark/Demon Souls fan - just stop reading and go buy this game now.If you haven't been into the Souls series - just go buy it anyways, but I will go a bit further to help you out.This feels like it was done by From Software, but you're actually getting Ska Studios - the married couple behind the excellent Dishwasher games and the Xbox Live Arcade featured Charlie Murder... but from the unique art style of all their games you would likely know that by one glance of Salt & Sanctuary.From the menu screen to the fonts chosen to the systems used in the game, this is Dark Souls down to a tee - and it was done properly by people who clearly not only loved the games but also understood why they were fun. Making the translation over to a 2D side-scroller isn't all that easy of a thing to do when you're talking about a style of game that is replete with depth and complexity but from what I've played so far, Salt & Sanctuary covers all of those bases while still being challenging and fresh in its own right.I implore anyone on the fence about it to make the dive and step in - I played this to death co-op with a friend on his PS4 and I've been dying with anticipation for the PC version to come out and I wasn't even aware that it was going to be today!

												It's a formulaic 2D clone of Dark Souls, but with the Ska studios graphical style. I've had more fun with it so far, then I had going through the entirety of DS3. The fighting is smooth, responsive and rewarding. It's tough, but only rarely cheap IMO. Once you figure out patterns of difficult enemies you get a lot of really cool back and forth melee action.I love most of the metroidvania style games I've played and the entire Souls trilogy. This is the perfect combination of both, delivered by a studio with strong experience in 2D action platformers.Honestly, best game I've played in years. 10.			"

												If you like the Dark Souls series, you'll love this game, it is tricky, forces you to carefully learn the enemies and bosses movesets and punishes you hard if you get too greedy. Great combat mechanics, dark atmosphere and a high replayability due to the many different available upgrade paths. I would recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a challenging but rewarding game. I am still in the early phase of the game but so far it looks and feels very promising.I had been waiting for this game for a while and I was not disappointed, I will definitely be looking out for more games on steam by these developers in the future.10/10, a great game for a great price.

Posted: May 22, 2016
												Salt and Sanctuary is an interesting game that I first saw thanks to Vaati who declared it ""Souls-like.""  As such, comparisons to Dark Souls are...kind of a given.  It's a different beast, in both good ways and bad, from Dark Souls, so let's break this game down.  It's not perfect, but has enough charm to keep you engaged for a decent amount of time.Visually, the game's characters are a bit odd, as they have an almost leathery, sackboy like skinset, but other than that, the visuals are striking.  A bit watered down at times, but with lots of detail and grim, haunting environemnts that are just as creepy as they are cool, like a village of dead people with smiles carved into their faces, corpses in a pumpkin patch which try to eat you, and an entire dungeon of creepiness.  The combat feels tough and meaty and there's a lot of blood, the best part of it being the weight each blow seems to have.  It feels like you're really slamming a hammer or a whip into an enemy when it makes contact.  You can reclaim your exp, called Salt here, if you die by killing your killer, which is cool, or by killing a bird if you didn't die to an enemy.  There are clever traps and wicked monsters, all well designed and creepy looking.Now, unfortunately, this game isn't perfect.  The music is...pretty lackluster.  It's not going a lot of the time, but occasionally breaks into a guitar riff and...doesn't feel ambient or appropriate.  It's also gonna get old quick because you are gonna hear it a lot.  The story is pretty nonexistant apart from a setup.  There are some interesting side stories and you meet some cool NPCs, but apart from a feeling of something sinister guiding you through the island, there isn't much story and the world building feels poor compared to Dark Souls.  We don't get much of a feel for other countries or nations outside the island we're on in the same way as we did for Dark Souls.  This game focuses a lot more on platforming as well, which is both good and bad.  Good in that it provides something different and interesting for getting around.  Bad in that you will die to gravity a hundred times more than you will to enemies.  This also brings up another point...any enemy your size or great can punt you off the edge of a cliff with ease and there are A LOT of cliffs in this game.  You are going to die a lot in unfair ways as guys swing at you and just throw you into an abyss.  Finally, some enemies are just unfair.  I know this sounds like a cop out, but there are two major problems with enemy design.  The first is stun.  It's easy as all hell to stunlock in this game.  For both you and enemies.  Get sandwiched and you are toast as your health drops to zero almost immediately, with you unable to swing your sword or raise your shield.  Conversely, it's easy to just totally prevent an enemy from hitting you if you are fast enough.  It's a trade off.  Worse though is that some enemies will screw you with unfair abilities.  That stunlock got me killed when an AOE did 1000 points of minor damage over like 10 seconds, but since I was stunned, I couldn't escape.  I also found a troupe of skeletons in a cave.  THey are able to teleport and hide from you.  This means they can teleport away from your swings and gang up on you with you unable to counter attack.  There are a fair number of problems with enemy designs.Salt and Sanctuary feels a bit less...polished than Dark Souls.  It's a good game and it has a lot of fun moments.  The design of the world is striking and the combat feels satisfying when the enemies don't BS you.  It's worth a try because the combat is addictive.  However, bear in mind there will be frustrations.			"

												I recommend this, not only as a fan of Dark Souls, but as a fan of Castlevania and Metroid. The 2D combat, while sometimes wonky with things like spears, is in depth and satisfying, and has a somewhat character action (Bayonetta, Devil May Cry) style to it, with the way you have crowd control combos. The map properly branches out many times over the story so far. My absolute *favorite* part of this game, is it's similarity to MetroidVania games, where not only do you level up for abilities, but you find additional abilites to explore more of the map or progress further in the game. I love it all, despite a little strangeness.			"

The fighting is smooth, responsive and rewarding. It's tough, but only rarely cheap IMO. Once you figure out patterns of difficult enemies you get a lot of really cool back and forth melee action.I love most of the metroidvania style games I've played and the entire Souls trilogy. This is the perfect combination of both, delivered by a studio with strong experience in 2D action platformers.Honestly, best game I've played in years. 10.			"

												Unreal!  I love the Demon Souls and Dark Souls games (+Bloodbourne)  and this is a game that just pays homage to From Software!  It isn't as hard as the Souls games but it is still very difficult.  If you are already used to the Souls type games then this game won't be hard to pick up at all, (or to put down for that matter).  It takes a 2d style of game play and makes it a Dark souls type game but with its own story, makeup and design.  I only have a little time vested into it but I can assure you I will be playing this for a while.  For the Price it is very worth it.  It plays like Dark souls (but 2d)  and is just as fun as the whole franchise.  Don't just take my word for it, read the other reviews!   The music fits the game and is really awesome in my opionion.  The play control is just right and (just as in the souls series) time and learn the movement of everything.  Jamming on buttons won't help.  YES, There are ""fat"" rolls if you are too heavy.  All in all, this game is worth buying if you loved the souls series.  This will scratch that itch for that type of game.  :)			"

												Salt & Sanctuary is a great game and a lot of its design decisions and mechanics should be appreciated beyond the common ""2D Dark Souls (done well)"" summary. It managed to cleave two overhyped indie game descriptors (metroidvania + soulslike) with a self confidence almost unheard of on the internet. This game is not sarcastic and it is not overly self-serious. It is a real gem is what it is and I'm real happy it's available on PC.			"

												If you're looking for an alternative to Dark Souls. You came to the right place. Salt and Sanctuary is a great example of how you can make a 2D Game souls like without amping the difficulty past what Dark Souls would make its players go at. I recommend this game to anyone who is longing for more Dark Souls after the two Dlc or as a way to tied your thirst as we wait for the upcoming and last dlcs. Once Salt and Sanctuary eventually decides to add Online Co-op. I will revisit this game. On Ps4 and on Pc(I own it on both platforms cause I enjoyed the game so much and wanted to record a playthrough on it without having to get a capture card.)			"

												Pretty sweet sidescrolling action/platforming RPG. Hack, slash, cast, level up, customize build, and explore mostly freely. Like 2D dark souls. It's difficult at times, but messages left by other players are there to help at key points along the way. A game with great atmosphere, good artwork and music, decent gameplay, and no real downsides. Overall, pretty good.Directions can get sketchy sometimes if you're easily disoriented or checking out a new area for the first time without realizing that it borders another previously explored area. Still, the map is pretty well laid out, and even without using fast transport, walking from anywhere to anywhere else isn't too punishing.I wish there was a respec option. Even with a penalty, being able to try new builds without starting a wholly different character would be very much appreciated. Still, the flexibility of the tree is nice - reminiscent of FFX's sphere grid. The little bits of lore on each node are nice too, for those who enjoy that kind of thing.A word of caution: some NPCs give quests that cannot be continued if the NPC isn't found and chat options exhausted before fighting the area boss. This can also happen in some rare cases where bosses may be fought out of ""order."" Just check the wiki perhaps, if completion in this manner is important. Winning the game and building properly are not dependent upon it though, so it's more a matter of collecting all the acheivements, lore, and crafting mats.			"

												Fun 2D Dark Souls-esque game with a tech tree to customize your character in a myriad of ways. It was a bit of a slow start for my chosen playstyle due to lack of weapons but once I got a giant axe and hammer I loved crushing things into the dust.The combat can be tough but fair though once properly equipped it may be on the easy side. There are blocks, parries and rolls (and fat rolls when you wear too much heavy equipment) to keep you alive though the enemies can also react quickly to make up for only being in two dimensions. The bosses were suitably epic and could be quite challenging if you were not prepared--only one I really call BS on due to a number of OHK at its disposal. The scraps of lore and story are intriguing and a nice motivator though hardly necessary to follow. The settings are interesting and varied and the art style can be a bit ugly but it's still very charming. The music is nice and gritty to get you in the mood for exploring this wretched land. The areas rarely outstay their welcome and you can make a good bit of progress in short bursts.My only complaint is the platforming controls could be a little tighter--that or I'm just bad at platforming, which is true. Trying to grab on ledges to climb up could be an exercise in frustration at times.The game could be a bit obtuse about some mechanics. I do recommend just opening up the wiki pages when in doubt.It clocked in at ~17 hours and I had not completed all the optional dungeons. If you're looking for something to scratch that Dark Souls itch I'd definitely check it out.			"

												Overall Salt Sanctuary is a 2d version of dark souls in the way that the game throws you into an unforgiving world steeped in mystery with many armor sets, weapons, and spells to collect; yet filled even more with ruthless bosses making every move to hinder your progress. The game features a few innovations over the Dark Souls formula. The Sanctuaries which basically work as the Bonfire of the game allow you to recruit different npcs that can give you special traits and the ability to purchase items. Another big difference the game prides in having from the Souls series is that Salt and Sanctuary has a very compelling skill tree that allows your character to progress in various skills. All in all I think anyone who wants to get their♥♥♥♥♥handed to them just like Dark souls in a world that is shrouded in mystery with ingenious lore should pick this title up!			"

												It is a 2D Dark Souls like, it is heavily heavily inspired by the Souls mechanics to the point that a handful of people are basicly going around with the whole ""Doom clone"" type of issue where because there has not really been a defined genre for Souls mechanics games its just a new subgenre that doesn't have a name yet much like how all FPS games where called Doom clones until they finily understood it was a new genre and finally gave the genre a name of FPS.While people cry clone, its no different then ""Doom Clone"" or ""Metroidvania"" or ""Rogue Like"" (which still hasn't gotten a proper genre name other then ""Rogue like""), its a new genre that people want to compare to the first game that name the genre popular.With that said it is competent at what it does, its map design is very Souls like in unlocking shortcuts and having things wrap back on themselves (even illusionary walls, each weapon type has a different feel to it, its enemies are a variation from cannon fooder to challenging but fair. It's bosses (so far, maybe further ones are not) seem challenging at first but fairly easy when you learn the bosses tells and learn how to dodge the upcoming attack, not to disimilar to a game of the same unnamed genre. As for the platforming I have personally had no issue with it only ""unfair"" deaths I have had where checking to see if there was a secret or not, but then again MetriodVanias where my go to games when I was a kid and knew there was platforming coming into the game, if you come into the game expecting purely a 2D Dark Souls then I could see not liking the platforming since Dark Souls was for the most part fairly light on platforming execpt a few zones.All in all if you read all the negitive reviews on the game you will notice only a couple of complaints ""Dark Souls rip off"" or ""Platforming unfair"", which like I said I could see coming from someone who was expecting purely a 2D Dark Souls, but if you expect platforming its not really unfair unless you don't like platformers. Or ""Bosses unfair"", which again its all about learning boss tells, some attacks you want to dodge roll away from, some attacks you want to dodge roll towards, some attacks you want to jump, I have not run into an attack you can not avoid (unless you poorly manage your stamina) but some may seem unavoidable if you don't think about rolling towards the boss to get under the attack.Who would I recomend this game to? Anyone who enjoys the Souls mechanics while at the same time enjoys platforming not to disimalar to Castlevania games of old.Is it a perfect game? No, but most the complaints are highly subjective or just not taking the time to try different ways to avoid attacks. I know I have beat the Queen of Smiles a few times, know that you can do the fight without taking damage but I just suck at the fight so just put her weakness on my weapon and kill her more quickly becuase I keep screwing up dodging toward her on attacks or the timing of it. Then again I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of the ""unfair this or that"" complaints where from people who are younger then when games where designed to be quarter eaters back when unfair was the staple of all games. But I have seen no reason to believe that this game crosses the line between ""challenging"" and ""unfair"", but certain parts may be in that grey area where its hard to tell which it is.			"

												Go buy this game now.If you are a Dark/Demon Souls fan - just stop reading and go buy this game now.If you haven't been into the Souls series - just go buy it anyways, but I will go a bit further to help you out.This feels like it was done by From Software, but you're actually getting Ska Studios - the married couple behind the excellent Dishwasher games and the Xbox Live Arcade featured Charlie Murder... but from the unique art style of all their games you would likely know that by one glance of Salt & Sanctuary.From the menu screen to the fonts chosen to the systems used in the game, this is Dark Souls down to a tee - and it was done properly by people who clearly not only loved the games but also understood why they were fun. Making the translation over to a 2D side-scroller isn't all that easy of a thing to do when you're talking about a style of game that is replete with depth and complexity but from what I've played so far, Salt & Sanctuary covers all of those bases while still being challenging and fresh in its own right.I implore anyone on the fence about it to make the dive and step in - I played this to death co-op with a friend on his PS4 and I've been dying with anticipation for the PC version to come out and I wasn't even aware that it was going to be today!

												Played this game for almost 80 hours through many new game+'s. This game is my favorite side scroller, and I highly recommend it. Gameplay is like a cross between Metriod, Castlevania and Dark souls. One huge plus, this game is only 20 bucks, and well worth it! I hope they make salt and sanctuary 2 huge and new game + harder, I will easily shell out 60 bucks if they do.			"

												While abit rough around the edges, this is an exceptional game and I am glad that I gave this one a second chance. While I wholeheardetly recommend this game, it is  NOT  for everyone.  Are you easily frustrated? Do you feel uncomfortable, when you are thrown into a game without any knowledge of what is going on and why or if any of these things/items/options are important?if this applies to you, I would advise you, not to bother. The game throws you into the action and expects you to read, obvserve, learn and test stuff out for yourself. It also is crushingly difficult in some parts until you figure out what to do and not always is the challenge on the fair side. Trial and error are part of this game to a certain extent.The first few hours in particular are very unwelcoming. You stand on a shore, get asked what gods you believe in, give a random answer, ask yourself, if this was something important(it was) and embark onto your salty journey. Everything is grey, it is hard to distinguish beween monsters, traps or chairs sometimes, enemies are cluttered everywhere and you begin to ask yourself, what you are trying to accomplish with aimlessly wandering about. Because you also don't have a map. Then you level up for the first time and take a look at the skill tree. And holy mother of god, what a cluster♥♥♥♥ of skills it is. You decide to put points into random stuff. Might be useful at some point. In short, the first few hours are a confusing mess and a mental state between satisfying monster killing and mild annoyance because yo do not seem to know anything. And then you get further in. You leave the first 2 areas behind. You discover a weapon you find satisfying to use. You decide to level up you skill tree in accordance with that weapon and suddenly realize, that this abundance of perks to choose from is a really simple structure of classes and suddenly makes sense. You find a few shortcuts and slowly begin to understand, how the world is structured and how to get around it.  (you will still get lost, but you know now that whatever path you follow, it will eventually lead to someplace familiar again) You will meet a few NPCs and fragments of a story are beginning to form. There now is this sense of slow progression, the feeling, that everything is coming together bit by bit, the further you delve into the game. You are now hooked to Salt&Sanctuary.This game is surprisingly big. I's say, you need about 15-20 hours to complete it(or even more, if you are like me and love to throughoutly explore, while getting lost like an idiot repeatedly)It has a good amount and variety of weapons. It has a scissor greatsword. A second playthrough is almost a given, with all the stuff you can find and/or miss and the different builds to make. It has a greatsword that is also a scissor. also worth noting This game is an hommage to Dark Souls. It has alot of names and mechanics out of the souls series, stuff you will recognize. However, it is NOT a ""souls-like"" or anything along those lines. This is 100% a metroidvania game and a good one at that. If you try to play this the same way you play a souls game, you will have a hard time. Conclusion This game is fun, hard, full of content, really immersive and not always fair. If you are able to cope with its little flaws and oddities, you will have a gem of a game for a good price. May the Salt be in your Flavour.			"

												Looking like Dark Souls ≠ being Dark Souls.Sadly, I must confess that the game falls short of what it tries to be; a fair and manageable 2D Dark Souls. I use the word ""manageable"" because what turns this review into the negatives all has to with poor gameplay:The good:- Decent Dark Souls-like atmosphere- Nice musicThe bad:- Lack of decent i-frames- Sloppy input registration- Shoddy timing- Badly designed hitboxes- Enemies with no tells for unavoidable one-hit-kills- Non-fluid animations- No wake-up action (can't roll/block as soon as you get up)- And the list goes on, but I'm gonna stop here for brevityAll of this makes the game frustrating due to fighting the controls and bad coding more than anything resembling a fair fight. Trying to string together hits turns the combat into - dare I say it - a salty experience. Button presses not registering makes it difficult to queue hits or rolls. React 0.02 milliseconds too fast for the extremely narrow window, and your character doesn't perform the action at all. Imagine Tekken, Street Fighter, or Dark Souls forcing you to wait until the hand from the first move retracted all the way back before you could activate another action? Good luck stringing together combos.While trying to make a 2D-souls is a commendable effort, the QA was skipped in full and it shows. I'll return if the developers revamps the controls. For now, I can't bring myself to pick it up again, as the worst controls this side of NES Rygar-jumping makes it intolerable on a KarTRASHian level.			"

 PROS - Art style is pretty cool.- Sanctuary system allows you to create a base to suit your playstyle.- Skill tree is straightforward and effective. CONS - Unlike Dark Souls, which is hard but fair, this game is pretty unfair in its difficulty.- Skill tree provides no real sense of progression, as health increases with level.- Stamina bar drains in like two swings.A lot of people compare this came to Dark Souls, and it's clear why. It's extremely obvious in it's inspirations. The game incorporates a lot of ideas from Dark Souls, but implements them very poorly. In Dark Souls, dying to a boss is mostly due to lack of skill. In Salt and Sanctuary, however, I found many of the mechanics, and the enemy and boss AI to be poorly programmed. Rolling is unreliable, and blocking is clunky. There's very little indication of the stat requirements of the gear you'll find. Many of the attempts to create difficulty has resulted in things such as enemies and bosses that don't let you get up after being knocked down. I really wanted to enjoy this game a lot, and honestly I do like it, but it could have been so much better.			"

												TL;DR: A game following in Dark Souls' footsteps must have absolutely spot-on animations, timing, and enemy hitboxes. Those are sorely lacking and thus the gameplay falls apart.Overall, Salt and Sanctuary has a solid premise with amazing potential.Unfortunately, improper i-frame timing, poorly designed hitboxes, and enemies with no tells for nearly impossible-to-avoid attacks take ""difficult but fair"" into ""difficult, and also totally unfair."" Coming from Dark Souls (a fair comparison - this game's mechanics are completely a carbon copy of Dark Souls mechanics), the game was not enjoyable because the precise and fine details required for Dark Souls - namely, well-constructed enemy hitboxes, fluid animations, and proper i-frame respect - appears shoddy and sloppy, making the game frustrating due to fighting the controls and bad coding more than due to difficult enemies.I had such high hopes for this game. It seems those hopes were unjustified.			"

												Imagine Dark Souls but 2D and just a tad easier while mantaining the same level of BS. This is the basic concept of Salt and Sanctuary. Now when you think of a 2D game, you likely have horrible flashbacks of utterly cliche of ""indie"" and ""retro"" art styles with. Thankfully, this is not one of those trash titles. This has an art style of it's own that is beautiful in its own way. No pixelated garbage, solid platforming, all in all a very very solid MetroidVania type of game that will have you yelling at your monitor when you mess up just like Dark Souls. This is coming from someone who is pretty much against any kind of side scroller as I feel they are just overdone to hell by ""indie"" devs.  Gameplay is extremely fluid and feels refined, no matter if you're a heavy armor great axe wielder or a dodging dagger/bow user. If your laptop can't handle Dark Souls 1, but you want that self harm experience, go ahead and get it. Even if you can handle Dark Souls III, I'd recommend it. For those looking for a game that's like the original Castlevania games, jump on this.			"

												I love me some Dark Souls, but this game's battles come up far short. They use the same weapon for parrying as light attacks so you will often find yourself doing a useless parry when you want to get in a quick jab after blocking an attack. Also many enemies are cheap. In Dark Souls when something went wrong it was your fault, it wasn't that a giant enemy decided to do a giant attack that you cannot roll out of, dodge and groups of enemies will spam attacks with no time inbetween for you to counter.Those are my big complaints, there are other smaller issues, the lore seems dull and lazy, the art looks junky and washed out, the mechanics are unexplained (and while that's true in Dark Souls, Dark Souls made me invested enough to learn those systems instead of just giving up.)

												Bought Salt and Sanctuary. Received Death Wish Simulator 2016. 10/10 would purchase wrong game again.Seriously though, I really like this game. The framework is certainly based off of Dark Souls and you will see many similarities but I didn't buy this game because of how much I liked Dark Souls. I bought it because I loved Dishwasher 2, which first introduced me to Ska Studios.That art style and hyper violence are still here but things aren't as chaotic and over the top because of the Dark Souls influence. Ska Studios' dark art style is perfect for a series like this. I also like the dark guitar and ambient sounds that comprise the soundtrack. The combat is difficult but rewarding. You will die....a lot but for all the times that you see the word Obliterated, the few times that you see the Victory makes it all worth it. Again this game is difficult without being punishing. None of that going hollow nonsense and needing an item to restore yourself. Simply visit any Sanctuary and you're back to full health. When you die it's often in new areas or with a new boss; trying to figure things out. Once you do, you know that victory is coming in time.It's been years since a game has been addictive enough to keep me up until the wee hours of the morning but Ska Studios has managed to do so with this gem, so kudos to them.I hope this game gets a lot of support, so that Ska Studios will release more titles on PC. I would buy Dishwasher 2 on Steam in a heartbeat.			"

												I really do like the Souls-series/games and thought ""Hey, why not give this a go""...oh boy was I in for a ""salty"" surprise...The beginning of this game was pretty neat and while I personally really DISLIKE the levelup-skilltree it was still kinda okay to navigate and get the proper skills I suppose?...The simple and single reason why I dislike this game and can not recommend it for (18bucks atleast) is that its leveldesign is INCREDIBLY BAD.I have been stuck in a fair share of games already, stuck as in not knowing where to go or what to do... but this game, this game takes the cake.I have had to run around for multiple hours(4) in order to find the next boss. That aside I have apparently skipped multiple times multiple bosses.At one point I was apparently 4 bosses and 7 safepoints ahead of where I was supposed to be...Aside from that the gameplay is nice.tl:drUse a guide to find the way and get this game for 18bucksDont want to use a guide? dont get this game.

												In Salt and Sanctuary you can always find immersive and addicting gameplay experience through every enemy you encounter, every hit you blow, and every boss battle you manage to survive. It is a well-made 2D platformer that is both challenging and unforgiving, but highly rewarding. Just before you embark on this dark journey, prepared to be crushed as no one will show mercy. 10/10 just forget about the Iron Rampart			"

												Good game, more fun than DS3 it is really mind blowing how a game like this can be so much better than a Triple A game, the music and the setting is just amazing, they did a really good job connecting all the world around you with shortcuts and stuff navigating was never really a problem or over complicated.Some of the things people remember about DS series is the ""cheapness"" of some of it's areas but mostly bosses and yeah let's be honest there are many areas or bosses in DS series that are cheap as ♥♥♥♥... here in this game i can only say that the only ""cheap"" boss is the guy with the gun that shoots fire AND not even because if you wear the proper gear you can actually not be oneshoted by those (fire resistance) and this is something i LOVED about this game, if an enemy is using a type of attack that is destroying you, you wear something to reduce the damage, GEAR ♥♥♥♥ING MATTERS YAAAY!!! not like DS where most of the time was worthless specially DS3.The only thing i hated was the jumping, there was too much jumping puzzles and the most cancerious one is the Pitch Woods but whatever i mena i had to do it because i was mage and i wanted the creed to buy the equipment.Other thing that i didn't liked was the creed grind, to be honest i didn't even bothered, to get the most powerful spell i had to be like the highest level possible but the creed of Fire and whatever is too far into the game to be even eble to get drops from enemies for that creed and i was almost at the end of the game to bother to grind anything at all, i did got my most powerfull weapon for my ""class"" and i got all the best equipment for a mage build so my character was good i just missed the ""most powerful"" spell which supposedly destroys bosses even on NG+ but yeah, i don't care i mean my character was already a beast.Talking about magic i loved the balance mechanic and it made stuff really on point, one of the things i dislike about having a mana resource system is that you will SPAM always the most cost-efficient spell LIKE IN DS3 in which you end up spamming Great Heavy Soul Arrow most of the game and it's other itterations, you can't do that here unless you want to kill yourself so it serves to prevent this STUPID spam present in other games KUDOS for that thing because it made things interesting for me. And all the magics are creative and there is not just 1 ♥♥♥♥ing type of magic (proyectile) like in DS3 which most magic is a stupid homing ♥♥♥♥, nope, here magic is varied and you can use it more easily than in DS, here you can always use 3 spells at any given time, 2 that you set up in right and left clikc (if you are using a staff) and one that you can acces through your items menu and you can have many of this so it makes gameplay really varied in terms of magic.Aside from the jumping stuff i never really felt like i was being cheated by the game to lose or that the game was just trying to kill me for the lols something i hated about DS2 and 3 was the stupid ""ambushes"" omg ♥♥♥♥ing pathetic, every 3 steps something or someone was gonna ambuch and kill you out of nowhere... i mean, really?.DS series was ruined by the ""git gud"", ""DS is all about the difficulty"" community even pvp can be said that it ruined it.This game is really good and yeah i would recommend it.

Posted: July 1, 2016
												This is a rather tough review to write. This game is a frustrating one; not from it's difficulty, but from the many aspects it falls just short of. I'll do my best to explain those aspects throughout my review.As a die-hard fan of the Souls series, I thought that I'd check this game out. This game does a great job of emulating the general Dark Souls-esque gameplay to 2D. As with the Souls series, the game is difficult. This game also shares the steep-learning curve that, once mastered, can make the game less difficult or even menial in some places.The game does stray from Souls style gameplay by having an overall more agile player character. Later in the game the character picks up dashing and wall jumping, something not in Dark Souls. By having the Souls gameplay in a faster, 2D format, the game seems like a pretty good one. When delving into it, however, its flaws begin to show.The game has platforming elements. Perhaps I was misinformed, or perhaps I was unaware, but I didn't expect this much platforming. I don't mind platforming, and I fairly enjoy games such as Mario or Super Meat Boy, but the platforming in Salt and Sanctuary frustrates me more than those two games. The beginning has little platforming, but it gradually ramps up throughout the game. I appreciate the smooth curve of platforming, but unfortunately, this platforming makes heading through the levels to either getting to your salt or return to a boss frustrating. By the time you get to the Pitchwoods or Crypt of Dead Gods, the entire level seems to focus on platforming. The levels become increasingly scarce of enemies, and your biggest threat becomes falling rather than death from an enemy. A better approach to this might be to tone down the platforming in the end levels while increasing the enemy count, to make it less tedious and more exciting.Armor in the game seems to be nearly worthless. In the Murdiella Mal fight, I switched armor sets multiple times each with different resistances and weights, but no matter what set or combination I chose, the difference in damage recieved didn't seem to matter. I have tested this numerous times and it still seems to point to a minor difference in wearing armor and not wearing armor. I don't like that having no armor is clearly the best solution, rather than the game striking a balance between an armored character, and an agile character.The various parallels between Souls and Salt and Sanctuary also frustrate me. I understand the game is inspired by Dark Souls but a lot of the features in this game have a direct equivalent in the Souls universe. Sanctuaries are Bonfires, Replenishing Healing Items are Estus, Creeds are Covenants, Upgrading is the same, and the list goes on. While this game has features that make it unique, I find that these are few and far between.Some bosses have attacks that are one-hit KO's. I can handle one-hit attacks, but when the boss pins me to the wall and he's too big to roll through, I can't escape. Too often have I been almost done with a boss, only for them to throw out the OHKO move.This isn't to say the game doesn't have positive features. As I've said before, the game does an excellent job of emulating the Souls series to 2D and it does an ok job at adding some unique features into the mix. This game is slightly more forgiving than Dark Souls, but that's a personal positive. The lore is also interesting, if not scarce. The 18 hour campaign is definitely worth the price.Those are my main pros and cons of Salt and Sanctuary. I wish there was an alternative third option to the binary system on Steam because this is a game that would frustrate and♥♥♥♥♥♥off a certain audience, and pleasure another. It also has the uncanny ability to do both to me. Salt and Sanctuary is frustrating because it's a game that I can complain about all day, but I'll be playing it again anyway.			"

												So Salt Sanctuary is basically a 2D Dark Souls. What makes it a 2D Dark Souls? - You have your bonfires (Sanctuaries).- Random NPCs that have questlines/quests.- Estus Flask alike healing items.- Similar starting classes.- Different Builds (STR, DEX, etc...)- Same sort of weapons ((Ultra)Greatswords, (Ultra) Greathammers, Scythes, (Ultra) Greatshields, etc...)- Area Bosses.- Messages from other players (Bottles with letters in them).- Secret Doors. What this game doesn't have that Dark Souls does have. - Invaders (I bet you casual, 2 phantom summoning gank squad scrubs love this)- Summon signs (No random help at bosses, so git gud).- Leveling up system like Dark Souls (Skills are obtained through a Skill tree, which is a very interesting way of doing levels)- Fun bosses Ok so, bosses in Dark Souls are great...but this games' bosses are NOT fun most of the times since the 2D aspect of the game it's kinda hard to dodge if you don't want to rely on shields. Most bosses have an stupid long range and will catch you off guard, if that isn't enough at a certain point bosses start to attack faster and will give you no time to breath in between getting smashed to the ground ending in you getting killed in a very cheap manner. Or they just spam attacks and murder you. TL;DR It's Dark Souls in 2D with dissapointing boss fights.I still recommend this game since the bosses can go fk themselves since the rest of the game is SO AWESOME.			"

												If you're a fan of Dark Souls and that's what drew you to this game, you will be dissapointed. Salt and Sanctuary is not only not like Dark Souls(I have near 400 hours logged between the three titles, so I'm not speaking out of my♥♥♥♥♥, but kind of a bad game in general.1: Literally the hardest thing about this game is the contrast. You cannot, under any circumstances, see♥♥♥♥♥♥ The grey enemies blend into the grey backround alongside the grey interactable objects. Fun. It's actually easier to see underground because then enemies are highlighted against black backrounds instead of the entire ♥♥♥♥ing screen being greyscale.2: Turns out platforming and Souls don't mix; you can't dodge in midair(at least they don't tell you how), and many enemies can simply swat you out of the air. The rolling is awkward as hell, there is collision by default and rolling allows you to pass through enemies, but only during certain frames, making it easy to roll gently to an enemy's feet ready to get smacked with a counterhit.3: Enemies aren't hard to kill, usually, but they have this annoying thing where every single move is stupidly under-telegraphed(if you can physically see the enemy model that is) so you can't just organically dodge.4: Confusing, overwhelming skill tree. 5: Overly simplified combat. Not even rolling attacks.6: No bloodstains, dying to an enemy buffs them and forces you to fight them for you lunch money. Great.7: The most difficult enemy in the game is the controls. The camera also likes to do whatever it wants sometimes, too. The game as a whole is way faster in every aspect that it should be, so it ends up being hard to follow and difficult to learn from your mistakes.All in all, pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ adventure platformer with unclever rip-offs of souls mechanics that's most difficult elements are the lack of any color whatsoever and♥♥♥♥♥♥moving as fast as Sonic Boom. I'm fairly certain I had a better time playing Cat Mario. "

												Like a 2D dark souls only not as good, not even close. While Dark souls loves to give you a cheap death every now and then, That is all this game is capable of. Bosses are ""hard"" because of small arenas or spamming the same attack over and over before your character can finish the recovery animation. Meanwhile the bosses with large arenas and slow attacks pose little to no challenge, and can be killed in one or two tries at most.Pros:-Nice art style-Great soundtrack-Some how wasn't sued by from software for ""borrowing"" almost every mechanic from the Dark souls series.Cons:-Artificial difficulty-A convoluted ""Skill tree""-Not very original-No online co-op (WTF)-terrible hit boxesIn short, just go play your favorite SOULS game.

												I'm a huge fan of the Dark Souls series. This game is basically 2D Dark Souls... that's pretty much it. I wouldn't say it is a rip off, but it is heavily influenced by it. It's very impressive that a two person development team created this game, but it fell a bit flat for me. My main complaint is that I don't think the 3D combat of Dark Souls translates very well to 2D. This is most apparent in boss fights. In Dark Souls, you can dodgeroll left/right/forward/backward from a boss. In Salt and Sanctuary, you can only roll left and right. Of course, the bosses' attacks are all 2D as well. But I found this cumbersome and some boss attacks felt unavoidable. I also found it difficult at times to distinguish enemies from the backgrounds. It's not all bad -- I certainly had some fun with it. But the more that I played this Dark Souls-esque game, the more I realized that I'd rather play Dark Souls.			"

												This is actually a decent game  and I really want to like it but many parts of the game require more luck than skill, which is why I'm giving a thumbs down because this flaw makes the game tideuous and nearly impossible.Just to clarify, I've played and finished some hard games, all the Souls games, old Castlevania and Mega Man games, Hagane and many more, but this one is so ridiculously unbalanced that it's just not fun to me at some points of the game.While normal enemies aren't that hard to deal with, you'll encounter some more difficult big enemies here and there, which are still manageable though.The real issue with this game are the bosses. Since it's 2D, you're limited in your ways of movement, which means that sometimes there is literally no way to dodge some of the boss attacks and some of them can kill you (almost) instantly. This has nothing to do with player skill and makes the game luck based and frustrating sometimes.You have to be lucky enough for bosses not to do attacks that are impossible to dodge from where you are standing.If you can get over that fact, you should be able to enjoy the game however. It's pretty much Dark Souls in 2D, only difference is that you level up in a skill tree rather than just boosting up stats.			"

												The game is cool at first. It's like 2d dark souls and has an interesting plot to it. The lore is fun to read up on and I loved finding new items to use. Unfortunately the controls are subpar at best and I find myself doing the wrong thing not too often, but often enough to kill me at key moments which is annoying. On top of that the platforming elements are overused and just not fun to play with. No one likes to die from fall damage because you jumped early after killing a slew of difficult enemies, it's stupid and not good game design. Especially when the platforming is as overused and obnoxious as it is in the late game. On top of that enemy design is sort of a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ With only 2 dimensions they had to innovate or the combat wouldn't be very fun. Unfortunately innovation means a ton of annoying to deal with enemies that fly through walls, teleport, jump insane distances, and knock you thirty feet away and off a cliff to your death. I'd say this game definitely isn't worth the 20 dollars you'll spend on it and isn't even worth 10 dollars. Especially with some of the bugs still present in the game that will deprive you of your ""salt"" and how you can easily die from stupid things.			"

												I don't review games often, but I felt like I had to with this.I love Dark Souls. This is not Dark Souls. The genre does not lend itself to 2 dimensions. In Dark Souls, combat felt fluid and like you could improve it if you practiced. In this, I can 100% accurately hit an enemy, but since they were dodging it didn't count. You can't dodge into an axe and have it count as a miss. You're right in front of my face; how did I miss?But for the player, that same hit (with a dodge) would've counted for 90% of your health, since there is no way to get out of enemy combos once they hit you. You just have to hope the AI is dumb enough not to continue a combo.It also won't let me use the mouse for the menus (but I can use it for combat), making navigation, equipment management, and two-handed impossible.

												This game have some good mechanics but it just doesn't work together well enough.Its 2D game. You can't just put 3d mechanics from Dark Souls and hope its worked.For example: This game have 80% gray colored locations witch means you can't remember all things you miss,                       And game have no map... Just try to play Castlevania Symphony of the Night without map, its impossible.                       S&S have hidden walls witch can't be detected completely. The only way to find them is to attack every wall on your way.1. Enemies also colored mostly in grey so you can't see them good enought. And they tend to spawn right near you.2. Weapons broken. Arming sword has same reach as spears, or maybe longer. Starting weapons very weak, in Dark Souls you can use your starting weapon till the end of the game and its not difficult.        Example: Starting Knights Sword in S&S deal 8-10 dmg to first boss, morning star 20. Swords and daggers are very weak. (Two-Handed sword like Claymore are pretty powerful.)3. Enemies are extreme in all sense:        Some have very far reach even if it seems that they don't.        Some of them very fast, if get close to axe-thrower guy you dead. He just make 4-5 hit combo in second.       Some of them can grab you dealing lots of damage. They can grab you through shields. Grab attacks have huge hitbox so you can only dodge it to avoid it completely.       All of them can spam attacks without cooldown. So boss fight are heavy RNG dependent. It is not hard to memorise attacks but bosses can f_ck you up realy easy by just spaming exact same attack over and over again.       And bosses and some mobs can deal damage up to 90% of your health with one hit.4. Skill tree. Why potions upgrades and higher class equipment unlocks are in tree?     If you take away these nodes from tree, the tree becomes empty. It has only stats upgrades left in it. All that makes    player to stop experiment with different weapons. If you take Axes you cant just take a dagger and try it, instead you need to refund passives or start new character.5. The game just wants you to die as many times as possible. Its hard but in unfair way. Some people like it but its not what make Dark Souls such a great game. Yes the Dark Souls was hard, but you learned and become better. In S&S you die in trap becouse you didn't see it, memorise it, come back and die on another trap. Repeat till you finish the game.6. There is some little bugs.     Example:  If you die from poison there is a chance to not being able to recover salt (souls).    Overall this game misses some 2d features witch can improve gameplay.    a) Watching below character is needed since you can die from fall damage.    b) Character mus be able to duck.    c) The Map - must have.    d) Replace rolling to dash.    e) Fix reach of some weapons and enemies.    f) Get rid of the Tree of Skill because it doesn't have skills... Or add 'actuall' skills in tree.This game have such potential but it just trying to♥♥♥♥♥♥me off. Thanks for reading. Sory for my bad English.			"

												Really enjoyed the first few areas, then got to Watching Woods and started falling through platforms. Not even the platforms that are supposed to break, though I fell through those prematurely as well, the static platforms' geometry sometimes ended before their texture resulting in me many times walking where I thought was safe then falling to my death.Persisted to Red Hall of Cages where I encountered really bad enemy hitboxes and an extremely spammy boss that was based around that bad platforming I just mentioned. At this point I also felt under-leveled despite being level 40 and having a level 5 weapon. Everything felt like it had an unfair advantage over me. Like they didn't have to follow the same rules I did.I recognize I am in the minorty in this thread so people are finding the good in it and that is great. I just wasn't having any fun playing it. I love a good challenge, I've put a lot of time into the Souls series, but they have always felt fair. S&S in my opinion does not.			"

												I feel quite sorry that I dislike this game, but it's not fun to play to me. It is obvious that somebody put both effort and thought into this game, but unfortunately it still doesn't work.The game is just super frustrating to play. And actually I don't think difficulty is the reason for that: In general I enjoy difficult games. In Salt and Sanctuary, there are two mechanics which I find especially annoying:First, if you gain enough experience (""salt"") to reach the next level, you don't automatically gain that level, you have to go back to the last save point and click a button. If you die before doing that, your salt is lost (well you can get it back, but anyways). This wouldn't be so bad, but in addition, each time you enter the sanctuary, all enemies respawn.So I continously find myself in this situation: I beat a hard section of a level, killed the enemies, and got lots of salt. I can now either a) go back and claim my level -- and face the hard secion again immediately without doing anything wrong. Or I can b) continue playing, with a very significant risk of dying before reaching the next sanctuary, having to replay the hard section in addition to losing my level.Second, the savepoint are not actual savepoints, but respawn points; if you die, you don't load your last save, but instead you respawn, losing some gold, all your XP, and without getting the consumable items back you used since you last respawned. Thus, my character just gets weaker and less resourceful with each death, reducing my chances to beat whatever killed me before in the next attempt.This is just super frustrating. I think in a jump-and-run game like this where you are likely to die often, you need some ""retry"" mechanics which doesn't cost the player anything.If dying would just reset you to the state you were in when you last reached a sanctuary (including gold, XP, and items), and you would gain levels immediately after collecting the necessary XP (this should probably create a savepoint), I think this game would be much more fun to play, at least to me.Other than that, the sound effects are very nice, the atmosphere is good, and the fighting system is somewhat unique -- so I think there is potential. The keyboard controls feel way more clunky than I think they would need to, though.			"

												Don't get me wrong, I love this game. It is fun, and all that jaz. But when your fighting a boss, and it's attacks do not do the same thing, or even close to the same thing, then the whole point of the game kinda falls apart. I am mostly referncing at the cyclops boss here. He has a jump attack, one of his attacks you are to roll behind, but 1/2 of the time he does it, he flies past me, easy to dodge. The other 1/2 he jumps at me, same attack, I can't roll past, and get a face full of axe. Like I said, it's a fun game, but it's a game of skill. The fact that I have to worry if I might roll past this time if I am lucky, or if I might not and end up dying, defets the full purpous of this game.			"

												How To Make a Basic Butter Cake from ScratchMakes one 2-layer cakeWhat You NeedIngredients1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened (plus extra for greasing the pans)1 1/2 cups sugar3 large eggs2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour1 teaspoon salt3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder1 1/4 cups whole milk1 teaspoon vanilla2 1/2 cups buttercream frosting, such as basic buttercreamEquipment2 9-inch round pansStand mixer or hand mixerMeasuring cups and spoonsCookie scoop or measuring cup, for dividing the batterInstructionsHeat the oven to 350°F.Sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.Prepare the pans: Rub the bottoms and sides of the cake pans with a little butter, shortening, or baking spray. Make sure to get into the corners and all the way up the sides. Flour the sides and bottoms of the pan by scooping a bit of flour into the pan, then shaking and tapping to coat the bottom and sides of the pan with flour; dump out the excess. Alternatively, cut out a parchment round and use this to line the bottom.Beat the butter and sugar until fluffy and light. Cream together for about 3 to 5 minutes on medium spread (see above notes for more information).Add the eggs one at a time. Beat until the batter is very smooth and creamy-looking. Adding the eggs one at a time gives them a better chance at incorporating into a smooth batter. Be sure they are room temperature so the batter does not appear curdled.Beat in half the flour, salt, and baking powder. Add the sifted dry ingredients with the mixer running at low speed. Continue to mix until incorporated.Beat in the milk and vanilla. Alternate adding in the liquids with the dry ingredients so the milk has a chance to be absorbed without needing to overmix the batter. Stream in the milk with the mixer on low until combined.Beat in the remaining flour mixture until just combined and no more visible flour remains. Stir a few times with a spatula to make sure no more flour remains on the bottom of the bowl.Divide the batter between cake pans. Use a scale or mechanical ice cream scoop to evenly divide the batter. Smooth the tops with an offset spatula. Drop the pans against the counter to shake out air bubbles.Bake for 25 to 30 minutes: When done, the cake should be puffed like a pillow, golden, and pull away from the sides of the pan. When done, a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes should come out clean.Cool for 15 minutes in the pan. Run an offset spatula around the cake to make sure it's completely loosened from the sides of the pan.Flip the rounds out of the pan, remove the parchment lining, and flip right-side up to cool completely.Once cool, frost and assemble the cake with the buttercream.

												I really wanted to like this game, but it doesn't let me.Already the start is really frustrating: the first optional boss shouldn't be possible to defeat for beginners and doesn't punish for losing, the story just continues, BUT the advantage of killing him is huge and he can't get fought again. So the player repeats and repeats and repeats creating a character, scrolling through the prolog and fighting his first enemies just to learn the one-and-only tactic to defeat the boss and has to hope that over this very long fight he doesn't make some strange jump which ruins all the effort with one-hit again.The first main boss isn't much less a fun-killer. In his second phase, sometimes he jumps over the whole arena, does his combo and doesn't let the player stand up again. One of the two currencies can't be much used until now, so the player just loses it without really a chance to save and invest it in sth. meaningful.The normal enemies aren't really a challenge, just hack&slay. But they can reduce the players life when they're still invincible (because of an animation) and hit you.Just looking in the wiki and after some own first experience it's clear there isn't much to customize. The game is more action than roleplay, most is straight-line, at least when somebody don't want to fail terribly.I can't understand all these positive reviews, it's more like souls-fanboys-hype. There's the usual problem with controls but additionally there're strange hitboxes, slight glitches and not really a story.This game has a good concept, nice graphics, fitting sounds, but lacking the finishing touch. In its current state there's sadly more of unavoidable annoyance than a learnable difficulty.EDIT:After playing through the whole game and many hours later (because i don't like to let things unfinished), my impression sadly didn't change as much as i expected. All these glitches where enemies just skipped some animations and started right in mid of the next attack, delayed jump & rolling actions leading to the most often happened reason for dying - falling somewhere down - and terrible balancing with some enemies just broken and others very easy brought me to the same conclusion as before: the developers missed important tasks at the end.

												Refunded the game after just around an hour, writing this more to warn my friends away from it, but you might benefit from it too.- Controls are unresponsive, to the point that this felt like a bad Newsgrounds flash game from 2001.- Dodge is a crapshoot. You're just as likely to roll into a boss's crotch and playfully tickle their junk as you are dodge through them. As a result victory or defeat feels entirely based on luck rather than skill.- Apparently Ska Studios thinks ""atmosphere"" means everything must be gray. Background? Gray. Foreground fog effect? Gray. Enemies? Gray. As you might imagine, this creates a problem beyond just looking washed out and boring; there are points where it is difficult to see enemies through all that gray.- Over-wrought skill tree. Almost as bad as Path of Exile.- No in-game explanation of stats, or at least none that I could discover. There's a difference between letting players figure things out on their own and abeing deliberately ambiguous. This game is on the wrong side of that line.			"

Posted: June 16, 2016
												Alright this is my 3rd attempt at writing a review, after calming down and thinking about my experience.Is the game good? Yes, i suppose, mechanically. Is it fun? No. Not at all - therefore i cannot recommend it. Whilst the art style is very pretty, polished to perfection, and the game is mechanically sound, it is not enjoyable. Here's a few reasons why[edit] just gonna preface this with the fact that, according to steam, I've played 241 hrs of dark souls 1, 431 hrs of ds2, 49 hrs of ds2: SotFS and 164 hrs of dark souls 3. (Thats 885 hrs of dark souls franchise). I've played a lot of dark souls games. I know how to learn patterns, find pathways, learn game mechanics myself etc etc. So I hope you can trust me when I make comparisons between this game and the souls franchise, and conclude that this game is not fun. Platforming Many enemies stand on small platforms that require you to carefully jump, dodge and dash your way to them to kill them. However, many enemies have ranged attacks that stun or knock you back, leading you to fall to your inevitable death thanks to the 100s of insta-death distances. The general rule is, ""if you can't see it before you fall on it, you'll die when you hit it"". You see very little of what is above and below, meaning you will maybe survive 1 in 1000 falls, leading to very frustrating deaths. Furthermore, enemies with ranged attacks can be tricky to manouver around, and rolling in this game,  copied from  similarly to dark souls, provides invulnerablilty for a short time but has a range longer than the vast majority of platforms - meaning you roll through the arrow and straight off the platform and down to your doom. This leaves timed jumps which are incredibly difficult or just sitting around with your shield up. Very boring and poorly thought out Combat Before I get into anything else, let me rant about the injury system. When you take damage, your max health decreases. As far as i can tell, there is no cap on it - I once got to have my 'max' HP be less than about 40% of my health bar. Why? ♥♥♥♥ you, thats why. It can get particularly frustrating thanks to the fact that you can't level up HP. At least, not directly. It slowly increases with leveling, I believe, which means end-game characters are only slightly more tanky than your fresh-faced adventurer straight off the ship. As someone who likes to be a bit of a jack-of-all-trades, having the option to block, roll, tank a few hits, deal decent damage etc, this totally ruins my playstyle. You have to sepcialise very carefully into EITHER a glass cannon or brick wall that can't deal any damage, but even then your pitiful HP bar gets quickly reduced to being 1/2 despite your healing items, meaning only glass cannons are actually viable. The same system is also applied to stamina, but you can raise it through your stats so it isnt as much of a problem to me - losing 25% of 200 stamina is more managable that 25% of your base 100. Actually killing enemies once you reach them is a bit... unrewarding. a long-range weapon like a big♥♥♥♥♥sword, spear, hammer, mace, etc. (which is what you want) easily outranges most enemies, meaning you can poke and run. I chose a spear and it made for an easy game. On the topic of weapons; you need 2. One for strike damage, one for slash damage. Most bosses are extremely vulnerable to one and very resistant to the other, making for a slight annoyance if you are like me in dark souls and like to swap out weapons every now and again, keeping a few weapons at +6 or +7 , with no weapons all the way up to +10. This game is pretty much the same as dark souls, except the highest is +7 according to the wiki, but i think +6 is as far as I got. Talking of bosses... Bosses Boring. All bosses are boring. Very boring. Almost as boring as this review. Boring, boring, boring. Why? Because blocking is the magic answer to 90% of all bosses. I literally beat 3 bosses in a row, blind, without taking damage thanks to a 100% block shield. Wow, nice design. On the off chance that the boss can't be blocked, rolling and stabbing the butt is equally effective, if a little more tricky thanks to the involvement of timing. There is 1 boss, the tree of men, which is just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gimmick boss that I'm only mentioning because I hope you will look up a video of the fight to see how frustrating the boss is - insta-death pitfalls on either side, crumbling platforms and ill-telegraphed attacks / fire-spitting tubes and plenty of knockback Enemies There are maybe 5 or 6 enemies types: flying, flying archers, walking dudes, walking archers, dogs and thats about it. I've described about 95% of the enemy varieties in that short list. There are few, if any, differences between each enemy within one of these types, and no tangible AI difference. All ground units mindlessly march towards you, swinging wildly, all flying units will charge at you in a figure of 8 pattern. Enemies rarely feel unique, and those that are unique are shamelessly copy-pasted into dozens of locations e.g. the flipping-samurai dudes with katanas that are kinda cool the first 7 or 8 times but get very boring the 30th or 40th time. Currency There are 2 currencies. Why? I haven't the foggiest. One is useful - salt, which allows you to level up. The other is useless - gold, which you buy things with. You lose all salt when you die but you can recover it bloodborne-style by killing what killed you. They don't tell you that the enemy is buffed by your salt though, which means a learned way of dealing with them might not work e.g. there are various enemies that 1-shot you (even in full armour) but take 2 hits to kill, except with your salt they might take 3 or 4, meaning you die again because you weren't expecting to suddenly get grabbed and 1-shot from an enemy that should be dead. You lose a portion of your gold forever when you die - the cost of ""resurrection by a mysterious priest"". Not a big deal, frankly, because there is little worth buying. Healing items are unlocked through the skill tree (for some unknown reason) and certain upgrade materials can only be bought from certain vendors under certain conditions - its much easier to farm them / find them. Sanctuaries What a ♥♥♥♥ing joke the system is. Put all your eggs in one basket is literally the only good way to do it. Spend your useless gold on a ♥♥♥♥-tonne of horns that let you travel to any sanctuary with a guide in it, and the guide will let you travel back to any other sanctuary. You then have 3 more slots for any NPCs of your choice - I would recommend blacksmith, alchemist and leader if you don't cast spells or a mage / cleric if you do use spells. Creeds slightly change what is available. Creeds They are not explained at all, but unlike dark souls' covenants that maybe don't impact much, creeds can have huge consequences. You can join 1 of 3 at the start of the game, and there are 7 in total. Changing creeds gives you a sin, and unless you repent at a particular NPC (think cromwell the pardoner without the charm, easy-to-find location or other uses) then all NPCs from your previous creed attack you and you can't travel there. You can't rejoin that creed until you repent, and find a different sanctuary belonging to that creed. This can totally ♥♥♥♥ your game if you accidentaly change creed, die, and have all your sanctuaries turn hostile.  Character leveling This, too, is stupid. The web design serves little function, really, and is needlessly complex in my opinion. It also forbids flexibility, forcing you to spec into 1, maybe 2 weapon classes if you want good damage output. There is also no way to increase health... Yup.Oh and one last thing, I have only made it to the final boss, but haven't beaten it. It took me a little under 15 hrs to get there, so take what you will from that.			"

												I really wanted to like Salt and Sanctuary, a Dark Souls/castlevania mash up with awesome indie graphics, and i guess i did enjoy the first 7 or 8 hours, but after a while I just felt no desire to continue playing. I guess I prefer more action -packed 2d games, like metroid on the snes, or games like Dust, where you don't have to manage a stamina bar, and the combat is much faster and more fluid.  Salt and Sanctuary just started to feel like a chore...Now, this game is a great achievment for such a small studio.  I loved the indie style graphics, and the lighting effects are really atmospheric.  It also has a brilliant inter-connected world design which has you unloking shortcuts all the time and bringing you back to new areas with new skills to unlock secrets.  It also expands on the Dark Souls legacy in novel and interesting ways, such as having your convenant effect the sanctuaries (bonefires) and being able to offer statues found in the game at your sanctuary in order to summon merchants and such.  It also has a really cool skill tree that reminded me of the one in Final Fantasy X.  So there's lots of great stuff about this game, just not my cup of tea. and I see from the Steam reviews that a lot of ppl like it, but for me it just became more and more infuriating and less and les of a joy to play and this is someone whose sunk around 300 ish hours into the dark souls games.  Maybe I shouls have persevered, but for now i'm gonna let this one rest.   Now, before all the  fan boys and girls get their knickers in a twist, I'm not saying this is a bad game, but i can't recommend it as I got bored of it really quickly.  Again, not saying it is a bad game, and really wish i could like it more			"

												I'm a die-hard Dark Souls fan. I can appreciate the effort made to pay homage to that, but this game doesn't pull it off as well. This shouldn't come off as a huge surprise.Often in Dark Souls when you die, it's because you made a mistake. This isn't always the case in this game, with some deaths just being out-right cheap.If you enjoy Souls/Metroidvania games, I'd say pick this one up during some kind of sale.			"

												Disclaimer - I am not a fan of platforming genre. Maybe people who really enjoy it would think of this game higher, than I do.I picked up Salt and Sanctuary because I'am a big fan of Dark Souls series. I think it will be more honest if I start with the things I liked about this game. And  to tell you the truth, it is almost everything.Fights, bosses, enemies, atmosphere.Everything is really captivating. On a level significantly higher than what you would expect from a non triple A game.Fighting system is a bit repetitve,and bosses begin to seem all the same after a few of them, but in which Souls-like game they are not?On the other hand, figthting is varied, offers you a lot of styles and meaningfull choices. Right my alley, I would say.Soundtrack is great. Also a bit repetitve, but still really enjoyable.Atmosphere - let's just say whis game would be a great succsessor to the Demon Souls atmosphere, although a bit more grim.Now, for a few negative sides of the game...There are generally two big issues that I feel ruined this game for me, and made ne unable to enjoy everything else.1) Many enemies are created without even a bit of thought about counterplay in them (namely, Horsemen, Angsty bones, Invisible guys  and many. many others) They are made to be annoying, not to be interesting or challenging. Their abilities are just not fun to play against. It's not that they are too hard quite contrary - they are just don't serve as learning experience or require special techniques to overcome. Wouldn't it be better to design enemies, whose abilities would be fun although challenging to counter?2) Platforming. Just...When I play this game, I always remember Prince of Persia, both Sands of time-warriors withtin, and 2D ones - 1 and 2.I think about those because many of the things that are bogging down this game are already fixed there.How many times did I fall to my death in Salt and Sanctuary because I just bounced off from platform, instead of grappling on it? How many times I fell through the elevator without any apparent reason? How many times I had to not even try going for the pitfall, hust because that ment that I would have to run back here from Sanctuary? Many. Too much for my liking. Why couldn't I just try this jump, and then turn back time (PoP or Braid style)? Why do I have problems with grabbing onto platform edges so much? Especial in Haggers cavern. A couple of times, I just had to stay on one place and jump there for a minute, trying and trying again to reach the edge of the platform just couble of inches from my head... Ultimately, for the main question of a platformer is how you deal with punishing players errors. Braid, Prince of Persia, Super Meat Boy - all these games were trying to minimise the impact, which single failed jump may have on your game overall, while also teaching you to play better. Is maximizing the punishment fro failed jump a good idea? Is running back from the sanctuary because of failed jump worth it? I don't know. Not for me, it seems.Dark souls souls-lost-on-death system is in my opinion doesn't play well with platforming.If you remember Iaito jump in DS1 or jump for Ostravas shield and sword in tower of Latria - take this, multiply it by ten hundred, and throw it, distibuted evenely, in the game. This is Salt and sanctuary in the nut shell.Also this is magnified by somewhat glitchy and unresponsive platforming, especially in the Hard Light brand parts.tl;dr Great game, buried under endless boring and infuriating platforming.

												This game tries really, REALLY hard to be Dark Souls. It has a lot of the same basic systems that the Souls series has. The game follows a lot of the same design decisions that the Souls games, but missed some opportunities to improve in areas. The game doesn't really tell you how anything works. You also basically have to commit to a build instead of really being able to experiment at all, since you have to spend your levels into a talent grid, similar to what you would find in Final Fantasy 10 or Path or Exile, and they tend to put different playstyles about as far away as they can from each other. You can refund some points, but you have to find items to do so, and there are only about 20 of them per playthrough so far as I am aware. Combat feels kind of slow and clunky. Rolling exists, but the hitboxes can be kind of weird. Also, there are different tiers of rolling, similar to the Souls series, where the closer you are to the encumbrance cap, the less effective rolling is. This makes wearing heavy armor and trying to roll expensive in terms of stat points, since you are going to have to heavily invest in your carrying capacity. Taking damage reduces your maximum health, so getting more potions isn't really effective, since by the time that you could use all of them your health will be at a point to where you will be killed in one hit anyway. Magic seems useful, but is somewhat inconvenient to use. There is no lock-on system, so casting it in any direction other than straight ahead is kind of fiddly. Casting spells also reduces your maximum stamina. You can recover this ""fatigue"" through the use of potions that you have to spec into. Melee has a limited combo system similar to what you would find in old beat-em-ups, you will do some different combos depending on what order you hain you heavy and light attacks in. There only seems to be about 5 different combos per weapon types however. There are currently 16 different weapon types, including staves and wands for casting spells, so there is a variety of weapons that you can use. Each weapon talent path also contains a couple of different types of weapons, such as spears, scythes, and poleaxes, so you have some room to switch between a couple of one type doesn't suit you.Parrying exists, but doesn't seem to serve much of a point. Most of the enemies that you would want to parry, including bosses, aren't parry-able. Most of the normal enemies I can kill in one hit, so no point in trying to parry them. At least the parry animations look cool. Bosses are fairly interesting. They aren't just larger versions of the normal enemies that you fight. Each one generally has a couple of attacks that it will use at the start of the fight. Once you get it to around half health however, it will pick up a new attack or two and start chaining its earlier attacks together. One of the larger problems with them though, is once they do hit the point where they start using new attacks, is that they start spamming them pretty much nonstop, not really leaving you with any room to get in any hits. Also, since most of the bosses are quite large, the character has some trouble trying to roll though attacks/models, and tends to roll in place and take a hit or two instead. Which you generally tend to die afterward, since the potions heal over time, and most of the boss attacks tend to be long, sweeping attacks and hit almost the entire arena. Overall it seems like they had a pretty good game, and then they added a lot of ""features” in order to make it ""challenging"", while instead all it does it make the game tedious to play. It doesn't feel difficult, it feels cheap. I don't really feel victorious after beating a boss, I feel like I managed to avoid getting cheesed.I really wanted to like the game, and maybe I will get to a point where I will start enjoying it more, but as it stands I would just rather be playing one of the Souls games.

												I love a good rouge-like, Salt and Sanctuary  IS NOT A GOOD ROUGE-LIKE.  This game is not ""difficult"", it is a ""pain in the♥♥♥♥♥""  There is a difference. The developers accomplished this by trying sooo hard to copy a formula that they killed what could've been a great side scrolling game. All the pretty visuals, metroidvania type gameplay, all the positive points about this game fall to the wayside thaks to its MASSIVE flaws. Like Grandma cutting a huge green fart in the chair next to you during thanksgiving diner. As great as everything couldve been, just one nasty old fart ruined it all.Only the animation is smooth in this game. Everything else (like the made-up ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t language you have to decipher JUST to create your charicter) is like being dragged down a gravel on your bare naked♥♥♥♥♥ The menus never get an explination, no tutorial to help you decipher the word salad, no telling what you can and cant do. The developer is clearly malicious in their intent toward the player, Unless the player is a basement dwelling short♥♥♥♥♥♥turbo nerd that can somehow play a game that cant be paused while googling every little detail about that game as they go along.""But gee golly'"" you say looking at the creation menus ""It can only get better from here"".Wrong. They pooch it. All your told is what the controls are. Some games start you in a similar situation, but those game do a better job. You know what games i'm talking about, go play those. This game is tragic, there is so much potential here, too bad it's all hidden behind a needlessly convoluted and bloated leveling system, combat that get both frusting and stale at the same time.Weapons, you pick up a new weapon only to see how long youll be carrying it around, wishing you could use it. That wouldnt be too bad... if maybe there were a few more weapons to choose from. There are a bunch in the game, too bad youll only be able to use maybe four, and youll NEVER be happy with those four. For the love of god, go play Dark Souls, Demon Souls, Bloodborne, ANYTHING but Salt and Sanctuary. This game is masterpeice of failures. Breaks my heart just to look at it... knowing i cant get my money back. If you play this game long enough to see for certain that it is a pale imitation, Steam will say that you have played too long and will not give you a refund. I tried.  Just dont, its soooo disapointing. This game reaches for the brass ring... and pulls off a fingernail. it is just awful.			"

												Blatant unoriginal Dark Souls ripoff, and no where near as good. At first that was the selling point as I'm a huge fan of the Souls series (as well as Castlevania), but this is just a cheap imitation. The main problem for me with Salt and Sanctuary is that in the Dark Souls games you are faced with challenges that leave you dying over and over, but each of those deaths you feel like you've learned something, so that the next time you approach the situation you can act differently; in Salt and Sanctuary you die over and over from poorly designed platforming areas and incredibly cheap buggy hitboxed enemies. Dark Souls provides you with a distinct sense of accomplishment when you've used all the things you've learned over your last 10 deaths to complete an area, whereas Salt and Sanctuay leaves with a feeling of ""wooooow I spammed the attack button and outcheesed the boss, now to enter the next area and fall into an invisible 100ft pit."" A joke of a game compared to the delicious subtle nuances in the Souls series, don't fall for the 2d Dark Souls appearance. Stick to the real deal if you want to play and intelligent action RPG and not a hack n slash fest that borders on a cell phone game. Don't let your love for the beautiful Dark Souls games sell you on this dirtbag ripoff, and don't fall for these positive fanboy reviews like I did.			"

												I really enjoyed this game for awhile. Some spoilers ahead. Up until the 3rd brand was given out I really enjoyed the 'explore kill and kill bosses' nature of the game. After that it sort of becomes a 'now explore with puzzles and get lost and figure it out'. I get that the game is supposed to be difficult, hell I really enjoy that part of it. But let me fight the monsters, let me fight the bosses, don't make me fight convoluted puzzles and a map that requires backtracking (which doesn't explain when you need to do this). You just have to wander aimlessly to try and figure it out. This game was good, the combat is fun, the weapons are fun, the bosses are fun. The amount of running required in the later parts of the game were almost enough to get me to put down the game, and were enough to make me give a negative review. I was ranting and raving about how good this game was telling my friends to buy it, but now I'm telling them not to unless they want a strange progression which isn't explained anywhere.			"

												Pros:- Nice translation of a souls game to 2DCons: - unresponsive controls (button mashing, i hate button mashing)- hitboxes seem off- game inconsistency (i.e. I can stagger using greatsword weak attack, but strong attack doesn't stagger?)- no wake-up action (can't roll/block as soon as you get up, which means enemies can attack or grab you constantly)- too many level interconnections (the levels don't flow together so tracking where you are and where you want to go is confusing)- spindlebeast (not even a boss, just an excuse to ruin the flow of the game. bad idea from the devs)Reached lvl 93, then just got tired of the unfairness and stiff controls. I've played and beat Darksouls 1-3 and Bloodborne and whenever I died I knew it was my fault. When dying in S&S, I know it's the games fault.			"

												The main cons of this game:Performance: I don't know why, but in many of the areas, especially the darker ones for some reason, the game really stutters and runs worse than Dark Souls III does on my rig. There's no reason a 2D game should be running worse than an open world 3D one like DS III.Platforming: This is easily the weakest part of the game in my opinion. The platforming just is not fun in any way. Most of it is simply jumping from one platform to another and hoping your character does not decide to not grab the edge and fall to his death. I've probably died as much from falling to my death as I have from actually fighting enemies.Controls: This might have something to do with the performance drops, but the controls feel really sluggish in some fights. One of the most annoying things that happens is your character attacking in the wrong direction and hitting absolutely nothing. It seems like the attack button command takes priority over the move button command and instead of your character turning and then attacking if you press a direction and then press attack he will just attack and not turn at all.Rolling in boss fights also has a bit of a curve to it. Bosses are treated as solid objects in all the cases I have seen and you have to roll in order to get past them and dodge their attacks. Unfortunately, the roll range seems really odd and more often than not I end up rolling into a boss and going absolutely nowhere because I get stopped dead in front of the boss.If you can look past the control issues and grin through the platforming, then the game is pretty good. But, with all the Dark Souls clones that are either coming out or have already come out I think there are more polished games on the market that will give you more bang for your buck. This game has potential however and I'm looking forward to seeing if it gets more updates to polish out these problems or if they improve on the game in another installment.			"

												So imagine Dark Souls but in 2D. Problem is Dark Souls is hard to recreate in a 2D way. That's where this game falls short IMO. It tries too hard being something that it's not. This game is meh. It has a lot of similarities to Dark Souls in terms of mechanics, customization, and overall layout. Problem with it is the difficulty. Personally, I feel it is challenging but for the wrong reasons; it's cheap. Enemies can corner you easily and lock you in, there are traps and pitfalls EVERYWHERE that have no indication of being there unless you already knew they was there, and all in all, it just lacks that feeling of satisfaction you get from getting past a difficult part, it's more like, ""oh thank god I'm finally done with that♥♥♥♥♥♥quot;. Keep in mind, I'm a huge fan of Dark Souls, and I review this game based off of the Dark Souls template. I think the game overall is decent, but it's difficulty supplement doesn't feel anywhere near as polished and rewarding as Dark Souls. It's trying too hard to be Dark Souls when it really isn't. If it were more of a Metroidvania game, I think it could be better.			"

												As cool as this game is, I didnt see myself getting into this game, I really liked the art style and game mechanics, but for me it felt a little bit too difficult even on the easiest difficulty, if your a fan of Dark Souls or anything like that, then its a game for you, but for me I didnt like it as much as I wanted to, fo a game like this it should be a wee bit cheaperanyway thats all from me			"

												I bought this game soley because of the comparisons to Dark Souls. The Souls series ruined most other games for me, and left me craving a similar experience. So, I went into Salt & Salnctuary with high (admittedly, maybe too high) expectations. I was sorely disappointed. It certainly nails the atmosphere of the Souls games while creating and maintaining its own identity, but something just makes the experience uncomfortable, annoying even. I can't quite put my finger on it, but playing the game just isn't enjoyable to me. Two flaws I can identify, however, are the combat and stamina system. The combat is just bad. It feels clunky and unresponsive. Fighting often results in the character randomly facing the opposite direction for some reason, completely ruining the flow of the fight. Like Dark Souls, everything in Salt & Sanctuary is stamina based. Swinging your weapon, rolling, and blocking an attack all drains your stamina bar; even raising your shield makes your stamina recover more slowly. The problem arises from the fact that everything takes so much stamina. You will run out of stamina at least a couple of times in a fight, leaving you completely defenseless. Boss fights make this problem even more clear. The idea is that a boss goes into an attack sequence, you block and roll to avoid damage, and then you use the boss' brief period of inaction to retaliate. However, after blocking and dodging, you rarely have enough to stamina to attack and then safely get out of range. Both of these problems could be fixed (it's even possible that I'm simply not used to how this game works), but the aforementioned general lack of fun I experienced while playing the game means that I probably won't be returning to this title. If your a Souls fan, buy it on sale just to try it. I don't see it being worth the full price, though.			"

												I played for about an hour and 45 minutes, was falling in love with it and then the game crashed out. I tried several times to get back into my saved game but when I would do that or click ""New Game"" it would give me an error that said ""Not connected to the Steam servers (I was) so you can't play the game. This is a pre-release issue."" Or something to that effect.With minutes left on the clock for my refund window, I had to return it. I am just glad this happened before I was past my playtime limit - I would have been very unhappy had my game done that and I was stuck with it. Which is the point of this review: I don't know what happened, but my game quit allowing me to start a new game or load any of my saves. No troubleshooting fixed it, and I am not inept. Be warned.

												At the time of writing this, I have had a total of 6-7 hours in this game. 3-4 on PS4 and 3 on Steam. I honestly tried to like this game. As someone who has beaten Demon's Souls 6 times, Dark Souls 12 times, Dark Souls 2 4 times, and Dark Souls 3 4 times, I cannot find a reason to keep playing this homage to the genre. I have learned a great deal of patience playing the Souls series, in fact I consider myself a better person because of it, but I can not play this game for more than 30 minutes at a time without getting mad. Let's start with the positives, because there are some despite my initial paragraph. The game's platforming works well. The game has a fair bit of customization with its extensive sphere grid like skill tree. The weapons, for the most part, feel unique to each other and have weight and heft to them. The names of the zones are dark and brooding and I love em. While the humans look awkward, I do like the art style of the game. The music is dark and brooding, which is what you need for a game like this. Now....for the bad stuff. The stuff I just cannot tolerate or forgive. The first is the god awful hit boxes. So many times I will get hit by things that I really shouldn't have. There are also times when rolling into an enemy to get behind them doesn't work, resulting in you getting hit anyway. An example is when I was rolling into an enemy to get past them, and got swiped into the air (because the hit box on the weapon seemed to be the entire screen despite being behind the hilt of the weapon at the time) and launched me into the air, falling down a pit just to get juggled by another enemy who knocked me down another pit to my death. Totally unable to prevent it, something Dark Souls is known for giving you a chance to prevent. There are also the enemies. Each enemy has unavoidable attacks which is a no no for a game like this. It may be fair, and some people may tell me to get good, but it doesn't FEEL fair. In fact almost 100% of this game doesn't FEEL fair. Dark Souls at least feels fair, if I die I know why and how to prevent it next time. I feel like each enemy I fight is just more bull stacked on top of more bull. ""Ok let's make an enemy who is invisible, can grab you in the air and on the ground, his grabs are unavoidable, and he can jump at you from off screen. Oh and make it take 90% of the player's life too."" ""Ok let's make a slime that attacks before you get a chance to react, and make it gravitate towards the player so they cannot dodge it, it instantly poisons him, and let's make the boss of this area throw them out during the fight. Oh! Let's also make it so there are no iframes after being grabbed so it can happen again immediately. AND, make it so each consecutive grab worsens the poison until the player dies in 1 second. Seems fair."" Let's get down to the elephant in the room though. Even if the enemies are not being impossible, and I am making good progress without dying, the game is just simply not fun. It is not an engaging game. Maybe I have just played too much Dark Souls, but I do not think that is it. So at the time of writing this, I cannot in good conscience recommend this game. I wish I could, I wanted to like this game. I bought it twice. I gave it a solid 6 hours at least. I just cannot do it. I will continue to play the game, maybe something will spark my interest  and if that day comes I will update this, but I think I am going to go back to Dark Souls for now.			"

												A dissapointing game that leaves you lost in a maze without direction and encountering subpar bosses that are only a threat due to miniscule arenas, spam-happy attack patterns and are little fun to fight.I have not finished this game simply due to the fact that it is just not fun. Combat is more R1 spam than a Dark Souls 3 gank squad, and is so basic and slow it's more tedious than exciting. And talking about Dark Souls I think it's an insult to call this a Souls-Like game. Everything that made Dark Souls fun makes this game tedious.Only get as a gift or in a sale.			"

												If you love everything about the dark souls series (and all the pain and frustration that comes with it), you will love this. I wish I had researched it a little more. It is everything I hated about when I first blindly purchased dark souls when it came out. You die and you get penalized for it. Die again and all your hard work grinding for experience is lost forever. I HATE when games punish you like this. Like come on it is a freaking video game not a do or die job.Do your research if you are unfamiliar with dark souls. I am a fool for blindly buying this. It looked like a cool 2d castlevania style game. Its not.			"

												This game looked fun, I watched a bunch of reviews I looked at tutorials I looked to see if my computer could run it, which appearently it could, and I said screw it I'll buy it. I bought it, had a terrible time trying to install it, finally got it to load. Could barely navigate the starting screen. It was clear it was not optimized for PC, upon seeing that my mouse was moving sluggishly I attempted to lower the graphical settings. Which I guess, DON'T EXIST, about the only thing I could change was the resolution, buyt eh I've played Chivalry this laggy before, I've played many many games that were worse than this I can manage. No, no I could not my lord how terrible the control scheme is for this game. The mouse doesn't do♥♥♥♥♥♥for this game, the block and parry were strangley hidden for a time and did not feel ""comfortable"" I want to play this game but I'll wait till I get a better computer to retry. Maybe my comp is the issue. I hope it is.			"

												Like playing complete rip offs of better games? This homage (not a homage) to Dark Souls will test your skills as a gamer...well, only your paitence at jumping puzzles and un-ballanced enemies, weak level and character design.Lest break this down.Graphics: Bland desaturated souls wanna be; both in level look and HUD style. We all love the Souls series and thats why we wanted to play Salt & Sanctuary. Its just a shame that this game really has no style or direction much of its own. The characters are a pain to look at and the bosses apear to have been grabbed from someones lack luster doodles from 6th grade. Its a muddy confusing mess to look at.Gameplay: Excesive jumping in platformers are a lazy gameplay/time extending excuse. Theres nothing old school about the jumping in S&S. The platform traversing isnt there to get you around from point A to B etc. Its there to get in your way, or for the enemies to hit you off of. It would have been nice to need them to get around a labrynth like world. The bland layout will make you not give two salts about where you're going or what you're doing. I like the weapons and how they look while attacking. They feel right and the gore adds to that; something i wish the Souls series had. I wont review the items and secondary trinkets as i generally dont care for that kind of item/gameplay mechanic anyway. Fighting is neat to look at but you tend to get sick of it when you have to go get your salt due to some BS enemies you cant see or lame lazy boss fight that you cant dodge roll around.When you DO lose your salt you are kindly informed that you lost it FOREVER. That of course is on par with the Souls series, but this time its the above mentioned tripe thats takes your sou...er salt...away from you. When the game feels like its cheating you then punishing you for what its done; things get a little frustrating. Not only do you get the 'bad touch' from the game, you get charged for it too. You pay in gold to respawn back at the bondfi...er. sactuary. When you feel its not your fault you died, you feel like you got robbed. Pretending to be like those other difficult games without understanding why they're difficult but fun; doesnt make for a 'love of Souls games' game.What the game does add that is nice: The extra abilities like wall jumping or upside down gameplay etc. When the game tries to be different (character design aside) it shines.The whole time playing this game i just wanted to go play Souls instead. I admire the small team that made the game, and i like how far they've come. As a fantasy doodler myself, i like that the game is hand drawn. It's just sad that this game doesnt have much of its own design and style to be fresh. Trying to be a homage to that which we love, the game fails because its trying too hard.			"

												I like it, it reminds me of Dark Souls BUT!!!And it is a big but!2/3 of the time I feel like I died because the controls are not very responsive or because the enemy had some insane undodgeable cheap attack that they do over and over. It isn't challenging so much as infuriating and it feels cheap.I know they are trying to be dark souls, but DS isn't punishing, it's fair. You die because you didn't learn enough. This game you die because the enemies have insane attacks that cannot be dodged, blocked or interrupted, or the controls don't work properly and you drop through a platform and fall to your death when you were actually trying to jump.Needs work on the unresponsive controls, they really get on my nerves. Till it is tightened up it cannot be recommended despite the fact that I love the concept, and that its basically 2D dark souls.			"

												The game has a dirty, grungy style that I thought would grow on me.  It did not.  Worse, it's trying WAY too hard to be 2D Dark Souls, to the point where it essentially rips off (I think borrow would stretch the word too far) several key Dark Souls mechanics.  The gameplay feels loose and unsatisfying mainly because it is trying to be 2D Dark Souls without the freedom of movement of Dark Souls.  I just cannot recommend this game.			"

												Eu tenho jogado Salt And Sanctuary já à alguns dias e gostaria de deixar bem claro que sim, é possivel se divertir com o jogo, porém eu não recomendo que você gaste seu dinheiro com esse jogo, baixe pirata, sim baixe PIRATA.Salt And Sanctuary é um jogo que trás elementos da obra prima Souls, COM CERTEZA tentando pegar uma carona no seu sucesso, além do mais a série Souls foi a unica coisa que me motivou a comprar o jogo, ao executar o jogo no computador se mostra obvio que SaS(Salt And Sanctuary) foi desenvolvido para platarfoma dos consoles ja que os desenvolvedores não se deram nem ao trabalho de alterar as teclas de controle.Por mais que você possa configurar as teclas do jogo para ficarem ""confortaveis"" no teclado ele permanece muito travado, aconcelho MUITO que você utilize um controle se for jogar no computador.Por que eu aconcelho a baixar o jogo pirata?Simples, os unicos motivos que eu vejo para comprar um jogo são:1 - Poder jogar online - Não, você não pode jogar online e não venha me dizer que você pode jogar no modo cooperativo porcamente criado para SaS, ele não funciona, eu sei disso e você também sabe.2 - Amor Profundo pelo jogo a ponto de desembolsar o meu dinheirinho para beneficiar a magnifica desenvolvedora do jogo - Não chega nem perto de uma paixonite de elevador.Mas por que o jogo é tão ruim?- A arvore de talentos é uma piada, sério essa♥♥♥♥♥♥♥é ridicula-90% dos inimigos recebem instakill-45% das suas mortes ocorrem por queda-A imerção que deveria ser um dos fatores mais importantes do jogo não foi por mim vista (em canto nenhum)-O coop ja mencionado-Você não consegue nem ver a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥do dano da sua arma ou o rank dela a menos que va a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥do ferreiro (isso é ridiculo, sério, desenvolvedores isso é RIDICULO)-Ao entregar os ""ingredientes"" ao npc lider voce tem direito a algum item que sera reestocado ao usar o santuario, o problema é que sua escolha será as cegas ja que não há sequer descrição de pra que caralhos aquilo serve.Eu gostaria de listar algumas coisinhas que o jogo faz bemBosses - Por mais faceis que sejam (e acredite em mim é muito facil, tanto que eu fui ver alguns videos na internet e percebi que nem deu tempo de ver todos os ataques de varios bosses porque eu matei ele muito depressa) usam a mecanica de -vida +dificuldade, ou seja, quanto menos vida o boss tiver mais mais fluido seram seus movimentos e combos, Sodden Knight que o diga, isso da a intender (na minha percepção) que eles lutam pela vida e se prendem a ela com mais firmeza (e é muito divertido ver que seu inimigo tem mais de um padrão de ataque a luta toda)Armas - A diferença entre armas é magnifico, armas de slash e de strike são palpavelmente distintas o que é perceptivel no dano que seu inimigo sofre obrigando ou pelo menos influenciando o jogador a usar tipos de armas diferentes.Brands - As brands são cicatrizes provocadas no jogador com a intenção de lhe dar alguma habilidade nova, além de serem muito divertidas de se usar elas tambem fazem com que o bloqueio de uma area seja muito mais logico do que uma simples porta que precisa de uma chave dando um profundidade melhor a história.Por enquanto é só isso, continuarei jogando para formar uma critica melhor apos me familiarizar com o lore, ainda assim esperava mais do jogo.

												I played this to the maximum 2 hours I was allowed before requesting a refund.  My final verdict?  Meh 6/10.The looks and aesthetics are perfectly fine, it gives off the proper atmosphere and the background blends (though some areas flowing into others looks a tad odd).The animations and combat feel clunky though you can easily compensate and that alone doesn't take from the experience.Rolling in the game works fine, I had little difficulty rolling through blows even with fat rolling.The Salt is a direct rip off of Souls from Dark Souls, but its a proven mechanic and functions fine here alongside Gold.The sanctuary and levelling up system is interesting, I wish I could have explored it more though it seems to cripple adjusting builds.Only fought the Sodden Knight (first Boss) and he was a cake-walk so nothing to say there on Bosses besides block, stab, roll, jump repeat until half hp then block, roll, block, attack, jump repeat.Overall I like the game, so why downvote and request a refund?Combat in general.The enemies have very random patterns of attack which alone is not a big deal, but the game is prone to throwing a half-dozen of them at you at once making it difficult to approach the situation.They also benefit from infinite stamina and no way to properly deflect or hinder their attacks or movement rendering Shields virtually useless when they swing endlessly.Rolling is easy though futile if you are still in the enemies reach as they will turn on a Dime and continue thier frenzy without hesitation regardless of what combo they may have been in.Couldn't try magic but found no way of properly aiming with a Bow which I found rather disappointing.Lastly enemies with thier random attack patterns and endless frenzied swings will most assuredly stunlock and kill you if you are surrounded by any more than 2 at any time making groups a nightmare to handle.All in all it was a nice game and these are my first impressions with the mere 2 hours of playtime I was permitted.The game does not suffer from poor controlls, aesthetics, or level design.  In fact I found them stellar and well implemented.  This game suffers from poor enemy design which cripples the entire experience.			"

												I have played and beaten Darksouls 1,2 and 3 and I can honestly say the only thing this has in common with them is the UI and death penalties. I will give it another try but I already feel pretty bored with the game after the first boss. Graphically it looks like a flash game which isn't a good thing but it alteast controls fairly well. The design and layout of the first area is a pretty bland run of the mill 2d platormer level with some generic metal music in the backround which adds nothing to the overall vibe of the game. I want to like this game but its pretty bad when you are bored in the first 50 min  of this supposedly ""amazing 2d conversion of Dark Souls"". Buyer beware the user reviews are misleading...I will try to get a few hours further into the game and hopefully its get better but idk..I expected more...			"

												Tried to like this game, but I couldn't: it just punishes you all the time. No matter what you do and how you do it: you wil die. Do not other players fool you: it has nothing to do with skill. For example, bosses, while having the memorable attack paterns, will use them faster and more frequently. When an enraged boss executes 3 attacks in a row you can only pray for one of them to be dodgeable via jump or movement, because you simply don't have enough stamina to do the third roll. Even the ordinary enemies may give you a hard time: did you do that roll half a second later than you should? Die from an attack series and die.I urge you to look YouTube videos on how players beat the game: you'll see that even the ablest of them are constantly receiving damage (and a lot of it). Frustration is constant: clunky controls, slowpoke hero reaction and attack delay on every single weapon.			"

												Don't get me wrong, the game looks awesome and is kinda fun to play. The only complaint I have (and it's a big one) is that travelling in 2D in this Soul-like game feels not right. Let me explain: 2D movements makes it hard to dodge something as you can't always go trough something while doing it. It makes some battles extremly unfair as you can't go pass the enemy to avoid damage nor running in the opposite way, because the attack got too much range.I can add the game is way too dark, like you're gonna have a headache if you don't tune up the brightness of your monitor, and there's no option for that in-game.Flying in every direction while taking a huge hit is not what I was looking for too but that's just my opinion.Good concept, so-so execution.

												This is not to be compared to Dark Souls.This is a platformer with a broken stamina bar unnecessarily attached to it (Roll = 1/2 Stamina bar).Don't buy it if you came here because you heard that it's like DS, better buy a DS game you don't have.			"

												Not terrible, but know what you're getting into.  The platforming undermines almost everything in the game.And you're going to spend a lot of time just in recovery frames, because hits just send you all over the place.Interesting entry into the ""souls"" genre, but really misses the mark.  I imagine the massive positive reviews for this are more for that it stands alone in this genre, and isn't terrible.However, cannot recommend it, because it mashes genres without solving the problems it generates.  Especially when it's a solved problem.			"

												Low ratings because it's a negative review, period. A 2D Souls game with some not great design choices. This game is not a roguelike or roguelite. It is a clearly Souls inspired game, even stated by the developer. GoodAnimations are satisfying.Visceral and fun combat. Nice atmosphere.BadEnemies can grab you from different planes and from across ledges, notably the beginning wolves. It has the DaS 2 equivalent of lifegems, making it a bit too easy to get health back.It's not clear how to tell if someone is an enemy or an NPC due to the art style. Not the most important thing, but it's annoying. The inventory isn't very clear on how weapons and shields work. You have two slots for either a weapon or a shield on either side of the inventory, but equiping a weapon on either side will only let you use one of those weapons if you're two handing. No obvious equip load indicator, so no way to know what's too heavy on sight, something Souls does right. No obvious armor or weapon stats, so no way to know what's good or bad on sight, something that, again, Souls does right. No normal enemy life bars, which is just a QOL thing, but still. The UI is just clunky and doesn't flow well. It's a more rough Souls, basically. I personally didn't like it, but hey, you might.			"

												It's sad this game had so much potential to be a good game, but isn't.Controls sucks.Attacking cancels any momentums.If you leaping forward and press the attack button, you immediately stop where you are and slash the sword.UI is really really bad.This game has tons of items so Inventory UI is important, right?As it tuens out, this game's Inventory UI is so bad I have no idea what am I equipping right now.I don't know what kind of effect my current equipments has.I can't easily compare two equipments to determine which is the better item.So, naturaly, I want to quit the game in less than half an hour.But I couldn't figure out how to propery quit the game!So I forcebly killed the process.This is ridiculously bad UI!I saw so many games with bad UI but nothing is worse than this. I hope the developer stop making games and use my payment money as a fund to start a completely new work which doesn't involve UI design, computer game or software development.The world will be a better place without this kind of game which looks fun but isn't.

												Poor combat design doesn't make for a good challenge; it just makes for a bad game. Gaining inspiration from poor combat design makes an even worse game. I regret buying this.Pros:-World is sizable, fairly intricate, and the art is unique-Wide variety of gear-Good amount of classes-Majority of bosses are good, if not simple-Salt reclamation is an initially interesting ideaCons:-Enemy AI is laughable at best, refund-worthy at worst-Jumping and climbling onto ledges rarely works correctly-Player animations and the roll mechanic are poorly designed, leaving you vulnerable and being seconds too long-Music is far from bad, but gets old fast-Talent tree is a downright boring and pointless selection of base attributes and gear access			"

												I'm trying really hard to like this game. Was super excited about it, having watched a quick look of it and dug the overall feel of it. But, having got my hands on it I can't really recommend it.The controls are super clunky and unresponsive at best, to the point where it seems like a design choice in order to make the game more difficult. I was playing on a wireless 360 controller but even when I switched to mouse n keyboard it was still a major factor.There are big sections where a well timed jump is necessary and it often seems touch and go as to whether the game registers it or not. This goes for other controls like the roll as well.With it being a 2D environment, both of these are essential in defeating enemies but neither can be relied upon in a pinch. Thats not even factoring in the difficulty in actually memorising the (seemingly random) attack patterns of bosses and their ability to spin on a dime mid combo.I'm also finding the colour scheme difficult to look at for long periods of time. Even if I know a trap is somewhere I can still have difficulty locating it and feel like I'm constantly straining my eyes.Not really liking the general enemy design, especially the blob enemies. Their attacks seem cheap and too easy for the AI to land.I'm gonna persist with the game, and would probably give the game a ""maybe"" rating if I could. If you can, try a demo.. Wish I had			"

												If you're looking for a challenge, for a real hard game that will test your skill and wit, that won't mess around and handhold you... you'll better look somewhere else, because THIS GAME isn't any of that. But if you're looking for an unfair neutered Dark Souls rip off in 2d where the developer decided that the only thing Dark Souls was missing was crappy platforming, then it's a game for you.This game tries so hard to be Dark Souls, yet fails on so many levels. Appearantly harder=better, yet they completely forgot about any pay off! In Dark Souls, enemies are mostly slow, yet they can eff you up quite easily if you let your guard down. Here, their normal swing is faster than your attack while two-handing a one handed weapon! Dodging is useless, because when you dodge-roll behind them, they immediately turn around to complete their combo and shove a sword up your♥♥♥♥♥♥ Enemies spawn in clear day light behind your back, ready to once again introduce your sphinchter to an unhealthy dose of hardened steel. But the biggest freaking gripe I have with this game is platforming. WHY!? Why did you think it was a good idea? Who needs good story? Throw it out the window! Let's add crumbling platforms! Our enemies are cheap and deaths are unfair! ♥♥♥♥ you, we're trying to be dark souls, so git gud, it's not the game that's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, it's you who are unskilled. This game sucks and is not worth your money. Go save up for Dark Souls 3 instead.Upd: Attempted yet another playthrough of it. Nope. Still ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gabage. Except I found another con - the bosses are complete♥♥♥♥♥♥ They are bland and completely forgettable, and if they aren't pathetically easy, they're hard as balls because they depend solely on your damage output - you have to kill them before they flood the screen with their crap. What a waste of code this game is. Avoid it at all costs.			"

Wish it was a little more Castlevania level difficulty and less ""let's make it ultra frustrating"" level.

												It's embarrassing how hard this game is trying to be Dark Souls.  Thing is, though, if I wanted to play Dark Souls... I'd go play Dark Souls.  There's three of em now, surely there's at least one that'd handle my need for its particular brand of gameplay - I don't need a fourth one.I do appreciate the experiment of bringing Dark Souls to the 2D format, though.  I think I'd like S&S a lot more... or really, at all... if it wasn't so blatantly trying to be Dark Souls.  In many ways it could be considered like a progression of the Castlevania playstyle (but not Metroidvania/Castleroid style.)  The gameplay is solid and I understand the many reviews praising it, but while I think it's technically proficient and put together well, I also feel it suffers greatly from being way too similar to Dark Souls.  As I already said, if I wanted to play Dark Souls... I'd just go play Dark Souls.Also, the art style is just ♥♥♥♥ing horrible.  I guess environment design is okay, but all of the sprites and characters look like crap.  I know plenty of people like the art style, but I personally think it's crap.I got the game for free from a friend and that's probably the only way I'd ever play this game.  As it is, I've already had my fill.  No way I'd ever pay for this.Bottom line: if you want to play Dark Souls, go play Dark Souls and give this one a skip.			"

Wanna know why? cus its ♥♥♥♥ing trash. This is one of those games that people with cheap laptops. Very terrible port over to pc when you see ps4 buttons in the menu. Take this dark souls demented cousin♥♥♥♥♥♥game down.			"

												I am not down voting this for being a Dark Souls rip off, im not down voting it because it's a bad game, I am down voting it because it is uplayable with the weapon reach every character in this game has (including your own) The reach is imaginary and much MUCH bigger than the weapon itself making it utterly impossible to know whether or not you will get hit and forces you to roll everytime you are attacked, this is hard considering you will spend alot of time attacking or jumping in a fight, you know, FIGHTING THE ENEMY YOU ARE FACING. Cant recommend this game with the broken weapon reach.			"

												Every aspect of this game is STOLEN from Dark Souls. Devs call it an homage, but it's just another Dark Souls-like rip off. The gameplay feels clunky(not in the Dark Souls way). Everything is familiar if you've played a Souls/bloodborne game, but with none of the polish. Crashes, bugs, poor enemy AI, terrible map layout, and poor boss design and execution plague this game. I wanted to like this game being a fan of the Souls/borne series, but I cannot recommend this game until many things are fixed. One more thing, this game has garbage platforming.			"

												Dark Souls is my @SS, I bought this ""game"" because people kept talking stuff like ""oh! its a 2D dark souls"", ""what a great mix between castlevania and souls series"" and ""it's difficult"". The truth is that this thing is just a stupid ripoff rofl, I'm REALLY dispointed.I think I don't need to clarify that I'm a souls/borne fan, DS1 is my favorite game ever, but I also LOVE the old castlevania series. I've spent a stupid amount of time playing SOTN on my PS1 with my cousing, who suprisingly got EVERY single item in that game haha xD Those were really good times! But Salt and Sanctuary doesn't really appeal to me, in fact, it's frustrating, the OST is really annoying (there are a few tracks that keep repeating itself rofl), there are TRAPS HIDDEN everywhere (I know, Dark Souls has traps duh, but they are pretty obvious and fair, since the game shows you the mechanics and don't even try to hide stuff from you, they are there to incresse the challenge, not like the malicious ones in this game!), level design is just poor (it's not fun, what can I say =\), ""human"" characters are ugly (like really, they look like a 8 years old cartoon hahaha), the story is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too cheap (honestly, the lore here is more uninteresting than the game...) and finally, what is not Dark Souls is Castlevania LMAOSo yeah, the game does it right sometimes too, like the stones system for example, you can ""upgrade"" your bonfire, I mean, sanctuary with merchants, ""leaders"", blacksmiths, etc and the skill tree is GREAT (yet another copy *PoE* cof cof).But that is just too little to keep entertaining me, this game is cheap and it doesn't have a mind / heart of its own.""OH BUT THE GAME KNOWS THAT ITS ""INSPIRED"" BY DARK SOULS"" > again, inspired is my ♥♥♥♥♥!! Hyper Light Drifter (an absolutely AMAZING game) has some inspiration from DS and other way older games, but still, it is a great and unique thing! The devs of this software (ska studios) are so lazy and shameless that they couldn't even NAME THE GAME RIGHT rofl. Tell me, ""Salt and Sanctuary"" feels like a good name for you? I thought so hahaha, not even the name has creativity.. oh man.. what a waste of time..If you are looking for a good 2D game, go play hyper light drifter, that game is UNIQUE and most important F U N !I ""THINK"" that the problem here is that SaS is TRYING to be a Dark Souls, when Dark Souls is a thing by itself, so it doesnt work, and at last, From Software + Miyazaki are GENIOUSES, and CopyPaste Studios, ops sorry, Ska Studios ...¯\_(ツ)_/¯Yeah, I know my english is way worse than this game xD			"

												Hi, it seems I upset some very sensitive children with my last review, and was instructed by them to write more words. So let me start by saying, note to self, cannot write a negative review or children will harrass you on end for some unknown reason. Now about the game.If your in the mood for a sit back and have a few drinks game this isn't for you. The game while having some good elements, can be difficult if your not switched on. It can be unforgiving and frustrating at times if you want a fast pace revive and move on.To all the kids upset please forgive me, I hope I have not ruined your life.			"

												It's 2D Dark Souls. That's a bad thing.I had hoped that it could grab me where DS failed, that it could have been an improvement on it. But it has the same infuriating problems DS has, and then some.In 2016 there shouldn't be any games that have checkpoints instead of saving freely unless the checkpoints are frequent enough. They are not in this game.In 2016, no game should be made without a pause function. This game has none. How does a game not have a pause function? What the actual f*ck? What, nothing I have to do, like answer a phone call or the door or someone on IM is more important than playing this game? F*ck that, man.As with DS, when I have literally any other game of the ones I play, why would I play this and get angry and waste time running to the same spots over and over when I can achieve SO much more in other games?

												Does Not acutally have online multiplayer apposed to what it says on the store. Every enemy more so the bosses has phantom attack range and can turn around mid attack to hit you if you dodge past them, basically removing all chance you have of not taking damage  (Easiest seen with the second boss when she digs her sword into the ground and then somehow 180's whilst they are still in the ground to hit you).

												Hey, look, a Dark Souls-type game that doesn't suck. that's pretty suprising.The game has a number of flaws in it, but that hasn't stopped me from enjoying it thoroughly. Now the combat is supposed to be similar to the Souls series, but the Souls series has combat that works exceptionally well in a 3D environment, and when you put that kind of combat into a 2D game, it starts getting a bit hairy.The bosses have a few unfair bits about them, that i don't feel like getting into.Game runs well, it's fun, it's relatively extensive, and has local co-op.So if you want to play a Souls-like on a lower end machine, or you just want to try something different, then Salt and Sanctuary is the game for you.

												Disclaimer:  I've never actually played Dark Souls, so this is all new to me.  But I've seen videos of it. With that in mind: First of all, it's Dark Souls.  In 2D.  Just in case you didn't already know that. Now the big question is, ""will you die"".  Yes.  A lot.  It has the difficulty.The next question would be, does it feel right, and is there the right rhythm and fluidity there?Yes.  Both are done right. And then the art style:  The art is going to be different moving from 3D to 2D, of course.In this case, the colors are very washed out, intentionally I'm sure... but the detail is pretty substantial, particularly on characters, and the animation is filthy fluid/smooth thanks to the 2D skeletal animations. The heads of your character and NPC's are not right at all.  Which is quite a down-side.  But it kind of works, in portraying this as *slightly* less dreadfully serious than Dark Souls.The music is splendid!  What music I've heard from it, while obviously not as varied, seems much better than Dark Souls.  A lot of rock.  I'm a sucker for rock. The bosses work in a similar way to Dark Souls, though limited to 2D.  They are tough but beatable. I recommend this game if:A)  you finished all of the Dark Souls games and want to try something else or B)  you are intimidated by Dark Souls, and feel a 2D version MIGHT be a way to SLIGHTLY soften the process of acclimating yourself to the actual Dark Souls games(that's me). or...C)  You like ""metroidvania"" style games.  This game actually works really well as one of those. For me, it was that second one... starting out a little tamer... but that's not really how it works.This game may have less dimensions than Dark Souls.  But I don't get the impression it's easier. And it is definitely.  not.  easy.Oh and I did not get this game for free.  It wasn't even on sale.  I spent months wanting it, had to have it, then finally paid full price, and no regrets. Got Dark Souls on sale, haven't touched it yet.  Go figure. And yes, I'm doing a video series on the game, just look up ""the humble hunter"" on youtube.			"

												This game looks weird for the first look of it.But...I forgot about that after half an hour of playing it. The game has the same mechanics as Dark Souls and I'm playing Dark Souls 3 as well at the moment. It' s a relief and enjoyable activity to play this game. It can be punishing but more rewarding compared to Dark Souls and it's easier to preceed within the game. If you like single player games and don't want to rely on who's putting signs in front of a boss level, this game is a great entertainment. Plus I really like to play it with my boyfriend hot seat :)			"

												After being introduced to Dark Souls by my best friend, I craved for more. Didn't we all, those of us who got gud? I mowed through Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin and went well into NG+++. Then my best friend showed me Bloodborne on his PS4 and I wept knowing it would never come to PC, beating the ground helplessly. (If you work for Sony and you're reading this, have a heart. We would gladly pay 60 bucks for a measly Bloodborne port, much more than what it's for sale right now at Gamestop. I was there last week and it's only 20 bucks. At. Gamestop. The store that robs you only sells it for 20 bucks what the hell?)ANYWAY, finding Salt and Sanctuary completely stated my craving for a Bloodborne port on the pc. It plays just like the Souls series in a metroidvania beat-em-up fashion and it embraces several aspects of Bloodborne like trick weapons (there's a greatscissor type weapon called the Jaws of Death, check it out HOT DAMN), ""losing your souls"" feature where you will kill the enemy that killed you to retrieve your ""Salt"" (functions just the same as Blood Echoes and Souls), and more. If you TL;DR just understand this: This is an indie game which didn't drown and get forgotten despite it being released amidst a flood of many other indie games. It also rarely goes on sale, and when it does it never goes below $12. Those are the signs you should be looking for in a game. Now just get it, damn you.			"

												It's basically Dark Souls as a 2d sidescroller/metroidvania. If you like any one of those kinds of games, I highly recommend this game to you. Knowing that going in, I thought it would be trying too hard and that Dark Souls style combat and environments wouldn't work in 2d. And while there are a few things that take some getting used to (rolling to dodge in 2d being the main thing), it definitely works a lot better than I was expecting. If there's anything bad I can say about this game, it's that it's pretty short. My first playthrough of the game, I went in and finished it blind, and it took me a little over 12 hours, but honestly, that's almost exaclty the length I would expect for such a low price, and the game makes up for it with having very high replayability. The bosses are interesting and challenging, the atmosphere is dark and engaging, and the map is designed incredibly smoothly. This is absolutely a game worth checking out.			"

												Great game worth $20 for sure, only a few issuse i had with this game one is the boss figths are either super easy mode or very unfair and rely alot on luck of missing there random combo atacks. Another issue is some of the save points are far away from the boss so having a hard boss fight takes a good 5 mins just to get a rematch. third the keyboard is way to clunky to play this game that requires split second reactions so a hand controller is  a must, trust me on this ive broken a mouse and lost a few keys befor i took out the controller. So If you dont mind dying over and over spending somtimes hours on repeat boss fight you will enjoy this game. I give it a 8/10  "

The game also has some fun platforming elements and I really enjoyed the world design and metroidvania aspects of unlocking the different brands that allow you to access different areas of the game.  I have yet to try the local co-op but that sounds like a another great feature!Amazing work for a 2 person studio. If you like Dark Souls games then you will most likely love this game.  I really hope that they make another game like this...loved the 2D take on the souls genre! "

												Only played a little, but seems like a good game, most of thenegative reviews center around difficulty, controls, and Dark Souls obsessions.The game is good, not great, but good, grim and dark, gorey and brutal. Combat is basic so far as you have your dodge roll, your heavy and light strikes and your block, spells are also a thing.Downsides are that some things do seem a little off in terms of balacing, example being hitboxes seem a little bigger than should be, rolls tend to just stop on top of an enemy instead of passing through (did this more than a few times on the Sodden knight boss where I stopped mid roll at his feet and got slammed backwards by the hit i was dodging).It's a niche game, heavily stylised and very....grey.Those complaining about it being ""garbage"" need to take off the 'Souls Specs' and realise that this is a video game, made purely to make money and has taken advantage of a market that has recently had a resurgence and a gap created by the release and completion of Dark Souls 3. Games you may enjoy if you enjoy this would be Necropolis and of course Dark Souls. "

												Right off the bat i have to say the obvious thing, I loved this game because it's so similar to dark souls 1; but just beacause is so similar doesn't mean is a clone; S&S takes all the right things from the dark souls formula (no map, punishing difficulty, several classes) and adds it's own ideas to it.Some of the differences are that:- Salt (souls) is different than money, you only lose some money when you die, but all of your salt is stolen from the enemy that killed you, to retrieve the salt you have to slay the enemy (who is stronger because of the salt). - Sanctuaries (Bonefires) come in two kinds, those who only heal you and reset enemies and those which let you level up and summon merchants, for the second type of sanctuary you have to choose a covenant which affects different things like how your ""estus"" work.- The level up system come in two parts, when you level up you spend your salt and that increases some stats, but when you level up you also get a ""skill"" item which you can spend immediately or whenever you want which increases specifically one stat; this is great if you want to not risk your salt but do not want to actually level up yet.The gameplay mechanics and atmosphere feels and play like dark souls 1, the ""soul"" of the franchise is without a doubt there.Leaving aside the fact that this is a separate game from the soul series I literally think this is a way bettr sequel to dark souls 1 than dark souls 2 (which i disliked immensely), 10 out of 10.

												Great game that combines the mechanical difficulty of games like Dark Souls with the action platforming of games like Metroid. Great game all award that rewards patience and good execution. The visual style is beautiful and contributes strongly to the mysterious world that the game introduces you to. Played through the main campaign twice and am currently working my way through new game plus. Highly recommended.			"

												Amazing. Co Op is so much fun. Challenge is fair. My only real suggestion would be have a map. And not to rip off dark souls so hard. But can't complain. Game seemed to last forever. The only issue was getting lost ALL THE TIME. At a certain point you need to find out where to go next. This is just absolutely difficult. You just run around looking for one way to go somewhere. Lame. Just use a map.  That's all it needed.			"

												People say it's a side scrolling dark souls game, true but it does have unique mechanics that doesn't make it just a copy and paste. Bosses aren't that hard, maybe the first one because you still haven't gotten used to the controls, but the other bosses are fairly easy. The only things that I don't like is the amount of boring platforming and that the different creeds doesn't serve much purpose except for a different ending for each one			"

Even though this game is hard the satisfaction of overcoming a boss after dying some odd amount of time is sweet.this game is not for the weak and will eat you up and spit you out if you don't bring your A-game. all in all so far it's really fun and challenging. If you like Metroidvania's or Dark soul like games then pick this up.			"

												Alright, for anyone that's watched The Grumps play this, like I did, immediately though ""Hey, I can play Dark Souls with my friends? Sign me the f**k up!""No. It's so much better than that.I haven't actually play multiplayer, but here's my two cents worthPros:-Sound direction is gratifying-Diverse skillsets, encouraging multiple playthroughs-Enemies are all unique in their own way, making you think about how to approach them-A HUGE skilltree-Player upgrades beyond just equipment-Art direction-Boss encounters are epic battles, testing your wits and reflexes-Attention to detail on gore (blood splatter on walls, sword, etc)Cons:-It's so DARK visually (yes, that's the point, but it's led to more than a few times I thought there was a wall, there wasn't one and I fell to my death)-Music is minimal and forgettable-Multiple enemies have the potential to air juggle you, leading to some bulls**t deaths-Hit detection is weird for ledges, leading to akward platforming and more death via pitfalls-Grinding is basically manditory if you want to get past some areas and bosses due to either level or equipment limitations (a little nitpick, but a nitpick nonetheless)In the long run, if you're buying this game just for the multiplayer aspect, you're missing out. There's a lot more to this game than that.			"

												Salt and Sanctuary is a fantastic mix of the best elements from games such as Metroid, Castlevania, and the critically acclaimed Dark Souls series. From the very beginning of the game, players are drawn in by the surprisingly deep combat system, as well as traditional RPG elements such as inventory management, gear upgrades and a sprawling skill tree. The magic/prayer system is as intuitive as it is innovative, and rewards players who invest in 'multiclassing' with a variety of buffs and special skills. The co-operative play is, if anything, even more entertaining than single player, especially as summoned friends can progress anywhere in the game without artificial boundaries being set, and can even (if their faith is strong enough) revive their partners. Finally, the NG+ system creates a fresh level of challenge for players who have beaten the regular game, significantly upping enemy health and damage output.			"

												2D Souls is the best way to describe this game. Borrows heavily from the Souls franchise, while managing to outdo Souls games in terms of exploration thanks to the platforming mechanics. If you enjoy the Souls franchise or Metroidvania games, I highly recommend trying Salt & Sanctuary.UPDATE: After some more gameplay, I realized that this game suffers heavily from the lack of really interesting builds and equipment combinations. However, since S&S has no online component and thus no real PvP to begin with, it isn't that big of an issue, just may limit replayability a bit.			"

												So I happened to hear about Salt and Sanctuary through a random reddit thread.  I was intrigued.""It's like Dark Souls only 2D""""Lots of customization and rpg elements""""A good Metrovania clone""""Hard as week-old stale bread""So i decided to go ahead and pick it up...and proceeded to get b***h slapped by the first ""real"" boss (The Sodden Knight) over and over.  Yes this game is hard.  It's also very reminiscent of Dark Souls with a pinch of Metroidvania thrown in. The brands you unlock along the way give you access to old areas that were previously unattainable and your skill tree allows for some prety deep character customization. So most of the hype was on point.  However, what many people seem to have missed in their rush to compare Salt and Sanctuary to other games, is that this is a really fun game, set in it's own fully realized game world.  I've enjoyed every frustrating death and every rush of adrenaline that comes with defeating a boss or uncovering the next area to explore.Highly recommended, more than worth the $20 I spent.4.5 stale salty crusts out of 5.0Oh, and it has local co-op as well!  Which is a nice and salty butter cream icing on top.			"

												You know when you play a game and there are moments where it's so immersive, so intense, your brain implodes from all the awesome and sends shivers down your spine?This. This game.Salt and Sanctuary has the ability to do that in spades. Somewhere between the amazing boss battles (jumping about and slicing those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s down), the soundtrack (amazing), and the artistic world building I was always entertained while playing this game.This was actually the first 2D style game I've played that I literally could not put down. Ska Studios outdid themselves with this one, it is well worth the money.If intricate levels, well-designed fighting, lore, and occasionally yelling obscenities at your screen are what you like in a game, then buy this.If it's not... Still buy it.It may surprise you like it did for me. I went from “Eh, I’ll give this a go” to “This is the most fun I’ve had playing a game in ages” in the amount of time it took for the first boss to kick my♥♥♥♥♥(so like three seconds). "

												2D Dark Souls meets Metroid. Done by a small indie team. A lot of love in the details, but of course not as polished as a AAA title. Still a great game. Don't buy if you're allergic to challenges or have no orientation at all.			"

												I feel like it's safe to say that at first I pirated this game to see if it was any good.  After playing the game for a few houres, I needed to gives the devs the money they deserve.  I know this game looks like a dark souls clone, but there's 2 things that's close to dark souls are the atk/def stats, and endless deathand sadness.  other than that, it's compleatly diffrent.  the tree of skill is perfectly designed, and so is the platforming, 2 things dark souls dosn't have.  So yes, this game is inspired by dark souls, but it's NOT a clone, it's very diffrent			"

												Dark and Souls. This game takes so much influence from Dark Souls franchise that it's sometimes hard to remember I'm actually playing a hard 2D metroidvania. Here's why. First of all the game world has distinctive areas. You begin from a shore (after a short playable opening) and enter a grey building. Inside you'll find a shrine, similar to a bonfire from Dark Souls that lets you heal, level up and grants access to a merchant, blacksmith etc. Shrines also let you quick travel between them which saves you from many headaches since the map has so many secret rooms, areas, clifs and nooks that it takes some time to get used to the travelling. Using the shrine respawns every slain opponent (excluding bosses of course) as does bonfire in DS. Enemies. Most of them are your typical slow crawling zombies that takes couple of hits and pose little threat. Then there are the faster and smaller ones that are hard to catch and deal nasty damage. Big armored knights, huge hulking golems, wizards, skeletons, dragons, demons, abominations and hanged men + many, many more. Enemies, encounters and compositions varied in such ways that I feel the game encourages to experiment with gear and how to approach the fights. Gear/items. So. Many. Light/heavy armors, swords, axes, whips, ranged weapons, hammers, one and two-handed weapons, staffs, magic, prayers and shields. Usable items for temporary buffs, throwable weapons, different kinds of arrows etc. I played through the game as a cleric in light armors, wielding a one-handed mace with both hands for extra damage, using healing spells to stay alive longer struggles. Plot. I seriously don't know. I'm bad at concentrating in a story when I can be whacking enemies and killing huge bosses. There are NPC's aroung the world that chat with you and sell you stuff but the further I went to less I read. That's a pity but I feel that Salt and Sanctuary's strength lies elsewhere. It's in the medieval landscapes and in the combat that packs a serious punch. It's in the feeling of wonder and excitement, in failing and overcoming. Difficulty. Hard. I used a walkthrough at times to mitigate useless running around and to check couple of bosses weaknesses. I love hard games and play for the challenge and this was the best way for me to enjoy this adventure. Some bosses take many tries to beat and few might even force you to do some extra leveling before getting past them. Bosses are nicely varied also and look similar to DS's crooked mythos.It took me 20 hours to complete the game. I didn't get all the achievements but I did kill all the optional bosses and grinded quickly for a better gear at one point. I believe that it might take closer to 50 hours to do everything ""on your own"" but 20 hours was more that fine with me. Definitely worth the price. I've played games since NES so while I admit that the game was hard I felt that it was still very ""doable"". One of those games that take some patience ( a lot) to finish.  Some gear combinations might prove harder to use than others but I haven't tested this at all. I'm pretty sure I'll return to S&S with a different kind of character later since the leveling up forces your builds a bit limited and there's plenty of fun to be had still. You can also play with a friend on a same computer but I didn't try that either. Probably makes the game a lot more easier and more enjoyable for some.Pros. - Not too long not too short- Lot's of gear to choose from- Art (the human characters looked a little juvenile but I enjoyed everything else)- Challenging - Dark Souls the metroidvaniaCons.- Leveling doesn't encourage to try different things (pick a weapon class and stick to it or else!)- Confusing at times- Many ways to die in a way that feels unfair (dropping from high places or being knocked back to instadeath)- Couple of bosses will be a nerve wreck for some- Story was weakPointwise I would give Salt and Sanctuary 4/5 for it is a magnificent game and the first Dark Souls-like game for me that has been enjoyable and deep. I whole-heartedly recommend this game for everyone in search of a metroidvania game, something similar to DS but not DS or challenging and hard platformer with bleak and bloody atmosphere. Buy it to support the brave devs if nothing else. Thanks for the ride Ska Studios.			"

												The Game itself is good. No more to say, no more to compliment. I have unlocked all the achievements and I love it, cuz I'm a fan of Dark Souls. But there is one thing I have to remind all of you: this game does not support cloud save so back your save up if you want to play it on different computers.			"

												Great GameI played all Dark souls games and am a huge fan. This game is clearly a clone but with its own personality that make it shine. The main difference is that it is a 2D game. Tough even if not as unforgiving as DS. Very nice esthetics and gameply. If you like DS try it			"

												Only played a little, but seems like a good game, most of thenegative reviews center around difficulty, controls, and Dark Souls obsessions.The game is good, not great, but good, grim and dark, gorey and brutal. Combat is basic so far as you have your dodge roll, your heavy and light strikes and your block, spells are also a thing.Downsides are that some things do seem a little off in terms of balacing, example being hitboxes seem a little bigger than should be, rolls tend to just stop on top of an enemy instead of passing through (did this more than a few times on the Sodden knight boss where I stopped mid roll at his feet and got slammed backwards by the hit i was dodging).It's a niche game, heavily stylised and very....grey.Those complaining about it being ""garbage"" need to take off the 'Souls Specs' and realise that this is a video game, made purely to make money and has taken advantage of a market that has recently had a resurgence and a gap created by the release and completion of Dark Souls 3. Games you may enjoy if you enjoy this would be Necropolis and of course Dark Souls. "

												This is one of my favourite games on Steam.  The game feels very polished, the art is well done, the style and visuals are interesting and engaging, the combat is super fun and you can build your character in many different ways depending on your preference.  The game also has some fun platforming elements and I really enjoyed the world design and metroidvania aspects of unlocking the different brands that allow you to access different areas of the game.  I have yet to try the local co-op but that sounds like a another great feature!Amazing work for a 2 person studio. If you like Dark Souls games then you will most likely love this game.  I really hope that they make another game like this...loved the 2D take on the souls genre! "

												Holy Sh*t, this game... You try it for the first few minutes and you instantly fall in love with it.Salt and Sanctuary is basicly a game inspired by darksouls, But in 2D. The gameplay works the same: Be reckless, you get ♥♥♥♥ed over, Instead of souls, you have Salt and you spend those to level up and upgrade your gear.But compared to darksouls, this game stands out on it's own very easyly; Gameplay wise, it's rather different since it's a 2D game, the atmosphere feels claustrophobic once you enter in rooms, sometime in total darkness wich forces you to use up torches to see in the dark or to equip something that will give you a few hits of what's happening around you. Another huge feature of the game is the skill tree. In this skill tree, you start somewhere different depending of wich class you choose at the begining. the left side of the tree is mostely Oriented toward spells, sightly over it, Daggers, then swords, Hammers and so forth. Each point spent in the tree gives you stats that will help you toward  choosing your playstyle.For exeple; if you want to do a knight, you'll probably go to the top left where the tree have alot of STR upgrades, It's also where you'll find the skill required to weild better swords (Weapons range from level 0 to 4.) And along the way, you could also reach in the Heavy armor mastery skill along with shields, and some upgrades to your stamina and carry weight to be more efficient in close combat.Another similar thing to the darksouls is the fact that the world is one huge map, only difference is than instead of bonfires, you have Altars, where you can praise an entity. (Little tip; depending of your awnser at the begining of the game with the first NPC, you can actuly get different entity.) And in this altar, you can donate idols wich will spawn an NPC that will aid you in your journey (Merchant, Blacksmith, traveler...) Another thing is that if you get in an aleready claimed altar, you can level up like normal but cant donate  anything unless you join them.  though some NPCs might not apreciate it... Another thing that's different from darksouls is the curency. Yes it has salt. but it also have Gold. Gold is used to buy things from NPCs. Meaning that you don't have to worry about farming up as much souls to get the gears  and items that you want. Though, if you die, you loose a good 10% (I think it's 10%, from what I experienced.) of what you acumulated so far.So yeah. This is a basic summary of what the game is like.Pros: +Challenging+Looks realy smooth, The animations on the characters and enemy are realy satisfying to watch+The game ambiance is very well detailed and imersive.+Alots of variety in the class you'd like to play+Controls very well with a keyboard (No clue about controler.)+Enemys and bosses are fun to fight against...Cons:-...But some bosses are ridiculously easy if you have a good shield. Only exception are the ones that deals elemental damage.-I got lost. Alot. The game isnt holding your hand at all to show you where to go, wich is a bad but also a good thing since it encourages you to explore.-The platformings sections with certain enemys shooting you at a distance can be pretty anoying.Final note: 8.5/10 . The game is realy great, specialy if you love the souls series. Most players that liked those will get familiar with the game very quickly, and it's friendly enough to let new players play it without worrying too much.			"

												From the screenshots, I was expecting 2D Dark Souls - as the comparison is obvious. Surprisingly, what I played was a deepy involving experience, filled with adventure, constant danger, and fast paced, viceral combat. Salt and Sanctuary takes inspiration from the Souls series and flips it, incorporating Metroidvania elements across many beautiful environments. The design of the level builds the tension of exploration brilliantly, and the dramatic bosses and deadly monsters only increase it more - though, occasionally I found myself longing for more enemy variety. Often, you will fight smaller monsters, many of whom act and attack similarly; though this is minor complaint, as the variation of the larger monsters breaks this up immensely.The weapons feel fantastic to use, and the armour looks amazing. That said, for most of the game, what looked the best is what I used; armour values didn't seem to matter greatly. My only real major complaint is that many of the bosses relyed heavily on fire based attacks, meaning that to pass them, I would be required to stack fire resistance items, and that is all. This happened many times, certainly more than the other elements, and I saw little variation in other bosses elemental attacks.Still, Salt and Sanctuary is a finely crafted game - one that I will certainly play again. These minor issues don't compare to the sense of wonder and curiosity that this game gave me, and I am glad to have purchased it.			"

I can't not even explain how amazing this game is... Also if you check my playing time... don't trust my playing time... it's over 100h because I'm playing on PS4 always... I just got the pc version because the developers of the game deserve all the support. Two people made this awesome game.PD: Parrys are like Dark Souls 1.... ENJOY IT and BUY IT.			"

In my short time I've pounded my fist on my desk several times in rage as i watch all of my lovely salt stripped from me by some bull crap trap.  I love it.Completed the game aftet about 22 hours with a level 102 Sword/Mage build.  It was everything I had wanted.  The only bad part is that with a greatsword and magic build there are some really easy bosses.  But man, that was the most fun and frusterating game i've played in a while.  And i mean that in the best way.			"

												Right off the bat i have to say the obvious thing, I loved this game because it's so similar to dark souls 1; but just beacause is so similar doesn't mean is a clone; S&S takes all the right things from the dark souls formula (no map, punishing difficulty, several classes) and adds it's own ideas to it.Some of the differences are that:- Salt (souls) is different than money, you only lose some money when you die, but all of your salt is stolen from the enemy that killed you, to retrieve the salt you have to slay the enemy (who is stronger because of the salt). - Sanctuaries (Bonefires) come in two kinds, those who only heal you and reset enemies and those which let you level up and summon merchants, for the second type of sanctuary you have to choose a covenant which affects different things like how your ""estus"" work.- The level up system come in two parts, when you level up you spend your salt and that increases some stats, but when you level up you also get a ""skill"" item which you can spend immediately or whenever you want which increases specifically one stat; this is great if you want to not risk your salt but do not want to actually level up yet.The gameplay mechanics and atmosphere feels and play like dark souls 1, the ""soul"" of the franchise is without a doubt there.Leaving aside the fact that this is a separate game from the soul series I literally think this is a way bettr sequel to dark souls 1 than dark souls 2 (which i disliked immensely), 10 out of 10.

Product received for free
												Ska Studios originally made their mark on the video game scene with their Xbox 360 Live Arcade series, The Dishwasher which became a nigh-instant cult classic side-scrolling beat-em-up/hack-and-slash a la goldenaxe, double dragon, etc.a friend of mine was very hyped about those games and got one of them at least, on his xbox 360 and i got to watch him play the brutal carnage-filled work of art. it was interesting, to say the least.however, Steam's indie release friendliness has proven far more fruitful for newer developers and quite honestly i'm glad that the company has decided to bring what will probably be their biggest title for a long time, to steam, as well as many other platforms (including the vita apparently).Salt and Sanctuary is a strange metroid-vania beat-em-up/platform/hack-and-slash side-scroller hybrid that takes the best of Ska's original Dishwasher series in terms of stylization and function, and mixes it with features from the most popular of brutal, unforgiving hack-and-slashers to-date: the Dark Souls franchise. this is no mere 'souls clone', and although it may not be for everyone, it is a gem of a game that i don't see getting one-upped for awhile.you play as a shipwrecked survivor (whom you design a bit, yourself) who was originally enlisted to protect someone and after a bad night on the seas... have lost track of that person... and you have also been shipwrecked in a strange land, seemingly overburdened with undead and bandits... and giant bearwolf things... yeah...so here's the breakdown: if you like metroidvanias, especially dark, grotesque, atmospheric artsy-ish games, you may want to give this one a look. if you like darksouls and don't mind side-scroll platforming, you should probably check this out. if you grew up with some of the craziest nes, snes and sega genesis games out there like double dragon, golden axe, battletoads, and so many more beat-em-up platformers, you may enjoy this title as well. so here's the scores1) GRAPHICS- 9/10the graphics are the most artistic thing about this title, and what sets it apart from other games. it has similarities to ska's other hit series the dishwasher, but it is not a clone of that in terms of style or details. it's kind of its own thing. and it does what it does quite well. my only gripe is that sometimes i don't see an enemy until i'm walking into it and then... i'm getting clawed at ._. but these visuals are stunning to say the least.2) SOUND EFFECTS/MUSIC- 10/10I havent let the music set in too much yet or had it up very loud but it really does paint the atmosphere nicely when it's there. it feels retro at times but has a modern-tech sound as well so that it doesn't just chiptune you to death while you're trying to emmerse yourself. it fits the game well. a more pixelated game may have benefitted from a more cartoonish or chiptunish soundtrack but this game has what it needs for sounds and you'll not have much of a gripe here yourself, i am sure.3) STORYLINE- ??/10i like what i've found so far on the story but i'm REALLY not that far in and can't say much about it so i'm just going to leave it at... it's interesting, but in the same vein as the souls series, it's not extremely story-based so you don't learn a whole lot at first... possibly ever... but it's enough to be intriguing.4) GAMEPLAY- 9/10it's solid. i'm struggling to learn some of the weapons i've found and many seem a bit harder to wield than they should be, like the hitboxes are very specific and the area of your weapon closer to the hilt on a longer weapon won't hurt enemies it seems, but if you learn the hitbox area and timing you can typically do pretty well here. if you have a one handed weapon and a shield, or a two handed weapon, it seems blocking is a viable option, and a necessity. timing is everything here as well... it's also a bit too easy to get overwhelmed with enemies that 'spawn' behind you and in front, and some of which are hard to see until you're getting pounded by five to ten guys, some of which can do some harsh damage... ugh. but, as per the souls series, you drop your experience if you die once and have to go back for it- the twist is, the enemy who killed you takes it and you have to seek revenge to get it back. if you die while an enemy still has your experience, you lose what he had forever... ouch. this can be a bit unforgiving, and with the few clunky things this game has going against it, may turn some away, but if you are a souls fan at all you are used to this sort of grind. thankfully there doesnt seem to be a durability factor in this but i could be wrong. i hope i'm not, because although that worked in the souls games, i don't want it in this one.OVERALL- 9.5/10seriously, this game is pretty epic so far. i've heard you can get up to like 30 hours from one playthrough, which isn't bad for the price (and if you get it on sale that's a damn good amount of hours for one playthrough, and the game has definite replayability). if you like souls games, metroidanias, beat-em-ups, hack-and-slashers, horror-ish games, grindfests, gorefests, brutal, unforgiving (yet mostly fair) experiences, and/or indie games, you should check this out, for sure. maybe wait until a sale if you feel the price is too high for you or you're still unsure after reading reviews... but definitely look into it. i warn you though, sales don't seem to come often for this one... but it's new-ish, so that's to be expected.

												Hands down... my personal ""Game of the Year 2016""Just recently came out on the PS Vita, therefore it is THE de facto, ""One and Only"" Dark Souls-like game on any handheld console.   I wouldnt try to compare this to the Castlevania games because S&S has its own character, or more accurately it is pretty much a Metrovania game with Dark Souls action RPG gameplay.  So, If you like Dark Souls + Castlevania, then you will love Salt and Sanctuary.Likes: The overall world level design is pretty interesting.The background/zone level designs are all unique and creative making your journey around the island feel less dull and repeative when you grind for levels and loot for crafting. There are lots of short cuts to open,lots of zones to explore, lots of bosses to fight, a nice variety of routes to certain bosses and certain collecting of ""brands"" aka key character abilities like in Metroid, so like in the first Dark Souls game its not completely full on linear progression, but rather it's linear with multiple branches. Ofcourse there are what I would call, ""key PLOT bosses/zones"" that are significant enough where YOU HAVE TO BEAT in order to progress.Also the Boss names/designs are REALLY REALLY COOL, enough said on that, and ofcourse there is LORE descriptions in thier item drops.Also just like in Dark Souls you can CUSTOMIZE the balls out of your character, so enough can be said about that for sure.One thing of note, the very first great sword you find is BROKEN (OP'd) as Hell, which makes going through your first playthrough fairly do-able, especially if you use poison builds.The travel system is pretty conveinant just like in Dark Souls and depending how well you utilize the ""Make Offerings"" feature at your ""Sanctuaries/Shrines"" which are your  NPC merchants/crafters/covenenant specific uses.Well I could on and on about how much I like S&S but its TOO LONG TO LIST lolDislikes:Sadly, the character art design is kinda bad.  It looks kinda cheap/lazy, and character features looks like those animated characters of that electro punk band Gorillaz, except Gorillaz looks WAY better.  I think this game's character creator is probably the worst part of this game which was unfortunately a turn off to some people who look down on indie games like this.However I do feel the equipment you pick later on kinda makes up for it, like the Bloodbrow set which is obviously a nice inspriational nod to Bloodborne including an NPC you meet who wears the set, and gives you lore about the ""Bloodbrow Hunters"" fighting ""Beasts"" lolIt's pretty sick looking, and there are also other good looking equip sets you can find or grind from enemies like the Split Swordsman.Bottom line the inital character designs are terrible, but you can find equipment that does look cool on your character.And speaking of equipment, ugh....the Inventory menu is kind of a lazy jank♥♥♥♥♥mess. Don't be fooled upon first impression look of a ""Souls-like"" asethetic but whenever you pick up items/gear/weapons and etc. it is sorted in the order of what and when you picked up first.  THERE IS NO WAY TO ORGANIZE your inventory, except drop everything ONE BY ONE in the order you want it as.Yes, I know this is a very nit picky criticism but damn its annoying as hell for OCD guys like myself that wants my sets in a particularly place and order.As far as music, not a whole of lot variety, every boss has the same common boss music which is fine,  however this game did do the FINAL BOSS a huge justice by having its own unique music, even the map before the final boss has its own unique music which was really cool upen first visit.  And as you grind levels and loot through out the game you can occasionaly get those sick ambient heavy metal riffs which is something Dark Souls games doesnt have, so that is a nice touch.Last thing that I didnt like is some of the bullcrap platforming shenanigans in later levels like those platforms where they disappear after 2 3 seconds, and you have to time your self FOR EACH AND EVERY SINGLE disappearing platform, which was ANNOYING AS HELL,  and in some extreme places if you miss the platform YOU FALL TO YOUR DEATH. However I believe it was just one Zone where you had to deal with the bullcrap disappearing platform garbage, and it is beatable, not impossible but annoying as crap.Well that's my two cents, and I hope you guys enjoy this awesome game and for reading my insights, and ofcourse apologies to any spelling/grammar freaks for burning your OCD.  Cheers! :)			"

Many people purcahsed this game and never were ever to play it, or it worked just long enough to no longer be valid for a refund then stopped working.Edit: Latest patch finally addressed this problem.

												People say it's a side scrolling dark souls game, true but it does have unique mechanics that doesn't make it just a copy and paste. Bosses aren't that hard, maybe the first one because you still haven't gotten used to the controls, but the other bosses are fairly easy. The only things that I don't like is the amount of boring platforming and that the different creeds doesn't serve much purpose except for a different ending for each one			"

												Very fun and addictive game for Dark Soul veterans and casual gamers alike. The leveling system is very similar to the Sphere Grid of Final Fantasy X and allows some nice customization. This game has a few decent things going for it but the biggest issue with this game is balancing, Strength builds completely outclass dexterity builds in every single way. Don't bother going for a dagger build because you will be hacking away at trash mobs for 5+ hits when a two hander can destroy nearly everything in one or two hits. Magic was nerfed but still recks late game and New game+ and so on. Despite this the game is very much worth the price tag.			"

												1. Gameplay: It is really fun. Some bosses may be very hard for certain characters but one way or another, you beat them. Trust me, i have killed my first boss in twenty-somethingth attempt and still manage to beat the game. If you decide this game is too hard for you, just make a two-handed warhammer/axe character and wear no armour. Its the unofficial easy mode for this game.2. Story: It is told like dark souls, through item/skill descriptions and npcs. Every boss and every place have its story if you are patient enough. If not, just check reddit for Drowned Tome. A guy named Asuko_XIII put everything together. He really did a good job so kudos to him :)2. Soundtrack: Eerie and really enhances the atmosphere. Just check the trailer :)3. Graphics: Art style may be off putting at first but it grows on you.4. Multiplayer (Local): I havent played it, but by the looks of it, dont expect much.Disclaimer: Although i really like this game, main reason i wrote the review was to get the badge for the steam awards.  The last boss deserves the ""Villan Most in need of a hug"" award   "

												Salt and Sanctuary is a perfect recreation of an already perfect game. Similar to the Dark Souls games, S&S Takes a new direction in making is a Platformer with co-optional gameplay. My family and I had the time of our lives not only trying to survive, but seeing how many times the other could die in the dumbest ways. I would recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of more serious combat and unforgiving mechanics. It took hours to learn and clear a single boss in the later game. A game worth playing.			"

												Great game worth $20 for sure, only a few issuse i had with this game one is the boss figths are either super easy mode or very unfair and rely alot on luck of missing there random combo atacks. Another issue is some of the save points are far away from the boss so having a hard boss fight takes a good 5 mins just to get a rematch. third the keyboard is way to clunky to play this game that requires split second reactions so a hand controller is  a must, trust me on this ive broken a mouse and lost a few keys befor i took out the controller. So If you dont mind dying over and over spending somtimes hours on repeat boss fight you will enjoy this game. I give it a 8/10  "

The game eventually gives you a similar Souls experience, just in 2D, as you side-scroll your way through bosses, secrets, and mobs of enemies throughout fantastic level design. The biggest issue that I had with the game was that I suck at Metroid-Vania style platforming (especially ledge grabbing) and die to fall damage a bit too often.			"

												Salt and Sanctuary is a fantastic mix of the best elements from games such as Metroid, Castlevania, and the critically acclaimed Dark Souls series. From the very beginning of the game, players are drawn in by the surprisingly deep combat system, as well as traditional RPG elements such as inventory management, gear upgrades and a sprawling skill tree. The magic/prayer system is as intuitive as it is innovative, and rewards players who invest in 'multiclassing' with a variety of buffs and special skills. The co-operative play is, if anything, even more entertaining than single player, especially as summoned friends can progress anywhere in the game without artificial boundaries being set, and can even (if their faith is strong enough) revive their partners. Finally, the NG+ system creates a fresh level of challenge for players who have beaten the regular game, significantly upping enemy health and damage output.			"

												Holy Sh*t, this game... You try it for the first few minutes and you instantly fall in love with it.Salt and Sanctuary is basicly a game inspired by darksouls, But in 2D. The gameplay works the same: Be reckless, you get ♥♥♥♥ed over, Instead of souls, you have Salt and you spend those to level up and upgrade your gear.But compared to darksouls, this game stands out on it's own very easyly; Gameplay wise, it's rather different since it's a 2D game, the atmosphere feels claustrophobic once you enter in rooms, sometime in total darkness wich forces you to use up torches to see in the dark or to equip something that will give you a few hits of what's happening around you. Another huge feature of the game is the skill tree. In this skill tree, you start somewhere different depending of wich class you choose at the begining. the left side of the tree is mostely Oriented toward spells, sightly over it, Daggers, then swords, Hammers and so forth. Each point spent in the tree gives you stats that will help you toward  choosing your playstyle.For exeple; if you want to do a knight, you'll probably go to the top left where the tree have alot of STR upgrades, It's also where you'll find the skill required to weild better swords (Weapons range from level 0 to 4.) And along the way, you could also reach in the Heavy armor mastery skill along with shields, and some upgrades to your stamina and carry weight to be more efficient in close combat.Another similar thing to the darksouls is the fact that the world is one huge map, only difference is than instead of bonfires, you have Altars, where you can praise an entity. (Little tip; depending of your awnser at the begining of the game with the first NPC, you can actuly get different entity.) And in this altar, you can donate idols wich will spawn an NPC that will aid you in your journey (Merchant, Blacksmith, traveler...) Another thing is that if you get in an aleready claimed altar, you can level up like normal but cant donate  anything unless you join them.  though some NPCs might not apreciate it... Another thing that's different from darksouls is the curency. Yes it has salt. but it also have Gold. Gold is used to buy things from NPCs. Meaning that you don't have to worry about farming up as much souls to get the gears  and items that you want. Though, if you die, you loose a good 10% (I think it's 10%, from what I experienced.) of what you acumulated so far.So yeah. This is a basic summary of what the game is like.Pros: +Challenging+Looks realy smooth, The animations on the characters and enemy are realy satisfying to watch+The game ambiance is very well detailed and imersive.+Alots of variety in the class you'd like to play+Controls very well with a keyboard (No clue about controler.)+Enemys and bosses are fun to fight against...Cons:-...But some bosses are ridiculously easy if you have a good shield. Only exception are the ones that deals elemental damage.-I got lost. Alot. The game isnt holding your hand at all to show you where to go, wich is a bad but also a good thing since it encourages you to explore.-The platformings sections with certain enemys shooting you at a distance can be pretty anoying.Final note: 8.5/10 . The game is realy great, specialy if you love the souls series. Most players that liked those will get familiar with the game very quickly, and it's friendly enough to let new players play it without worrying too much.			"

												From the screenshots, I was expecting 2D Dark Souls - as the comparison is obvious. Surprisingly, what I played was a deepy involving experience, filled with adventure, constant danger, and fast paced, viceral combat. Salt and Sanctuary takes inspiration from the Souls series and flips it, incorporating Metroidvania elements across many beautiful environments. The design of the level builds the tension of exploration brilliantly, and the dramatic bosses and deadly monsters only increase it more - though, occasionally I found myself longing for more enemy variety. Often, you will fight smaller monsters, many of whom act and attack similarly; though this is minor complaint, as the variation of the larger monsters breaks this up immensely.The weapons feel fantastic to use, and the armour looks amazing. That said, for most of the game, what looked the best is what I used; armour values didn't seem to matter greatly. My only real major complaint is that many of the bosses relyed heavily on fire based attacks, meaning that to pass them, I would be required to stack fire resistance items, and that is all. This happened many times, certainly more than the other elements, and I saw little variation in other bosses elemental attacks.Still, Salt and Sanctuary is a finely crafted game - one that I will certainly play again. These minor issues don't compare to the sense of wonder and curiosity that this game gave me, and I am glad to have purchased it.			"

In my short time I've pounded my fist on my desk several times in rage as i watch all of my lovely salt stripped from me by some bull crap trap.  I love it.Completed the game aftet about 22 hours with a level 102 Sword/Mage build.  It was everything I had wanted.  The only bad part is that with a greatsword and magic build there are some really easy bosses.  But man, that was the most fun and frusterating game i've played in a while.

												I still haven't finished the game and I got it shortly after release.  It is a solid platformer with satisfying, yet difficult combat.  The length of the game is plenty and there is all sorts of secrets and loot to discover.  I had a hard time going back to this game because it came out the week before Dark Souls 3 and it just doesn't compare.  The co-op gameplay is really fun and was implemented quite well. If you like challenging platformers and skill-based combat systems, you will enjoy this game.  It is deceptively deep and feels more like a Castlevania title than a typical left-to-right side-scrolling experience.  There is a HUGE skill tree and lots of ways to customize your character/build.  I like my pumpkin helmet.  I'm the type of Steam user that collects games but only finish my favorites.  It kind of feels like playing a Zelda game on a game boy after playing Twilight Princess, it's still a great experience but doesn't compare to similar AAA titles.  Since I plan to finish it someday soon, I think I would give it a 4/5.			"

												Even though it's a little lacking in terms of creativity, the gameplay more than makes up for it! Some people may disagree, but I think the combat and platforming are well-done. Some traps can be a little annoying, but they're not a problem if you pay enough attention. The game provides a nice sense of satisfaction when you unlock a short-cut through the honeycomb tunnels that the map is made of. This is a fantasic game to play with a friend.			"

												A rather brilliant Metroidvania homage to Soulsborne.Sweet- Satisfying combat that rewards careful planning- Environments look wonderful and obviously a lot of effort has gone into the world design- Loads of enemy variety to keep things fresh throughout- Loads of great, memorable boss battles with some lovecraftian influences- Interesting character progression system that's flexibile enough to allow for some creative build design- Lots of playstyle variety with loads of magic to choose from as well as distinct melee and ranged weapon types- For the most part, the controls are fluid and responsive- Creed system adds a nice layer of personal world development and customisation- Great atmosphere and some interesting loreSalty- There's no inventory management and no external storage, so inventory becomes cluttered and unmanageable- Soundtrack is very limited which seems a bit of a diservice to the large environment, enemy and boss variety- Some enemies need some functionality changed. In particular the teleporting skeletons are a bit ridiculous and just frustrate rather than challenge. I actually thought this was bugged at first.- An online multiplayer would have been niceApart from those few small annoyances I thoroughly enjoyed everything on offer and I'm impressed with the quality of the experience from such a small development team. I'd certainly absorb a sequel or a spiritual successor.			"

												Recommended with caveats. Like Dark Souls 2, this is a deeply flawed game that yet manages to be entertaining. Primary irritations include:· enemies that spawn on top of you with no way to detect or affect them beforehand· death causing an enemy to appear that, though weak, drains your entire stamina bar if you try to block it and can kill you quickly, even if you don't care about the damn salt· little explanation of mechanics (much like Dark Souls, in a bad way)· there's a LOT of platforming, and while it's better than any DS platforming, it often requires too-precise jumps· poorly lit areas· unattractive art, but that's a personal thingThese issues get really bad in the swamp, and I'm honestly halfassing my play at this point, because it's tedious to retry it for the 20th time after slightly mistiming a jump and dying. Watching a stream is more entertaining.			"

												Salt & Sanctuary does a lot of things Dark Souls did right, with it's own unique twist. The 2D environment gave it it's own unique difficulty with the platforming traps. The skill system is, IMO, a much better system than DS's simple stat levelling, offering the ability to make a truly unique character for every playthrough. The fact that an average playthrough doesn't take that much time also helps with replayability.Overall a very fun romp and a very nice surprise from the indie scene. I really hope they make a sequel with more weapon variety.			"

												Basically a Castlevania + Dark Souls hybrid. Difficult, but mostly fair. If I had to put up a complaint, it would be that sometimes enemies can patrol off-screen or between areas, but still hit you while you have no real way to retaliate. It doesn't happen that often, though. There's a skill tree system, which allows you to develop your character how you please - it's very remniscent of Path of Exile, in that there are individual nodes that increase parameters, but you can reach another class' section of the tree if you so desired.The game will test your patience, so I recommend stepping away and coming back when you end up dying a lot. Definitely worth the buy, though.			"

												Short of it: Mostly for people who like Souls games for the Souls games (with more metroidvania sprinkled in) and not the co-op/PvP. Not everyone will like it, but ehh.. who cares if they don't?Souls-like that unfortunately lacks online multiplayer, but you can still couch co-op and optionally even PvP with your friend if you really must. This is a simpler and more compressed experience with more Metroidvania inspirations than Souls games had and some features of its own. A little hit&miss for lovers of Souls style games due to the limitations of the multiplayer and other limitations, but if you don't look it as trying to be another proper Souls game (which it isn't, it's 2D for crying out loud), you can enjoy it perfectly.Unfortunately unlike Souls games, this one denies you from using gear you don't have unlocked the skill for, which is kinda nonsense, but it also sort of makes sense since your lacking stats in Souls games would soft block such things anyway.I've enjoyed it so far, lacking some hints where I can go in some parts, but I'm still trying to beat it. Kinda met a boss that my build is not as great for as it was for the ones before, but heyyyy, not like that isn't the norm in Souls games with gimmick builds :p			"

												This is by far one of the best games I've played this year. Just saying it's a 2D Dark Souls clone doesn't do the game justice. It definitely straight up copies most of Dark Souls best elements, but it does so expertly not mindlessly, and intermingles it with it's own rich lore and phenomenal Metroidvania style of exploration and plattforming.It's an incredibly atmospheric game, even after having played it through once it still gave me chills on subsequent playthroughs.It offers an insane amount of possible and effective character builds, far more than any of the aforementioned games.So if you enjoy games such as Dark Souls, Bloodborne, Metroid, Castlevania: SotN, you must play this game, it is easily just as good any of these classics.

												I purchased Salt and Sanctuary expecting another Dark Souls experience to tide me over until the next dlc for Dark Souls 3. What i recieved was a brutally unforgiving game with similair mechanics as Dark Souls, but 2D. Failing again and again it reminded me of the first time I played Dark Souls, and how engrossed I became into this one little game. The map design is brilliant for being just a 2D and the play style is refreshing compared to its 3D counterparts. As one would expect this game is rich in lore and story, but to truly understand it you must research on your own in the wikis and forums (just like Dark Souls). By the end of the first playthrough I felt very pleased and satisifed as I once was with the ending of the first Dark Souls. If you enjoy those types of games that make you rage and ""gitgud"", then this gem is for you.P.S. I never comment/review anything EVER, so this being my first I felt more people needed to learn and play this masterpiece :^)			"

												Pros: 1) Good Combat System - attacks flow together nicely and there is a sizeable variety of weapons2) Unique Bosses - there are a few that are a little similar but they usually force you to use varied stategies against them.3) Optional Bosses - Self explanatory4) interconnected world - all one map that has secret passages all over that allow you to move back to earlier areas easier5) Variety of Builds - from the quick light armored fighter, to the heavy armored warrior with a massive shield, down to spellcasters with a nice assortment of spellsCons:1) shift in art style from player character to enemies and environment (felt like mixing Salvador dali style art with something like the powerpuff girls)2) Iron Rampart a sheild that exists and counters nearly everything once you get it (takes a lot of strategy out of the game)3) Loss of 10% of current gold each time you die with no way to retrieve it. (this really limited the sense of exploration because it gave you an even greater punishment for dying) This becomes a problem later on in the game when the path forward isn't always clear. 4) Less skill based than dark souls, I think this is best shown as while you are blocking it blocks all sides rather than just the side the sheild is facing. 5) Storytelling - Lackluster storytelling, very little lore in game just item description that don't seem to come together very well.6) Punishing Rather than Challenging - Often this game had trap rooms without a warning which makes you learn through repetition rather than learning and overcoming the obstacles by stategy (seems to use memorization for a challenge rather than a difficult puzzel)7/10 worth a single playthough.

												I was looking for the longest time for a side scrolling RPG-like game to satisfy an itch I had. This game most definitely satisfies that itch and then some. The game can be described by using the names of two other games, which have become their own genre - Metroidvania and Dark Souls. I will say this game seems a lot more forgiving than Dark Souls, but don't let that catch you with your guard down. You will certainly have your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you if you get cocky, no matter your level. Much like Dark Souls, it requires patience, trial and error, and a thirst for adventure. Highly recommend.			"

												While the human character designs are rather poor, the monsters look great and the gameplay is a well balanced blend of Dark Souls and Metroid. Souls veterans may find it a bit on the easy side and the controller button layout is... rather confusing, but it's still a fun time.That being said, I will give one caveat to this recommendation. As you progress through the early midgame, we get two bosses in a row which are absolutely infuriating. The first is called ""the tree of men"" and it combines a lot of ledge-grabbing at the very top of a jump (the most finicky control aspect in an otherwise tight game) with usually instant death if you fail. Then you get the ""Disemboweled Husk"" which is fine on his own. Challenging, sure. Aggressive, does a lot of damage, but fine. The problem is the run-back. The enemies are aranged so it's nearly impossible to avoid them as you would normally do in a run-back, so either you die or you fight them. But fighting them takes a while, because of the flying enemies that always float out of reach whenever you try to hit them and take really too many hits to kill. Basically what I'm saying is that, like Dark Souls, there are several parts of this game which are aggrevating due to poor design. However S&S has more of them, and they're more aggrevating. Still good overall but... there are a few serious black marks.			"

												So far it's proving to be everything I had been led to believe it was; that is really very good indeed.  I've not played Dark Souls and I'm bothered or interested in comparisons.  In its own right this is a great game, its uncompromising, darkly beautiful and very well done. It does very definitely get under your skin and though I've not played much yet I am very much looking forward to our relationship developing, albeit in a thoroughly hatsh and unforgiving way...

												I was looking for the longest time for a side scrolling RPG-like game to satisfy an itch I had. This game most definitely satisfies that itch and then some. The game can be described by using the names of two other games, which have become their own genre - Metroidvania and Dark Souls. I will say this game seems a lot more forgiving than Dark Souls, but don't let that catch you with your guard down. You will certainly have your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you if you get cocky, no matter your level. Much like Dark Souls, it requires patience, trial and error, and a thirst for adventure. Highly recommend.			"

												So far it's proving to be everything I had been led to believe it was; that is really very good indeed.  I've not played Dark Souls and I'm bothered or interested in comparisons.  In its own right this is a great game, its uncompromising, darkly beautiful and very well done. It does very definitely get under your skin and though I've not played much yet I am very much looking forward to our relationship developing, albeit in a thoroughly hatsh and unforgiving way... Just buy it, seriously.			"

												It's basically a love letter to Dark Souls, set in 2D. Fluid movement and combos, amazing level design that rewards exploration, traps that punish those who leap before they look, and a wide variety of enemies at nearly every turn.  It even has those messages people leave everywhere to help (or mislead) you!The only area it falls short in is not having online coop.  HOWEVER, local coop is available.			"

												This is by far one of the best games I've played this year. Just saying it's a 2D Dark Souls clone doesn't do the game justice. It definitely straight up copies most of Dark Souls best elements, but it does so expertly not mindlessly, and intermingles it with it's own rich lore and phenomenal Metroidvania style of exploration and plattforming.It's an incredibly atmospheric game, even after having played it through once it still gave me chills on subsequent playthroughs.It offers an insane amount of possible and effective character builds, far more than any of the aforementioned games.So if you enjoy games such as Dark Souls, Bloodborne, Metroid, Castlevania: SotN, you must play this game, it is easily just as good any of these classics.

												As someone who doesn't really like Dark Souls, all the constant comparisons to Dark Souls with this game really worried me. I primarily was looking at this game to play another Metroidvania type game, and thought a game on the more difficult side would be refreshing. Let me just say, this game is really great. The similarities to Dark Souls come mostly from the difficulty and leveling system, which is basically identical. But the 2D platforming and exploration parts of this game are truly excellent, and I've had a blast trying to find my way through the dark caves and the towns and everything in between. The game is really reminicent of old NES games where memory played a huge key. There are lots of traps that, should you run into them, may damage you significantly or even kill you. There are a lot of enemies that may die with one hit, but if you fail to see them, or mistime a swing of your sword, those enemies can kill you and you lose all your salt to level up. I really liked the emphasis on memory in combination with 2D platforming and exploration since it's exactly what I wanted this type of game to be. So, even if you're like me and don't really like Dark Souls, this game offers something for other people as well.			"

												I never tried the souls games before, but as a Metroidvania fan I had to check out a 2D souls game since I sincerely believe Metroidvania and LoZ were the basis and inspiration for the souls games, but enough history lesson. Man am I loving this game, it's gorgeous from beginning to end (especially the end), the combat and controls are so tight and smooth, and the audio is just mesmerizing (including the music). It has all the respawning enemies/backtracking elements from Metroidvania/Souls games so there's never a dull moment. Simply put this is a game heavy with atmosphere, exploration, tight combat, and very fun lore, there's a little bit of platforming as well if that's your thing. If you like Souls or/and Metroidvania you will love this. 10/10, can't recommend this game enough.			"

												this game can be very accurately called a 2D Dark Souls but the reason I like it is because it's one of the best Metroidvanias I've ever played. Symphony of the Night is one of my favorite games of all time and Castlevania as a whole is a series that's left an itch unscratched ever since Order of Ecclesia. This game scratches that itch. I enjoy it far more than any modern indie Metroidvania on Steam. It understands what made exploring the old school Metroid games and the handheld Castlevania games an amazing, immersive adventure.

												I purchased Salt and Sanctuary expecting another Dark Souls experience to tide me over until the next dlc for Dark Souls 3. What i recieved was a brutally unforgiving game with similair mechanics as Dark Souls, but 2D. Failing again and again it reminded me of the first time I played Dark Souls, and how engrossed I became into this one little game. The map design is brilliant for being just a 2D and the play style is refreshing compared to its 3D counterparts. As one would expect this game is rich in lore and story, but to truly understand it you must research on your own in the wikis and forums (just like Dark Souls). By the end of the first playthrough I felt very pleased and satisifed as I once was with the ending of the first Dark Souls. If you enjoy those types of games that make you rage and ""gitgud"", then this gem is for you.P.S. I never comment/review anything EVER, so this being my first I felt more people needed to learn and play this masterpiece :^)			"

												Salt and Sanctuary is a true tribute to the Souls series. Everything that makes the Souls games great is there and intact in 2d form, though there are other elements that resemble games such as Castlevania more. Therein, lies the root of the game's problems. A middling plot, a somewhat questionable art style, and some subpar design choices unfortunately mar the greatness of the game's vistas, sense of progression and variety, and absurdly tight and rewarding gameplay that'll just make you not want to put the game down until you've beaten it. Had this game been less -else, and more -souls, it would have been perfect in every sense. As it is, the pros more than outweigh the cons, and it's a must buy for fans of Dark Souls at any price range.			"

												If you are someone looking for a refreshing experience from the Souls style of game then Salt and Sanctuary is for you. Mixing the beloved Souls formula with 2D platforming and other elements, Salt and Sanctuary is a fantasic product that really rewards the player for their feats. If I did have a few major issues with this game is certain weapons and styles are obivous superior than others. I used a greatsword for the majority of the game and simple flew past many of the bosses. Another big issue is although the game looks really good and is impressive at times, it often blends together. Many maps loop back into one another like Dark Souls 1 but the areas end up look so similar at times I could not name where I was without trouble. It's not that big of a deal but it's very noticable when you play long enough. The Challenge of the game is so and so as well. Sometimes I question if the boss I fought was really a boss while other times I wondered why it was so difficult. Witch of the Lake and The tree fire-spraying boss are great examples of this. The platforming is okay and it's only when you get the power-ups that the platform is actually fun and it becomes easy to travel. Overall if your looking for a Dark Souls game that is close to Dark Souls 1 while shaking things up, Salt and Sanctuary is the game for you.			"

												An amazing tribute to the Souls genre and a worthy addition to that pantheon. It understands the fundamentals that makes Dark Souls great and respects them.It also adds it's own twists, this isn't a ripoff or a clone but an inspired production+ Combat that blends deliberate stamina-based combat with combos and skills+ Freeform playstyle, switch easily between weapons and styles to suit your needs+ Nightmarish, interconnected world. Superbly done and easily comparable to any Metroid-vania+ Implicit storytelling reveals a deep and mysterious world, look up The Drowned Tome for lore explanation ~Dodges can be a bit difficult to judge, and can result in some annoying deaths, but it isn't a major issue and you eventually get the hang of it.

												I don't like Dark Souls, but I'm loving this game.I enjoy difficult games, which Dark Souls certainly is when starting out. What I don't like, is the neccesity of memorization. While exploring new areas I was able to improv on the spot to pull off some pretty cool stuff. I think the lack of the third dimension allows you to focus more on what's going on around you (as a beginner to both). The only thing that I dislike about this game is that there has already been a point that I've had to google where to go next after some pretty extreme exploration. The neccesity of a guide where to go next seems to be required.			"

												Salt and Sanctuary is a very well made platformer, which many people claim to be a dark souls in 2D. While it sports some elements dark souls fans will find familiar it does add its own touches to mechanincs and gameplay. The map design is amazing and the areas are interconnected very cleverly, while the combat is brutal and fast , and it feels great too annihilate your enemies in a spray of limbs and red liquid :D. There are also a lot of different options to play your character so this game also offers a high replayability. The only weak point i would mention is the music. while i liked it, there could certainly have been more variety in the boss fight themes.If you're a player who's into dark souls and metroidvanias you should definitely buy this game.

												20 hours in, at the time of this review. Yep, there are a lot of comparisons to Dark Souls. Replace souls with salt, and it's basically the same mechanic. It's fair enough to say it is a Metroidvania Dark Souls. And this one did it amazingly. It's been a while since I've enjoyed a platformer of this nature.I put this one just below Symphony of the Night, in terms of 'Where did four hours just go? .... meh.... *tap* *tap* *tap*...There's an expansive skill tree, so few builds will feel exactly alike. Want a pole axe maniac mage? Have at it, Brochacho! You can do eet!The crafting system isn't terribly deep, but it's interesting. Bosses drop items which can be used to turn certain weapons into various stronger weapons. This can also be achieved with far more common items. It's neat.There's no actual pause. The only safe places are sanctuaries you must claim in the name of a number of idols which have their own benefits. You'll have to claim sanctuaries in their name and kill their enemies to improve these semi-customizable sanctuaries.You customize the sanctuaries by placing figures (cleric, fighter, leader, traveler, merchant, blacksmith, etc.) upon the altar of your chosen idol. The traveler in particular makes getting around the world easier, via an item he sells. Fast travel, gold is cheap!Another thing I love about this game is that you can farm all you want and get totally OP. But you can still easily die if you forget about the various ambush situations throughout the game. Try being level 80, repeatedly without cancel, getting smacked around by an unfortunately effective sneak attack.Now go back and git gud. Git u salt. Git rekd old man.Git this game.			"

												This game was an absolute blast to play and 100%. While initially it was difficult and the controls felt weird, I became accustomed to them and did what I could to ""git gud."" The game eventually gives you a similar Souls experience, just in 2D, as you side-scroll your way through bosses, secrets, and mobs of enemies throughout fantastic level design. The biggest issue that I had with the game was that I suck at Metroid-Vania style platforming (especially ledge grabbing) and die to fall damage a bit too often.			"

												A truly magnificent game.Essentially a 2D version of Dark Souls, Salt & Sanctuary is a tough, unforgiving, yet thoroughly enjoyable game. Beautifully designed in every aspect.If you're looking for a challenging split screen Co-Op (or solo) game, look no further than Salt & Sanctuary.			"

												Amazing game.I had the itch to play DS3 again after the DLCs came out but didn't really want to go back to the grind. Enter S&S. All the things that make these games (""castlevania-like"" or ""souls-like"") great, with some great weapons / attack combos, dense level design, some tough bosses (until you have a STR / hammer or greatsword build, which is OP for the first several bosses), awesome visual style, very forgiving movement and, this is the best part, can run on old hardware or laptops. I was pleasantly surprised to get the game 30-40fps on a 4 year old i5-3317u with an HD4000 (integrated graphics only. Which means I get to play this at work.I'd say this is much more accessible than anything in the Dark Souls series, so worth a shot for players not used to those games.Don't know what keyboard controls are like, but with a 360 controller it's great.

												Salt and Sanctuary deserves marks for doing it's best to emulate the style and feel of dark souls in a 2D format. Unfortunately, some of the design, from levels, to abilities and monsters leaves a lot to be desired. Sections of the game smack of difficult for difficulties sake and lack the flow and nuance that someone expecting a 2D dark souls would want. Overall, the game smacks of a small team of fans doing their best and doing a pretty commendable job paying homage to a great game series that takes hundreds of people and millions of dollars to produce. Well done!			"

												this game can be very accurately called a 2D Dark Souls but the reason I like it is because it's one of the best Metroidvanias I've ever played. Symphony of the Night is one of my favorite games of all time and Castlevania as a whole is a series that's left an itch unscratched ever since Order of Ecclesia. This game scratches that itch. I enjoy it far more than any modern indie Metroidvania on Steam. It understands what made exploring the old school Metroid games and the handheld Castlevania games an amazing, immersive adventure.

												A spectacular adaptation of Dark Souls to two dimensions. Captures every aspect that made DS great - the skillful combat, the oppressive atmosphere, the variety of playstyles, the rewarding exploration, the hidden lore. On top of all that, it adds platforming challenges to the mix. Well, Dark Souls had those too, but this time the controls are actually suited to them.The only flaw I found was uneven difficulty - it's easy to find a build so powerful that bosses become trivial about a third of the way through the game. If you end up breezing through it, definitely try New Game +, as the difficulty curve will catch up to you and give you a much better challenge.			"

												Basically a Castlevania + Dark Souls hybrid. Difficult, but mostly fair. If I had to put up a complaint, it would be that sometimes enemies can patrol off-screen or between areas, but still hit you while you have no real way to retaliate. It doesn't happen that often, though. There's a skill tree system, which allows you to develop your character how you please - it's very remniscent of Path of Exile, in that there are individual nodes that increase parameters, but you can reach another class' section of the tree if you so desired.The game will test your patience, so I recommend stepping away and coming back when you end up dying a lot. Definitely worth the buy, though.			"

												If you are someone looking for a refreshing experience from the Souls style of game then Salt and Sanctuary is for you. Mixing the beloved Souls formula with 2D platforming and other elements, Salt and Sanctuary is a fantasic product that really rewards the player for their feats. If I did have a few major issues with this game is certain weapons and styles are obivous superior than others. I used a greatsword for the majority of the game and simple flew past many of the bosses. Another big issue is although the game looks really good and is impressive at times, it often blends together. Many maps loop back into one another like Dark Souls 1 but the areas end up look so similar at times I could not name where I was without trouble. It's not that big of a deal but it's very noticable when you play long enough. The Challenge of the game is so and so as well. Sometimes I question if the boss I fought was really a boss while other times I wondered why it was so difficult. Witch of the Lake and The tree fire-spraying boss are great examples of this. The platforming is okay and it's only when you get the power-ups that the platform is actually fun and it becomes easy to travel. Overall if your looking for a Dark Souls game that is close to Dark Souls 1 while shaking things up, Salt and Sanctuary is the game for you.			"

												Ah man. Where to even start with this game. I guess with the obvious, in that it definitely takes a lot from the Souls series. But holy crap, it takes everything it can, makes it 2D, and then makes it work fantastically.  The Good Stuff:   The controls are TIGHT. Everything feels damn good. I will say I play this with a controller primarily, but from the couple times I've tried on the keyboard, it felt good there too. The jump button will still be your nemesis, but DAMN does this play well. It's exactly as precise and responsive as you would want in a 2D platformer.  The game stays true to the Souls series in being punishing for bad play. This is a game you're gonna have to get good at, as with any other soulsborne game. You're going to be hard pressed to cheese through anything, especially on your first playthrough. But when you git gud? You feel incredible. It's super satisfying to finally beat that boss that's been giving you trouble for the past couple hours.  The art style is incredible, or maybe I have a soft spot for it. I was previously a fan of the nitty-gritty disproportioned look of The Dishwasher: Dead Samurai (from the same developer, if you're not following my thought process here), so perhaps this will not appeal to all those who stumble across this game. That said, the environments are beautiful, and the bosses are freaky. The art style definitely grants a lot to this game.  The progression through the game is steady, and flows incredibly well. At least in my experience, I never felt like I wandered to the ""wrong"" place, or that a detour I took was ""too far out of the way"" or anything. In fact, exploring a little bit out of the way (or into an area you're not as prepared for) can sometimes pay off through some easy-to-acquire loot to give you a little bit of an edge.The Meh:There's not much to put here, but I have one thing to point out. I might add to here if things cross my mind later on down the line.  You can find certain areas to ""powerlevel"" in. I did find myself at two points in the game where I felt I just needed a little bit extra power to proceed, possibly due to previous fast progression or something. Either way, I found myself running out of a sanctuary, killing all nearby enemies, returning to the sanctuary to respawn the enemies, and repeating the process for a while to eek out some extra levels. I don't think this is detrimental to the game, as it could have been just because of my playstyle, but I feel the need to mention it here. During those times it felt grindy, obviously, but I don't think it detracted from the gameplay enough to warrant distaste in it.The Bad:  There's no map. That's literally the only downside I can think of. You're going to just want to pull up the wiki at least for the map. Other than that, I can't fault this game for anything else.The Final Verdict:If you like the soulsborne series, you're going to love this. If you think you'll like the soulsborne-style game, you'll love this. Hell, if you just love 2D platformers with good combat mechanics, you'll probably love this as well. It's just that good. It's worth the regular price, and it's a damn steal at anything less than that.			"

												Salt and Sanctuary is an homage to the Souls franchise that has been the mainstay of From Software since Demon's Souls was released back in 2009. This game is a throwback to the first two titles in the series, borrowing several concepts regarding combat and exploration from those titles. The way in which you heal, dodge, increase in strength and chain actions together, though in 2D rather than 3D, is very reminiscent of the mechanics from these titles and all of this is executed in a tight and predictable manner. Best of all, most of the first play-through is beatable without wearing armor or performing heavy upgrades to weapons, so most of the content is almost entirely skill based. If you know how to play the game, you can get through it without feeling like there is a hard gear check for most of the game.Where Salt and Sanctuary actually shines is in the original ideas it brings to the table. This game makes incredible use of vertical stacking akin to the 2D Metroid games, but uses it as more of a way to represent distance between areas rather than them literally being physically above or below one another. It has an excellent array of areas and bosses, each which follow different principles and have extremely varied weaknesses and strengths. There are bosses that follow traditional duck and swing, sword and board as well as keep away principles of Souls fame. There are also bosses which follow 2D fighting game principles where combos, rushdowns, grabs, cross-ups and dizzying the opponent are all important concepts. The variety of weapons and spells in the game is just enough to entice you to try playing the game in each possible manner and keep the same challenges entertaining for several play-throughs. The game also has a few challenging platforming segments and principles that cause you to look and travel the world completely differently each time you discover a new one. This totally changes the incentives and how you look at the architecture you come across, and like any good Metroid environment, causes you to rethink things you already wandered past.The music and the sound are all crisp and convincing as well. Other than the rudimentary character faces, there's really nothing in this game that is not beautiful and pleasing to the eye in the environments or the enemy designs. You can tell that this game borrows from many other games and fantasy settings than just the Souls series in the types of dungeons and enemies you trek through and are put up against. All in all, no transition is soo harsh or bizzare that it seems not to fit. Because of this, the world the game takes place in is very believable and interesting. I often forget how pleasing the aesthetics are and I'm always impressed when I come back to the game and remind myself.If you enjoy adventure games with hard bosses and very few hints, are a fan of the Souls series or the original Zelda, or are just looking for a dungeon or horror game of medium difficulty to start you off on the genre, Salt and Sanctuary is a definite must. You will enjoy what this game has to offer.			"

												They should remove the word sanctuary from the title and it pretty much sums of this game.			"

												a ""Dark Souls""-like adaptation to 2D. It stumbles a bit here and there but overall is a really good game. Fun, skill-based, combat. Exploration and an interesting setting. It gets my seal of approval.  "

												Really excellent game. The exploration is awesome and I had to consult a map online to figure out where to even go (A rough in game map would have been welcome). The character level up system is pretty bland, but the environment and enemies made this such a fun time. I'll be keeping an eye out for future games these guys do.			"

												As many other reviewers have said, this game is essentially just Dark Souls adapted from 3D to 2D, but the end result is quite compelling.  If you like Dark Souls, you will find this game is a refreshing twist in a novel, compelling world.  I very much enjoyed it.			"

												Lots of comparisons to Dark Souls, in that it is hard, but I'd put it closer to a difficult Metroidvania type. I'd say it's a lot easier to get a hang of than Dark Souls, and there are fewer bosses that trouble most average players in S&S than DS. That being said, it was loads of fun once I got over the initial hump, only wish there was more replay value in NG+ other than maxxing out your skills tree. The art is well done and the atmosphere is creepy. For a bargain price, this is well worth the investment.			"

												A very good take on the Dark Souls genre in 2d - not impossible to learn and play, challenging but not too unforgiving and great design as well.If you prefer Dark Souls in 3d and do not like 2d platformers you won't like it, but for anyone who loves the 2d genre this is a must			"

												I have tried out a few different classes, and I've beaten the game twice now. I've never really played the Dark Souls franchise much, so I don't know if that's what I ought to be comparing this to. I can however say that this game is (mostly) as fair as it is punishing. Failure sucks, but sticking it out is more satisfying because of that. The thing I don't like about this game? Platforming and jumping ""puzzles."" I have no interest in Parkour in my RPG to the degree which this game has it in certain areas. If you are looking for a neat little RPG to have fun with, I highly recommend getting this on sale. The local co-op in Salt and Sanctuary is also pretty good, even if there are occasional camera issues.			"

												I do not like 2D games.I like this game.This game gets my approval.But seriously this is a difficult, yet rewarding game to play. The first 3 bosses gave me trouble and the others I killed on the first try because of what I learned in the previous fights. It also helped that I more than doubled the damage on my weapon :PLots of people compare this to Dark Souls, and yes it has a few things similar to it, but the gameplay is very different in my opinion. Specially the 2D aspect of it makes dodging a lot more difficult and the enemies here can attack at average speed or lightning quick. There is no room for mistakes here, specially early on when healing is limited. This brings me to the last thing I want to mention from my first impression: The skill tree. Oh my oh my it felt overwhelming at first, but then I realized it was rather simple. I just had to find the final node I wanted and trace it back down towards the center and then I realized I could reach class 5/5 swordfighter within the first 5 hours of the game if I wanted to. This actually feels great. It doesn't take too long to get anywhere but of course it gets more expensive as it goes on. There's truly so much freedom in how you build your character and I love it. It's essentially a simpler version of what path of exile uses and that is a great thing.Alright I'm ready with some cons for this game:-some enemies leave no time for healing between attacking/getting staggered at all. I do consider this a flaw in games that are about the combat-some bosses have uneven models and don't turn around their center, which severely changes their hitbox in a split second. This is very poor design in my opinion-the game can easily be beaten before you can wear a full set of class 4 armor due to its weight/endurance problems :(With how cheap the game is, you just can't go wrong though. I'm rating it based on what it is regardless of price and I say this game scores no less than 8/10.			"
