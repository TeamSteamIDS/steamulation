												This game is a must-buy for any RPG fan!While its style is distinctly western, in everything but art Epic Battle Fantasy is very much a JRPG. The combat is heavily based on elemental advantage/weaknesses – brute force is rarely an option in harder battles, instead the key to victory is using correct skills and gear.Speaking of gear, uniquely among RPGs, newer weapons and armor you acquire are not direct improvement of your old equipment. Instead, each weapon and armor has properties that make it good in some situations and mediocre to bad in others. The result is that no equipment becomes useless, and some of early gear may very much be an option for endgame battles.Instead of acquiring stronger gear, the game features upgrade system for your equipment, allowing you to improve your gear as you progress through the game (most later upgrades require items that are not available until later). And on final note about gear, each item your character wears, from weapons and armor to small badges visibly changes your appearance, which is really a nice touch!The story doesn’t even pretend to be serious, but it will accomplish what it sets out to: make you laugh from start to finish!Overall, Epic Battle Fantasy is all kinds of awesome. If you like turn-based RPGs, give it a try and it won’t disappoint!			"

												Like RPGs?Like Some honest to god decent humour?Wanna be a good guy and help out a guy who has made a ton of free games buy giving him some money?Want a cool soundtrack for free?Do you have a thing for anime boobs? *slapped* ok okThis game is worth every penny and don't let the people saying ""oh no you don't have to pay its free on kongregate"" fool you.The steam and prem Kongregate version has additional content to the base game and provides much more content then you'd expect!Also the steam version gives the soundtrack for free so a plus there.Give it a whirl on Kongregate if you are really cautious about the games you buy and make your choice there.I still say you should buy it to support the dev who really puts more work into his games then a lot of other devs that make free games (also give his other games a try while you're at it)			"

												You enter a battle with five generic looking monsters! Suddenly from behind you, a tank fires an armada of bullets at the enemies for no reason, accompanied by a cat with no legs that charges towards them with a wooden sword and shield. Your swordsman jumps in with his sword and then suddenly summons a sword out of thin air due to his sheer love for swords. You click on your mage's chest only to find out that her boobs give you an achievement. Your ranger looses her arrow towards the final enemy, but it doesn't do enough damage, that is until a giant wooly mammoth falls from the sky and crushes it.This is just a typical battle in Epic Battle Fantasy 4.

												It's been a while since I've played a true traditional RPG. I've not particularly taken to the RPG Maker trend and even stalwart supporters of the genre, like Square Enix, have edged their games into more action-oriented mechanics. Ironically, at one point in the Playstation age, I felt the genre had become saturated and stale; nowadays, I'll jump on anything that strips back the gimmicks and offers a wholesome predictable journey.Epic Battle Fantasy 4, as you have probably determined, is part of a long running series none of which have graced Steam before. Luckily, there's absolutely no reason why you can't just jump in if you haven't played the predecessors; the storylines are simple, rather trope-filled affairs and all the better for it. They're wrapped up by the end of the game and the only continuation between the titles are the main characters and cameo moments that serve as fan service. If you're looking for an epic tale of tyranny, betrayal and sacrifice then you might be disappointed. If you have the time for a charming, genuinely funny and surprisingly deep RPG experience then EBF4 provides in every sense.Your team of four party members aren't limited to class setups like most games. Instead, you'll develop each character using a huge selection skills that eventually make every character capable of wielding devastating spells and life-saving buffs. This flexibility keeps the combat interesting throughout, with enemy resistances calling for constant experimentation and fluidity of tactics. For a game with such an irreverent tone, you'll be greatly punished if you don't approach the battles cautiously. The ability to rush through battles spamming physical attacks is at an absolute minimum and while some battles drag on longer than I'd have liked, it's always preferable to feel engaged at all times.Surprisingly, I had most of my fun with EBF4 in the world map. Most areas you travel across throughout the game will have a handful of chests, optional battles, NPCs with sidequests and incredibly well-hidden secrets. Scrubbing the screen with the cursor, looking for a hidden package of loot became quite the obsession and really reduces the tedium of back-tracking or getting lost. With items that grant new skills and powerful equipment on offer for those with a keen eye, it's easy to get swept up in the mechanic and see the battles as a distraction. Thankfully, the monsters appear as sprites on the map, so if you feel that way, they're easily avoided.Grinding is kept at to a minimum, with the rare moments I felt under-powered quickly corrected by fighting a few mobs I'd opted to pass a few screens ago. There are many options to improve your party's powers if you're struggling. The less common stat-increasing foods are a viable source of instant power, spells can be trained using AP accrued from each fight and gear is improved by crafting upgrades using miscellaneous loot. There's always something new to aim towards, especially if you have an interest in achievements; there are some great situational challenges and the developer did a fantastic job of avoiding a conventional and dull list.The care and attention put into EBF4 is impressive; even when an enemy could be considered a palette swap, there will be little touches to the model to suit the change in power or element. The Zelda-esque key items that can remove obstacles encountered earlier in the game encourage a lot of exploration and reward players generously. With it taking upwards of 20 hours to complete everything, it's surprisingly to see even more work put in to encourage multiple playthroughs. The value for money takes it from being a budget purchase for genre diehards and into the arms of anyone that's ever launched a Firaga into a flan's face and loved it.Despite being a fantastic game overall, there were moments of frustration. The occasional enemy will throw instant death moves that feel a little cheap, though nothing compares to bosses that can heal themselves. These situations are few and far between thankfully and do little to overthrow an RPG that remains so consistently enjoyable.With so little competition in the world of traditional RPGs, EBF4 could get away with minimal effort and still be devoured by starving fans. As such, it's hugely refreshing to see so much love and attention combined with a proficient and challenging adventure. There's little I can say against the game which, in turn, is one of the best things I can say in its favour. If you fancy something traditional that isn't entirely predictable then I'd say there's no better choice on Steam than Epic Battle Fantasy 4.			"

												You've seen the video, and you're going ""This is a Flash game.  This belongs on Newgrounds.  Wait, this IS on Newgrounds.  Why would I pay for this?  Why would anyone even greenlight this??""  I'll tell you why: because this is the RPG your oldschool heart's been waiting for.You've got your turn-based RPG elements, your enemies rating from the silly to the spooky to the right-out terrifying, your countless tongue-in-cheek Final Fantasy/Pokemon/Zelda/Mana/etc. homages.  But then there's the feeling of being a part of this world: rather than ""exploring"" a ""vast"" world of triumphs and tribulations, you just sort of twiddle around and run into packs of monsters just sitting there on the worldmap.  There's the never-ending bickering and bantering among your teammates as you progress.  There's the range of hints both silly and satisfying that play out as you spar with your foes and try new techniques.The challenge is there too--boy, is it ever.  For a game optimized to be played 30 minutes at a go, you can spend a lot of effort fine-tuning your characters' skills and loadouts for tough fights (and it will *really* pay off if you are playing Epic and going for the achievements).  You'll be able to come back to it over time, too--have the satisfaction of clearing the game, take some time off from it, and come back to it anew in New Game+ (or ++) playing however you feel, without having to collect all those non-key items again but with all the damage numbers exponentially increased for more cheesy epicness.And of course, the content you won't find on Newgrounds here--the Battle Mountain--escalates the challenge further (though you could still get through it pretty easily in Easy mode if you went that route).  It's a chance to step off the beaten plot-ridden path and just smash up tons of monsters--plus all-new bosses both uncompromising and unsettling.If you are a child of the 90s or late 80s and don't have time to play RPGs anymore but still admire them from afar, this is your chance to see firsthand what happens when nostalgic thrills meet the present day.  This East-meets-West cultural take just might give you one more fantasy to embrace after all.			"

												This game is a funny joking, breaking the forth wall, RPG. It's all good fun in the world of EBF4, with jokes coming left and right, and all being masterfully crafted so that none fall flat you won't stop laughing. Enough about how funny the game is, let's talk about gameplay, the game focuses on the goal of collection and completion rather than harsh and numerous battles, the creator has also made it so that character's not battling will also gain experience so that you won't have to grind for any other character at a later time. The collection will included things such as: chest locations, random drops for armor and weapon upgrades, those weapons and armor  themselves, certain creatures to fill that damn bestiary, ect. All battles are fair and equal as long as you do a little side searching here and there to gain a little extra exp. Jokes, fair battles, and no grinding sounds like a good game to me.			"

												Thank goodness I got this game, Matt has always impressed me with his epic battle fantasy series, and when I heard that the fourth installment was going to be on steam I just couldn't keep quiet about it, I was extremely excited for this coming out on steam. It is definitely worth the £8.99 I spent on it. In fact I think it's worth much more than that! Turn based RPGs has always been my thing. The game also tickles me ribs with it's humour, crying with laughter at some points. I really enjoy some of the references to animes that you make. I like the roaming around, puzzles and the mini-games too. Honestly Matt, I love this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game so much. Would absolutely recommend to people who love a good, lighthearted turn based RPG.			"

												Epic Battle Fantasy 4 is an adventure RPG game, developed by Matt Roszak, releasing on Steam is February 2014. This is my first foray into the Epic Battle Fantasy series and have no other previous experience with other games in the franchise. Gameplay is a simplistic RPG style view, with turn based combat for the fights. Controls are so simple; you literally can play the whole game with just your mouse. The game has a real “Pokémon” feel to it, as you explore you will find parts of the map you can’t explore yet because you don’t have the required skill, for instance, to cut a tree down or to smash a rock. Once you learn said skills, you can backtrack quite easily to explore and find treasure hidden in the previously locked area.   The game has well over a hundred different enemies to kill, and learn their strengths and weaknesses of.  My favourite part of the game play is easily the loot and item system.  The game boasts over 170 different items for your characters to use; you can upgrade these items through using the Forging mechanic which require you to use craft-able items to make the upgrade.   The combat system is really well designed too; you have a party of four characters eventually, but you can only use three in a battle, the fourth acts as a backup in case one of your others dies. The Pokémon element theme is a key mechanic too; making sure you use the correct weapon with the right effect on the enemy is an almost absolute must most of the time.  Characters can also learn “companions” which acts as like “ultimate” attacks, and any of your characters can use them rather than having them bound to one of your party – the best and most fun by a country mile has to be the Super Nova, which just obliterates the entire screen. Visually, EBF4 is again, simple, but that comes across very pleasantly. The in game art style looks colourful and vibrant, and has a very 3DS look to it. The narration parts of the game are done in a beautifully, almost hand drawn style of art, as if they have just been pulled out of a children’s book. I was enchanted by the visuals straight away as soon as I saw this. There is little animation in the game, given the 2D aspect, but the small amount of animation in the game is done really well, no odd movement cycles or strange looking attacks. There isn’t any voice acting; however there aren’t walls and walls of text to read through, so that can be forgiven. EBF4’s difficulty levels can be changed on the fly, and you are almost encouraged to play on the highest difficulty until you start hitting a brick wall. I played the game on a normal difficulty and still felt sufficiently challenged by the fights. You can ramp up the difficulty to epic mode for those wanting to get extra achievements though. Once you complete the game you have the option for New Game+. Not to mention the Fire Mountain area of the game. This area scales with your characters level, allowing you to take on unique beasty bosses for extra special loot. This for me again, reminded me of the Pokémon games and the Elite Four trainers. The world, in which you play in, is full of extra little bits to do, with roughly 20 side quests to complete, which offer no real variety but still add a bit more game play. The quests are only collection quests, so don’t expect to be getting really in depth quest lines like other RPGs. The quests will reward you with stat increasing items, or more equipment to make use of. There are also a number of NPCs scattered around the world that whilst they offer no game play advantage, they do have a bit of lore behind them though. EBF4 took me just under 20 hours to complete. I went into this game expecting it to be over in five hours. I am absolutely amazed at how much content and how long this game actually is. What really does this game the most credit is, I wasn’t bored once whilst playing, and I wasn’t waiting for the end of the game to roll around as I was having that much fun playing. There may not be a massive amount of replay ability given the linearity of the storyline, but the New Game+ mode will definitely cater for any people that are fans of the game play.  Technically, the game runs in a much smaller resolution, whilst you can play full screen, it is a scaled up version. For some reason, I almost had a lot of stuttering during some moments in the game. This was fixed by reloading the game, but I couldn’t quite work out what was causing it. Obviously the game isn’t very taxing to run, given the 2D graphics, but still, I was dropping frames every now and again.  The game cannot be played using a controller without the use of third party software, but I would recommend people play this game with their mouse. To sum up, I am absolutely amazed at the quality of this game. It is easily one of my favourite RPG experiences I have ever had. I remarked quite a bit in this review about the resemblances between EBF4 and Pokémon, and that comparison really does this game justice. It is an absolute masterpiece of a game that looks so simple on the outside, but is beautifully and carefully developed on the inside. The game is so perfectly priced at £8, 99 too, with hours of content and high quality content at that!  Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Not Recommended3) Only recommended when on sale4) Recommended5) Highly recommended6) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

												Awesome sense of humor. Classic early final fantasy battle formula. Endearing characters. Cool Plot. Varied skills, elements, items and battle mechanics. The world map is divided into screens which you navigate sector by sector and then connect shortcuts together once you clear areas. An impressively well designed game. One thing to keep in mind however is that this game is combat heavy, I wish there was more dialogue and plot lines because those are what makes the game memorable. Playing this makes me wish they improve on the plot in the next installment, and I wish they released the previous game in the series on steam for a low cost, but apparently the dev made those available drm free online from what I heard so I might check em out. Great achievements and there is a lot of hours you can sink into here if you play epic mode and go into the hardcore area after you beat the game and do endless waves and whatnot. A great pick for classic jrpg fans.			"

Key supplied by developer for review.======================================Epic Battle Fantasy 4 Read on for the full review!======================================TL;DR:While there are a couple downsides(and only a couple,) Epic Battle Fantasy 4 features many positive aspects of classic RPG gameplay, while also lightheartedly poking fun at RPG, anime, and video game tropes. It's cheap, too, so you should definitely pick up a copy!======================================Pros+ RPG: It's oldschool!+ Options: All there+ Graphics: Cute, colorful, and with nice animations.+ UI: Remembering the last used spells is sooo convenient!+ Humor: Very much present.+ Price: Low, especially for playtime.+ References: EVERYWHERE.+ Variety: ALSO EVERYWHERE.+ Combat: It will keep you doing different things.Cons- Not higher resolution!- KB Mode still requires mouseNeutral+/- You'll have to fight alot of waves of monsters.+/- You'll also have to backtrack quite a few times. ======================================Epic Battle Fantasy Four...now that's a name! Like its name, EBF4 seems to be a parody of all things RPG. It sports fairly good writing, self-aware humor, a wealth of items to find, and the equipment all has unique art assets. We're off to a good start! So what's the story like?It's a bit like this. You're a girl from a small woodland village. Three protagonists from the previous titles in the series have ransacked your village, and its prized jewel is gone! You track them down and force them to join up with you, after realizing they didn't steal the jewel, as repayment for their pillaging. You then go on to the next village to find their jewel is also gone. Okay, you should grab some popcorn for this: The jewels are meant to be seperated, and when brought together could spell doom for humankind. This is because of Catgod. Yes. Catgod. Catgod created the world, and all its creatures. It created cats in its image, but became jealous of their relationship with humans, and decided to take the cats' arm and legs, and destroy their greatest works in the world. Now someone, maybe these cats, wants to even out the punishment! You must take your lovable band of misfits and stop them!So, we're already in for an interesting ride. What else is there you ask? Read on!This is the kind of game where the more I play, the more I appreciate it. There is humor in spades, which sometimes falls flat for me, but it's very self-aware, so I still appreciate it. Something also everywhere is references, and I LOVE references! Other things are also everywhere, such as: skills, summons, equipment, upgrades, monsters, quests, hidden treasure, and barriers blocking your path.The graphics are cute, with much of the stuff in the game sporting decent and equally cute animations. There are plenty of options in the settings menu. There are overworld monsters, so when you feel like skipping battles, you can. The blockades barring your way actually keep things interesting, since your equipment will all remain useful depending on what enemies you are fighting, and everything in this game can be upgraded or scales with your level. This sets a great pace for exploration, and encourages you to find all the hidden unblocked treasures you can get your grubby hands on.Progression has a good curve. You'll level up, find items, get new weapons, and clear areas at a steady pace. There's also a lot of content to this game, for only 12$ off sale, so you'll get your money's worth, too. The game likes to parody cliches found in anime, games, movies, you name it. The humor will keep you going even if the gameplay gets old, and if it does, a quick break is all it ever took for me to fix that.For example, I once started a battle with a woolly mammoth to then inadvertantly drop a woolly mammoth on top of it right after my party commented about how tough the fight would be. I was close to taking a break, but instead laughed plentifully and wanted to keep going. There are plenty of other nice things that will keep the game convenient and easy to play like the ability to scan monsters and instantly see their strengths and weaknesses, the ability to leave a battle without having to play a minigame or roll dice, zone teleports, instant healing slimecats, recently used spells list, and more!Getting around in Epic Battle Fantasy 4 is easy. The UI is simple enough, although slightly clunky. There are keyboard and mouse movement options, but keyboard mode still requires the mouse for battles, unfortunately, and there's no controller support. The game also maxes out at 720p, which is quite low for modern displays. There is also, on the negative end, ocassional lag and stuttering. There are plenty of settings to mess with so you can likely find a setting that fixes that for you.All in all you'll want to experience this game for the story, humor, characters, references, varied battles, and sheer number of items, equipment, and potential upgrades.======================================If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group "

												Why should you get this game? In short: It is fun, and unique.Just 10 minutes into the game and you can see everything that has been inspired from games of old. Turn Based battle system, a fun, laid back skill system, and visual cues that darn well give away hints.If you're looking for an extremely hardcore RPG, you have come to the wrong place, if however - you are looking for a ""comfy"" JRPG which focuses more on fun, you have come to the right place. Not to say the game is not challenging - far from it. It's just more relaxing to play than other JRPGs on the market. Hence the term ""Comfy JRPG""; it's something you can play all night without realizing the time, which is exactly what happened to me last night.Even-though I have some of the best JRPGs ever created in my library I choose to play this for hours instead. Now, you're probably wondering why? The answer is simple: Fun. Literally pure fun. With some of the classic JRPGs you get ups and downs, and sometimes just can't be bothered to keep playing - but with this, it's just all ups and I never wanted to put the mouse down. - Would be nice to perhaps Controller support in the future though.The story/plot is very unique, and the game has some nice light humour, which is very nice to see in a JRPG. This is a game that doesn't take itself too serious. It's less about hardcore grinding, and more about fun. The story up to now has been great, but I won't say much as it would ruin surprises for you.It's quite funny seeing certain thing's in game and you think to yourself ""Wait a minute! That looks familiar!) - There are clear references to Final Fantasy, Zelda, Pokemon, etc. It was funny seeing that Pikachu on the fire, and other stuff which I won't mention it as it could spoil the surprise. There are plenty of different foes, and might I add - the art style is very good too. Would be nice to see 1080p support in the future for those who can make use of it.The battle system is very relaxing. There is no rushing, no stress. You do stuff in your own time. There are a lot of skills and specials to choose from. Items can also give you permanent boosts, as well as your mandatory heal items, etc you would come to expect from a JRPG.At first the item collecting seemed weird - but after a bit of time I realized it's another great element to the game, and it reminds me of when I used to be a kid and collected rare items in games. It's nice to have something like that again. Although, it would be nice if there was a few less item quests, and perhaps a few more hunt x monsters quests.So what are the final thoughts for EBF4? It's almost the ultimate comfy JRPG, and that's not a light thing to say. This game is VERY FUN. So if you want to sit on the couch or desk for hours and hours and forget about time and eventually grow a beard and never wash again because you are so damn addicted, then this game is for you. Seriously. BUY IT NOW. Feel free to look at my reviews for other games, I normally score most games low, but this get's an 8/10 from me.Also; Did I mention you can make bewbs bounce, and play with♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ :3			"

												Well first let me tell you that I have followed the series on Kongregate while it had only released Epic Battle Fantasy 1 and to be honest the first and second game wasn't that great but then the third instalment came to the series and it changed everything becouse it had absolutely everything an JRPG could offer for a flash game.I played Epic Battle Fantasy 3 about 5 to 10 times and when beating the game it gets a bit repetative so I usually came back for it every other month or so. Even when I had played it 9 times it was still as fun as it was the first time I started the game. But years passed and one day in 2013 just before I was about to turn off my computer I just wanted to check my Kongregate and there it was, Epic Battle Fantasy 4.I played the game 2 times or so on Kongregate but never really took the time to beat it but then a half year later when it got to steam I instantly bought it and played it through. I'm currently at my second playthrough and it has been some time since I bought it now.Lets get into the game shall weArt and Graphics: (10/10 absoultely love the art style)I personally love the cute anime based art style that the game has and the effects are well animated aswell as the world and items and don't forget all the monsters and characters all have high detail. You may wonder why I say that they are detailed while their not having that mush details like shadows and particles but that is becouse it has a perfect balance between being cartoonish and detailed so i would say that this is a kind of masterpiece.Sound and Music: (11/10 its my favorite game music and I listen to it all the time)I think that the sound effects in this game fits perfectly with only some few improvements coming into my mind sometimes but thats just if I'm picky.The music which is written by HalcyonicFalconX is absolutely stunning and as it changes from every region you visit it also changes the games atmosphere. From relaxing in the forest to intense in the factory aswell as epic while in the volcano. All I can say is that without the music the game wouldn't have such an impact on me as it had.Gameplay (combat): (8/10 the combat is great but can sometimes get a bit repetative)The combat system is that of any JRPG just that it is simple, highly detailed and fun but it does get repetative when going through an older region or before you unlock multi target skills. Anyhow the combat can make you quite impressed sometimes as some skills/attacks is simply epic.Gameplay (exploration): (9/10 the world and exploration is so relaxing)With a bunch of puzzles, easter eggs and a large variety of biomes to explore the exploration gets quite relaxing and at the same time interesting as you never know what you will find before uncovering the map.Content: (8/10 very mush content for having one developer)There is a large variety of quests, skills, items and monster but its not as mush content as you will find in an AAA game but thats obviouse that it would not have as mush content. I'm not saying that the game is low on content of items etc. but when you reach high levels for example you might have acctually leveled all skills to max and uppgraded every piece of equipment to the max. There is still enough of content to satisfy any player but I'm just saying that you might end up with nothing more to level up other than the characters levels but you wont reach the ""no more upgrades"" untill your in New Game+ or New Game++.Story: (7/10 even without any focus on the story I still like it)The game focuses on exploration, upgrading and combat but still offers a small story and its quite lighthearted and ammusing but still every time the game reveales a new part of the story you really feel like you are there in that offten wierd situation.Final Score: (9.8/10 this game is a must buy)Why such a high score well here is some ups and downs:+++ : The music is absolutely amazing++ : The sound fits very well with almost everything within the game++ : Exploration and puzzleing is very fun and can get you obsessed to clear everything to a 100%++ : The combat system is very strategic and interesting but its still simple enough to be played by a child++ : The sudden notices from the characters can get quite hilleriouse++ : The games easter eggs makes the game quite fun if you try to notice them all that is+ : The game offers New Game+ aswell as a large variety of items to use+ : Some skills/attacks can only be described with one word only: EPIC- : There is a large variety of Skills and Equipment but after starting New Game+ it feels like you found everything- : Going back to an older region does not provide with any supported combat untill you reach the next New Game+This is a must buy for all RPG fans aswell as to all Fantasy and Comedy fans so I hope this review helped and that you might buy this game.

												There's an achievement for clicking Natalie's breasts and making them jiggle, stealing underwear, and leaving a character dead at the end of the battle. So, basically, you are rewarded for teasing a busty girl, running away with her intimate clothing and leaving her dead in the end. Just like real life. 10/10But here's the real review.Originating from a browser game, the fourth installment of Epic Battle Fantasy is on Steam, and for a very good reason. I haven't seen a lot of turn-based fighting RPGs like this one, but it really hits the spot.It has excellent humor, and I often find myself laughing uncontrollably as I press space to advance through the chatting/cutscenes, seeing hilarious lines being announced by the characters, either in the arguing present everywhere in the game (because Natalie's boobs/Matt being a disgrace/Anna living in a tree/Lance having microcameras stored in his armor to ""look"" at Natalie's boobs), or in the battling of hundreds of enemies (because they are too weak/strong/disgusting/cool/tasty/scary, or because they resemble Pok*mon too much).The characters are beautifully designed, and their personalities are constantly clashing with each other due to their differences, creating a constantly interesting atmosphere to get your mind off the battling and strategy if you're playing on Epic. There's things to like in all of them (and if you look at my profile you MIGHT find out which one is my favourite), and the soundtrack is amazing as well.All in all, it sounds like I'm reviewing a GOTY title. And I can't say I don't love Epic Battle Fantasy the Fourth. Thank you Matt Roszak for making this game.			"

												This game is really fun! When i played it earlier I couldn't stop playing untill i finished it. Now I'm going to do same. This is just RPG with a turn-based battles, Where you can control 4 different heroes. Battles are very exciting and full of visual effects and references to the other games. When you're playing it, sometimes yu're ROTFL'ing, but always you're smiling :). More or less, this is an ,,Epic''<heh> RPG game, you will spend with her many wonderful hours for sure. Would play again 10/10.PS. There is also weird bug when you can't stop play ;D			"

												Randomly found this game and seeing that it had JRPG elements, i investigated further. I Watched a few gameplay video's, read the full description, but i found myself still not convinced that it was of worth. I Thought to myself, "" just go for it"".. i did not regret it one bit. I Am so addicted.How this game was created, was so thoughtful to details in the terms of gameplay. From witty dialog that pops up but does not get in your face, the excellent setup of the battle system, puzzles, loads of achievements to keep a player occupied, to even the collectable elements. The game is just so thoughfully pieced together.I Would recommend this game to anyone who loves the JRPG genre, and everyone else alike.			"

												If you loved the gameplay of old-school JRPGs, then Epic Battle Fantasy 4 is right up your alley. It's one of the few examples of a Flash game that's actually good. The story is silly and almost nonexistant, but the gameplay is satisfying and scratches that JRPG itch. The game is well-balanced almost all the way through, with almost no points that feel badly-designed. If you do pick up EBF4 do yourself a favor and start on the highest difficulty (Epic), as I feel that's the way it's meant to be played. You can always switch to a lower difficulty if it ends up being too much, which is nice.The biggest flaw I can find with EBF4 is the 3-character party. There are 4 playable characters, but because there are permanent stat-boosting consumable items, the optimal way to play is to choose your party and completely ignore the 4th character for the whole game, because any stat-boosters would be wasted on them.Other than that, EBF4 is a great game that, while it may not be a masterpiece, is still a lot of fun and an homage to a genre that the game industry has long since forgotten.

												Just finished it and I have to say this is the best flash game RPG in a long time and it was definitely worth the price on sale. The graphics might not be the best and its story is stupid, but that's what made this game so charming to me. Its just not so serious like many other RPGs out there.My favorite part of the game was the turn-based combat system, along the lines of Final Fantasy, Grandia. etc... But instead of getting new/better weapons, you are provided with a selection of many different weapons with different elements. You really have to think before entering a fight to choose the right elements. At around 25 hours, it's a pretty long game and you can get even more out of it with the boss rush and endless monster encounters.Try out the flash game on kongregate.com and decide for yourself if you're unsure. Support the devs of such a high quality flash games, because they can be fantastic regardless of engine.			"

												TL;DR: A well done JRPG styled game, with a focus on adjusting your gear and tactics for each group and boss to hit weaknesses and exploit status effects. Requires a bit of strategy for optional things, but no too deep if you just want to enjoy it.I've actually played all the EBF's so far, and you don't need to play the others to play this one. Technically, you can play it for free on the website, minus some features, but the creator has done some amazing work on this title, so he deserves the money if you want to purchase it.Epic Battle Fantasy has always been about adjusting your tactics to your current enemies, and 4 is no different. The game boils down classic turn based combat into a purely fun formula. Each battle, even bosses, you can run from at will, so if you find new enemies you can scan them, then flee to adjust your gear if you like, or just hammer on through if you can. Most enemies can be beaten by using gear with no downsides and the proper elements, but obviously you will get much better results, especially against bosses and larger enemies, if you adjust your gear to hit their weaknesses. Unlike most JRPGs, status effects actually matter alot in the game, and alot of them work well in conjunction. One of the best combos is the darkness status effect decreases stats over time, and increases weakness to holy...and the holy status effect reduces the other stats over time, and increases weakness to dark. This leads to combos, such as having an accessory that gives the darkness-only debuff to your weapons, and using that against dark enemies so they receive even more holy damage. The game is all about finding those neat combos and useful effects, and using them well.The story is bare bones, but it doesn't need to be too epic (Despite the name), the summary from 3 to 4 as told in the intro is 'the heroes saved the world, so they thought they were entitled to everyones stuff, so they took it...that made people mad, insert new heroine'. The game makes light of typical JRPG tropes, without being too caustic. It also introduces new elements as you run into them, so it avoids any sort of tutorial. Sidequests are nothing more than gather materials, give to NPC.The game has many things you can do to improve your characters besides levelling, optional skills that you can only give to one character, upgrading weapons/armor (of which there are plenty), accessories, permanent stat boosting items that can be hoarded through numerous NG+s, etc. While you can go through it on easy, the game does reserve the boss achievements only for beating them on the highest difficulty, which is an effort no matter when you do it. The optional area, Battle Mountain, is even tougher for it, as the enemies level up with you, so you have to rely on strategy (and maybe some stat boosting items) to win. Still, every group of enemies is unique in structure, and the difficulty ramps up well, a very well designed curve for the game. There is some backtracking as you gain new items, to collect old stuff, but you don't feel too put upon to do so.Overall, I highly reccomend this game if you like a good turn based RPG that requires you to think about how to handle each encounter, without getting into a mindless slog through weak enemies.

												First off, Yes, you can play this game on Kongregate or Newgrounds (or possibly Matt's DA), however the version you play will not be this one. In other words, No, this isn't the same game you can play on the sites I previously mentioned.What you'll play is indeed an RPG akin to the old days of Final Fantasy, when Combat wasn't real-time combat with before-use cooldowns.To those unfamiliar with the Epic Battle Fantasy series (namely the ones with actual story elements) This is an RPG game with tons of funny things here and there, self-referencing humor, and things that reference alot of other things.So basically the story so far is there's 3 heroes.One is Matt, who jsut wants food, like swords and piracy... He's also a pirate.. Did I mention he has a guitar and likes Death Metal? I jsut did, you're welcome, reason 1 to buy this game.There's Natalie, whose powers are in her awe-inspiring magical powers, witty remarks, different mindset of the others, and her boobs. No seriously she's kinda the ""Big boobed girl cliche"" of the series, though she's hilariously not jsut eye candy,  dishing out the sage advice and owning remarks. But even more seriously she's literally the only one who can decently heal and revive party members. She's kinda the most important character combat-wise.There's Lance who is a military guy.In a world filled with big demons (like the last villain you kill in #3), sapient cats with no limbs able to wield weapons via unexplained telepathy powers, elementals, magic, Lance is the one who kills things with overwhelming firepower. Seriously though, he melts those who are weak to bomb-type attacks and even has decent fire and electric attacks.There's a 4th character, a huntress druid girl for Natalie to relate to.This game also has achievements alongside the medals of the game, giving you elevated bragging rights.Your progress on this version won't be wiped by clearing your cache or cookies.There's what I call a Shamievement, an achievement that's more or less a badge of shame like Duke Nukem Forever's Turd Burglar. You'll be rewarded for being a perv by this, though it really could be worse, so in terms of them, it's really not bad.Here's the part you care about though... The exclusive content.This version has more weapons, and more items in general, save for crafting materials (i think) and this game has an entire area called Challenge Mountain. This area is literally filled with enemy encounters which all have 8 enemy encounters each and stronger versions of the bosses in the game which are WAY harder to kill.Every enemy in thise area scales with level, which means you can get past all enemies at level 1, though you do need quest items like the axe or battery to get past some bits.How does this game fare? Well for someone who played the first half 3 times on Kongregate, I can say the game fares really awesomely. I mean... never did I once say ""Oh god not this part again"" or the infamous ""Why can't I just skip this"" and I'm one of many who found Diablo 2 monotonous after Normal difficulty.This game is very fun, has some funny elements and even gets challenging properly without feeling unfair. This game doesn't have any difficulty spikes... until the final area, but around then you're ready for it. This game is simply a blast, the only thing stopping me from playing it is just the simple fact I'm feeling a bit bored of RPGs in general.Alongside such big titles like Final Fantasy, Diablo, Torchlight, and even anything else you could really think of, this game holds it's own ground. The game is honestly fairly unique in my opinion.This game in my books gets a 7/10. It's pretty good honestly, and I'd easily recommend it to anyone who likes Turn-Based games and RPGs, Despite the fact you can play the game on Kongregate with 30% less content for free.			"

												TL;DR: - game is a bit intensive on low-end computers + Lots of content (Summons, equipment, skills, etc.) + Tons of achievements (Just click Natalie's boobs and then leave that in your review) + 4 different difficulties (Easy, Normal, Hard, Epic) + 4 unique characters + Free OST with the game + So much moreI've been waiting some time time to do a review of this game, considering I still haven't completed it, but I can say I love the thought and content this game provides, as it is far more in-depth than its predecessor, Epic Battle Fantasy 3 (EBF3). This game brings forth so many more mechanics than EBF3, and I just love it to death. Some mechanics were even changed for more balance, which I am happy that ups the challenge, while also making it more fair (no more half health poison damage due to the poison stacking enemies could do).Only downside is that the game is a bit intensive. Lower end computers might want to at least chanmge the graphics to medium (still might lose some frames).With about 10 status ailments, a ton of summons and skills, tons of equipment, a vast amont of achievments, silly dialogue, a decent story, with all of this topped off with a fourth party member, I have come to truly love this game in the EBF series. I do highly recommend this if you enjoy a nice challenging RPG (especially in the major bonus area). Not to mention, you get a really good OST for free if you get the game so that's pretty nice. I also highly recommend just keeping an eye on the dev (Yeah. One guy made just about everything aside from the OST) as he is already working on EBF5 if I remember correctly. Check out his website: http://kupogames.com/If you made it this far, thanks for reading my review. I apologize if this review seemed to just go everywhere, but I really did try to express the joy I got from playing the game. I hope that I was able to express that joy into those reading this. To further express my joy for this game, I will state that I would even do an LP/Walkthrough? Some day when I get my PC back, I plan on LPing the game just because this series has given me comfort and maybe even a reason to live. Rambling aside, I hope you guys enjoy this game.P.S. This game is getting my ""We Didn't Think Of Everything"" award! Thanks a bunch Steam Awards! :D			"

												Back when I was a heavy Kongregate user in 2013, this little gem has had great potential. So much, it was worth buying Kreds to purchase the bonuses. So if this game runs on Kongregate, you are right: this game is Flash-based. Yeah, Flash games have a bad rep on Steam, but this one cuts that, the cake, AND adds icing on the cake, making it a great RPG to play on Steam.What I have loved has, and always will be, the music (http://halcyonicfalconx.bandcamp.com/album/the-music-of-epic-battle-fantasy-iv). The $12 is worth it, believe me. Favorite track is 'Elfin': makes PERFECT battle music, comparable to many of the SquareEnix jRPGs out there. It's heard once you reach the cavern entrance. For those who have complained about this being a paid game over the free Kongregate version, this comes WITH the OST, located within the install folder.This version is Steam Cloud-enabled, so a long-awaited feature, cloud saves, exist finally. Saves will be created in the install folder under .meow's (very funny, Matt...). This one feature has the advantage over the Kongregate version....Or maybe it's because I have had this fondness for Natalie, the red-hair, blue-eyed beauty who has this skill named Genesis. You tell me what the creator had in mind, given my username and avatar...I say BUY THIS!!!			"

Amazing soundtrack?  ~ Then this game is for you! ♡With more gameplay than many AAA ""factory made"" games released by big companies (who dare to charge $40 for 15 hours worth) and much replayability with the new arena/boss modes - this little gem of a game will not disappoint.Still unsure? Then check out the free basic/lite/demo version available on the web - if you like that, you will love the LARGE amount of extra content Matt (the one and only developer) has added for this version.

												One of the best games I've ever played, don't know if it's an over load of nostalgia that makes it good, or if it's that actual game. Though I've got a feeling that it's both.If you remeber playing this game or any of the previous ones on a website like Kongregate and you've enjoyed it, or if you just like turn-based RPGs. This game will not fail to keep you entertained and occupied.I would definetly have more hours on this game if had enough free time to play more.Here are some good things about the game:-Great art-As good as you can get when it comes to turn-based gameplay-Light hearted/silly story-Pretty long boss battles or battles in general (if you enjoy that kind of thing)-Different difficulty settings if you're struggling or want a challenge.-Realistic jiggle physics-Pretty funny dialogue-Cool weapons, armour, and skills-And alot moreThere's no real complaints I have about the game other than some battles can take a really long time, like seriously I don't  if I just suck, but the most recent boss I got to took me about an hour to kill... And that's all I have to say about this game so I'm going to stop giving you my pretty biased opinion and let you decided what to rate it, once you've played.			"

												Best jiggle physics in recent games ever.Epic Battle Fantasy 4 used to be a browser game. I used to play games from Miniclip and other websites that provide flash games, but for some reason I didn't came across this one. Boy did I missed out. In case you couldn't tell, its a turn-based RPG. It has funny jokes, fourth-wall breaking and references to other games all over the place.Like every RPG, you go around killing enemies to get materials to upgrade equipment, doing quest and side-quest and buy stuff from shops, you know the usual stuff. And thats what makes this game great. Its a very nostalgic feeling of how a RPG should feel, but they removed one key mechanic that made this game even better.NO. GRINDING.Item drops from enemies for upgrades can be bought from shops so you can grind or if u have gold u can just buy it from the shops. This made me so happy to see because so many games rely on grinding to extend the gameplay which is extremely tedious. The characters are great, the music can be better (tho i usually play the game with the music and sfx muted cuz i can play while doing something else) and the achievements are challenging and fun.RPGs lovers have no reason to not get this. This game is great. Cant wait for EBF5 whenever thats gonna be.10/10			"

												In today's era of multi-tasking, it's not enough to perform just one job at a time, or even engage in a single recreational activity. Take right now for example, you're probably not just reading this review. If I had to guess, you're also eating lunch, catching up on your netflix backlog, listening to music, and browsing your favorite p... nevermind. Some jokes are just too easy to make, and that's no fun. The point is, we're living in a time where all of our eyes, ears, and limbs have to be used at their maximum efficiency. On its own, Epic Battle Fantasy 4 is a solid little RPG. While its threadbare plot and meme-filled writing won't win any awards; there is a certain je ne sais quoi about the adventure. This might be attributed to the fact that boss-monsters tend to guard items that assist in exploration. The first boss guards an axe, which can be used to cut down all of the trees you might have passed by earlier. This is a linear game, but there's always an incentive to go back and collect treasure you couldn't reach before.EBF4 employs a lot of ideas specifically designed to keep gamers playing as long as possible. Alongside traditional avenues such as gaining experience, you also strengthen party-members by collecting materials and upgrading their equipment. Practically every weapon and armor has an element tied to it, and if you're playing on the hardest difficulty, you'll want to take full advantage of elemental strengths and weaknesses. To really get the advantage, you'll want to explore and obtain all of the rare stat-boosting foods as well. Since this RPG offers New Game+, which begins directly after the defeat of the final boss, you may find yourself caught in the cycle. This all-too familiar hamster wheel promises opportunities to make your party-members even stronger, and see those lovely stats & numbers get really, really high.Unless you're playing on the harder difficulties, EBF4 works quite well as a ""second-window"" game. While you're playing this decent little RPG, you can watch some videos, read a book, or do whatever else. There are a few charming cut-scenes over the course of this game that will draw your attention and remind you of what's currently going on. Otherwise your mind is free to wander onto other topics as you lead the heroes through the motions: Kill monsters, collect treasure, upgrade loot, etc. One thing I have to nitpick about is how enemy waves are handled. Most battles tend to involve multiple parties of monsters. When you destroy the first set, another set will take its place. This is all well and good, but I have a complaint. If the last enemy in one wave is killed with a counter-attack, the next wave that appears will get a free turn. I figure that this is because it's still considered the ""enemy's turn"", but it's pretty annoying when it happens. Some of the references and dialogue are also dated and uber-cringe, but it's not that big of a deal. I mean, some of the lines are just plain dumb, but I've already forgotten most of them. Of course it helps that while I played this game I was reading Three Kingdoms.With a game like Epic Battle Fantasy 4, there's only so much to talk about. Either you're 100% behind the idea of leading a plucky group of adventurers in the pursuit of higher numbers, or you just want something to busy yourself while watching four twitch.tv streams at once. For what it is, this is a fine RPG, just don't set your expectations too high.			"

												If you're into RPGs that don't take themselves seriously, or if you're into pastiches of anything and everything, then this game is for you.It plays really well. Only downside is that, as many people have complained to Matt Roszak before, you spend most of the game with a set of three characters, and leave the reserve one in the dust. Once you have a good enough skillset between three characters, there is no motivation to switching partners unless that partner's ability is ABSOLUTELY NEEDED for a particular battle.The visuals look cute, I guess. I don't know if the cutesy style goes well with some dark bosses later on, but for the most part, it works. True to Roszak's style, the machines and mechanisms in this game are so well-designed. It's generally pleasing to the eye. The animations are fluid, and the Limits look really awesome. Also, given the certain types of characters that appear in the game, and certain types of armour and equipment you get in the game, I can presume that Roszak has at least done some research into them. So, good on that front.The writing is class. There is no punny humour, but it still leaves you laughing mad. That's the kind of humour I thoroughly enjoy. I highly recommend players to not skip the dialogues because just reading them shows the amount of thought put into these jokes. Then of course, there are the occasional pop-culture references, so any future reviewer might say that this game is a product of its time, and a sort of mirror to what's going on at the time. There are certain things that aren't recommended for younger audiences, like panty stealing and the Pervert medal, so you'd have to be at a certain age level to be able to understand them -- but when you are, it really comes through brilliantly.The other language I play this game in (out of curiosity, of course, and because I speak it as my second language) is French -- and the jokes by-and-large translate well, though there are a few lines that sadly, do not get translated well, or even at all. For instance, there's that one laser that's gonna SHOOP DA WHOOP if you're not careful. That line is put in, verbatim, in its English form, in the French translation of the game. And if a French-speaker doesn't understand what 'shoop da whoop' means, it's gonna be lost in translation. There are some parts where punctuation is missing. It's little bits like these that niggle at the player, and make all the difference between a well-translated game and a poorly-translated game. It's not ""poor"" by any stretch, but could use some work. And in the case where a direct French translation can't be found, a Bowdlerism might come in handy here.All in all, it's a nice game. For someone who started out indie, this game has done well and managed to relate to any and all corners of society in some way, shape or form, and rightly so. If you're into RPGs, do try this out. If you're into parodies and pastiches, absolutely try this out. And if you're just browsing Steam looking for a game to try out, perhaps give this one a shot.			"

												I defenitely recommend this game! The steam version has many extra perks that the flash game doesn't have! Some of these perks are battle mountain (A place where you get to fight upgraded bosses. You don't get any experience, AP, or gold, but you can get some really sweet loot!) You also have the amazing soundtrack in the installation folder, if you're into that. I totally am ^^. The game also looks and sounds much better than the flash version.5/5 Amazing game C:			"

												I played kupo's games since 2009. Yes, 2009, the beginning of the Epic Battle Fantasy Series. That was even before I knew about Steam. I played the hell out of those games and still to this date, they're amazing.It is one of my favorite, or I can say my favorite Series of RPG Gaming. I am glad to see that on steam, because I wouldn't remember the old times, when I didn't saw the Steam Notification about EPF4's release.I love this game, but sadly, I cannot record it, because of the lagspikes, that happen when I move my mouse. I hope, that there will be some solutions to that problem. Maybe someday, I make a full video about this franchise.Kupo, you did make me happy with it and I hope, that you will do that in the future too with more EPF. I highly recommend it for everyone, who loves turnbased combats with a mix of humour.			"

												I want to hate this game because its humor and art-style remind me of the 12-year old meme-lords of yester-year who spoke in a mix of memes and emoticons. It almost stopped me from playing, but i regretfully have to say that this game is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. Everytime i went further in it, it surprised me again with its interesting abilities, good puzzles, and well balanced combat [at least if you play on the highest difficulty, the lower ones are way too easy]. The game lives up to its statements of being influenced by the likes of Golden Sun and Final fantasy, which is amazing since i havent seen a good rpg like golden sun in a very long time.Its fun, easy to understand, well balanced for good fun exploration, while not throwing in too much irrelevant sidequesting [which is the bane of many games]. The map is well crafted, and theres plenty of content for those who seek it.overall, actually one of the best rpgs i've played in a very, VERY, long time. But f*ck me, those memes are cancerous.8.5/10, too much memes.			"

												Epic Battle Fantasy 4 is an interesting game.  It's an ""old-school inspired"", JRPG-esque game but it's also heavily Western in styling...I know that's a strange sentance but this is a strange game.  The characters and dialogue are cheeky, fun, and likable, and the animations are well done and seem powerful.  The music is pretty good (although repetitive) and there are almost too many collectable and upgradable weapons, skills, and summons to digest at once.Even with all that said, while playing this game I strangely felt like there wasn't all that much compelling me to keep going.  I got a few hours enjoyment out of it so I don't necessarily regret the purchase but it just wasn't a gripping title by any means.  It's really a glorified web/flash game with a few perks that it picked up when it moved to Steam.Epic Battle Fantasy 4 isn't bad per se, but I don't think I would recommend it to other gamers.  That said, if it looks interesting, I'd recommend playing it for free in its original medium - a web flash game:http://www.kongregate.com/games/kupo707/epic-battle-fantasy-4If you like it and/or want to purchase it to support the developer please go ahead, the game works flawlessly as a desktop title and the port from web to client went very smoothly.All in all I'd give it a 6/10 - and I would recommend once again that interested parties check out the web version before purchasing.  The game shows potential, but really it seems to be trying to pull off what Cthulhu Saves the World and Breath of Death VII achieve much more gracefully.  However, the production value and syling of Epic Battle Fantasy seems of higher quality than the other two titles I listed, so if the author can make a few tweaks I see bright things for the future of this series.

												Short Review:Highly Recomended!The game is incredible with it's amazing artwork, fun designs and animations, superb music, collectables, and difficulty levels ranging from casual> some challenge> to Holy Crap this seems impossible but I KNOW it's not. My god it feels good to knock this game out on the highest difficulty but it's not the reason I came in the first place since this series is fantastic. If you haven't played this series yet, get on it! It's a blast (sometimes literally as the combat is way more deep than at first glance). Looking forward to EBF5 Matt!			"

												TL:DR - 8/10 would highly recommend to those who love collecting-achievements and RPGs without taking them seriously+ 12+ Hours of gameplay+ New Game++ Achievements- Lag/slow down issues- Bestiary does not save to other filesUnlike Epic Battle Fantasy 3, I find this version to be harder. The game is longer due to the bigger worlds so EXP and AP leveling is a bit slowed down it seems to make up for the larger worlds and more battles.Plenty of unlockables and pathways to go, however I find myself rarely using the new girl unless one of the original characters is dead and I am too lazy to revive them.The puzzles are still a nice challenge, not too hard but not too easy but at the same time some of them are just time consuming and this is due to the slow down.EBF3 did not have slow-down but even with turning off animations and making the graphics as low as possible my game still slows down and seem to freeze when changing to a new scenary. Heck my game crashed on me after a battle even though I had nothing else running. Now I keep saving more than ever incase it randomly wants to break down on me.I enjoy the game but the lag/slow down issues need to be fixed, other on forums have reported this. It may be due to the game being larger in size then EBF3 but my game can handle much bigger and better games graphical-wise so the issue is just a massive let-down, specially when re-checking areas for 100% completion.I would still recommend this game, I have not even completed it once yet and still have 12+ hours clocked in on this and I know generally know what to do and know the enemies already so you do get your money's worth.Only other bad thing to say is the fact Bestiary does not save over to other save-files unlike in EBF3 where they did and this was helpful because scanning was a pain. The scanning in this one is not so much of a chore but still annoying you need to rescan everything when you start a new game.			"

												This game is an awesome bundle of fun.It has a lot of the charming qualities that old turn-based RPGs had and it also has some decent writing to boot. There's a large equipment pool and a good variety of enemies. It's technical enough to be fun without dubming too much down. Proper preparation prior to battle can mean the difference between a 20-second battle and a 1-minute battle.As far as difficulty goes, the game is not very hard. The endless battles, monster marathons, and boss rush modes can provide a mild challenge if you play on Epic difficulty.Achievement-wise, there are some very simple achievements along with your standard beat-the-game achievements. There's also ones designed for hilarity (click on Natz' bewbs and touch the chicken)! You can tell the person who designed the game has a good sense of humor. The only thing I didn't like is how tedious the game felt while going through the 3rd playthrough. Since I am an achievement hunter, I felt compelled to 100% the game and trek on through playthrough #3 in order to get one of my last few achievements. One thing that I felt could have been done better is some variety when it comes to consequent playthroughs. I found myself picking up chests which served no purpose because it gave equipment I already had. If anything, those chests you've opened on older playthroughs should have something else.I recommend this game to turn-based RPG fans. It's a good deal and provides 10-15 hours of fun on each playthrough if you casually go through the content.			"

												To think, this game started life as a flash game on Kongergate:I'm not kidding about that statement, it baffles me to think that this game is flash. I've been playing this game with very little previous knowledge of the series and I've been loving it to pieces. EBF4 is a lovechild/parody of games like FInal Fantasy and other turn-based RPG's. So right off the bat, if you like those games then you will most likely love EBF4. Not a fan of JRPG's like I am? Then continue reading as this review will be based on that mentality.So first thing you may ask is ""What if I'm not great at RPG's?"" No worries, EBF4 has multiple difficulty settings so you can either worry about resistances and stats or just use the flashiest move you have. So what is so different about this game that I shoud considering it worth my money? Well the game is not serious, like at all. The game is part parody after all so the game is very funny and makes a ton of jokes at RPG's and gaming overall. The 4 charecter's are all really interesting and have a ton of good lines. Other than that, there is the previously mentioned simple but intuitive RPG combat mechanics. Most of your attacks are in the form of spells and trust me when I say there are plenty of spells to customize your movesets out. The game is very straight foward too, NPC quests is are short and sweet and there are only two optional areas to visit. Yet despite the linar design, there is a ton of replay value. The main story is about 8-12 hours but you can play through the game multiple times with harder foes and do other stuff like collect all of the medals and weapons. To tie all of the game together there is simplistic but charming art style and one of the best soundtracks to a game ever, I'm not even kidding when I say that last part.So overall, would I recommend this game to newbies of the RPG category, maybe. Would I recommend this to long-term RPG fans, definetely. Would I recommend this to those who just want to play a silly and fun idie RPG to enjoy,  yes. The game is cheap and I guarentee you'll like it.			"

												If you've talked to me for more than 20 seconds you will no doubt know that my favorite developer goes by the name ""Kupo"". Matt ""Kupo"" Rozsak made his debut with a stupid♥♥♥♥♥fighting game where you pressed SPACE before the ai opponent. it had some nice artwork and it was well made for someone working on his own, but it lacked...everything else. Kupo's next game was something far, far better.The first Epic Battle Fantasy game.5 years or so later he is STILL working on his own and produeced a game of a godlike calibre.  EBF4 was available (as were Matt's other titles) for free on Kongregate, Newgrounds, Armorgame etc for a while, but people where saying EBF3 was so good they'd pay money for it. One installment later, the Epic Battle Fantasy series had a big enough following that 3 or 4 months after the release Kupo decided to put it on steams greenlight, and so it was lit.Kupo had already programmed an expansion pack for ebf4, so obviously that is included in this version. Some minor changes are the inclusion of grey text that appears when an attack isn't very effective, and putting some new mini-bosses in some places. However, one MASSIVE expansion is that of Battle Mountain. Battle Mountain is a gauntlet, essentially. You fight your way up from the base of the mountain to the top, along the way finding the bosses from the main storyline have returned wit a few...slight twists, aswell as the inclusion of the Dark Players should you get far enough in, which are evil version of the characters you play as, mentioned to be the hardest bosses in the game by Kupo himself.EBF4 is an rpg, plain and simply. as the ladder part of the name reveals, it's taken inspiration from classics such as Final Fantasy among other popular stratagy games and rpgs. in this game you take control of 4 characters on you mission to smite god herself (yes, herself) before she can do the same to you and all the other living beings on the planet.The characters you control:-Matt: Self-inserted pirate-swordsman, Matt Uses almost exclusively physical, single-target attacks which typically don't give enemies statis ailments unless the equipped sword does so.Completely destroys Bosses and has the strongest Limit Break attack in the game (Even stronger than most enemies attacks i'd say) known as ""Cleaver"", doing 700 Base power(x5) damage without buffs. (The second strongest Limit Break does 550 base power). He also has an ability known as ""Revenge"" that deals more damage the more total-team health is missing (mostly accounting for his, but if an ally is dead the damage is boosted) making him able to shred through anything aslong as he doesn't die (obviously).-Natalie: The Healer-mage with huge♥♥♥♥♥♥ Best used as a healer, but can pull her own weight using exclusively ranged-magical attacks, having the widest move pool she's easy to expiremet with and see whether battle-mage or healer is best suited for your stratagy. For Healer, she has the only ability in the game to heal all party members at once, (without summons) and can set up combos by boosting magic attacks of allies and weakening enemies defenses. As a battle-mage, she has the usual fire-ice-electric-boom setup, but also is able to use attacks like ""Spectrum"" which deals damage and inflicts statuses based on  your currently-equipped staff. Natalie also brings a devestating holy attack know as ""Judgement"" and it's opposite, a darkness attack ""Pulsar"" to make quick work of anything of the opposite element. -Lance: Gun enthusiast and soldier of an unknown army (maybe) -Uses a mixture of Magical and physical attacks, Easily the most powerful against non-boss enemies.He can unload an entire mag of his freakin' awesome gunblade or maybe call in an airstrike, whatever way he takes enemies out, it's always flashy. Lance is able to fire lazers from space, so clearly he is my favorite to play. Easily his most devastating attack is Hyper Beam, where it requires one turn to charge, then, in the the next 3 turns you may fire it, It hits everyone for massive magical damage and reflects the elemental typing of your weapon. Facing five fire enemies at once? Switch to the water cannon and shoop-da-woop their asses out of existence. Awesome.- Anna: Nature's ♥♥♥♥♥- personally my least favorite, good for inflcting status effects with her Arrow Rain ability, and she also attacks with a mixture of physical and magical damage, leaning more towards physical. She can also learn healing spells so Natalie doesn't have to do all of it, but none of her abilities heal more than one person, to make up for that she gives healed player ""Blessed"" status, preventing them from being inflicted with status effects. She's the weakest in terms of strength and I find she's only good as a support to set up combos.The only negative things about this game-1) It's not kind to the uninformed. Not knowing that you're supposed to summon the ScanBot to get information on your enemies' weaknesses and resistences can be devastating during fights. Also, not knowing which skills to get on whom, how to spread your stat boosting items, and other essential things to survival are not taught to you. I suggest playing EBF1 or 2 before attempting this game.2) Epic mode is honesty TOO hard. in the older games Epic mode made enemies 40% stronger and gave them new moves. In this game, it makes them 100% harder, and start the battle afflicted with a status they are 200% resistent to (IE- Poison heals instead of damages). This makes the game boring as you are constantly buffing yourself and charging attacks and setting up to do the most damage possible to a level 3 slime because if you don't it will kil you by brushing up against your knees too swiftly.3) Items essental to the area you're in being given to you 2 areas ahead. This happens surprisingly often. I recall getting my♥♥♥♥♥kicked by some ice enemies only to find a staff boosting ice defense and strengthening fire attacks in the next area. Number 3 is a personal problem, but 1 and 2 should be headed if you are not a veteran to the RPG style of play. Other than that and a few minor complaints I have about the distribution of critical items, I have no real complaints.If you're not in to RPGs, this game may not be for you, as there is little in the way of minigames. If you do not like to spend time micromanaging every bit of equipment, play on normal, if you are used to RPGs in general, play on hard, if you have played through ebf4 prior, play on epic if you choose. The only reason to play on easy is if the Dark Players are making you rage and you just want to kill them already after your 40th attempt...in other words, easy is too easyTip- Use scanbot during your first move against the enemies, then run away. The flee command never fails, you can use this to get infromation on a new enemy before a fight and allow you not to waste a turn at the beginning of a fight by calling for scan bot after you enter it for the second time.Meaningless and totally bias score: 10/10 as RPGs go. This is easily my favorite of the RPG genre and I encourage anyone to atleast play the free version if you are a cheap ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.Also, I did say he was working alone, but that's not entirely true, He also Had the help of HFX who handled the music, and was given some additional designs by various fans (listed in the credits).I salute you, Kupo, You've come a long way since EBF1.

I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves a good RPG game.  With adventure aspects and amazing comedy, half the time I had to take a break from the game due to laughing so hard.  If you feel like giving the game a spin, play the free verison on Kongregate.  If you like it, why not buy a copy on steam?  Kupo Games surley deserves it for all his hard work on the series.			"

												I've played EBF IV on Newgrounds and it was one of my favorite games, also considering that I've played through I~IV each on Epic Difficulty (although, the first of the series I have not succeeded in completing on Epic Difficulty). Seeing it released on Steam and buying it on the early release got me going with hours of gameplay.Either way, it is different from the Flash Version, with Extra content and New Game+ and New Game++. Extra Content includes such as the Battle Mountain area which requires more of a strategic approach than the grinding approach. New weapons and armor to help customize to whatever best fitting for you through gameplay challenges.Difficulty-wise, you can change the difficulty at any time necessary (although, one should be playing on Epic Difficulty); for those who need a challenge or are having trouble with a slime. You should be using strategies you know.Gameplay-time, you can expect to look forward to of around 25 hours to 30 hours of gameplay for your first playthrough (and running on Epic Difficulty while gathering a majority of what you can).It provides references to other material while adding its own hint of humor.If you're still on the line of buying it or not, consider trying the Flash version for a few moments. If you do enjoy it and wish to support the creator, Matt (and HFX), then you may buy it as so. If you have travelled quite a long distance in the adventure, there is a way to transfer the saves from Flash to Steam.Overall, if you like turn-based jRPGs with wonderful quality graphics and a different plot than most, I'd recommend it.

												Alright, to begin with let's get the tricky stuff out of the way. First of all, this game is cheeky and doesn't shy away from cracking jokes at everything, itself included. If you're easily offended, you might want to keep that in mind when making your decision, but ultimately it's all light-hearted and carefree. So don't make it a political thing, it's not. Secondly, while it's true you can play this for free on Kongregate, the Steam version (like Kong premium version) adds extra features (including new game plus), an entire new zone with bosses on illegal stimulants, supports more resolutions and you get the entire soundtrack, which is, might I say, really, really good.Now with the disclaimers done and over with, let's get to the actual game.It looks old school and cartoony, with turn based combat in which you slash, hack, blast and nuke your way through loads upon loads of critters, ranging from cute bushes (never thought I'd use that phrase seriously) to intimidating elementals. Elemental strength/weaknes system is in play, and there's plenty of elements and status effects to play around with. There's a lot of room for experimentation with gear and skills, and even bosses can be beaten through different approaches.The soundtrack, as I said already, is AWESOME. No really. Just listen to it and appreciate it. It does a lot to round up the game experience. HFX has done an awesome job yet again (the only kind of job she ever does it seems).It's not a hardcore RPG, even if it offers its challenges, but that makes it no less fun. Just a word of warning: If you decide to play this, better wear a helmet, because those shards of the fourth wall are going to be a-flyin' all over the place.			"

Dev gave me a free steam key for it once it released on here. ive racked up lots of hours, completed the game all three times and earned every achievement. I love this game.The trailer's kinda cheesy, but if you like turn-based combat, lots of creative enemies and boss monsters, witty dialogue, wonderful music and environments, cutely animated scenes, and a huge selection of weapons and armor, you'll love EBF4. Matt Roszak is a totally cool dude, and this is an indie game, so you should suport him!I highly, highly recommend this game!			"

It's worth getting it on steam even if you played it before, as the steam version has some additional content.The only thing that i'm sad about is that monolyth enemies are weaker than they were in EBF3. I liked their design and difficulty, but in EBF4 they seem much easier to beat.			"

												A stellar game, from start to finish, keeping alive the old turn based battles we used to fight back in the day, with a surprising fresh twist on it. Stellar gameplay and music, a simple yet somehow still gripping story, and the freedom to kill enemies wherever you might go. The skill system means that just enough player input is required to get the most out of your battles, and the equipment and forge system means item drops are relevant throughout the game, every battle fought is a useful one. All in all, this game deserves my glowing praise for it, 10/10			"

												I've been playing this game for the past 2 weeks and absolutely love it. At first I thought it might be one of those parody/homage to old RPGs but while this game doesn't do anything revolutionary with the turn based formula it does present an interesting challenge without any of the annoyances of past well known games. First thing you should know that it does contain a lot of references from old school games like Final Fantasy to Pokemon to some less obvious. That doesn't mean this game isn't original. It's got a light hearted story and a charming cast of characters. There are a few references of previous Epic Battle Fantasy games that might be lost on you but they happen more so for comedic effect and doesn't hinder understanding the story whatsoever.I think what really makes this game enjoyable is the battle system. There's a few notable improvements on the old turn based formula that make fighting more strategic and less of a chore:1. You are able to change equipment and characters on the fly - In the middle of a battle you aren't bound to the 3 characters and if you're not quite properly equipped to handle the foes you're battling you can easily swap out equipment during your turn. Characters in reserve also recover HP/MP each turn so it makes things slightly easier. 2. Elements and status effects play a prominent role in fights - This adds a bit of challenge. Generally there's 10 elemental resistances and another dozen status effects. Instead of always equipping the stronger weapon / armor you'll find yourself adjusting to weapons of different elements for maximum damage and defense. I find this particularly nice and adds a bit of strategy because depending on the foes you're going to be changing equipment a lot. 3. Limits / Summons - Will do wonders if you know when to use them. You could opt for a blind challenge in which you don't know any of your enemies' weaknesses but, if you're not into blindly hitting anything that moves you'll end up scanning foes a lot to learn what makes them tick. Unlike most RPGs the scan feature in this game is super useful. It also helps that the scanned information is readily available after you scan each foe. It doesn't just disappear for it to be forgotten and spam attacks anyway. 4. Upgrades - You keep all your equipment so it helps that you can use various items to improve weapon resistance and deal added damage. While I do enjoy playing most games with a controller I found using my mouse extremely simple to move, access menus  and fight. Also the environments are vibrant and fresh so you don't get bored too quickly. The side quest Battle Mountain and varying difficulty levels are available for those who love a challenge. There's also 100+ achievements for the would be hunters to come back and 100% this game. I've only been on my first playthrough but I don't think replayability is high but for the price you have a decent 20hr minimum game on your hands. I would suggest if you're a fan of RPGs to get this. It's a bit light on story but it's done a couple of fun things with the battle system that will keep you entertained for a while.			"

												Go see the bad reviews :- ""Nice, but I don't like this type of game"" (well, so you are biased, good sir)- ""Too much weeb♥♥♥♥♥♥ don't like it"" (You bought with eyes closed ?)- ""I can play free in flash version"" (Doesn't make the game bad, does it ?)- ""Good game but doesn't deserve high note"" (It's based on a yes or no system, so you say it's bad just to frack the global note... that's messed up)All in all, the people voting against this game don't say it's bad.I loved this game when it was free, I still love it, I bought it just to support de dev, he deserves it.And, yes, my review is just ridiculing bad reviews, shame on me :)			"

Although I don't quite understand the huge amount of love and praise for Epic Battle Fantasy 4, I did enjoy my time enough to give it a thumb's up. Is it worth twelve bucks? I really don't think so, but its frequently on sale - and it is worth something. It is quite fun and addicting, if not a bit repetitive. I feel it suffers from a quantity-over-quality aspect where there are metric tons of items and crafting recipes, but its all just 'stuff'. Like, I don't care about the loot items, only when I can upgrade my sword. That kind of thing.Essentially, you grind through enemies over and over. You get loot, you upgrade, you grind more. It is addicting, and the animations and music are all great. While the humor really shines, the story is quite forgettable IMO.Pros:+Fun classic RPG that gets a lot right+Great animations and music+Great humor (wayyyy better than UnderTale IMO)+User interface is pretty well doneCons:-Storyline is meh-Tons of items, but who cares what they are - only if they can be a 'part' to craft that new sword (this is hard to explain)-Very grindy; you just grind enemies the whole time-Probably not worth full price IMOI've enjoyed my time in it so far, and will likely finish it. I'd totally pick this up on a sale.			"

												EBF4 is a wonderful little game available for free on browser.  While there is extra content, it's probably not worth the price of EBF4 on steam by itself.  I'd recommend trying out the game for free on Kongregate first.  Personally, I purchased the game on steam more to support the developer than for the extra content and have not regretted my decision.  The purchase convinced me to go through another playthrough which was very enjoyable and took a good 10 hours to run through.That being said, the game has little immediate replayability after completing the campaign the first time around.  It's very possible to get through all of the content in one playthrough, and the story is very linear.  The mechanics and general gameplay are very fun for sure, but there is little to no incentive to come back and play again.Overall, 8/10.  Fun gameplay, great graphics, but little replayability.Looking forward to EBF5			"

												If you like RPG's it's worth the money.For those people who are not that young and remember the SNES times with the Lufia will be happy with that game,cuz it's almost the same. You can Upgrade a lots of things and have a large collection of abilities you can learn.The nice thing about that you can't make anything wrong.It makes a lot of fun and as i said it's similar to Lufia, round based Combat, but the traveling is like Secret of Mana / Terranigma.For people from the old NES or SNES times, this is a must have. Trust me.20/10btw Good Soundtrack which in also included in the Folder where you have it installed.Really good game.			"

There's a good amount of extra content, definitely worth its price.Now, about the game...I'm a huge fan of turn-based RPGs, and this game is exactly as good as I would have expected from Matt.And I just love you developers for having included the soundtrack in the bundle, I'd listen to it all day!And last but not least, thanks for the arena. Really.Now, I'm off to play it, keep it up!			"

												Although there will always be some who are resistant to Kupo's monetary direction with the Epic Battle Fantasy franchise, I for one am glad that I can finally support this indie developer who is beloved by his fanbase, not only for the plethra of content he's put out for free online, but for the continued, friendly support he's shown across the board on his games and site.With that said, EBF4 is a light-hearted take on the RPG genre that takes the best out of its traditional norms and combines them into new, fun, and creative systems. Gone is the abnormally intense grind to level your characters beyond all reason, as enemies and bosses scale to player level, and can be brought down using a variety of strategies based on equips, attacks, and status effects, all of which you continually obtain more of to keep the battle system fresh and flexible to differing playstyles. The story is limited but enjoyable, requiring no previous experience with the series to appreciate fully. And while the map progression is a little linear at first, various secrets and puzzles still make exploration rewarding, not to mention the lack of random battles means you can set your own pace with the game, choosing the order of battles at your leisure.The addition of Battle Mountain to the Steam version was a welcome change to returning fans, and a great place to accquire game-changing gear to boost your battle tactics throughout the story and beyond. Not to mention, by the endgame, quite a challenge to clear all the boss rushes, making the last dozen or so achievements quite satisfying to get. All-in-all, a must-have for any RPG and/or Flash enthusiasts; the port from Newgrounds/Kongregate was masterfully done, with no noticeable performance issues on my end, as Kupo was thorough in addressing them into and well after release.If the price tag is a little too steep for you, pin it on your wishlist for a while, Kupo's never modest about putting EBF4 for generous sales throughout seasonal events and not. Or check out his other titles first, here or elsewhere: EBF3 is up on Steam for free, and is a good demo of what you'll be seeing in this one.			"

												If you like Final Fantasy and silly humour this game is pure win.EDIT:  After finishing the whole game on normal, I'm still very impressed and have penciled in a second playthrough on hard difficulty at some point.  Here's a more in depth analysis.First up, I love the inventory.  You can hold every item in the game but there is no problems with clutter.  You never have to worry about a full inventory or wonder if you should sell an item you may need later on.  Huge time saver, I hate managing inventory.Abilities are chosen with experience points.  There are skills and specials.  Skills are character specific, like the fighter gets sword skills, the ranger gets bow skills.  Specials can potentially be learned by 2-4 characters but only one of them can actually learn it.  For example the skill ""power metal"" can be learned by either of the guys but not both of the guys.  Limit breaks (yes there are limit breaks) fall into one of these two categories as well.  So there's some careful balancing to make sure your party functions well.Equipment is easy to manage and you will be needing to switch weapons/armor/trinkets from time to time to deal with various types of enemies.  Your mage wont be needing that fire damage staff against fire elementals, for example.  Equipment can be changed during combat at the cost of a turn in case you get caught by something unexpected.  Certain fights you'll be changing gear more then once as different enemies appear.Equipment can all be upgraded through crafting.  Not the sort of annoying crafting where you have to sort through tons of crap and figure out just how much rough stone you need to make enough widgets to make 20 springs.  Basically you open the upgrade menu, things that can be upgraded with your current mats are highlighted, things that can't are not.  It cuts the crap and simply boils it down to the desicion of, is this where you'd like to spend these materials?  Most of the items I was using were maxed by the end of the game with no particular effort to farm or buy materials.  2-3 weapons per char, 1-2 armors, 1-2 helmets, and a whole whack of trinkets.  The real meat of the combat boils down to resistances and damage types.  8 types of elemental damage and 8 debuffs, all with their own counterpart resist stat.  Fortunatley you don't have to memorize 16 stats for every enemy type.  When an enemy typs is scanned with your scanbot, you can hover over them to check their stats at any time for the rest of the game.There are also summons, as you'd expect from a final fantasy game, however they are not spammable in this.  You get summoning points for each kill depending on monster strength and use the summoning points to ... summon.One thing that always bothered me about Final fantasy and Chrono Trigger was how end game tended to revolve around spamming your biggest AoE, a lot.  It looked like this game was heading that direction in the mid game, but toward the end that was just not possible.  Mixed immunities ensures you aren't just spamming a single AoE forever.  This game really took all the good out of final fantasy and boiled away a lot of the crap.  8.5/10			"

												This game is perfect. Even in its most awful moments, of which there are plenty, it is very clear that the writer is quite aware of the awfulness of his sense of humor. Cats as gods? Absurd, so perfect. NoLegs the Cat? PERFECT NAME. This is the best kind of bad and is quite aware of it, somehow also having a more cohesive story than most decent games.

												I haven't even finished this game yet, as of writing this review (6 hours in), and can already say that this is great to play.  The sense of humor is delightful, and includes many homages to classic RPG's.  The difficulty curve at this point is well balanced between intentionally overly difficult and trivially easy, and the battle system is broad enough to require tactical thought, but simple enough to be easy to learn.  But the real strength of this game, as noted above, is in the comedy, which balances subtlety and silliness rather well, imho.			"

												by reading that title you're probably gonna assume it's a Final Fantasy knockoff, but don't be so quick to drop this game!Gameplay: you explore around the game's map in a zelda/dragon quest style overworld map,you can use arrow keys/WSAD to move on the maps, but in combat it's mouse only (no gamepad support)the game is a turn based RPG, battles aren't random, but instead you run into an enemy to engage them in battle, combat is done with 4 party members, 3 of which are active in battle and one is the backup that you can switch in without wasting a turn, and also recovers their HP/MP while in backup. you got your nature based archer Anna, your cliche powerful swordsman Matt, the well-endowed mage Natalie, and the crazy gun maniac and tank summoner Lance.you defeat your enemies using all of your many equipments: weapons, clothes, accessories, Flairs which each have their own resistances/elements (there's a lot!) and they all can be upgraded to increase their effectiveness, not only that but you got skills and magic at your disposal as well!each enemy has different weaknesses/resistances that you NEED to pay attention to, unless you wanna do 0 damage, or worse, HEAL your enemies by accident, luckily you can ""scan"" enemies using your summoned scanbot which forever allows you to see their weaknesses/resistances.each character has their own skills to learn that are unique to each one, but there's also skills that are shared between them, but only ONE can use them so you'll have to plan around this a bit, you can forget skills if you really need to.there's also ""limit breaks"" not unlike a FF game you charge your limit guage by taking damage and unleash powerful moves, like a rapid-hit sword slash combo, summoning a space ion-cannon, or fully healing your partyand then you can use summons, which use SP that you gain from defeating enemies, like a dog that throws healing items to you, an Ice elemental that freezes enemies, and a cat with no legs that slashes everyone, and later on even summon boss monsters to your side!oh and there's quests that require you to grab certain (rare) items and bring them to NPCs, cause they're too lazy to do it themselves!Music/sound:this game's soundtrack is what makes it a little more unique, of course it's all original and done by an awesome artist (BTW soundtrack comes with the steam game!) it really sets the mood of the game. if you've played the flash game, the quality of both sounds and music are a LOT better on this version!Graphics:if you're looking for awesome 3D graphical eye-gasms... well you might not enjoy thisbut if you like hand-drawn 2D sprites and comical anime-style character designs this game has all of that! don't worry though the graphics are pretty well done for what they are, with idle animations for both party members and enemies alike, no static combat sprites here! and a lot of the skill/limit break animations are awesome!I should mention the entire game was originally designed in adobe flash, but personally this has to be one of the best flash graphics I've seen!again, this version has better graphics quality from the flash game. with resolutions up to 1280x800 and fullscreen! Difficulty:this game has an adjustable difficulty from 4 settings, that you can change at ANY TIME. believe me when I say it makes the difference of a cakewalk 10 hour game, to uber insane Bosses that 1-hit KO the unprepared!!the games difficulty changes the enemy stats by a percentage, making them have more/less HP and do more/less damage to youEasy (50%) normal (100%), hard (150%), Epic (200%)you get the same EXP, money and AP regardless of difficulty, some achievements require you to play on epic that's all.Replayability:other than different difficulties, the game has a ""second quest"" and ""third quest"" mode which is basically the same game again but with higher level enemies. and also has a new game+ so you can play again and again while still keeping your levels, AP, and equipment.there's a bonus area called Battle Mountain, that holds extra bosses and challenge battles, including one that puts you against  multiple bosses back to back! also you can try to finish every quest, learn every skill to max, and forge all your equipment to max, and reach lv99 if you wish to do so.Summary:even though it started as a flash browser game, it has to be one of the most AWESOME flash RPGs i've played, and in some ways better than a lot of mainstream RPGs.this steam version includes  all the ""premium"" features from the browser version, with better sound and graphics quality, and allows you to transfer saves from the browser game to the steam game! (read in forum how to do this)it's pretty damn entertaining, the game makes jokes on itself and the dialog, both in battle and out, can be fun to read. but, damned if your first encounter with ""God Cat"" won't catch you off guard, and it'll quickly remind you why this game is called EPIC battle fantasy!!THERE'S ALSO A FREE VERSION ON KONGREGATE.COM, NEWGROUNDS.COM AND ARMORGAMES.COMtry that first, this one's an UPGRADED version with all the additional content included!!for those wondering why buy the steam game over the free browser one:-second and third quests included (premium only on browser game)-higher graphics, and sound quality (1280x800, and fullscreen)-Battle Mountain area which holds the ""premium"" items from the browser game.-cloud saves through steam, if you realize how easily you can lose your browser game data, this is IMPORTANT!!-26 track soundtrack included with the game!!

												This game is a must buy for anyone that is a fan of RPGs and one of the best RPGs available for the PC. The art style is very easy to look at and is one of those styles that will never look old. The animation effects during battles are all awesome to look at. The sounds make every hit and effect seem very powerful. It's not something easy to explain, until you experience it for yourself. As the title of this game says, the main focus is on the epic battles throughout the game. Lots of care and attention to detail has been put into the battle system. Gone are the random encounters from outdated RPGs. You see every enemy on the screen now and can choose whether to fight it or not. As soon as you touch an enemy, the battle instantly loads. No more waiting around for loading times. The combat system has so much depth. There are *a lot* of different strategies you can use to fight enemies in this game. Different equipment, elemental effects/resistances, skills, crafting and items are all very important in taking down enemies. The boss battles are very epic and will challenge you to see if you have been learning how to play efficiently. You will spend a lot of time figuring out what equipment and skills to use for taking down a boss.Postgame has the optional Battle Mountain area. Always thought it would be a great idea if RPGs would include a way to fight every enemy in the game during some marathon battles? Welcome to Battle Mountain. Where all normal encounters, minibosses and bosses are thrown into some very difficult battles to test just how good at this game you truely are. Not to mention the extremely difficult new enemies created for that section of the game.Love collecting achievements in games? This game has over 100 Medals/Achievements waiting to be unlocked. The music is some of the best I have ever heard in a game. You will definately find at least a few songs that you think are amazing. It fits every area and encounter so perfectly. There is also a New Game + mode where you can carry over all your equipment and skills. Enemies will level up and everything will be even more difficult this time around.There are so many things this game did right for an RPG. You are truely missing out on a great RPG, if you don't give this a try.You will spend around 50 hours trying to complete it.			"

												When you first look at this game you might judge it too quickly and believe that it is not worth it and you will be doing the biggest mistake in your whole life... okay I am exagerating here, but trust me. I have played this game when it only had the flash version and I played most of the previous versions too. It has a fun and cool story, the artwork is pretty cool and the soundtrack is amazing, I get the feels just by listening to the soundtrack while not playing the game at all.Another thing is, you might expect it to be just another simple RPG game, but this game has a complex system with many stats and elements and you might find a great challenge while playing in the EPIC difficult, but you can also just go for the casual or normal difficult.You might find yourself enjoying playing this game much more than many AAA games out there.I would like to thank Matt Roszak, Halcyonic Falcon X and everyone else who helped to make this masterpiece.

												Epic Battle Fantasy 4 is by far the best parody games I have ever played.  It pokes fun at a lot of classic console RPGs, but the real heat of the game is the way they combined what made so many other games so memorable.The game is a simplistic true turn based RPG on the outside, but stesses a depth of strategy with a wide variety of equipment and monsters that have elemental strengths and weaknesses.  There isn't a single weapon or piece of armor in the game that is optimal for each and every battle (there are some that come close to defying this though).  You strenthen your weapons and armor through a basic crafting system that requires a hunt of scarce materials, but offers an item shop near the end of the game where you can buy the materials you might need at a hefty cash price.  There is even a achievement for poking...  Uh...  Nevermind.  The storyline and plot is pretty flimsy, but on the flip side, there isn't a need to grind to complete the game.I strongly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys console RPGs of the 90s, even if they didn't grow up in the 90s.  There isn't any need to play the earlier iterations of the games to keep up with the jokes.			"

												This game is very much a product of its time. It condenses all that was irreverent, wonderful, and magical about the internet culture of 2010. EBF4 is impressive in its scope. Its art-design remains fresh & unmistakably original. And, its level of challenge is almost without peer. It's also brimming with memes...ancient memes. References that were stale at its launch, and by now practically paleolithic. However, if you experienced the golden age of ♥♥♥♥♥ first hand, or ever doodled on drawball.com, or spent endless hours playing every free to play game that used to pop up on Newgrounds front page, than Epic Battle Fantasy 4 will be a perfect time capsule for an internet culture long gone, but warmly remembered. Highly, HIGHLY recommended for most every netizen in their mid-late 20s. For others...less so.			"

												So, you're wondering if this game is worth your time? YES.Worth your money? Yes. definately!In this game, you control Anna, a ranger whom ends up tracking down the team of Epic Battle fantasy 3 on the accusation of them having stolen the gem of her village. You end up going on an epic adventure with them, going through adorable settings all over. The game is beautful with hand drawn settings that have tons of love in them, making every single area feel likable, even if it's not your favorite!You'll be playing with a total of 4 characters, having 1 of them on backup in case your main team falls, and for me that meant that the person on back-up often ended up being forgotten in regards to stat boosting items and equipment upgrades, but that's how i like to play the game. The person in back-up gets XP just like everyone else in battle, as long as they are alive at the end of the battle. Switching someone out with the back-up is smooth and seamless at the single press of the button, and if you regret it you can always switch right back. The battles move at your own pace, as the enemies cannot take their turn until you are done with yours, making the game move however you want it, wether you wanna go fast and spam your strongest move or if you carefully want to plan out the next upcoming turns.The game thrives on it's exploration, the humor and hidden references (which unfortunately had to be partially censored at least by name in order to avoid legal issues as far as i'm aware), but most importantly the music. Oh man, the music is great! It's often high tempo, but it calms down when it needs to, and it does a fantastic job att setting the mood for the current situation, which is really the only thing you'd truly want out of music for an RPG game.The game also features a bit of puzzle solving and NPC quests (most of which are fetching quests where you give them crafting items of different kinds) but if that's not your slice of cake, it's not a problem because the quests are entirely optional as far as i know, and the puzzle solving, while mandatory in some parts, is never so difficult that you feel like you want to take a break because the puzzle is just difficult.Now, there is a free to play version available on the web, both on Matt's own website aswell as several different gaming websites, but there are a couple of differences. Mainly, on the premium versions on the gaming websites as well as the steam edition, you can access an area called Battle mountain, which features tons of bonus equipment, items, skills, summons and more. But most importantly, it features some very heavy challenges, ones that will have even the best of players on the edge of their seats as they lose over and over, slowly making progress towards that sweet goal, giving you a dark souls feeling of success when you finally complete the ordeal! That takes me to the difficulty of this game!Overall, this game isn't particularily hard in many ways. The puzzles aren't extremely complex for the most part, the battles shouldn't give you that much trouble, and there's plenty of oppurtunity to heal yourself in between battles (one of which is just to stand around, as you do have natural regeneration on both MP and HP), but here's the fun part.On the options menu, you can instantly switch between the 4 different difficulties at any point on the world map, and since the battles are all actively triggered along with fleeing being 100% reliable, you can customize the experience according to how you like to play your games!If you want to play through the game having a chill time, you could just cruise through on easy.If you want to play through the game having a TOUGH time, you should play on Epic, which is when the game itself becomes so incredibly difficult at some parts that you might have to end up fleeing a battle, changing your entire equipment loadout and then trying again. However, if you feel that a battle is at any point TOO difficult for you, it's always possible to simply flee and turn the difficulty down.As for equipment, there is a ton of variation in everything from weapons to armor and accessories.Every character has their own type of weapons, and every type of weapon comes in a varied and unique form, ranging from a gun made of marble in the shape of a fist that will smite undead foes and steal health based on how much damage you do to a bow that will inflict random status ailments on each hit to a staff that is a literal incarnation of deaths' scythe, you'll find your favorite to use pretty quickly. However, even if you find the number one weapon you prefer, almost never will weapons feel obselete as enemies come in a ton of different elements and forms, and weapons almost always carry with them a special element, so ultimately, it comes down to deciding wether you want a weapon for its stats or if you want it because of the special effects it triggers. A lot of different equipment trigger special events before your turn starts, such as a random attack triggering before you get to act, or maybe a random positive buff on your character.The armor is divided into two groups, one with male armor and one with female armor, since there's 2 of each in the game. This is nice as upgrading one set of armor could potentially benefit both of the specified users, however i feel this is also a slight drawback as if one armor set is used by one character, the other one has to use a different once, which can lead to trouble sometimes if you are for example looking for specific elemental resistances and you only own 1 armor piece which protects against it, as you'd then have to choose which one would be allowed to equip it.Furthermore, accessories are shared across all your characters, and they come in the form of small badges, and while the effect more often than not isn't extremely impactful, it's nice to get small additional bonuses from time to time.Overall, this game is alot of fun, any fans of RPG games or JRPGs will most likely instantly love this game, and for people that aren't into RPG's yet but are looking for somewhere to start, this would make a great candidate!Rating for this game:Visuals: 9/10Audio: 10/10Gameplay: 8/10 (my only problem is that i wish there was some other way to control the battle menu besides the mouse :C)Final grade: 9/10If this game is on sale, do consider buying it, as it will 100% garanteed (by me) be worth it.Also, you gotta give him some credit, it's a single (not relationship wise) guy doing so much work, by both drawing everything, programming everything and man, you KNOW there's been put some blood, sweat and tears into this game! I love it!			"

												I've been playing this game since it was a Flash Game, and it always make me come back for more.It has an excelent jrpg gameplay with easy to understand menus, a great artstyle, cool designs, a unique and ironic sense of humor and omg the soundtrack.As I said, I used to play EBF4 on Kongregate, but as soon as I knew that there was a Steam version with some new features I immediately decided to buy it as soon as possible.And I enjoyed it once again, but this time even more.This is a game that changed my life, honestly; it made me look at games and art in general from a different perspective. But maybe that's just me.Anyways, excellent game, I'm looking forward for EBF5. ;3			"

												tl;dr Thick and juicy: either I'm talking about ""Epic Battle Fantasy 4"" or I'm craving steakThe ""Epic Battle Fantasy"" series have always been a love letter to the RPGs of old but it wasn't until the third game that the series really started shining. The fourth game takes everything that made number 3 great and multiplies it several times over. The game isn't especially long but it's thick offering a ton to do with subsequent playthroughs including a plethora of achievements to unlock and multiple boss rushes for an added challenge. Couple that with a great soundtrack and you've got yourself an RPG that's well worth your time.			"

												Well, this game is incredible. It shows what determined developer can do from little flash games. Third part was succes, but this one is even better and Kupo works currently on part 5. You don't need to play previous versions of the game (You can find them all on Kongregate), but it will help to understand some dialogues. Dialogues are super funny and filled with eastereggs. Like the whole game. I've lost count of how many easter eggs I've encountered. The story isn't complicated, it's funny and interesting. All game mechanics work great, every boss is well done and challenging (Especially on Epic difficulty, when you want to gain some achievements). If you aren't sure about buying this game, you can play it on Kongregate for free, but this one includes premium content (which is awesome) and supports the creators.Also, take a note that only 2 people created that game, Kupo (Matt Roszak) as programist and Phyrnna (previously Halcyonic Falcon X / HFX) as musician.I recommend this game for anyone.

												So,here I am,writing a review on this amazing game. I'm 9 hours off to have 100 hours in total put into this game,almost beating the game a second time and now,at Temple of Godcat. Let's do this.So let's get straight to the point,to me,and probably to the whole community the selling point was the humor and the artstyle. I also really like the voice in the trailer. Since i was younger,I was playing this game,even tough I was just clicking random stuff. But now that I actually UNDERSTAND how this game works,it's super fun! The vast choices of your spells,to figuring out wich one does the most damage. To scanning new foes,great bosses and so on. But the DLC actually gives you WAAAAY more playtime! (About 15 hours plus). And I love it! Now let's take a look at the Pros and Cons:Pros:-Humor-Artstyle (Who dosen't love anime?)-The battle system and all the spells you can hit your foes with-The way encountering foes works,you don't have to get that chest or battle that random foe,just pass 'em like they aren't there!-You don't have to grind,you can but the foes level with you so it dosen't really matter.-The bosses are great,but the remakes on Battle Mountain are amazing!-The way Kupo interacts and let's their fans make some foes,and sometimes even bosses!-The creativity and time Kupo puts into this.-The songs! They're so great! And the soundtrack is free,how generous of him!-His games are still going strong,especially this one!-A fifth game is coming out! How exciting!And now,let's take a look at the Cons.Cons:-He deserves just a little bit more attention.-The bosses take a little bit longer then they should.-The walking system is kinda bad. But there are Slime Cats to teleport you around,so it's not that much of a problem.I hope this review helped you choose if you should buy this game,and the community says hell yeah! I mean,you don't see alot of ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" games now,do you?Well,I don't really know how to end a conversation/review so I'm just gonna say a bye with a heart at the end.Bye! <3(I've awarded this game for the The ""Villain Most in Need of Hug"" Award).

												Honestly one of the best games I've ever played. The items are great, the gameplay is easy to understand, and the character interaction is hilarious.Each weapon/attack/item has it's pluses and minuses. What may be great for one battle may be awful for another. This is nice because you actually need to pay attention to equips, not just get ""the one armor set."" You actually have to use your brain a little bit to play, but not so much that it's exahausting (for example, you wouldn't go into a battle with light creatures wearing only darkness armor, you'd be screwed).In terms of gameplay, you can switch between using your mouse or your keyboard, an option that other games lack. Also, in terms of battles, you have plenty of time to think and do what you need. While some may like time-constraints, Epic Battle Fantasy 4 provides for a more stress-free type gameplay. All your abilities and options are easy to navigate to, and thus far I have not run into a single glitch.The characters are great. That's something that could be said about this entire franchise, but especially this and EBF3. There is so much interaction between the characters, enemies, and the environment. Battle after battle can get boring, but the witty dialogue balances this out nicely.All-in-all, this game is perfect for those looking for a relaxed RPG experience: no time-constraints or reflex-speed battles, vibrant colors that don't strain your eyes, and lots of easter eggs from Minecraft, Pokémon, and more just in case the fantastic characters didn't already have you hooked.

												Epic Battle Fantasy 4 (EBF4 for short) is the fourth installment of popular jRPG-esque seriesthat originated as web browser games. The series is basically a parody of famous Japanese RPG games (mostly Final Fantasy). If you want some more preview on the older games, I suggest you read my review on previous game, EBF3 (which is also on Steam), if you haven't already.But to keep things short, I'll just give you a small preludium: the series started as free browser games that were made for fun and played to kill some free time, and even EBF4 itself can be played via your browser, but there's also an expanded, paid version (AKA the one I'm reviewing now), and it's not exactly cheap, 11,99 USD. Some professional games cost as much, and thus, the game will be judged like one.So, first, what's the premise?As a rather typical jRPG like game, you can expect the usual: explore the world, find treasures, both hidden and not, talk to stupid NPCs so they can give you their stupid quests, upgrade your skills and fight the enemies ( and there's lot of those). The game world	The creator approched the matter with a safe and proven method: the world itself is open, but it's filled with various obstacles and road blockers (such as rocks or trees, but also more absurd ones, like floating clouds) that make your road linear at first, but with time you acquire means of bypassing them, one by one. This not only allows you to progress, but also lets you find hidden treasures, enemies, and other content, so you will definitely be coming back to old places through your entire playthrough.As I've said, it's a safe method that was used in countless titles. And it's not a bad thing really. Experimenting is good if you know what you're doing, but if something just works, I see no reason not to use it.The world itself will charm you with its simple graphics (which are still a major improvement over the previous one) and varied environment, as well as subtle themes to be found, such as various references to other media and clever comments spoken by your team members.  Overall it may not be masterfully crafted, but it's full of its own unique charm. CombatCombat has always been THE core element of these games, and as such I'm very happy to say it spectacularly failed to disappoint me. Not only it's great on its own, it also improved on everything from the previous games without changing the basis even slightly.Aside from the usual stuff like attacking, healing and using your Limit Breaks, there's 12 different status effect, 10 elements and over 100 unique skills which can be used BY you, or AGAINST you. Add shiploads of unique pieces of equipment and you've got EBF4.That means a vast array of different strategies that you can use to defeat your enemies, and believe me, if you play on Epic (the hardest difficulty), you will want to spend some time thinking about them.Want to debuff your enemies to such point they can barely scratch you? Sure. Want to go full offense and counter your lack of defense by making your enemies unable to move? Guess that will work too.Naturally enemies have their strengths and weaknesses, and there's a whole lot of them (147, to give you the idea), so you will have to use everything at your disposal thorough the game.Overall it's just what a good turn-based jRPG should look like. Give the players freedom in their playstyle and let them experiment. I have absolutely no reason to complain. Story and quests Each game has its pros and cons, and I've already explored the pros.Now, the story was never the main focus of these games, but it still deserves some attention. I can't really say much without spoiling it (as the story is partially revealed thorough the game). I'll just say that if you're enjoying the game itself, then the story will keep you interested, but if the game doesn't turn out to be your type, you won't stay just for the story.The quests are just what they were in the previous game - that is, fetch quests. You are told to get some items, and you either get them from defeating monsters (or buying them from shop), or from some treasure chests, or from other quests. Simple as that. I can't say I expected more, but it certainly would be nice to see a more expanded and developed quest from time to time. Say, a bunch or chain of quests that all give you key items that together allow you to challenge some hidden boss or whatever. Finale The game is moderately long, with plenty of additional content (most notably a fully optional location featuring lots of optional bosses and extremely long and challenging enemy waves, full of unique treasure), and fun gameplay will make sure you will play more than one time.If you're an old-school fan of the jRPG genre (I'm not, personally), it's a must have.If you're new to jRPGs or RPGs in general, you should at least give this game a try. If you're not sure about spending money on it, go ahead and try the browser version (or previous games whatsoever). If you happen to enjoy them, then definitely buy it, as it's only better than all that came before.I give it a solid 9/10			"

												Turn-based RPG created by Matt Roszak and his first game that is not binded to a browser. Full of different equipment that have varying properties to help you deal with the enemies.You will meet insanely hard bosses with attacks that may destroy your whole party if you're not prepared.And of course your party has tons of epic skills and limit breaks (which are awesome :D) that may help you on your adventure.Game is full of secrets and epic references to popular games, music and media and it has an awesome soundtrack made by HalcyonicFalconX.Story is told with humour and it makes you laugh even in grim situations.The world is pretty large so a lot of roaming is included altough you need to access a lot of quest items to roam free. In the end, game progresses in a linear fashion trough all different zones excluding some secret places and the Battle Mountain area.Also, this game has achievements. A lot of them. And they vary from starting the game to killing insane bosses on epic difficulty.Buy the game and support the developer. It is worth it.			"

												Surprisingly fun Final Fantasy-inspired (with a little Golden Sun and Pokemon influence) JRPG-style game. The game is pretty lighthearted and doesn't take itself too seriously. Large variety of items/gear to collect, skills to unlock and chose from, and monsters to encounter. On the higher difficulties, you have to make sure your party make-up is balanced as far as elements, as monsters all have various elements and status conditions that they are either strong or weak against. Combined with the possible synergies between gear and skills, it gives the combat system enough depth to have it not feel stale after a while.Some minor knocks include lack of widescreen support and lack of built-in controller support. Also obviously, if you dislike JRPGs, this game will not appeal to you.			"

												I've played EBF since the first game, and it's always been one of my favourite RPGs.The game has a nice aesthetic, a classic tried and true battle system, lots of room for strategy.The characters are likable, if a bit cliche'd. The dialogue is not the best, but it is very light hearted and not intended for the overly serious.The game it'self has a large amount of content, which will keep you occupied for hours upon hours. The story alone is 10+ hours, which is double what most ""real"" games have thse days. And that 10 hours is a lower esitimate, only if you are fast and don't go gear hunting etc.You may see people complain that someone is daring to charge for a game you can play for free on New-grounds, Kongregate and Armour games.A couple of points against these naysayers.Firstly, you are paying to support a developer who already has this game and 3 others out for free (and others of differing genres, like bullet hell?) Don't wanna pay? you can play it for free, so how is that even a relevent complaint.By paying for this game, you gain access to extra content, an awesome soundtrack (that I hear costs $12 by it's lonesome), which can be found in the install folder. And you support a developer who has devoted years of his life to creating such content to give to the world for free, think of it as a donation.GFX 8/10 - The overworld spriates are lacking, but have a certain charm to them. The in battle sprites are full of life and charm.Music 10/10 - halcyonicfalconx never fails to deliver. http://halcyonicfalconx.new grounds.com/Gameplay 8/10 - A good old classic turn based RPG strategy battle game. Nothing groundbreaking, but don't fix what isn't broke amiright?Replayablity 8/10 - Lot's of content, newgame+, battlemountain challenges, medals, achievments.Overall Rating 8.5/10 - Well worth playing, even if you arn't willing to buy it, go play it for free on Kongregate or New-grounds			"

												Just to get this out of the way, it is my opinion first of all and i have already played this game on Epic at kongergate,so my play hours wont be as high on steam. I played the older veriosn first and other minigames made by the same person (group now i think) and enjoyed them in my younger years.younger being important because you would find many things fun. i was hyped for this game and i am  overwhelmed with it, it delivered Meow,Meow, MEEEOOWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I mean come one  >:O Epic battle fantasy 4 on steam .This is where it belongs >:OOOOOO. Its a flash game but allllllllll that effort put into it is amazing .The art ,music everything and it all works. the combat may be turn based but once you have the swing of things  :D Its not a short game too which is awesome and with all that loot out there youre gonnna have a goood time. I played this on Kong yes the *free version*  ( DONT BUY IT ON STEAM ;=; this man is ripping you off)  yeah right >.>  only people who dont read say that ;ppppp so dont let that stop you from buying this epic game. Cause you have to buy that extra stuff online for more  so why are people saying this is a riff of if its a bit cheaper here >.> even if its the same price its still better on steam and why not support this dev , I mean look at the quality of the game and all the effort put in from this small team maybe even just the dev himslef has done plus no adds, no need to go on  armour games or anything like that . Its just epic battle fantasy and you till ya bored,which will take a very long time) . Another thing i like is how the dev uses fanart  and even got one  of his enemies from the fanbase. How cool is that. Story 8/10 (yes there is a story)= Cats plotting to take over the world!!?? Now thats new.(wierd but it works alright,might need to understand ebf and is preious games to understand some jokes but it does eplain briefly)Gameplay 10/10= its rurn based combat and it works like silk, you move around a the map from birdseye,play the free version because this can be an issue for some people.Music 10/10= is Ammazing and everyplace has its own theme and combat mode themes adding atmosphereFun 9/10=depending on your difficulty, i play epic so there are some boss battles and even access to new areas when you just give up but do return.Ramping up the difficulty does provide and *Epic* challenge and it might seem undoable but with the skills and items you have Victory is always possible and for anyone whos into these types of games you will spend hours on this game.The homour is great among our characters who all have their own traits and since they are silent you can voice them in your own way.(Which can be extremely entertaining)The free version itself is amazing anyway and thats all it took for me to throw my money at my screen when this came out. If you dont like this kind of rpg turn base stuff then maybe the anime refereneces will keep you going >.< if that does not maybe try the free version online and if you like it a lot  buy it and get all the extras here and share it with ya friends :DDD.im to excited for the future of Epic Battle Fantasy series as a whole.

												Epic battle fantasy 4 is one of those games you have to play! It's a turn-based RPG, That has a viraity of Characters, Weapons and Skills each Character has is Unqine. The Dialog in this is very enjoyable, the story is very great and the Bosses? Awesome! You can upgrade each and every armor piece with all the different items from killing monsters and opening chests!If you don't know what this game plays like. Play the one on Newgrounds or anywhere you find it.One thing I don't recommed is Starting the game on Epic diffculty like I did! but if you want a challage, then go for it!The Music by far one of the best things about this game in my book and Graphics? looks better than most game for it's 2D anime-like Spites (I think there hand-drawn....I don't know).I recommed this game to RPG fans anywhere and peoples whove never play an RPG.

The graphics are amazing. The bosses are creative. The dialouge is funny. The only real problem I have with the game is the battle system. Sometimes. It gets boreing and repepitive.

												The Steam trailer is kind of awful. Anyway…Epic Battle Fantasy 4 is a turn-based RPG. This was not my entry into the series, I played this and its three predecessors over at Kongregate. Yes, that’s right, I played this Flash game for free on Kongregate. And beat it. Several separate times. And when it came out on Steam, I bought it, and beat again. Yeah, you can play a slightly less content version of this game for free if you want. But stay with me for a little longer as we get into this recommendation.I’m not going to deny the game is a little immature. I mean, “anime boobs” is right there on the Steam page. But I will say it’s not that horrible. The fan service isn’t really overbearing, nor is it even all that present. A comparison would be, if you watch anime that includes fan service, then this game has less. If you think most/all anime is horrible and incredibly juvenile, then you should probably pass on this game. Just putting that out there.The game is lighthearted and doesn’t take itself seriously. NoLegs the cat has no legs (all the cats have no legs, actually), Matt is a big sword fan (in both meanings), etc.  Character dialogue (no voice acting) is humorous in a cheesy, silly way.Look, I bought this because I enjoyed the series, and wanted to support the developer. I do recommend getting this game on a sale. You want a demo? You don't want to buy it? Look it up online. Play it. You’ll miss out on a little bit of extra stuff. Whatever, I can’t stop you. Steam version does come with free soundtrack download though, and the soundtrack is pretty nice.  "

												A very cute and quirky turn-based JRPG. If you only have a laptop that's a few years old (like I do) you may need to turn down the settings a bit as there's a bit of lag. If you have a good computer, though, max it up. So, here's what you need to know about the game before you buy:1. It's a turn-based JRPG. Think Final Fantasy up to FFX and you'll get a good idea about what you're getting into.2. There is a story, though it's usually behind a lot of humor, including a bit of meta humor. If you want a game where there is a story, but with a lighthearted tone (for the most part), this should be good.3. Depending on how you play the game can be preeetty lengthy. It depends on whether you want to grind just enough to beat the bosses or grind A LOT and look around for any treasure.4. Lots of skills to learn and equipment to find, and all of them can change your appearance. It's a good way to mix and match the characters you get in terms of the roles you want them to have in combat.12 dollars is an alright price for what you get here (though it'd probably be smart to wait for a sale). If you're really stringy about if you want this game, though, you can play the first three EBF games (as well as a slightly stripped version of this one) for free on most flash game websites.			"

												Started by playing it on kongregate, decided to buy it so i could play it through actually with saves. I have to say that it's great fun to play, light hearted and colourful. If you want to take a game seriously, then it's not for you, but if you want plenty of jokes, fairly simple combat, and a whole load of achievements to grind out, then it's for you.			"

												Best use of farm animals - Steam Awards Nomination 2016To start, this game is simply amazing.The characters have their own personality (which is rare for a lot of RPG's), the enemies are stupid in a hilarious way, the bosses are random in a stupid ways.It's just beautiful.The story of the game, if what is above isn't enough to convince you of it's amazingness, is the godcat, the creator of the world, is pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at the cats for becoming slaves to the humans, so godcat took away their limbs. Now, an unknown period of time later, godcat has returned and is going to destroy the world unless you stop it.Other than the game being hilarious, it also has an amazing combat system that's relatively simple and easy to understand if you just try.Each enemy has it's own weaknesses (or er.. not), and each boss is unique. Each time you replay the game, you find another achievement or easter egg that just makes you fall in love with the game all over again.If all of this isn't enough, listen to the game's soundtrack. Simply beautiful. The artist, Phyrnna, even has her own fandom (whether she knows it or not).Matt & Phyrnna, well done.I truly respect what both of you have done, and am eagerly awaiting EBF5.			"

												A nice RPG and an interesting story.It's also easy to pass the God Cat(the final boss).Unless you want to beat it on Epic Difficulty.You also don't need to kill foes over and over again to get EX,because it's completely enough to kill the necessary fores.But,for some players who want to get all medals,it's really hard.Because you have to beat every boss on Epic Difficulty.So you need to beat normal foes on Epic Difficulty or you won't have enough EX to upgrade.A fight can last 10~15 minutes and a boss fight can last 20 minutes or even longer. It's surely worth the price.			"

												I'll be honest, after I bought this game I had a sinking feeling it'd be kind of a forgetable RPG, but as you can see by my hours it actually turned out to be pretty damn decent.Weapons and armors are straight forward but have a lot of different combos you can use and switch out withHumor is goodCombat is the usual you hit me I hit you and the visuals and utilities of the moves are actually something you'll itch to upgrade when you get the exp or points for.Only irk I'd say is that if you're looking for an RPG with different things you can do asides wander around and kill things look elsewhere, this is basically a very well done flash  game that just does wandering, buy/trade/talk, kill and made me put it down now and then, but I always picked it back up for the great music, boss fights, and combat.

												Even if you've played the flash version and have mastered it, it's still worth it getting the game because there's plenty more to it. The game is simple. It takes on classic turn-based battles inspired by RPGs. They've pretty much nailed it. The artwork is great, the music is fantastic, the gameplay can get repetitive at times (But what can you expect from turn-based games, right?) The game is fun, and it's worth playing as the story is, surprisingly better than I've expected when I've first played this game on kong. The references and humor in this game balance out the overall seriousness that an RPG usually gets. The puzzles, not the best. Some can be too easy, and some can be just plain annoying. However, with all the new additions, the game didn't keep old. It's worth the money if you've played the game or not.			"

												An old-school turn based RPG with a shiny modern coat of paint, that sums up Epic Battle Fantasy 4, but also explains very little.  Helpful, aren't I?  Um, anyway.  It's actually a really good time for fans of this sort of game, with game creation software in the hands of anyone who wants it, we have a lot of SNES style RPG games to choose from.  EBF4 really rises above the herd in many ways.The graphics are pleasing and detailed, which is especially nice since the game has such a wide variety of gear.There is a good variety of elemental damage and resistance in skills and gear, so that what you  wear can really change the outcome of a battle.  Along with that is the fact that you can always flee from battle and start it over, so you never have to find yourself in the awkward situation of being slaughtered by ice monsters because you wore your fancy fire armor that day.The humor in EBF4 is self-aware and somewhat silly, without being over-the-top hey hey look at me arrow-knee pie-face lulz.  Well, not too much anyway.I heartily suggest this game to anyone who likes fantasy, or epic battles, or the numeral four.			"

												This game is great. I first played this game when it was still in development on Kongregate, having a Kong Plus membership which allowed me to play unreleased, in beta games, one of which was EBF4. I beat it once before it's official release, twice afterwards when the official release was hosted on Kongregate, and now I am part way through my fourth playthrough here on Steam, and one thing I can say is that I still enjoy this game as much now as I did when I first booted up so long ago.Now, for some actual pros and cons.Pros:+Easy to learn battle system, allowing even new players to easily hop in and play.+Fun, humorous dialogue/situations, one of the best parts of this entire game.+An awesome soundtrack, with each theme fitting the environment it plays in very well.+Well designed environments, that do actually feel like they should.Cons:-Not really a con, but if you do not properly equip your team, you are going to have a bad time. For example, not using fire-type weapons on Mr. Murderous Plant.-Some of the puzzles can be confusing, and irritating to solve.-Monoliths.-Expanding on the above point, that one battle where you cast Syphon 5 times, and it only works once, and the damn thing keeps healing itself and using charged attacks.-Expanding even further, RNG.Maybe not exactly a complete review, but it is 3:15 AM as of the time of me writing this, so excuse me for being half asleep.

												This is one of those game I would typically NOT buy. Just look at childish graphics and that low-res jRPG style - not worth €11 in my book. I said 'typically NOT buy' though...I had this game in a bundle and gave it a try thinking I'd remove it within 5 minutes. But 5 minutes of playing became 10, 10 minutes became half an hour and by now I've already played 4 hours. Why..? Aside from the first negitive impressions, this game is FUN and addicting. Not to mention that the story is fun and well written.But is it worth the €11 Steam charges? I don't think it is. If you can get it with a 50% discount, grab it! If you can get it in a bundle, grab it as well! If you're a huge jRPG fan, then don't wait for the discount and just grab it now!			"

												i've been a fan of the EBF series since the very first, and this game, differs from the natural trend of ""the sequals are never as good as the first"" these games just get better and better. i absolutely love EBF4, the introduction of the new character, Anna, and all the witty comments and banter between the characters (especialy lance and Matt) is an absolute delight. i played the free version of the game, which in no way compares to the exclusive content on the payed version. Battle mountain poses a challenge at any level, makeing the player use elemental weaknesses and strengths to their advantage without even knowing what they will have to use. the art style is quirky (in a word) but still really good, the particle effects of the skills are something else completely, in a good way of course.all in all. i love this game (not to mention the creator and the artist) i'd reccomend it to anyone wanting to have some nostalgia in the turnbased combat system, as well as all the references to boot in the game. 10/10 complete must buy, deffinately worth the moneys.

If you like turn-based battle systems where smart play is rewarded (ie, check the bestiary, choose the right equipment for a given battle, build your characters so each can cover a few different attack types), I can easily recommend this game. The combats are things you initiate, but the monsters are varied enough that equipment selection isn't as simple as ""take ice weapons in fire place."" A further point in its favor is that you don't have to waste any time with extended tutorial nonsense- straight to the gameplay with all the systems available pronto!

												Hi Everyone,I have been buing this game in a gamebundle of somesort, I'm about 18 hours ingame, have never played or heared of EBF1-3 and my first thought was: WHAT THE HELL?? What is this 3rd rate Flash game doing on Steam? I'm an achievementhunter (beginner) so I scrolled through the achievements. I saw an achievement about boobs. I was like: ""Wait what? They got bewbs in this? Ok. You got my small brain's attention now."" So I fired up the game and... what to say. I never saw the bewbies, BUT: I was rewarded with an easy yet intriguing old school battlesystem-RPG. The battle system reminds me of one of those RPG makler games, but the graphics are cute, the humor is excellent and the gameplay is fun. This game is for you if:-You like Old Scool RPGs-You like good humor on a family friendly basis... well most of it ;D-You like to bounce around boobies...-You like nyan cat-You like cute stuffs-You like to hunt desperately for pron where none is to be found because of a boobieachievement.-You played the pervious titles.-You play the Game on Kongeate/Newgrounds but despise the Ads.-You like a nice soundtrack.-You wanna see an actual GOOD flash-game selling on stem (yes this is flash, deal with it)-You can like achievementhunting.Things you might dislike even if one or more of the above points are positive for you:- Full screen mode only supports a few resolutions, game kinda stays in 4:3, you get a colored border which is much like black bars if you use 16:9 resolution.- 2D graphics- Artstyle might seem a little childish to youBY ALL MEANS: THIS IS A CHILDISH GAME WITH CHILDISH HUMOR, IF YOU LIKE THAT, BUY THE GAME! IT IS GREAT IN WHAT IT DOES!I like it. :D			"

												The Epic Battle Fantasy Series have had a touch of brilliance to them and have come a long way from their first installment in 2009.I thought the third one was brilliant and would be very hard to top, but looking at the fouth and playing it through I admit, I'm amazed at how far the game has come. The story was brilliant and had more key elements than the third. The music was as brilliant as before, if not better and as a bonus the audio files come included with the game.The characters still had their uniqueness and the battles were what I had expected of this game.Overall, I really liked the part about the cats.

												EBF4 is a very cute RPG. Though it is just a little flash game, but the entire performance presented, in my opinion, has excelled many state-of-the-art RPGs of the same genre obviously. Lots of humorous conversation, elaborately designed combat system and funny character setting make it so different and outstanding. And most importantly, it catches the essence of what each RPG should has, that is, the capability to keep player involved for hours without feeling any bored. It no doubt does its job very well in this aspect. I think the developer is not only just to make a product for money, but to create a vivid dreamworld for the lover of traditional RPG and themselves.EBF4 is free-to-play on Kongregate website. If you don't have it on Steam, you can find it and its 3 predecessors there.			"

												Epic Battle Fantasy has always been one of my favorite parody series, which is itself one of my favorite genres. But unlike your average ""take that, Final Fantasy!"" mimicry affair, EBF stands on its own in every regard:Colorful art design, imaginative enemies, and I can't think of an adjective for the writing that quite encapsulates the unique blend of self-depriciative humor. The protagonists have a ""band of idiots"" shtick that in any other parody would just come off as mean, but EBF manages to convey a genuine sense of chemistry, that these idiots have been working with and through each others' eccentricities. The humor really comes alive when EBF satirizes not just the genre but also its players, with Anna playing straight man to a trio of 4th-wall-breaking powergamers.It wouldn't be a Japanese-style RPG without a story, and where the first three EBF games went for the ""here is a villain go fight him"" excuse to skip to the action, the fourth instalment has tried its hand at some actual worldbuilding this time, though at the cost of assuming players are familiar with the events of the third game. Returning party members Matt, Natz, and Lance are quickly discovering that the various save-the-world plots aren't as standalone and isolated as they assumed, and larger forces have been resetting their little pawns whie they were busy level grinding the Pickpocket skill.As for gameplay, EBF is quickly recognizable to anyone who has ever touched a Square Enix RPG, and at the same time found its own way to keep the turn-based combat fresh. Not content with just elemental rock-paper-scisors, EBF ensures stats buffs and status effects/ailments are incredibly critical during the late game, but thankfully the player is slowly eased into it all. There's a great deal of customization, especially if you want to eek out every precious damage point from your foes, but if you feel that you're stopping too often to fiddle with menus the game leaves open the possibility of overleveling yourself (to a point). If you know what you're doing the game will be happy to throw you enough curveballs to keep yourself from feeling overpowered but never tries to make you entirely helpless either.The only real thing to watch out for is possible slowdown. Might wanna check how your computer handles Flash, since that's what this game was originally built in, and large numbers of vector images, since that's what the original Flash engine rendered in. My other main complaint is that late-game bosses can be a bit of a slog if you aren't an absolute min-maxer, but in a way that's sort of the point.Overall, EBF4 is a happy, charming little affair from start to finish. Matt Roszak has stated that he made the series so he can see a game with everything he likes in it, and the level of love put into the product from start to finish really shows through. If you like swords, sorcery, slimes, and squishing the latter with the former, I recommend giving Epic Battle Fantasy a look; chances are there will be a lot you will like as well.			"

There's also auto-mapping, tool tips for status effects, and tons of achievements to earn. Oh, and lots and lots of silly humor.			"

												Back in the days of Newground-gaming, the Epic Battle Fantasy series brought much joy to my young, naïve heart. And thus, when I saw thew fourth-installment here on Steam-Sale, I just had to buy it. As soon as I entered the game I felt the memories of the previous EBF game rising up in me, and after I entered the first battle, all the memories of the first and second came rushing through my head as well.The bad jokes are so bad, they are good again; The references to other games; Matt's endless stomach; Natalie's breasts; NoLeg, the cat with NoLeg (...and no arm for that matter); Natalie's breasts; Lance's Nazi-ing; Tons and tons of equipment as powerful as they are ridiculous; Out of the box thinking; Natalie's breasts; And many, many more eye-candy, for the nostalgic Newgrounds-veterans and rookies both!12/10 Kyun!

Best indy rpg I've played, and definitly one of the best jrpgs I've tried(up there with Golden Sun and Dragonquest)It has remarkably detailed combat, and usign weaknesses and resistances is about the only way to take down some of the tougher foes.It also has a lot of hidden items ^w^ And many easter eggs.It also uses an unusual system for encoutners, with most battles only happening if you target the foe and start it yourself, with most batles having preset compositions(a nice change from the usual random encoutners of jrpgs).

												This series has long been a staple of flash gaming, and with good reason. It's a totally solid JRPG-style game. It's easy and intuitive to play, well-written, and a great way to waste five minutes or five hours. It plays equally well in short bursts as it does long sessions.About the only criticisms that can be made are that the game can be a bit anime-fanboy-crude, with emphasis on fan service with breasts and scantily-clad females, but the actual characterizations of the female characters are well-done, so if you can look past the lewdness, it's really not bad in that regard. The other thing is some battles can get a bit long and repetitive. Most of the time, combat can be over quickly if you're paying attention to your elemental damage, but then sometimes you'll be up against an enemy that has a ton of health, and while the enemy doesn't pose a huge threat to you, it takes a long time to kill. Still, a few battles turning into a bit of a slog isn't that big an issue, either.Overall, it's funny and well-written and the gameplay is just an absolute charm. There are a lot of elements between the equips and elements and consumables and upgrading of items, but none of these elements are overly complex to the point where thye become annoying. It's easy to find almost any piece of information you want, and the gane doesn't penalize you too heavily for forgetting to attend to any of the ongoing tasks.A solid installment in a solid series, heartily recommended to anyone who enjoys RPGs, anime style, humor, or casual gaming experiences. Not that the game is overly casual, but it's so easy to learn, it's a great gateway into RPGs for the casual gamer.			"

												Anyone who was already a fan of this series who might feel weird about spending money on what was an internet flash game might want to give it a second thought. This game boasts 25 hours of gameplay which is around twice as long as most big budget games' campaigns and it had new game plus as well. The same humor that this series is known for is fully intact and the art done for the cutscenes is simple but definitely depicts the quirky nature of the characters and situations. For the harcore RPG players this game starts with higher difficulty modes to ensure that you are challenged right off the bat. To anyone who is a fan of the series I say you should definitely pick this up to show your support for the guy who has been doing these games for years now and to those who aren't familiar with this series I suggest you go find the other games online before you make a real judgement about this game. You won't be dissappointed :)			"

												I absolutely enjoy this game. I honestly find it to be one of my favorite Turn-based rpgs out there.It has alot of heart, the gameplay is really fun, and the difficulty is there. Not to mention the surprising amount of depth to the combat as you progress further into the game. The Steam and Kongregate Premium versions have a pretty nifty sum of extras for the more devoted fans of the game to unlock as well. Plus, you get the soundtrack as an added bonus if you buy it here. Which really helps add to the value of the game.If you are like me, then you will get a good 20+ hours out of this game, and that was before I got the premium edition. And with the new NG+ feature, New Battle Area, Survival and Boss Rush modes, and the new equipment and Skills to check out, there is no doubt in my mind that it will leech even more time from me.

												The Epic Battle Fantasy series started out as just a bunch of flash game you could play on Newgrounds and Kongregate back in the day (and you still can). For the longest time, they had stayed in the top rated flash games for both of those sites, and for good reason. This series is pretty obviously inspired by them, and if you're a fan of turn based strategic combat in RPGs similar to old school Final Fantasy, you'll love this game.If you're on the fence on whether or not you want to buy this, you can simply go on Kongregate or Newgrounds right now and play the free version. Now you may be wondering, ""If I can play this game for free, why should I buy the Steam version?"" Well other than supporting a series made by a developer who does both the coding and the artwork, with a quality soundtrack by Phyrrna (aka HalcyonicFalconX) that comes for free upon purchasing it, the Steam version comes with additional content, including a new area with tougher challenges that yields extra equipment to help you out on your main journey, not to mention being able to keep your save files on the Steam cloud. I also recommend Epic Battle Fantasy 3, which is now on Steam, and is completely free.Now this game does have some intermittent performance issues when it comes to frame rate, but you can toggle the quality to deal with it, and other than that, I believe this is well worth the money. I usually wait for games to be on sale, but I bought this game as soon as it was available on Steam, and I don't regret it one bit.			"

												I've been playing this game since it came out on Armor Games and Kongregate. EBF4 is the latest entry in the Epic Battle Fantasy Franchise, an RPG series inspired by franchises like Final Fantasy and Pokémon. It has an unique and recognisable artstyle and a quirky sense of humor. There is some story to be enjoyed here, but unlike some other RPGs, you will be playing this for the gameplay. You will be surprised by the lenght and depth of this game. One thing to note though, is that this is in fact a flash game, which means the game does require a mid-grade computer despite the games' simplicity and the steam overlay/keeping multiple tabs open doesn't work as well as usual. Even so, grabbing it for either a sale or the full price is a steal in my opinion. Pros:-Quirky cast with the same tone of humor-Decent Story-Unique and colorful artstyle-Good Game Lenght-No random encounters-The ability to save anywhere outside of battle-Surprisingly deep and fun gameplay, while still being very a accessible RPG-A small party of well balanced characters-Tons of videogame and other references-Decent game config options-A good amount of saves and a autosave feature-4 difficulties to choose from, providing a good challenge for everyone-Side quests and Challenging extra content to get even more stuff and replayability-Good character progression/equipment system (you should find this out for yourself, discovering what I'm talking about    here is part of the fun!)Cons:-Only on pc (although there are ways to get around this, including the web version)-Somewhat low frame cap (although it really doesn't matter for an RPG like this. Trust me, you won't even be bothered by this unless the game lags for you.)-No Shift + Tab Steam Overlay or F12 Steam Screenshots-Responds somewhat slowly when switching tabsOther things to note:-Good pieces of music, although there isn't that much music in comparison to the size of the game, which means it might get a bit repetitive at times when you've played the game this much.-There is some puzzle solving involved, although I personally think the puzzles add to the game rather than taking away from it. These won't change according to difficulty, but you don't need to be Einstein for this stuff.-The humor can get a bit weird sometimes (boobjokes, for example), which you will either love or hate about this game.-Because of the relatively large game size, you might lose interest before finishing everything. The percentage of people who finished the main story actually isn't that high. Whether this is good or bad depends mostly on the type of gamer you are.-Completing the game 100% requires a lot of time and mastery of the game. A lot. This might be annoying to some, but does provide a good challenge.I recommend this game to anyone who is open to games with semi-serious story. You don't need to be a hardcore RPG fan to enjoy this game at all, and you get a lot of bang for your buck. It happens pretty often that the ones playing these games become dedicated fans of the series. Epic Battle Fantasy 5 is currently in development and is shaping up to become even better. Epic Battle Fantasy 3 is also available for free on Steam if you want to get a good taste of the series first. Be sure to check those out if you're interested.I can't praise this game enough for what it is. Just give it a go and see if it floats your boat.			"

												Epic Battle Fantasy 4 has the best turn-based combat system I have ever played. That, by itself, is enough to warrant playing it. That it contains copious secrets, varied dungeons, good music and a great sense of humor is a bonus.There's a wide variety of skills and items for every party member, including skills you can only give one person and permanent percentage stat boosts to help ""customize"" your team. Your equipment and skill selection have a profound impact in battle, but they're all balanced against each other. Every one is useful in different situations, so you'll still be using some stuff from the beginning of the game by the end. Status effects are powerful and varied, and vital to many fights. The ""swap in the fourth party member at any time"" mechanic is odd at first but actually comes off really well. And if you crank up the difficulty to Epic, the game provides a mighty challenge indeed--even by the end of the first level.As for whether you should play the free version or the paid one? Well, aside from rewarding creativity, the bonus area is everything you could hope for. You unlock it piece by piece as you progress, and it offers lots of brutal fights and unique items and skills (including rematches against alternate versions of each boss, some entirely new bosses and waves of tough enemies). But best of all, it scales to your level so you can tackle each part whenever you want to and cannot beat it by grinding.Either way, free version or paid: If you've ever had fun playing any RPG at any point in your life, you should play this game.

												Epic battle fantasy 4 is a slightly challenging rpg. It is a remake of a flash game that was later greenlit. This game makes you think more than most current and past gen rpgs. Buffs and debuffs matter a lot in this series. More rpgs should expect you to play smart, or reward you as much as EBF4. "

												Like JRPGs? Anime? Honest to goodness humor? Well good for you, a game with all of that! Not too frequently do you see such a good game. The music is great and diverse, and really conveys the area. The art is cute, but not so much that you feel sorry for the enemies you kill by the millions. The humor is great, and the gameplay? AWESOME. Getting through with brute force is impossible, but you can't be weak and expect a strategy with no force backing it up to work. The game is hard but very possible, even on Epic. Extra versions of the bosses are insanely hard but give great rewards. Even with the free version there, this game is worth more than the big, expensive games you see all so often in stores. 11 out of 10.			"

Here's what I have to say. This game in my opinion is too good to be free and clearly deserves some money for the developler's hard work. If you are skeptical about the game then you can play it on the web and then decide if you want to support the developer. The steam version will include everything that's described on the store page with a few other notes exclusive to the steam version from the developer in the steam forums. Why are you still reading this? Just stop reading and buy it now! Don't forget to check out his other games on the internet while you're at it.			"

												Rather a silly (fun!) pastiche of JRPGs, this addictive little game has enough basic puzzles and humor to make it your go-to quick fix for a little straightforward play time. The learning curve (at least on Normal) is pretty low, with few moments of true fear for your party, but getting at least one member with Revive is not a bad idea. Just pay attention to skill and item leveling (in my case, focusing on a few general purpose spells at least so far to ensure always doing at least *some* damage). I fully expect the higher levels to be much trickier, but I'm saving those for a later playthrough.Especially if it is on sale, this is most certainly worth getting if you at all like the genre!			"

												I loved this game! Epic Battle Fantasy 4 (or ebf4) is a Strategy RPG similar to Final Fantasy 6 and below. There are Four main characters, Matt the theiving, high attack high defense tank, Natalie, the good natured mage, Lance, the phsycotic, perverted gun freak, and Anna, the tree hugging goody two shoes with a bow. the game starts off with you in the overworld, and when you enter a hostile area, you'll notice the enemy sprites. Yes, the creator got rid of random battles. Thank Christ. when you enter battle, you control three of the four hero's attacks and strategies along with equips. for strategies there is ""benching"" a character for another, there is switching turns for a character, surrender, and block for the most part. equips follow the rules of, you can change wepons, outfits, flair mid battle, but it costs you a turn, same with consumables. attacks are the highlights of the game. each character can learn their own special set of ""skills"" for them only, but you ccan find ""specials"" out in the feild usually after boss fights or quests. theses ""specials"" can be used by any character provided they meet the parameters. overall, the game is fun, some very small tech bugs, good design and a wacky story. 8.5/10			"

												Epic Battle Fantasy as a series is, in my opinion, the one of (if not) the best indie RPGs that I've played in... quite possibly ever.The game is well done and there are countless different ways to build your characters early on, though this drops off a bit due to being able to get everything later (bar a few spells/abilities that are 1-person only). The combat system, while basic, works great with very little errors outside ones made by the player.The maps are also well designed and often have more secrets in them than meets the eye, in many cases either requiring a return trip or waiting for something to flash upon the screen (though block puzzles, in my eyes, are unforgivable!).The 'many ways to build a character' is even more evident because of the inclusion of the 4th character (fitting that you get the 4th member in the 4th game), meaning that someone is back in the sidelines ready for action should you need to swap one of your (three) party members out.Cleverness and hilarity is also abundant in EBF with countless (sometimes censored due to copyright) references and/or memes.As I write the review, I have not actually gotten to any of the 'Premium' (Read: Pay for) part of the game, as I'm doing an Epic difficulty playthrough and have not started the Battle Mountain or Survival battles.If you're looking to try the game, go to some place like Kongregate and play it there to see if it's to your liking.If you're looking to get the game (and support the amazing developer), buy it.Don't anger the cats by the way; they tend to bring about the apocalypse in the form of elder gods when you do so.November 2015 Edit: Still amazing, though I forgot to mention (long ago in the original review) that this takes an obscene amount of comp usage for no real reason, so don't be surprised with large amounts of slowdown!

												Easily one of the best indie games of recent years. If not one of the best Turn-based RPGs of all time. Speaking as someone who has never played a traditional turn-based RPG prior to finding this game on Kongregate years ago (Unless Mario RPG counts, which i don't think it does.) I can therefore say that this game is a PERFECT gateway RPG. Just enough depth in it's combat system to make vetrans feel welcome, while not alienating newcomers like alot of other RPGS do (Xenoblade and Final Fantasy X come to mind)The gameplay (once it gets rolling) consists of 3 party members (with 1 in backup). Anna is the support class with her basic attacks not doing all to much damage but having alot of skills to debuff enemies or inflict them with bad statuses.Matt is the physical attacker, with alot of non-elemental high power skills.Natillie is the Magic user / Healer with most of her power revolving around her ability to deal elemental damage or heal/revive part memebers.Lance is the glass canon with not much defence or HP, but with a ton of enemy devestating moves.When you complete battles, you gain EXP and money (In this case, Choclate Coins) like other RPGs. You also gain AP which can be used to level up or learn new Skills or SpecialsThe difference between Skills and Specials is that Skills are character specific, whereas Specials consist of a pool that multiple characters can learn from. Each special can only be learnt by one party member. This makes for some intresting strategic opertunities as alot of arts are here. This game also has Limit Breaks, which to be honest, are not that much different than in Final Fantasy 7. But for those of you unfamilliar, Limit Breaks are powerful attacks that can only be used once a character has taken enough damage. What's different here, however, is that limit breaks can be saved for later use as the attack command is still there, where as to do so in Final Fantasy 7, you would need to keep using Magic instead of attacking.The equipment system in this game is in my opinion the best type of equipment system in any RPG. No 2 pieces of equipment are exactly the same, nor are there any that are inherently better than other pieces. They all have their own use with their own stats and resistances. I cannot think of any other RPG where i was never like ""Oh, this sword does more damage than that sword with no downsides. Better sell my old sword for this upgraded one""The music is annother shining point of this game. Phyrnna did an amazing job. Explaining it can't do it justice, so i suggest you listen to it for yourself.Overall, 10/10. If you are looking for annother good RPG that isn't too confusing to get into, look no furher than Epic Battle Fantasy 4.			"

												Great turn-based RPG. Long-term strategy in choosing who gets which abilities, thus focusing each character around certain roles, and shorter-term stuff in deciding when you need to buff and debuff in-battle. And unless you're playing on Easy, you DO need to buff. (Which means the game has difficulty pretty much just right, especially as you can choose between Easy, Normal, Hard, and Epic.)The dialogue is also very entertaining, the art style is nice, and if the enemy design isn't good there'll be witty comments on how unoriginal it is.tl;dr: Good difficulty, good gameplay, good music, good graphics, good dialogue. Get.			"

												I played this game a while back for free on kongregate.   When I saw it on steam I bought it without even checking for new features (turns out is has them, and lots of them!) because I wanted to give the creator money for all the time i've spent enjoying what he made.   The humor is amazing and self aware, it doesn't go to far into camp.   Seriously, if you love old rpg's and are willing to try one with a modern twist, you should be picking this up right now.			"

												This installment of the EBF series is by far the best. The humor was fantastic and definitely angled in a way most gamers would understand, The story is fun and imaginative, The combat is fun and has a fair amount of challenge to it, The treasures and secrets are fun to hunt for, The soundtrack is great and fun to listen to, And the sprites for both players and enemies are very well put together. Its absolutely worth every penny.			"

												A witty game, hearkening back to the older RPG's of yesteryear, where the battle system was refined, and the enemies made sense for the setting (no, not really, but just roll with it).  In this game, you command a three of four warriors at a time, and fight for the safety of the world.Uses a turn based combat system, where speed is not a factor.  Your team goes, then their team, then yours, etc...The summon system works well as any character can use it, but you still have to watch the summon's resource bar.A large array of weapons, armors, gear, skills, and spells for you to arm yourself against the monsterous waves of enemies that block your path.  Will you stand tall and face the challenge? Will you fight in this Epic Battle Fantasy?			"

												If you love old school Japanese RPGs I strongly recommend that you play this game. If the price tag isn't wroth it you can find the free to play version of the game on Newgrounds and Kongregate. The steam version to my knowledge has a few extra features like more equipment and the new optional area. All in all it's an okay game to at least play through once if you're not into the idea of paying for extra features then I suggest you play the free to play version.^--^(0.0) ~Marf!~/__\			"

												Excellent independent game! If you're a fan of Final Fantasy, Golden Sun or any other RPG along those lines, you'll find plenty of things to like here.Its a fairly simple system in terms of skills and weapons. Find the right materials and you can forge your equipment to be better. Higher level equipment requires rarer items. After winning a battle you get ability points which you can spend towards spells and skills. Higher levels need more ability points and so on. This is in addition to a standard leveling system (get exp and level up). The skill and equipment sets feel very well thought out. No one skill or item is designated as ""crap"" each feels like its part of one option for strategy, and I can say you will probably use every piece of equipment at one point or another. Another cool touch is that each item shows up on the characters both in battle and outside. It's a nice little touch.The story is also simple to follow, but its almost like a parody of the traditional RPG plot. It doesn't take itself seriously at many points, yet still keeps you somewhat invested in fighting the big bad guy at the end. There are references galore to other RPG's and internet stuff among other things, and its just a straight up fun ride.Finally, the music kicks♥♥♥♥♥ That's all I have to say about that.And this was made by one guy who made flash games in the past.  While the price might be a little off putting to some, buy this to help support the guy. Plus he threw in some extra content exclusive to Steam, so its a pretty good deal.			"

												This game has become one of my guilty pleasures. Although it's a port of a Freemium Flash game, it runs smoothly and is thankfully devoid of a Cash Shop. The graphics are whimsically cute, and the gameplay can be considered JRPG-lite for Westerners...as it has everything you'd expect in a JRPG but without the insane grind (you can make it through the entire game within 12-14 hours as opposed to hundreds of hours in a typical JRPG). The humor and use of standard JRPG tropes is comical to where you can't help but smile and giggle incessently while playing (down to the non-apologetic blatant remix of the victory theme from FFVII).  It may not be a hard-core JRPG, but it is a delightfully fun tip of the hat to classic JRPGs. It's definitely worth the price of admission.			"

												Epic Battle Fantasy 4 is an incredibly fun adventure roughly based off of games such as the early Final Fantasy games. As its title implies, there are also three entries before it... there are also two spin-offs. EBF4 has a flash version that's free to play, but you will have to pay for the Battle Mountain zone regardless, and the flash version tends to be rather laggy at times. Unfortunately, due to the earlier three games containing things that would bring its developer, Matt Roszak, into legal trouble (most notably the first game having a few pokemon for summons, and the final boss of the first game being Goku), they will not be appearing on Steam.PlotIn between the events of the third game and this one, the heroes, Matt, Natalie (Natz for short), and Lance, turn to a life of crime, since they lack the funds to buy food. They think that this is justified due to them saving the world before, although this is a rather flimsy excuse. They finally go too far when they steal an important jewel from Greenwood Village, causing her to seek them and finally deliver justice to them... only to learn that they did not steal the jewel. Anna must team up with the heroes, and track down the thief before he/she/it/they can steal the other two jewels and summon forth Godcat, who will destroy the world....It's rather bare-bones, and can rather easily be ignored in the favor of picking fights with wild animals. Aside from a few rather minor references to the third game, you can easily jump into the game's plot without playing any other games in the EBF series. Interestingly enough, the entire series runs on the plot structure of ""Stop this thing by beating it to a pulp,"" although this game diverges itself from this plot a little more.GameplayGameplay is split up into two areas: The overworld and combat.In the overworld, you can walk around, accepting quests to get items for complete strangers with the promise of some stuff in return, harrasing the wildlife, stealing items from treasure boxes, and buying items to prepare for combat. When one wishes to enter the combat phase of gameplay, one simply clicks on an enemy on the map. If one goes to the options tab, one can switch between using the keyboard and the mouse to travel on the map.In combat, you have a myriad of standard JRPG skills, including several that are based off of elements. As one of the game's tips says, attack enemies until they die. If red numbers appear, that means the element of that attack is pretacualy effective against that foe. If grey numbers appear, that means the foe is either immune or resists the attack. One can also use the Scanbot summon to reveal the weaknesses of these enemies, revealing their weaknesses and stat totals for all enemies of that type. Battles may be split into multiple waves, too. In one of the lower points of the game, your party's turns are not refreshed at the start of each wave, which can result in up to five enemies getting free attacks if you use your last action to kill an enemy. This is especially bothersome with the final boss, who will ""kill"" itself after a few turns on the waves where it's invulnerable, giving its next phase free, powerful attacks.After winning a battle, one is rewarded with Gold, EXP, and AP, all used outside of combat. Gold is used to buy new equipment, items to upgrade your equipment with, things that hurt enemies, and items to heal your party members. EXP will make your characters stronger. AP can be spent under the ""Skills"" screen to unlock new skills, or upgrade ones you've already learned. Any skills under the ""special"" tab can only be learned by a single character and have to be forgotten if you wish to teach them to another character, adding a layer of strategy as to who gets what skill.DifficultyEBF4 is divided into four difficulties. In order from easiest to hardest, they are: Easy, Normal, Hard, and Epic. The difficulty can be changed on the fly, so unless one is having trouble on Easy, the difficulty can be lowered with ease. By default, the game is set on Normal. If one were to select Hard or Epic, enemies will also recieve bonuses that aren't directly stated, such as some enemies that absorb fire damage entering battle with a status that deals fire damage every turn, or fire-weak enemies starting with a status that lets them resist fire. Bosses that are defeated on Epic difficulty also give medals, which directly corrolate to Steam Achievements.In short, do I recommend this game? Yes. I am aware this type of game isn't for everyone, especially considering the rather cluttered interface, but it's a damn fine one. Also, to those who ask where the other party members are at the start of the game, you'll find them as you progress through Ashwood Forest, before finally finding Lance after defeating the Mighty Oak and entering the Crystal Caverns. Each party member also has a different role, which should be relatively obvious looking at their stats and personal skills they can learn. "

												I'm always a fan of Final Fantasy style games, the ones where you take turns doing damage to your enemies, and them to you. What I especially like about the Epic Battle Fantasy games however, is the differences it has that make it stand out as a game. For instance, at the highest levels, your weapons that you've had since the beginning are still options to use for battle, instead of other games where your starter weapon was probably sold at the first shop for some extra cash. For the final bosses as well, unlike the FF games, where simple grinding could make anything easy, this game relies on intelligent strategy to beat a boss. You can't simply use brute force to take down an enemy here, it requires actual thinking. You have to consider:-What weapons do I use?-What's their weakness?-What armour do I wear to compensate for their skills and mine?-What skills do I use, and which special abilities (Only one person gets it, but you choose) gets which skills. All of this, a decent storyline, great music, good characters with unique personalities, and a vast world are all reasons why Epic Battle Fantasy 4 should be considered a great buy.			"

												I loved this game! Epic Battle Fantasy 4 (or ebf4) is a Strategy RPG similar to Final Fantasy 6 and below. There are Four main characters, Matt the theiving, high attack high defense tank, Natalie, the good natured mage, Lance, the phsycotic, perverted gun freak, and Anna, the tree hugging goody two shoes with a bow. the game starts off with you in the overworld, and when you enter a hostile area, you'll notice the enemy sprites. Yes, the creator got rid of random battles. Thank Christ. when you enter battle, you control three of the four hero's attacks and strategies along with equips. for strategies there is ""benching"" a character for another, there is switching turns for a character, surrender, and block for the most part. equips follow the rules of, you can change wepons, outfits, flair mid battle, but it costs you a turn, same with consumables. attacks are the highlights of the game. each character can learn their own special set of ""skills"" for them only, but you ccan find ""specials"" out in the feild usually after boss fights or quests. theses ""specials"" can be used by any character provided they meet the parameters. overall, the game is fun, some very small tech bugs, good design and a wacky story. 8.5/10			"

												Epic Battle Fantasy as a series is, in my opinion, the one of (if not) the best indie RPGs that I've played in... quite possibly ever.The game is well done and there are countless different ways to build your characters early on, though this drops off a bit due to being able to get everything later (bar a few spells/abilities that are 1-person only). The combat system, while basic, works great with very little errors outside ones made by the player.The maps are also well designed and often have more secrets in them than meets the eye, in many cases either requiring a return trip or waiting for something to flash upon the screen (though block puzzles, in my eyes, are unforgivable!).The 'many ways to build a character' is even more evident because of the inclusion of the 4th character (fitting that you get the 4th member in the 4th game), meaning that someone is back in the sidelines ready for action should you need to swap one of your (three) party members out.Cleverness and hilarity is also abundant in EBF with countless (sometimes censored due to copyright) references and/or memes.As I write the review, I have not actually gotten to any of the 'Premium' (Read: Pay for) part of the game, as I'm doing an Epic difficulty playthrough and have not started the Battle Mountain or Survival battles.If you're looking to try the game, go to some place like Kongregate and play it there to see if it's to your liking.If you're looking to get the game (and support the amazing developer), buy it.Don't anger the cats by the way; they tend to bring about the apocalypse in the form of elder gods when you do so.November 2015 Edit: Still amazing, though I forgot to mention (long ago in the original review) that this takes an obscene amount of comp usage for no real reason, so don't be surprised with large amounts of slowdown!

												Easily one of the best indie games of recent years. If not one of the best Turn-based RPGs of all time. Speaking as someone who has never played a traditional turn-based RPG prior to finding this game on Kongregate years ago (Unless Mario RPG counts, which i don't think it does.) I can therefore say that this game is a PERFECT gateway RPG. Just enough depth in it's combat system to make vetrans feel welcome, while not alienating newcomers like alot of other RPGS do (Xenoblade and Final Fantasy X come to mind)The gameplay (once it gets rolling) consists of 3 party members (with 1 in backup). Anna is the support class with her basic attacks not doing all to much damage but having alot of skills to debuff enemies or inflict them with bad statuses.Matt is the physical attacker, with alot of non-elemental high power skills.Natillie is the Magic user / Healer with most of her power revolving around her ability to deal elemental damage or heal/revive part memebers.Lance is the glass canon with not much defence or HP, but with a ton of enemy devestating moves.When you complete battles, you gain EXP and money (In this case, Choclate Coins) like other RPGs. You also gain AP which can be used to level up or learn new Skills or SpecialsThe difference between Skills and Specials is that Skills are character specific, whereas Specials consist of a pool that multiple characters can learn from. Each special can only be learnt by one party member. This makes for some intresting strategic opertunities as alot of arts are here. This game also has Limit Breaks, which to be honest, are not that much different than in Final Fantasy 7. But for those of you unfamilliar, Limit Breaks are powerful attacks that can only be used once a character has taken enough damage. What's different here, however, is that limit breaks can be saved for later use as the attack command is still there, where as to do so in Final Fantasy 7, you would need to keep using Magic instead of attacking.The equipment system in this game is in my opinion the best type of equipment system in any RPG. No 2 pieces of equipment are exactly the same, nor are there any that are inherently better than other pieces. They all have their own use with their own stats and resistances. I cannot think of any other RPG where i was never like ""Oh, this sword does more damage than that sword with no downsides. Better sell my old sword for this upgraded one""The music is annother shining point of this game. Phyrnna did an amazing job. Explaining it can't do it justice, so i suggest you listen to it for yourself.Overall, 10/10. If you are looking for annother good RPG that isn't too confusing to get into, look no furher than Epic Battle Fantasy 4.			"

												Just brought this on steam after spending many hours on Newgrounds playing it, if you like any sort of RPG you'll like this. it has several influences from classic games (most notably final fantasy) and plays on those conventions well. Definitely one i'd reccomend others to play.			"

												If you love old school Japanese RPGs I strongly recommend that you play this game. If the price tag isn't wroth it you can find the free to play version of the game on Newgrounds and Kongregate. The steam version to my knowledge has a few extra features like more equipment and the new optional area. All in all it's an okay game to at least play through once if you're not into the idea of paying for extra features then I suggest you play the free to play version.^--^(0.0) ~Marf!~/__\			"

Posted: April 7
												I bought this game from the Overwhelmingly Positive Humble Bundle for 1€.I can't believe i'm writing a review of this game on Steam after playing EBF2 on Newgrounds in 2009. Time flies.What is this game about? How the description on the store page says, this is a turn based rpg with cute graphics and stupid humor, how i like it. At first the gameplay seems simple but the game tells you from the first battle to scan every enemies because elemental weakness and resistances are the core of this game.The game gives you a lot of equipment because to succeed you need to change your gear before starting an encounter or between waves to not be overwhelmed by your opponents. This is a good layer of strategy alongside the usual buff your party and debuff your enemies.This brings another point i liked of this game, the forging. It's quite simple here, you need to have the materials acquired by slaying enemies or bought by stores to increase the atrritubutes of your gear and some also have passives like random chance to summon a belly flopping mammoth on an enemy each turn, auto cast buffs on your party or a damaging spell after attacking. So try equip and upgrade different piece of gear for some nice combos, don't focus on what looks the best!The plot is quite simple and funnily enough it serves just as a background for our ""heroes"" to adventure on the map and acquire gear while doing stupid stuff. That's the charm of this series, the party is a bunch of goofballs with barely working brains. As Anna said: ""I have no idea how they survived this long with no survival skills"". Quite a different tone from your usual RPG.Finally, the soundtrack, which is free by the way, is really good. It set up the pace perfectly with happy tunes while exploring the grass areas or fighting the early enemies, to dark tones in the toughest fights. The composer is really good and she made EBF3 music too, check that out!Now, after praising basically everything, i will nitpick a couple of complains. First of all, some fights will drag a lot, expecially on higher difficulties, where the stats of enemies are increased, and when i saw an encounter was composed of 7 waves i was already rolling my eyes after finishing another long wave or a boss fight. I don't think it's boring, but i tended to overthink my strategy and equip for each wave and probably my brain was melting.Second problem is that the game offers 4 characters, but unfortunatly it's best to focus on 3 and two slots are occupied by Matt (warrior) and Nat (Mage) for their highly specialized stats so the third slot is contested by Lance (Gunner) and Anna (Archer) that overlap a bit on their utility but many guides and myself went with Anna in the end since she is the newcomer and brings a bit more on the table than Lance (cough, evasion buff).To conclude my fanboy review, i say this game gave me more than 30 hours of enjoyment for just 1€, and i plan to play   new game+ on Epic difficulty, but i can say that i should have bought this earlier, even at full price (11€.... not a lot) because it's a bargain for someone that enjoyed in his youth Final Fantasy and other turn based rpgs in the PSX era. Just don't let the ""anime"" graphic, ""childish"" humor and flash coding influence your opinion on this game.If you aren't sure, you can play this for free on Kongregate or Newgrounds, the only thing you will miss is Battle Mountain, another end game with extra loot, but unrelated to the main quest, so you aren't missing any plot by not playing it. So you also have a demo, what more do you want?! :DNow, i'm waiting for EBF5, currently in development, and this time i will get it as soon as possible.TL. DR. game is good!			"

												Great fun->I usually skip over all types of round-bases-battle-RPGs but I'm glad I made an exception here. EBF4 is a tongue-in-cheek RPG with hilarious characters who dress as stereotypical pirates, rangers or red mages. On the over-world map you collect hidden goodies, explore branching ways and follow the farce of a storyline. If you choose to bump into an enemy the fighting starts, no tedious random encounters after any x steps. Also heroes slowly heal after battle for convenience and most creatures respawn.The battle system isn't boring but really fun with lots of different skills, weapons, equipment, usable items. Skills are unlocked and upgraded with skill points. Levels are gained by experience. Weapons and Armor are found or bought in shops and upgraded with items. There are also summons usable by anyone, limit breaks and ""specials"" which are skills you can assign to complement a characters skill set like a fire attack or a heal spell.You may try out the EBF game series on some websites for free to understand how the game works.

												I want to start by saying that I have over 400 games in my Steam library, with the dreaded curse of barely beating any. When I get hooked to the point I play through this game to the end, you know it's a damn good game. Thanks to Steam's Summer Sale, I was introduced to this game. It's simplistic in graphics but it's a very well done turn-based RPG. It's not a AAA title, nor does it pretend to be. I hope there's a sequel one day with many improvements and on a larger scale. The random humor thrown in is a plus too.			"

												crazy good game considering it was developed mostly by one guy. has everything that makes indie rpgs good including: rad music straight outta newgrounds clever references to games as old as ff1 and as new as minecraft really good animation and art everywhere gear upgrades from loot enemies are very well designed and its easy to tell their strengths and weaknesses just by looking at them grind/gear curve is perfect very easy to influence game difficultyit does have its problems though, mostly due to being ported from flash. moving the mouse anywhere on screen drops the FPS to 1 (known bug) and the game starts dropping a bunch of frames after playing for a couple of hours (only fix is restarting game). there's also no controller support which is sad but still not a gamebreaker.if you want a fun indie ""by weebs, for weebs"" rpg that doesn't require much commitment (and you've already played neptunia), support scottish developers and get this. it's a good deal at the base price and at 50% off you're robbing the poor guy.

												I've had nothing but a good time playing this game.It's a JRPG style turn based combat game, with an overworld map exploration aspect to it (secrets to be found, items that open up new areas and paths usually to treasure in old areas).There are no random encounters, and only optional enemies respawn; once you clear a 'path-blocking' encounter it remains cleared.  Turn-based combat with a focus on using skills/spells that the enemies are weak to, with a party-wide 'summon meter', lots of items and equipment to be had all with varying effects to them such as ""randomly summons a wooly mammoth to fall from the sky onto an enemy each round"", ""randomly blesses the character"", ""counters attacks with xxxxx skill"" things like that.The humor in the character/NPC dialogs is light hearted if a bit geared towards a younger crowd (not kids though).Fans of turn based RPGs should give this one a shot, it's very easy to play in short bursts when you feel that RPG itch, or you can get 30+ hours out of it like I have so far!

												A game that doesn't look great but is rated 98% on Steam, uh..? Okay, let's try the Flash version... Ah, the agony, you have to point and click to move the character around, they're moving on a grid and you get ugly icons everywhere you point at... My, my. The character designs aren't exactly good... Okay, since these are both one-man projects, I'll at least say that it looks much better than Undertale. It also beats it in terms of laughs and overall complexity.Really. It's absolutely hilarious, and also excrutiatingly overwhelming at the beginning of the game. Ah, those crafting materials...!After an hour I decided to buy the Steam version, and couldn't stop playing it ever since. This is nothing like a RPG Maker game, it seems to use its very own engine (which, amusingly, is quite slow even on a high-end PC... Thankfully it's still playable). This has a lot of advantages.It pays respects to its elders but never tries to be lazy about anything. My main complaint? It's a very difficult game... If you want to 100% it, you'll suffer. A lot. Be prepared to spend tens of hours on it. I'll just be happy with at least two thirds of the achievements. If you don't mind not getting everything, then... I get it's doable. But you'll still need to grind a lot, or use a money cheat to buy all of the items you need.And this was my 42nd Steam review, a milestone for any self-respecting geek. Not my finest hour, though!

												I know what you're thinking. ""This guy hasn't even started playing this game yet, why should I listen to his review?""Well, the truth is, I played the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this game's free version on Kongregate.  I also played the♥♥♥♥♥♥of EPF3.  And let me tell you, if there is any game on Kongregate that deserves to make it to the big time, its EPF4.Epic Battle Fantasy 4 once again stars the trio of heroic, yet dimwitted adventurers Matt, Natalie and Lance.  This time, however, they're joined by a new character, the ranger Anna, who is easily the smartest of the bunch.  Together, the four this time must travel across the land, searching for crystals and uncovering clues about a new feline menace.Epic Battle Fantasy has always prided itself on gut busting comedy and intense, over the top action, and this game is no exception.  There are hundreds of weapons, skills and summons to collect and use against literally hundreds of enemies, and the game is full of tongue in cheek moments such as Nat's oftentimes futile efforts to get Matt and Lance to care about the environment, or Anna trying to curb Matt's kleptomaniac tendencies.Also, is case you're wondering why you should buy this version, well, its because it grants you access to the Premium Pack.  This pack adds a ton of new content to the game, including new weapons, new armor, new summons, new enemies and bosses, and even an entirely new area.If you're a fan of turn based rpgs, of self-referential comedy, or just plain fun RPGs, then you owe it to yourself to try this out.  Check out the free version on Kongregate, and if you enjoy it, you should definitely considering going Premium by buying the Steam version.			"

												Epic Battle Fantast 4 is what most RPG's today lack. a focus on battle, skills, gear and just plain fun, exploring a vast land with as many side quests as you want without gunking up the main plot of the game. unlike other games where finishing side quests and gridning for level seams more a chore then anything EBF4 makes it all worth it by showing a clear advantage against lower level enemys as well as making the items from side quests worth the effort and back tracking some require. over all if your looking for a fun respin on clasic RPG's i highly recommend this game to anyone looking for some quick pick up and go fun			"

												Honestly this game is really good and was worth the ten bucks. I'm 17 hours in and still haven't beat it so there's definetely quite a bit of content here. The enemies all look different, yet are distinct to their element. The art all and all is very good, with limit breaks giving you these fun crazy destructive attacks. There is a bit of grinding and the combat is turn based, so if you don't like turn based combat this game isn't for you. The grind is pretty minimal and throughout the story are the fairly generic characters making funny remarks and conversation to keep you interested, but there isn't any award winning plot here, as the game doesn't take itself seriuosly, but that gives it creative freedom for some funny moments to keep it more fun than serious.                So overall this game is 8/10 which for 10 bucks is pretty good. It probably wont last more than 20 hours for most people though because I'm basically at the end, but overall I enjoyed it and I think it's pretty good. You can try the game out in the browser if you'd like to see if you enjoy it first, but the steam version has WAY more content and is definetely worth it if you like games from KupoGames. If this game is on sale for less than 5 bucks like it is at the time of the review, I'd say definetely get it if you're into this genre.			"

												This is a standard RPG with its selling point probably being its humor. It's pretty addicting.The two best things about this game:- When you get a medal, notifications appear on your steam client, the game itself (satisfying sound effect included), and if you have ASTATS open in your browser in the background, it'll appear there, too.- What's even better, is when in game, you're fighting an enemy and it barely lived as your turn ended, then it gets struck by lightning and dies, ending the battle. Or even better, it gets crushed by a falling mammoth out of nowhere. Or two of them.If you feel that's underwhelming, maybe this isn't for you. I recommend you play the free flash games, Epic Battle Fantasy 1~4, to see how you like it before buying it. They're on Kongregate and other flash game sites.			"

												This game is undoubtedly one of the best flash games I played. The amount of work done to this game is phenomenal. I remember playing this on Kongregate and enjoying the hell out of it. Once I heard that the full version of the game was selling on steam, I told myself that I had to buy this. AND I played through the whole thing, including through all of the additional contents with Battle Mountain! Here's why this game is worth a look!POSITIVES:- HOURS of content- Not so serious story with humorous elements of characters- Four characters to play as (Each with unique skills)- Many ways to customize characters (Skills, Costumes, Badges)- Several areas to explore and tons of foes to face!- Game presents a challenge and difficulty scales gradually- Many RPG elements that people who are familiar OR new to them will love- Many rewards, many prizes!- Don't need to grind this game in order to beat it. From what I remember correctly, enemies scale to your level.- SOUNDTRACK IS AMAZING!- Art design of world and characters are attractive- Can save your game anytime- ACHIEVEMENTS!NEGATIVES:- No gripping or remarkable story- For people who do not like casual RPGs, this is not your cup of teaOverall, I enjoyed playing through this game again and experiencing the challenge of Battle Mountain! Hope this review helps make a clear picture of Epic Battle Fantasy 4!			"

												Epic Battle Fantasy 4 is an awesome role-playing game. The game is wickedly funny (sometimes in a lewd way xD) with cute graphics and has amazing battle soundtracks that pump you up. The best part about the game is the combat system heavily based on elemental strengths and weaknesses that make you think what the best gears and skills to equip before boss battles. Highly recommended if you're into turn-based game with role-playing adventure elements.			"

												I played this game before without buying it on steam. Once I found it here I had to, just had to get it. Its a charming little game made by one person if I remember correctly. Hours and hours can be put into it, with many different kind of achivements. Some lewd, some really strange. All in all, this game is something you can play without worry. Just make sure you have a free day. Once you start it, its hard to stop.			"

Some people say it's a bit repetitive but i dont think so due to the fact that there are many different tactics and gears avaliable and it has a large variety in environments. Overall it's good value for a small cost.			"

												Well, EBF4 is a great game.there's lots of reasons to play this game:its a turn based RPG, has alot of humor, has refrences everywhere, and the battles are much more rediculus than other games.just an example: emagain a team of 4 poeple, trying to kill the last wooly mammoth, and the first guy says: ""oh wow! the last wooly mammoth! i cant beleve we found it!"" and suddently, a mamooth litteraly falls from the sky, hits the mammoth, and then you summon a sword out of thin air.so poeple, buy this game! its 12$, quite cheap!10 / 10			"

												EBF originates from a internet flash game which I originally played years ago on Newgrounds. It's a turn-based adventure RPG with elements from its counterparts in both western RPGs and JRPGs.As far as RPGs go, it has a relatively small amount of gameplay, making it a short (but in my opinion sweet) play. Most of the fun will be had in battles, where diverse enemies and an easy-to-understand element system make it a strangely relaxing experience. The art is nice, the moves are diverse and there are references everywhere to almost anything.Its cheap too, so thats a plus.			"

Spells and attacks against enemies can do extra damage or heal them depending on elements. It keeps you on your toes so you can't just click through most battles.			"

												I'm known to HATE turn-based combat, but the Epic Battle Fantasy Series is the exception. I don't know what it is about the games that makes me love them to bits... I guess it's the characters and the wholeheartedness of it all. What I feel: Kupo wants to make these games for the love of making them. Also, you can't say that the characters haven't had any development. I remember how Lance joined the team (not in EBF4) - which was hilarious. Then there's Anna who learned to tolerate Matt's love to ste- err, take ""Free Samples"" whenever he wants. A love development can really complicate the narrative if mis-handled, so please be careful and don't rush it!My bit of critic, I.E. the only problem I had: wave transitions are cruel. Q.Q;Maybe it's intentional, but once all the enemies attack then they all die of poison or whatever, the next enemies come in and they get to go first. Also, if the last (and only) enemy attacks and then die from a counter attack, I start hating my characters' awesomeness since I have to deal with the next wave's attacks before I can heal or something. It'd be great if that were dealt with. :DThat's literally my only complaint, with the first sentence in mind, so YES! Get it and play it! Totally worth it!Lastly: I love the reference to Golden Sun. >.>			"

												This, my fine gaming siblings, is what we've all been waiting for. Addicting turn-based classic JRPG gameplay. an amazing soundtrack that gets you in the mood to fight when entering a battle, and let's you jam out as you travel. Funny and interesting characters that you grow to love (and laugh at) instantly. A myriad of spells, skills, weapons, armor, power-ups, enemies, dungeons, landscapes, and slightly... *ahem* ""special"" (yet hilarious) NPCs. An artstyle with animations that instantly pique your inner otaku and hold you captive. And last, but not least, and interesting and engaging storyline that will have you on the edge of your seat (perhaps exagerated, but i digress). Everything about this game screams that it was carefully and lovingly developed by a AAA team of a godly design. But not so, as it is meticulously crafted by one man who has spent years on these games. Perhaps it is free elsewhere, but i implore that you consider helping out this fellow, by throwing a few dollars his way. It is easily worth the money. Now, go forth my brothers and sisters. Go forth and conquer that which is Epic Battle Fantasy 4. Because if this isn't a 10/10 masterpiece, then nothing is.			"

												This would be the first turn-based RPG where (when playing on epic) you have to take time to set up equipment for the battle. You have 4 character and play 3 at a time, they all have a weakness and strength (of attacks) so you have a good reason to use all 4. A game worth the time and price. If you like turn based RPG, you will not be disapointed.Edit: Game gets quite challanging when going for all the achievements.			"

												Pretty good game, but kinda expensive, seeing as most of it can be found on Kongregate for free. The Battle mountain is pretty cool to do and the new equipment is awesome too, but i don't know if that alone is worth the 11 euros you have to pay for it. I, personally, have a problem with the FPS when playing extended periods (over 6 hours) but overall it's pretty stable. I recommend buying this game if you know you'll enjoy it... else, search it on Kongregate first and look if you can afford the 11 euros for this game.			"

												In short - this game is absolutely awesome.In long... Challenging yet not impossible, funny yet smart - it keeps you playing, but never lets you get bored. Personally I find fighting mechanics extremely enjoyable - well balanced, but requiring some level of skill to end up effective and successful. Storyline is nice, though I liked it more in EBF3 - there were more fun stuff and I really loved all those witty anime refferals. I want to point out - that in EBF4 quality level DID NOT drop, it's just that now such things are expected (for those who played previous part obviously). Characters are great - they are not one bit like classic boring ""heroic"" heroes or angsty anime kids. Well... there are some problems - Lance with his naz... black uniform does look a bit disturbing. I just don't understand authors position on this one. So I picked different outfit and tried to forget. =) And did I say Natalie got some classy eyes, -wink -wink?!  I recommend this game to everyone...  unless you find Final Fantasy style of battle system unaccepatable. If so - accept my condolences!			"

												Really enjoyable game, would absolutely recommend.It's fun, quirky and let's you take it at your own pace. If you're a m3g4 l33t MLG H4rdc0r3 gamer then you may find it a bit easy, I boosted it up to hard for a bit more of a challange and I usually freaking suck at games. But I'd suggest hard mode when you get your bearings.But really it's a lovely game to play, it's not stressful at all (Except maybe mid-boss fight) but even then you can drop in and out of battles with no penalty. It also gives you the option to come up with battle strategies that rely on your team working together to take down your foes, or you can just wale on them until death happens.  Anyway if you're thinking about buying this game enough that you're reading this then I'd say get it. Unless you're a scaredy sisspot that is.			"

												Epic Battle Fantasy is a story set in a fantasy land that encapsulates total humour. It's powerful role playing essentials prove that an RPG does not have to be made with great graphics or new complicated battle mechanics - it just needs a firm storyline such as this.The story unfolds with four heroes that find each other along the journey, fight monsters, and as usual, attempt to claim world peace from this unseemingly harmless boss - the Godcat. Throughout the way, dry R16 humour develops throughout the story, and even when you are engaging in difficult battles, somewhat the characters randomly crack jokes in a light hearted manner. Hmm...The system is brilliant. Brilliant in the sense that the forging and money systems go hand-in-hand nicely unlike many other games that introduce poverty into the heroes. Summons actually help a lot, and battle statuses are not just those nice symbols floating on your heads - they actually kill you. Simple but effective.Music is fine, although the tunes are reminiscent of popular music. Canon in D - main theme. Enjoyable but I didn't love it as much and it somewhat did not match the situations.Overall, a must try for fantasy fans. Also has a very high replay value.			"

												I followed this series back in 2009 (starting from EBF 1) and am still following it.This game was first introduced on a flash game website and to have it ported to my personal PC is the nicest thing to have.The game is a simple RPG with a linear story line. Tons of unique (even fanmade!) monsters as well as an abundance of costumization for your characters to use. Each enemy has their weakness and each character is good at dealing certain types of damage or being a certain type of ""stereotype"" role.Epic Battle Fantasy is a homage to your good ol' JRPG (Japanese Role-Playing Game) and features a keyboard usage as well as mouse usage, depending on what your preference is. The EBF series also has a lot of connections (and easter eggs!)  with Japanese stuff related, especially anime. For those who want a simple, yet fun RPG with tons of references to anime, J-games, this game will be fun for you!The creator is also creating on a sequel of EBF 5 and spin-off bullet hell versions. Also check out EBF III, the prequel of this game! :D			"

												This game is a blast from the past for me, and I'm very happy it's on Steam. It's a fun little Flash RPG, with silly humor and goofy battles, but with incredibly solid mechanics. The battles are fun and satisfying, and can also be pretty challenging on max difficulty. The only issues I feel are worth mentioning are the following two: the character balancing, and the graphics. It's not that the graphics are bad, I rather like the art style. But when you try to play on fullscreen, it lags like crazy, even on higher end PC's. As for character balance, it's hard to ensure all party members remain relevant throughout the game. In my experience, it's typical for people to settle on the three they like most and just roll with them the whole game. While this isn't really a bad thing, I think it would just be more interesting for each character to be built for a certain role, and perhaps to have all 4 fighting at the same time. Regardless, this game is very well made and I loved it long before it ever won any awards (which is hasn't, shamefully!), which is why I nominated it. Great work Matt, Looking forward to EBF 5!			"

												Considering this is not only a (loving) parody of JRPGs, but was also originally a Flash game, this game is somehow really amazing. The turn-based battles are pretty simple, but the summoning system and being able to swap in a backup character - even when the one you're swapping out is dead- is a nice change. And the variety of weapons, armor, and accessories give a ton of options to tackling enemies. Then there's the fact that they can all be upgraded to be even more useful. The art style is simple too, but also pretty clean and nice to look at. Basically, it won't turn any heads, but this game is technically several years old from the time of Kongregate. The characters all look really nice and have a lot of charm, especially in their idle animations that love to add in a few fun references. And the characters themselves also have some fun personalities and banter. I really only wish that there was a little more development involved in it.Next up is the music, which is very fun-sounding and doesn't get tiring to listen to. And considering the soundtrack is free, its definitely worthwhile. The only real complaint I have is that the tracks themselves don't seamlessly loop like you would expect, so it's pretty obvious when they do.One of the biggest differences from the original browser version is the addition of Battle Mountain, a side world with extra-tough battles. And grinding isn't an option since levels scale (but try to come back later with more skills). It's a nice addition that will keep you coming back for a challenge, in addition to the game's already solid level of content. This game is overall a fun experience, that while a bit dated, can still bring some chuckles and enjoyment. So play it if you like simple turn-based RPGs.			"

												So lemme just get some facts and biases straight.The first game I ever played from Matt was Brawl Royale - a simple flash game that's basically just a reflex game to see how fast you can press a button when prompted. The animation, for me at the time, was pretty dang good and he gained a fan from that moment on. I've played every other game that came out since then, other than the Bullet Heaven ones, and I loved all of them.If you ever get to read this, Matt, I gotta say thanks for entertaining me for all these years. Hopefully, EBF5 will blow EBF4 right out the water.Tl;dr - I'm a fanboy and this review may be a little biased. Also, this is my first ever review.NOW ON TO THE REVIEW!REVIEW:This game was originally a flash game that was (and still is) free to play on sites such as Kongregate and Newgrounds. The only real differences between the free version and the Steam one/Kongregate's premium one are the additional weapons, armors, and badges and Battle Mountain. This is a little underwhelming for something worth $12 dollars, I have to admit.If you've played any traditional JRPG games before, that's pretty much what this game plays like. This may be a turn-off for some, but for fans and newcomers to the genre, I think you'll be in for a treat.The characters are all unique and interesting in their own way - even the NPCs, while not really memorable, have some choice bits of dialogue. As for the dialogue and text in the game, it's very humorous with loads of little nods and jabs to all things video games.The plot is pretty linear, so NG+ is really only for maxing out whatever skill you didn't learn and trying out some new tactics....That's all I can think of at the moment while typing this up so...Overall, 8.5/10 - needs more boobs			"

												This game actually inspired my life, I found the series when i was eight, and played it for hours on end. Now I am older, and I look back at the old games and think about how much it inspired me. I do art now, and i write spectaculacular stories, and I started them becuase I was writing fan fictions. I didn't knwo they were called fanfictions, or anything like that. I made stories about the characters and I still love them today. Love you Matt Kupo!!! <3 :D			"

												~Epic Battle Fantasy 4~I bought this game on a sale around 2$ , with no expectations from it , but when i actually played the game i found my self completely loving it! At first it's a bit boring but when the real battles and the easter eggs come♥♥♥♥♥♥get real.i really enjoyed the gameplay , it was not too slow but not fast either. The art style was amazing and the colours were just so pretty. The movement is really annoying in the begging untill you understand how it works. The plot is so over the top that it actually gets intresting at some points. The gameplay time , if you play with side missions, farming exp and gold , finding rare armor etc. , and try to finding all the easter eggs will be about 40-50 hours, if you play only the main story line it will be around 15-20 hours. And finally , last but not least , the achievements, OMG those achievements, you must jiggle natalie's boobs and find pants! To sum up this game is mostly focused on oldschool rpg fans but new players can also enjoy it but not as much.Overall score : 8,5/10			"

												The ""overwhelmingly positive"" review score makes me think of the first Dim-Sum restaurant to recieve a Michelin star. That is to say it's not the most extravagant or artistic game, but an expert execution of some basic JRPG principles. I've already played it from start to finish for free online, and felt it was worth actually buying. From a replayability standpoint the humor and plot obviously doesn't hold up well, but the combat is still engrossing, and what more can you ask of something titled ""Epic Battle Fantasy""? The soundtrack is shockingly good in a nostalgic synthisizer sort of way, and though the tracks loop fairly heavily after 11 hours and counting I haven't muted it yet. The most impressive part for me is the level design. From start to finish you are never asked to backtrack without being rewarded for it. Exploration is heavily encouraged, and plot based roadblocks flow exceptionally nicely and naturally. Like Morrowind each 'tile' of the map is filled with side-quests and secrets to discover.			"

												Epic Battle Fantasy 4 is a game that has seen in my opinion, too little attention. It's a game that brings back the nostalgia of the classics, while throwing in it's own unique sense of humor to keep everything fresh. The animations may be a little stiff, but that is only because of the art style itself, and that is still beautiful. To anyone who is having any hesitant thoughts about this game, I suggest going to Newgrounds or Kongragate and trying your hand at the previous three instalments.			"

												This game has boobs. 10/10.But seriously, if you've ever wanted a freaking awesome classic-style RPG this is the thing. The soundtrack is SO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ EPIC. Like seriously, Epic Battle Fantasy 3 and 4 have my two favorite soundtracks among video games I've played.The mechanics are standard fare, but there's nothing wrong with that. Character designes are very memorable, especially things like the slimes, NoLegs and GodCat. If you're looking for a short RPG to play, this should be your first choice.			"

												*Revised* Old review can be found here: http://pastebin.com/gT51U0zYLike JRPG combat but hate the melodramatic stories or overtly anime plots that only appeal to otakus?Want a RPG that's honest to god funny without pointing out all the cliches we see in RPGs? Epic Battle Fantsy 4 is for you! With a deep combat system that's very much based off Final Fantasy, but with enough nuances to make it its own and an interesting equipment system that allows for more replayability, unlike in most RPGs, one sword or peice of armor isn't ""better"" than others simply cause you find it later in the game, each have their own pros and cons that allows for extra experimentation and strategy. Oh and the music is pretty great too, not the best in the world but is definitely worth a listen.			"

The game may not take itself that seriously, but there's a lot of strategy in almost every single aspect: weapons, armor, accesories, crafting, buffs, resistances and weaknesses... thare's a lot going on in a single fight, so you can either plan your moves acording to every situation or just don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥and start using finishing moves all over the place.

												Boy, did I strike gold when I picked up Epic Battle Fantasy 4.  New to the series I had no Idea what I was getting myself in to, but it quickly found a warm and fuzzy place in this avid RPG fan's heart. The art style in this game offers a fun, playful experience, keeping well away from the dark and gritty with generous amounts of color to satisfy everyones pallet.  The Soundtrack. MY GOD THE SOUNDTRACK is what makes this game for me. The various battle themes keep you pumped from start to finish and with every new zone comes its own thrilling and whimsical theme tune that serenades you on your fantasy adventure and well after that. Going by the music and game design alone, it is clear that the developers and those involved in this humble indie game have a  clear understanding of both fun and fantasy. The ammount of  hours you can get out of this game is up to you. With an endless supply of monsters showing up in previously explored areas, you can level your characters as much or as little as you like. The enviroment puzzles, although optional will keep you busy and reward you fairly.  Oh and feel free to grind materials and upgrade your gear for  even more of an edge in battle.  And I can confidently say this game has plenty of replayability, the main story is short and sweet and wont run the risk of boring you halfway through your second, even third playthrough. You have some control over what abilities your characters learn or not, and mixing up the gear and permenant upgrades to your characters stats can certainly effect their roles and the outcome of battles. Plus multiple difficulty settings for all your bragging-rights needs!A damn fine Fantasy RPG that will amaze, inspire and reward your efforts with equal affection. Guaranteed satisfaction 10/10			"

												I wanted an old-style ff-esque game.  This is that game.  It has an overworld scrolling map like the original zelda, along with the ability to avoid random encounters.  The backtracking to grab items is handled well in items you find throughout the game unlocking easy access to already explored areas.  The puzzles make you think from time to time, and are solvable without having to look up a solution online.  The only thing I wish I had done was make better use of all the different weaponry and items.  It's easy to just level up your favorite items and miss out on some great combat tactics.I got the game on sale, but I think this game is well worth the normal asking price.  If the author creates and epic battle fantasy 5, I will definitely be a buyer.			"

												Almost to the end of the story, I think. I love jrpgs and there aren't that many good ones on Steam or the PC for that matter. But then there is EBF4. The story isn't much to write home about but it's still cute and the writing is pretty humorous with tons of references to other classic games.  The world is pretty big and each area is unique and has plenty of different types of monsters. Crafting is simple and straightforward but satisfying and there are tons of skills to choose from.I have two very big complaints however. There is no controller support. Which is a shame because I wanted to sit back and relax whilst playing. The other complaint is the UI is a little cluttered. Even after hundreds of battles I can't remember which menu a specific skill is in but that's probably just because I'm dumb. Either way the game is well worth the money and I'm will be playing it any time I need to satisfy my jrpg urges.			"

												A must-buy, must-play game.I highly suggest playing the first Epic Battle Fantasy games (you can find those online) for the sake of the storyline and getting to know some of the characters.This game made me laugh out loud more than once with its fourth-wall breaking and really bad jokes. The gameplay itself is absolutely fantastic in every conceivable way. It's smooth, engaging, and there are a lot of challenges that'll keep you on your seat for a long, long time (from puzzles to bosses on Epic difficulty). The artwork is cute, and so is the plot. And finally, the characters are absolutely lovable and memorable, with each one having a unique (and sometimes unusual) personality.One of the best games I've ever played, and though it will probably not come out, I do hope that Matt creates an Epic Battle Fantasy 5. I really wanna get to know Anna more as a character, and I kinda wanna see some possibility of some relationships blooming!			"

												( Review from a guy who usually play in French, sorry if this is hard to read )Really thought that the 3rd one was the best??? That nothing could have made this game any more perfect???Well here's the 4th game or this amazing serie.EBF4 is a classic-styled RPG : Turn by turn combats, Équipments, Magics, Element system, ALL the Items, Aventure!!!The game's tags already spoil it all, nothing new.There are only 2 things you find less often in that one game tho' :- Grinding.... ooooooh the grinding... very glad you didn't corrupt this game.- Random battles. Yes yes! YOU decide when the action scenes starts!The musics are amazing, so much i'm currently listening to them from the in-game gallery. Amazing idea to have more than one battle theme too, it prevents them to get repetitive too much.The game is funny and you might need a second playthough to spot and/or get all the references mentionned in the short but frequent character's lines.The game difficulty can be changed at will in the game's settings, so it's hard for me to give a negative point by saying that the Epic difficulty mode really can make you remember to save after every fight. Of course you could flee the battle and come back later if they are too strong for you... but really sometime you simply don't see the insta-death attack coming. Except for the bosses, the first 10 levels gives you short and enjoyable battles with basic tutorial windows that pop-up so new players aren't too lost. After you get to level 20-22 tho', battles can sometime get long and repetitive, especially with a high difficulty setting. Because the enemy monsters usually matches the current place you are in, it can happen that you just want to see some differant landscape in hope to see the foes also change accordingly... as you will stay in some specific 'biomes' for quite a few battles. The generous amount of ready-to-be-opened-gold-trimmed chests usually help you to not get too tired of these long 4-waves battles. The playable characters slightly lack some personality and backstory, yes, but i guess it's the perfect occasion for the 5th title to be even better that this one. Those who already played ( and loved ) the 3rd game should not see any problems with that tho'.The price is fair, and the game deserves every single of the 9 points I can give out of 10.			"

												I honestly have a feeling that all the negative reviews are from people who've never even bothered playing the other 3 games and know nothing about the engine that was used for this or even gave it an actual chance. It wasn't RPGMaker so you obviously fail for trying to compare Kupo to a ""reddit RPG Maker /b/tard"". If anything since you know reddit so well that you used categories and seen for yourself how people are on there then you must be one of said ""/b♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"". This game is literally an indie RPG masterpiece referencing all types of games and genres and heavily Final Fantasy referenced. I played this mostly on Kongregate and the moment it was on Steam I bought it. The OST is AMAZING. I listen to it all the time at work. Halcyonic Falcon X aka Phyrnna <3 I love you <3. You can get all the EBF4 music on her YouTube or Spotify channels. Maybe Pandora, I don't know because I don't use Pandora. You can also get the soundtrack from the Steamapps folder of this game too. I've been a long time fan since EBF1 and Bulletheaven. I can't stress how awesome this game is for what it is. There's actually A LOT to do in it and you can easily upgrade EVERYTHING. However I'm missing like 1 piece of armor I think, I can't remember but I read something about it only being available at a certain time? I forgot the full details of it. It's a well known question a lot of people have been asking about in the game because they can't 100% the armor collection. Still haven't figured it out yet. The thing about this game is, if you want to speed through the game, you can change the games difficulty to easy. The only difference the game makes is the damage you receive from enemies and how much health they have. Basically just a stat difference. There isn't anything too significant unless you're trying to get all the achievements in-game. The game doesn't seem to give you extra rewards after battles, just the overall challenge of the fights. I usually find it easier when I'm trying to rush through the game to just set the game on easy until I get to a boss fight because a lot of the enemy fights tend to get pretty tedious over time the I crank up the difficulty to hard or something because I can't do epicyet and I'm on my second playthrough. This game does have pretty good replayability to it. Especially the fact that you need to clear the game 3 times in order to get the achievement. However that 5m damage achievement is insane. I can't seem to pull that off with the Revenge skill when everybody but Matt is dead and Matts near dead while atk buffed. I guess I just need to farm for atk stat boost items.I honestly give it a 9/10 for me only, because some of the non-boss battles can get really tedious and it does lose entertainment value after awhile. It's good to play this game for a few hours a day unless you decide to play on easy  the entire time until boss fights show up and crank up the difficulty.But in general I give this game a 10/10 just because of how well made it was by 1 man and how well the music is for the game by 1 woman. It's definitely a masterpiece indie RPG. I can't really find anything wrong with it in general. Just a few personal afflictions I had that shouldn't affect a lot of other people as much as me.			"

												I freakin' love this game.  Before I get into the controversial stuff that I like... let me just say that the battle system in this game is amazing.  You can decide which characters get which special moves, you can level skills up that you want while leaving others in the dust if you choose, you have to level up your equipment (especially in later battles) to ensure you have a nice diverse set of resist gear to survive the challenging boss fights (depending on the difficulty you set it on).Did I mention that there are tons of hidden chests, quests for npcs (that aren't necessary for progression, just a bonus), an extra difficult bonus location for those of us that bought the game, and an amazing sound track?I personally really got a kick out of some of the commentary between the characters.  The story is obviously very light-hearted and the gimmicky chats between the heroes is usually comical - not to mention you can click on Natalie for a chuckle now and then.  Epic Battle Fantasy 4 for me was a breath of fresh air in a market that no longer caters to those of us who liked the traditional jrpg such as the early FF games/nes/snes rpgs of the past.  I like Skyrim and all of the clones of that new genre of rpg that are out, but I REALLY like the old style.  As someone who grew up in the 80s and 90s playing the rpgs of that time, and if you did too, you will like this game.  Thank you so much Kupo for putting this together, I just wish EBF5 was out...

You can run from any battle everytime including boss battles, when you scan an enemy it stays scanned in future battles, items are clearly sorted based on type and effect, in-fact if you were to describe everything you hated about RPG's in the past 5 years, this game takes all of those things and removes them replacing them with something better.

												There is an achievement for stealing panties.10/10Edit: In all seriousness the humour isn't the only thing great about this game. Epic difficulty is very difficult and rewarding at the same time. There are some difficult puzzles. Late game (on epic) has some 30-60minute+ fights which are all or nothing - very tense, and very rewarding. Because of the way skills work there are some which you have to choose which character to take them on - i.e. revive which is only way besides using an item to actually revive a dead ally (which is pretty important since most attacks in the second half of the game are one shots).This remains one of the funniest, deep, and difficult games I have played ever. And if you are complaining about getting RNGed all the time - it's the kind of strategy which is beatable in all situations if you play it perfectly. The difficulty comes in devising a game plan and equipping the right items (which all do different things like random buffs). There are also multiple ways to build your party which can all work - a lot of people have Natz as a full carry mage for example, but she is on healer duty for me :)The only bad part of this game is the first boss where you have limited options because you have no skills yet :A			"

												Epic Battle Fantasy 4 is the latest game in the series of flash driven, turn based RPGs by Kupo Games. Its tiny development team, headed by Matt Roszak (Whom is credited for design, art, story and programming).This is a game which should be praised, for the amount of effort put in. The result is a well realised and full RPG experience full of character and heart.The game retains enough nostalgia from old school RPGs but still manages to feel fresh and new. If you’ve ever played any Final Fantasy title pre FFXI you’ll be familiar with this format. It gives a master class in how a turn based system should play along with all the usual elements you’d expect, being able to cast magic, summon other creatures, use items and attack and it does this as well as any JRPG does. Its appeal for me was that this is a finely tuned machine of a game. Usually with turn-based RPGs you eventually become so powerful that nothing is really a challenge, except maybe some bosses but with a combination of a difficulty slider that makes a difference and some well paced scaling of foes, Epic Battle Fantasy 4 keeps you on your toes and makes you think a little bit.I’ve always loved turn based RPGs when done well and RPGs in general, but turn based more so than Action. The reason being it brings an element of strategy with out reliance on quick time events [which i hate]. Epic Battle Fantasy 4 makes full use of the strategic element of the genre.It does this through its use of equipment and skills. The majority of weapons have an elemental effect which will assist you in tearing through enemies that are weak to that element and each piece of equipment has a use, without the collect and discard method used in most games. Weapons can be swapped out in combat also but this will take up a valuable turn to do so. Not only that, you won’t be receiving that free ride through an area.The skill and specials pool is a very well implemented way of customising your characters and their skillset. Skills can only be learned by that specific character and specials can be learned by all, but only one character may have it at any one time. Once again, brings some difficult decisions forward. You can also equip the characters with items that will provide passive bonuses or abilities within battle, another little customisable option for balancing your team some buffing characters and some casting abilities at dice-rolled intervals. Gone, in this game, is any idea of an “Ultimate” weapon. For me, that’s refreshing. Each weapon can be upgraded as you collect items from combat or treasure.The characters are well written and interact nicely. The personalities feel genuine and It seems like they are inspired by or based in some way on friends of the developer. At times they do act like close friends who have a lot of fun in each other’s company. This game is no doubt a labour of love and the small team at Kupo Games must have poured a lot of time into this game. It is increasingly rare to see triple-A games give this creative warmth, probably due to the size of the teams but Steam lets this flourish.There are a lot of small gestures and references that experienced RPG fans will appreciate showing a good dose of humour. From the snow covered Djinn from Golden Sun in Whitefall Town to the name of some of the achievements you can gain for using new items they flow through the whole game well.Epic Battle Fantasy’s achievement/medal system is well implemented. Some are very difficult to obtain, some pretty much laughing in the face at how ridiculous achievement systems are. When combined with the bestiary gives you that feeling of collection that a lot of games look past. It makes you want to collect them, this is important. A game by a turn-based RPG fan, for turn-based RPG fans, this will likely not appeal to those who only play Shooters or Wii Fit games but give it a chance and it may well draw you in. To wrap up, Epic Battle Fantasy 4 is an absolutely fantastic game, made even more impressive by the huge contribution by Matt Roszak. It is a game i’ve played over the Christmas holidays and will likely play again soon. With a Newgame+ option it is set up well for this. The art is soft and friendly, the enemies range from menacing to adorable. The mechanics are solid, the story is well written, the characters engaging and the experience is enjoyable. It can also be bought for next to nothing because ‘Steam’.4 Ferrets out of 5			"

												This is the first and probably one of the very few reviews I will bother doing - Because its rare for me to fidn a game I enjoy this much. I have been following Matt (Kupo, the creator)and playing his games for a few years now. Bullet Hell, EBF3, EBF4, and a few other titles. I have to say, this fourth installment of EBF is the best. The game gets better every single time. each game has more equipment, strategies, monster and boss variety, skills, and medals. There is no way to express how much I really enjoy this game. There are tons of light-hearted jokes, and meme references. Also, there are a ton of referneces from old school games and shows - especially pokemon. ""Don't thing too hard - you may hit yourself in confusion."" ""IM NOT THAT DUMB.""........"" Weak generic bat enemy used wing attack!... It wasn't very effective."" Littlle things like that (and there are tons of them) make this game so much more enjoyable. Also, Matt ridicules himself and the game several times through his characters. He doesn't take himself or the game too seriously, yet he makes every aspect of it near flawless. Its one of the few games I can actually sit through more than once and do it multiple times. Also, the ability to switch from easy to♥♥♥♥♥♥instantly is great. Some might think its cheap, but honestly, you only get achievements on epic... no need to fight 1000s of monsters that mean nothing on epic when on the bosses matter on that difficulty.ProsSkill varietyMonster varietyEquipment varietyStrategy (You will get crushed... especially on Epic difficulty... if you don't think before you act)HumorAchiements/medalsEndless monsters and challengesPuzzlesMultiple charactersTons of secrets and hidden chestsLots of questsGraphics (pretty intense for a flash game)Music (and they say video games don't have real music)New game+ and several difficulties, along with ability to switch difficulty whenever.Large map. Seemlessly merges together once you open all pathways. Lots to explore and discover.ConsSometimes choppy on steam. Probably not the game's fault. Plays fine on Kongregate.A lot of backtracking and memorizing. I personally don't mind this, but some might. There is a walkthrough for this game on kongregate if you cant find something or get stuck on a boss.10000/10.			"

												If ever there was a game to buy, it'd be this one. If youre unsure, you can check out the free version online, but this version has extra content(some of which includes the full soundtrack)which is definitely worth the purchase in my book. The creator of this game has been making some of the best flash games ive seen for quite some time, and for him to actually get a game on here just shows how well made this game is. Buy this game, you will not regret it			"

												It is hard to believe this game is made by one person, you would think a team of about 20 at least is necesary for such detailed craftmanship. I bought the game to enjoy the extra steam features and finish it in hard mode and up :3 its very entertaining and it scratches that rpg itch one has for good oldschool rpgs a la old final fantasy titles (6 and bellow) i highly recomend it, this game only comes second to bravely default in rpg goodness.

												I am really glad that I gave this a try - it's pure fun! Nice graphics, great music, funny dialogues, fine-tuned turn-based battles, lots of skills, upgradable weapons and armor... its a pure gem! Also exceptionable are the many medals/achievements you can get - and many of them will make you smile (e.g. I almost fell off my chair laughing, after I poked some chicken). For the price - it's totally okay for me. Yes, I have read that there is some free version out there - but I like this game and so it's just a fair way to support  the developer. After all - that might help to get another great game like this coming...			"

												Having almost finished the game, I'm more ambivalent about it now than when I started. The fights are fun and the puzzles are simple but plentiful, which is good, but the game's humour rapidly becomes tired and obvious. Boob jokes and casual lechery aren't just sexist and stupid, they're also dull and show a serious lack of creativity.I'm still recommending this game because the gameplay is good fun, but I recommend skipping through as much of the dialogue as you can, because it's just too boring to bother with.

												Okay, so, theres three senarios on why you'd want this game:1. You completed the Free Flash Version [armorgames.com]And Wanted To Find Some More Adventure In The Same Game! And, Yes, This Is Extended - But Not Exactly How You'd Think.. (You May Not Have Completed It.)2. You Are An Epic Battle Fantasy Fan And Find It On Sale Here, Ready To Buy. You Didn't Play No.4, Yet Alone Know It Was On Steam, Or You Didn't Even Know No.4 Was Out!3. You Are Looking For A Decent RPG Game, Or A Friend Recommended It, And You Come Across This. You Would Have Purchased It Already If You Didn't Notice The Big Fat ""4"" Tag On It, Emplying Its A Further Installment In The Series And Had Such High Pricing, So You Look At Reviews.Well, I say  ALL  of the above is why you should get this game! To support the maker, To play a new game, and to have fun with a fresh game to you. The story is a continue from Epic Battle Fantasy Three,[armorgames.com] so I recommend playing that first. Maybe the characters will be a little knew even in that game, but you should get used to it. Even in number one the characters werent explained! Once you play that, get this game for:It has cute characters like kitten gods as your main foes, loot that you wouldnt find anywhere else, epic storyline, challenging puzzles, imagination behind the idea, RPG adventure, weapons of extroadinary looks, cutsences with emense artisrty, extended fights, major fun, enchanting music and more! I recommend this game for all of that. The exclusive content to the full PC release on steam are:• Includes Kongregate’s Premium Pack, which adds:•    8 new bosses, 27 new equips, 8 new skills.•    Huge new area to explore.•    Survival mode and boss rush challenges.•    Newgame+ feature, with higher level monsters.• Support for different window sizes and fullscreen resolutions.• Uncompressed audio and various visual improvements; the game looks and sounds better than ever.• Integration with Steam’s achievements, trading cards, and most importantly, cloud saving.• Includes the soundtrack. (26 tracks!)Added Awesomeness: 100%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------And.The Cute Ones Deserve It!			"

												9/10Wow so good! Inspired by some the best JRPG games such as Golden Sun and Final Fantasy, Epic Battle Fantasy 4 is a modern hit and success! I have enjoyed my time fully and have found the content and gameplay to be satisfying. The only cons I can think of is no Steam overlay and sometimes a little choppiness. Thankfully the game's playstyle doesn't require more optimization but it would be nice. All around a pretty smooth game and definitely fun!I do wish more games would come out like Golden Sun...so underappreciated.			"

												Wow, this game is fun... and big! I'm amazed it's just a Flash game. If you're a fan of the old-school Final Fantasy games, this game is for you, especially if you like cats. :3 It's very rewarding, too, since the visuals are fantastic, the writing is fun, and the battles are tense (especially toward the end). I can't count the number of times when I was sure I was going to lose, but I somehow managed to get it together just enough to crawl to victory.The final boss is the most tense battle I've ever fought in an RPG. The game does its best to kill you, but there's this tiny sliver of hope, and every turn feels like it will be your last. When victory finally comes, you will know it's because you tore it from the the maw of defeat with your bare hands.At least, that's how I felt. Hopefully, I'm not just bad. :P I'm sure I could have leveled up more, but the pacing of the game made it feel like this was where I was supposed to be, and that feeling persists through the entire game. Grinding is minimal, and I only did it when I just felt like bashing some heads in for fun.Get it. Get it, now!			"

												Epic Battle Fantasy 4 - The first thing that popped into my head when I heard of this game was, ""what kind of name is that?"" Going by the title alone, you almost expect this to be the most cliche RPG ever, and it is - in a good way.EBF4 is a bit of a parody of RPGs. You have turn based combat, level ups, and gear, just like in all your normal RPGs. You've also got characters that crack jokes at their own game, and much like the little indie game EvoLand, it likes to make reference to other games fairly often as you bash enemies over the head with oversized weapons.At first glance, this game looks like the kind of flash game you'd play in your internet browser when you were little - the art is colorful but looks primitive and the controls aren't complex. Yet this is the kind of 'flash game' that someone poured hours and hours into, and it shows; the art style may very well be simple, but that's before considering how much you can customize your characters. Each and every helm in the game gives the characters a different hairstyle, for one - heck, I spent more time than I'd like to admit mixing and matching outfits to see what was both stylish and combat practical.The game is very lax in terms of its rules. It could almost be said that it got rid of all the little bits that make RPGs frustrating - encounters are not random, running away is penalty free, all gear is useable once upgraded, grinding is not necessary (except maybe for Epic mode) and upgrade ingredients are plentiful. The game doesn't have you trecking an hour to get a single ingredient - everything progresses at a quick and painless pace.Make no mistake, the game is challenging on Hard and Epic modes. One's ability to arm characters with the right attacks and gear is mandatory for taking on the game's big bosses, even if said big bosses look too comical to take seriously.Overall, a very pleasant game, and there's no way I can't recommend it. It's not the kind of gripping story about trust and betrayal that will move you to tears, but it's a fun little title that does everything right, and should be recognized for it.			"

												Eh.I liked EBF3 better.I've been following this game series for a long time now, so when EBF3 came out it 'wowed' me in a way that EBF4 simply cannot - being that it's exactly the same game, but with a new character (who doesn't add to the max count of players on the field). It feels like a new game. But, at the same time, I suppose instead of innovating, it's simply... more content. Coupled with a map that's of a decent size, yet feels surprisingly small. That, and of all the swords that we've got still in the game even from EBF1, no Soul Eater. My absolute favourite sword is not here. That makes me a very sad cookie. Soul Eater, featured in every game up until but excepting this one. Very fun because of the drastic reduction in survivability stats, but a huge increase in damage.I'm only 17 hours in, at the final boss, and I expect to be here for a while longer, simply because I'm gonna need to grind up a whole bunch more XP off... something, and a whole bunch more money, off... something, since I expect I am going to need a pile of it to upgrade every piece of equipment I need so I can finally beat the boss.Now let's get something straight. I don't mind grinding. I play Disgaea 1. Yeah, play. Not played. I'm still going.But in EBF4... for some reason, I'm not really enjoying the grinding. I'm not really certain why. I spent hours upon hours finishing up EBF3, and it was incredibly satisfying to finally tick every box, but with EBF4, I'm struggling to work up the effort to beat the final boss.Why do I recommend this game?I recommend it because it's a good game. It really is. It's a $12 JRPG-type game, it's great fun, and it's terribly, wonderfully simple in scope. It's exactly what it looks like, a turn-based JRPG. If you like turn-based JRPGs, you will like this one.If your finger is hovering over that 'Add To Cart' button, and you're just not sure, then give Epic Battle Fantasy 3 a go. It's free, and a good representation of what you're going to find if you purchase EBF4.			"

												Quite enjoyable, and very nostalgic as I had played the previous three installments which were flash games. Reminiscent of the RPGs of old, with unique new twists. Offers an arcadey experience with a plot as intricate as the Mario franchise, so you don't really need to worry about getting caught up or anything since anywhere you start is pretty much all you really need to know.Like I said, a very arcade experience for those who want good, strategic combat out of their RPGs. Multiple difficulty levels which can be changed outside of combat. Alot of the game will be you having epic combat in a fantasy setting, but I suppose the title could have told you that much.This game gives plenty of replay value, despite the 28 hours I clocked in at the time of this review, I haven't finished a single playthrough yet. Provided, I did alot of mucking about with sidequesting and took my sweet time, and if I went straight for the final boss things could have been done quicker, but this game features a whole host of battles that aren't part of the main map and further enhances the whole ""arcade"" view point.Although, by no means is this game tedious just because you fight things alot; the main focus of the game is RPG combat, as referenced by the title, and it delivers.People have said there's a free flash version of this game, and there is; but it doesn't include the content this has. Said content is the particuarly large ""Battle Mountain"" portion which has a HUGE amount of content, and this version supports up to three newgame+ runs, with enemies scaling with player level each NG+. This also runs better than the flash version, which is a given due to being a stand alone client now. The dev also did a good job with the previous three flash installments, so why not show him a little love? Alternatively, you could purchase the ""full verison"" on kongregate and play it there, but I feel that's less optimal. It's cheaper, but it's still going to be in flash there and ultimately not as Despite not having a indepth story, which isn't a bad thing mind you, the characters were still interesting to me. Graphics are pleasantly cartoony and colorful, with lots of detail and style.Also, unlike the flash version, this has cloud saving, so temporary internet file shenanigans won't muck anything up.Also features comedy and good times!Ultimately, this was a good buy. I forget whether I got this on sale or not, but looking at the price I'd call it worthy of twelve dollars. On the other hand, I am a real scrooge, so I prefer to save as much money as possible when I buy things.			"

That being said, the characters and dialogue are pretty one-sided and the author really overdoes it on the casual misogyny and slurs. Fun game if you're able to overlook the fact that the cookie-cutter story sounds like it was written by a thirteen-year-old boy who's just discovered porn.			"

												This is far better than I expected. It's a very dynamic game. You're able to really chose between what you want to use and there aren't many ""direct upgrades"" to things. It's pretty challenging too, and has just my type of humor.			"

												EBF4 is a fantastic game for anyone who likes RPGs and laughing. You can spend dozens of hours with it and it doesn't get boring. The fighting system is pretty detailed and even when you finish the game for the first time, you probably won't know all the tricks about it. The graphics are also great, made with lots of time and love. In fact, a very good game for its relatively low price.			"

												Played and loved EBF3 in a browser ages ago... and EBF4 delivers a simple continuation on that same wonderful low-brow hilarity. Even the game's performance problems seem designed to troll you. so...Last few rounds going against the diamond golem, it starts spamming a long animation limit break every turn which causes a little bit more slowdown each time... and the game crashes when the golem's life bar hits 0.11/10, would crash again.

												Epic Battle Fantasy 4 despite its quirks is a reasonably well made JRPG with a solid combat system that comes with interesting itemization(optimization for fights ahoy!). Sadly I found the story rather lacking. Obviously it makes fun of many stereotypes in the genre and overal tries to make jabs at how easy our heroes mow through zones while npc's pretend like it's all ever so hard...In the end I cannot help but feel that the lack of any kind of story to get invested into really hurts the game since it really only has the gameplay going for it. When a serious game makes a joke or two you can really appreciate them since they contrast with the serious nature of the game. Epic Battle Fantasy 4 sadly makes a joke out of everything which ends up making everything unfunny. So is the game worth playing? I bought it for about €3,00 or so and I'd say the 25 hours I got out of it were easily worth it. Get it at a discount and you'll have fun without trying to justify the price. I enjoyed the game since it has solid combat and itemization but it's not going to be something people will talk about much since storytelling is often such a strong part of JRPG's and it simply hurts the game not having much of any.

												First and foremost, this is essentially an upgraded flash game. If you dont want to pay full price (which is understandable for some people) then wait for a sale.This game brings back the classic feel of a turn based rpg system in a warm, fun filled cartoony format. It is not a childish kind of fun, but is still best left to those who like games that are not even close to serious and are meant to just screw around with. That being said, it is possible to either breeze through the storyline or sit and grind for god knows how long on achievements. Either one works.If anyone were to ask me if this game is worth getting, I'd respond with ""Do you like cheesy, fun games that arent at all serious? If so then yes.""			"

Because I can't think of one. If that isn't enough reason to like it, I don't know what you're looking for. But, I can bet you that you can find it in EBF4.Hail Newgrounds. Wait, no.

												First played EBF2 on Newgrounds, loved it, but wished it was more complex, EBF3 comes out, can't get any better than this. see EBF4 on steam, stop what I'm doing, drive to the store, get a steam card, play for 4 hours straight, get up next saterday, play 7 hours straight, got 54 hours out of 1.5 plays of the main story mode, and this game has a VERY high replay  value, useing new setups, putting skills on diffirent units, and explaoring all the new crap in the extra zone, my only flack with this game is that one, I never needed to use Lance on my first play. Two, wish there were more and more varied skills. Three, would love a challange system where you have to do extra stuff in combat to earn rewards, such as ""Kill at least five foes with one attack"" or ""Use the same attack on the same unit that was weakness to that element 4 times in a row without killing it"" Just a few thing that I think would add to its size. Still overall, worth MORE then you are paying for it, oh and try the third game too. Still kicks♥♥♥♥♥			"

												I have played through and enjoyed all three other Epic Battle Fantasy games, and i enjoyed the series. Sure, it's not the best or most complex game, but the skillsets and itemsets and the way the combat work are grippingly fun and highly strategic, and the enemies were interesting the whole way through.That is, until this one.The game now no longer lets you win by strategy and you can't use the team you want. Unless you find the secret items or buy the exact ones which you have to use for each specific fight, and then GRIND until max level, you literally cannot win without turning down the difficulty at which point you may as well not play the game, because the story isn't gripping or interesting in the slightest.If you're thinking of buying this game, play Epic Battle Fantasy 3 for free instead, i wouldn't even pay £5 for this let alone it's actual asking price.

												I bought this game due to the large number of positive reviews, but frankly, I'm not impressed. The combat mechanics are competent, but there's nothing that distinguishes it from any other turn based RPG. Furthermore, the game isn't particularly difficult, so it never feels like your choice of skills or equipment really matters, since you'll be able to beat any enemy without much hassle anyway.The puzzles are pretty standard ""find key/item to unlock area,"" or ""flip X switches,"" or ""push this boulder out of the way"" affairs that are quite easy to solve.The humor and plot are comically childish and shallow, to the point where I was questioning if the story was written to be intentionally terrible. But perhaps I'm not part of the intended audience; I just can't imagine anyone over the age of 12 finding the humor or story compelling.			"

												#56Epic Battle Fantasy 4So, it would be a good game, if it worked.  The problem is, it crashes all of the time.  I'm not talking crashing back to windows, it crashes my whole system, requiring a fresh reboot.  Eveyone seems to have a solution, but none of it works.  The bottom line, it suffers from a deplorable excess of Flash.  Heres what i've done:1. uninstall/reinstall2.

												The actual gameplay itself minus the characters and the dialogue was decent, but nothing special. I liked the style - everything is adorable, but that was quickly detracted from by other aspects of the game.If I could eliminate the girl with the jiggly boobs from the game completely I might have sat through more of it.  Jiggle physics/animations completely belong in some games (saints row hilarity anyone?)- in this game I found boobs in my face uneccessary and eventually it just ruined it for me. There is always the option to swap characters, but the damage was already done. I also remember many points with the dialogue where I stopped and thought ""wow... I can't believe I actually paid money for this"", doubtful I'll go back and finish this game.Overall - 4/10 would reccommend for a pre-teen boy.			"

												I feel like this game is exactly what happens when a two-year-old Redditer or /b/-tard gets a hold of RPGMaker. The game tries to pass itself off as funny, witty, and clever, but ""meme-based"" humor and party members with half of their entire dialogue written in ""l33t-sp3@k"" simply is not funny. Or enjoyable. Or entertaining. Or anything other than ""annoying."" It all feels painfully forced, tedious, and failed to get even so much as a giggle out of me. Then the game introduced the Black-Mage-type/offensive spellcaster, Ms. Fanservice, whose special ability is a ""sexy wink"" and I gave up on this atrocity altogether.The only good thing I have to say about it is it's turn-based battle-system is kinda fun and it was really the only time when I enjoyed myself in the game. However that does absolutely nothing to set it apart from all the other RPGs out there and in the end this game is not something I would recommend to anyone. Ever.			"

It has amazing battle system and it has alot of old concepts that game developers have just thrown away in exchange for newer ideas that are less developed, BUT (And this is a big but) I'd have to say every character in this game is forgettable even the people you play as are very forgetable even though there is alot of character development. I feel if you go through the game being all ""who is that again?"" to your party members it is just not worth it. 4/10 GG no RE-match...			"

												The steam version of this game has very choppy framerates. I have a gaming computer and this game runs slow for me. I would say stay away from the steam version. It's not worth the money.			"

												I love RPGs. Jrpgs, western rpgs, they're both awesome.I saw the trailer for this game, read some reviews, and I was sold.Unfortunately, my first (and last) impression of the game was so bad, that I regret having paid for this title.The interface is terribly cluttered, difficult to use and understand.There is NO tutorial in the beginning. None. There are some vague hints here and there about minor aspects of the game, but that's it.How to fight? How to find your way? How to manage your inventory and skills?Not explained in any way. Hell, I even had a hard time figuring out where the hell I was supposed to go to begin with!I'm all for games that don't hold your hand (God bless Dark Souls), but this game, despite being a Jrpg, seemed to make it obscenely hard for me to even start going somewhere.Unless you have the patience of a saint and the willingness to figure where the hell you're supposed to go to, and how to do ANYTHING, I recommend staying away from this title.I regret buying it.

												Every time you're hit for half your health you almost kill the enemies and you keep seeing monsters spamming moves to instantly kill all your party members while you rely on a random cat with no legs, a tank, a dog, coffee, tactics, and reviving to survive the rest of the battle. That's only a typical battle in epic mode, but this is a great game overall. you can change anything you do, whether you grind or not, use the best skills or not, upgrade your weapons or not, fight optional bosses or not. You can do almost whatever.			"

												Pros+ Beautiful animations, from battle scenes to idle animations+ Hours of gameplay+ Changing armor/weapons changes the appearance of the character+ Lots of additional gameplay in the post-game+ Not just about turned-based combat; many puzzles to solve and secrets to find throughout the gameCons- The lack of a serious plot line might bother someOverall score: 10/10I can honestly only say good things about this game. If you don't believe me, you can always play the free version on Kongregate to see if you'd like it. Some of you might be wondering, ""Why should I pay for a game I can play for free online?"" Here are my two reasons: First, there is a lot of additional gameplay when you buy the version on Steam. It's the same version as the paid version on Kongregate, but this version comes with Steam Trading Cards, which obviously makes it superior. Second, I've been a longtime fan of the series. (My personal favorite is EBF3.) in some ways, I feel like buying this game was thanks to Kupo for all of the hours of fun I spent in all of his games. But seriously, play this game.If you like turn based RPGs, this game will be perfect for you. The animations are beautiful, and the gameplay draws a lot from the Final Fantasy series. I also love how armor, weapons, and accessories called flairs affect the appearance of characters. It's a personal pet peeve of mine when RPGs have armor, but changing the equipped armor doesn't change what the character is wearing. You can see that a lot of effort went into this game.The game doesn't take itself too seriously, so don't expect to be blown away by the plot. There are some immature jokes as well. Neither of these bothered me, but in fairness to the other games I reviewed, I felt obligated to list a con.Regardless, EBF4 is a wonderful game and you should definitely buy it if you like turn-based RPGs.

												This game sat on my wishlist for quite some time while I hemmed and hawwed over whether or not I wanted to buy it.  Reviews were good, I've just had a not-so-great streak of games I've tried out lately.  But I figured what the heck, it looks like something I might like.And let me tell you, it is!  This is a light-hearted 2D old-school style RPG that makes light and silly fun of many of the tropes we all know and love when it comes the the RPGs we've all played over the years.The gameplay is very simple to learn, but you do sit and strategize a little bit when it comes to the attacks you want to use and what to equip for the best results.  It is very forgiving and easy to pick up for the casual player, you can save at any point you want and there is no rush.  You can go back an unlock previous areas you've been to for more exploration or items.And of the items, there are a great many in this game.  You will find an upgadeable crafting system here based largely upon random drops from enemies and chests.  There are also some that you can buy.  Weapons and armor are all fairly unique in the things they do an attirbutes that they have.This game doesn't do anything especially new or different.  It is a comfortable and well-executed little game that you can sink hours into without realizing it has gotten dark out and you ought to make dinner or at least let the dog outside.The $12 full price is not bad, I felt it was a reasonable cost for the game.  But if you can pick it up on sale for less, I highly recommend you do if any of the above rings your bell.			"

												This latest installment in the EBF series does not disappoint. Beautiful animations, great bosses, and fantastic Limit Breaks.While at first it may seem like a cookie-cutter RPG, this Flash game has things that other RPGs fail to deliver. The characters are - admittedly lecherous - but lovable, the storyline is satirical and fun, and quite obviously, the game doesn't take itself too seriously; all the reason why this game is suited for children and teenagers alike.If you're like me, and want a challenging experience whilst chuckling at the jokes and smiling at the anime references, then EBF4 is for you. NOTE: After playing this game you most certainly will hate cats with a burning passion.			"

												One of my childhood games, on steam... imagine the excitement felt!The game is really good if you like crude humor, epic skills, and big twists in battle. It's as much stratagy as it is action. With the multitude of skills available and diffrent weapons and armor, No battle is ever the same. Any battle can go from a walk in a park to the most intense feeling of  ""oh we're srewed"" you have ever felt, just because one enemy decided to de-buff you.That being said if you dont like unreasonable amounts of damage, or instakills, or the table turning battle, and prefer a slower paced, reasonable damage, and no doubt what so ever. Try for a diffrent gsame. Otherwise give this a shot.You should try to play all the other games before this one. Because there is a bit of a story line. Rate 10/10All Hail Godcat			"

It will take 20ish hours the first time through, which gets you your money's worth.The different difficults matter quite a bit.  Easy is easy, epice requires a ton of planning and thought.

												Although it isn’t the best RPG I’ve ever played, it is still worth buying. The graphics and music for the game are both excellent. The gameplay for the battle system is really fun. There are no random encounters. The length of the game isn’t too short nor is it too long. The only problems I personally have with the game are common in most RPGs. I’m talking about grinding, backtracking, and enemies that take a long time to kill. If you are a fan of RPGs, this is certainly one you should check out.			"

												This game is a joke, being a parody of Final Fantasy,BUTIt's not a joke.Not only does this include a difficulty system that actually tells you everything major that changes (Besides things like the Bomb Slimes and Purple Squids entering battle with nine poison stacks on Epic) but the game is still reasonably difficult without putting it on Epic, unless you're so used to Epic that in your second playthrough on on a sequential save half of the enemies one-shotting you in the power plant due to you being two levels underleveled feels normal. My first experience with Epic was nearly getting killed on the first battle in the game, gg. What truly makes this game difficult is Epic is insanely hard, but you can adapt to it. You can get hit by the enemies and survive, and most things that the enemies can do aren't out of your power, unlike a lot of games you see today. It puts the player and the enemies on nearly equal ground, but manages to still keep the game reasonably difficult. That is a sign that the game's difficulty is well designed.This game contains parodic references to almost every game in the book that your childhood was composed of. My favorite cluster of references is the graveyard in Graybone Cemetery, there are many tombstones on one screen, a few of them are damaged, but the ones that aren't contain jokes that are mostly references of some sort. This is only a pinch of what is included in the actual game, though. The dialogue in this game somehow keeps a decent balance between ""Absolutely hilarious and cannot be taken seriously"" and ""Deep storyline"" despite the final boss being *SPOILER* a cat god.I think my favorite thing about the dialogue in this game is either the fact that there is a one-liner for nearly every skill in the game, or the fact that dialogue can randomly trigger when walking around the map, and these times it's at it's funniest. There is one cluster of dialogue where Lance is staring at highschoolers and Natalie calls him a pedophile. Another is a conversation between Matt and Lance where Matt seems to be trying to explain to Lance that despite all the cameras he apparently has in his posession that he uses to stalk Natalie, it's still stalking and over the top stalking at that. The items even get some of this amazing humor, every one having a one-liner for a description. Achievements even get thrown into this bucket, there is one that nearly everyone knows about for clicking Natalie's boobs.The only negative that comes to mind is the lack of an optimized full screen resolution and no access to STEAM features ingame, besides syncing, achievements, and cards. However this is understandable for a game ported from flash.There isn't much to say about art style, it's not super duper flashy, and it definitely doesn't try to be edgy. It just tries to be cartoonish, cute, and funny, as it should. I can't say much about the music, purely because music is almost never my main focus. Although I can say the music is definitely catchy and worth listening too, HFX definitely did a good job in my opinion.This game has very nice replayability too, but the story isn't really the strong suit. I personally replay for the comedy and the challenge, and I do NG+ to get gear and etc. I didn't grab the first time around. Overall, Matt deserves much more attention than he gets, but should never stop being a semi-solo developer. When you work with a lot of people and publishers, games like this are only dreams.			"

												First old school type JRPG i've played in a VERY long time, and it made me remember why I liked them so much.  Lots of options and depth to the game in terms of elements/stats/effects/gear, and the fact that you can make the 4 characters into almost any type of class you wants negates the fact that there's no real character variety.  The one real downside I will say is that the storyline and comedy really wasn't there for me.  Maybe some spots where it made me smile, but nothing resembling laughter or really funny moments.  Worth the purchase for the one play thru, plus if you like it a lot there's plenty to do after that like endless modes, marathon battles, and epic difficulty.			"

The music by HalcyonicFalconX is guaranteed to get stuck in your head too.There's a free Flash demo you can try on your favorite webgames site.

Same as the Flash game with the same name,I have been playing this game for over 17 hours offline.Pros:- Great time killer.- Gaming culture and fourth demension breaking gags everywhere.- Interesting story.- Some really odd quests...... women's underwear is a quest item.- Got me to buy and play this game after I finished the Flash version.- Great music.Cons:- Massive back track game, done somewhat well by restricting areas until the barriers are broken.- A bit grindy sometimes. Take your time and bulk up.- Music loops a bit too much in battle.- Hard to think of cons for.- Have I mentioned the back tracking? You have no idea do you?Things to know:- Most males will worship Nat, they will give all the buffs to her.- Grind before obvious bosses.- Go for normal skills over maxed out elemental skills.- Save often.Give it a go; combat wise it's better than Final Fantasy 13.

												Epic Battle Fantasy 4 is a fantastic RPG game that is very enjoyable for several reasons, of which include the large amount of customization that offers thousands of strategies, and the addition of destroying a whole lot of enemies. The aptly Battle Mountain contains battles that will test your strength, and reward you. I enjoy the series, and this installment is just about the very best so far, at least until Epic Battle Fantasy 5 comes out. If you enjoy a fun RPG game that isn't too serious, lots of ways to obliterate your foes and just a plain good time, this is the right game for you. Of course, the interface is not the easiest to navigate, and the lack of a tutorial is a bit messed-up, but before you try this game, you should try the Flash version of it, to see if you would want to spend money on it.

This game is a pleasant surprise. Good characters, funny jokes, bunch of 4th wall breaks, nonsensical conversations (in a good way) and the combat makes me want to reevaluate my stance on jrpg's.

												I honestly could not stress how much I recommend this game to RPG enthusiasts. I played the Epic Battle Fantasy series when it was just an evolving flash series (with a really fun bullet hell offshoot) on Kongregate. I loved each and every iteration, and I loved EBF4 to the point I sat down and went full nerd-out on it with writing things down, calculating, minmaxing, the whole nerd-works. I loved it enough I actually put money towards the microtransaction it had. When I heard it was coming to Steam, I was super hype for it, but I never was able to get around to snatching it. Now that I have it, i've revisited it and am having just as much fun - if not more! - than I was on Kongregate. The game itself is what I would call a tribute parody. The entire thing is self-aware of its genre, but also faithful to what it's parodying. Classic turn based combat with a rock-paper-scissors elemental / buff / debuff system, many items to equip to this end, a buttload of spells and abilities both natural to each character AND others that can be passed between each. Saving on the fly, resuming on the fly, overworld monster encounters instead of the random encounters we all are used to from classic RPGs, and those monsters tend to disappear permanently if they areb locking your main path. The scanbot allows you quick reference mid-battle to what an enemy is capable of, while also giving you a permanent bestiary entry for later reference. There are plenty of other features that really speak that an RPG enthusiast is behind the development, who has gone through the caveats and annoying nuances that many RPGs over the years have tossed at us that plenty a gamer have thrown their hands up at in rage. There is an abundance of humor, including puns, references, tropes and similar things that make fun of itself and its genre, and also referring to other games, series, memes, etc. without being overbearing and causing you to roll your eyes. tl;dr: This is an RPG made by, and for, RPG lovers, and I could honestly say you're missing out if you pass this up and are an avid player of RPGs.

												Very tight combat mechanics with a lot of interacting skills, status effects, and equipment.  The depth of customization here is stupendous.  It keeps the combat fresh and only becomes tedious near the end if you need to power-level your way up to handle the extremely formidable bosses.  Interesting characters, tons of loot, and the diverse combat mechanics keep the game engaging all the way to the end.Graphics are anime-style rendered in a flash engine.  Not exactly crysis, but it doesn't want to be, and it fits the feel of the game perfectly.The dialogue is humorous - adolescent and boob-focused, but again, this game doesn't care about that and neither should you.  It knows what it wants to be and does it great.			"

												I've been a fan of the Epic Battle Fantasy since I first found the original on Newgrounds five years ago. Seeing the series evolve as much as it has, finally reaching an actual release on Steam? It's a great sight.I've never been a fan of JRPGs, but I never found EBF to be frustratingly difficult. It requires the right enough amount of micromanagement, planning, and strategy to appeal to both casual and hardcore RPG players. It's also got a very parody-minded sense of humor that's usually quite fun and rarely runs dry. One example in it's favor is South Park: The Stick of Truth, which I did like for it's humor, but the tongue-in-cheek delivery kind of killed it for me halfway. EBF doesn't do that, and I'm glad about that.While my only real complaint would be the relative lack of backstory to cover the events of past games for those who might be new to these games, it's never so drawn out and overly complicated to not pick up on quickly. If you're looking for a new RPG to add to your library, I'd definitely make no higher recommendations.			"

So I have no quarrel towards buying the steam version to support the developer. I will agree with another that the game has a very ""flash"" feel to it though, and may not appeal to some. So try the free version on Kongregate before you decide to make the purchase. This game gets a 9/10 from me.			"

It has everything the first three game had and more! You have an extra amount of everything in this Steam version of EBF4 and that makes it worth it's $12.99 price tag. You have at least 3 playthroughs for increase replay value and you've also got EPIC mode which delivers an intense challenge for the daring and grizzled veterans of the series.

												A unique, well-thought-out RPG featuring a classic battle systesm. With 4 difficulty options that can be swapped at any time, the game has appeal to all fans of the genre, whether you're a hardcore power leveler or just rushing through the mandatory battles, the combat is simple and with many skills to level at your command, battles become more reliant on your own decisions. The dialog both in combat and in the field is witty and surprisingly well written, though some dialogues can be misplaced if missed in an earlier fight. The art in the game is fantastic - the character and enemy models are well-drawn and all have a distinct EBF artstyle. Each piece of equipment modifies the character models enabling the player to decide what their character stats will be and cool or cute they look. The story mode is fairly lengthy, taking anywhere from 15-25 hours on a normal difficulty run depending on completion and grind and features several optional challenges, with massive replayability including New Game + and Battle Island. Last but not least the music, by HalcyonicFalconX is not only great, but each piece fits amazingly with the nature of the battle or field, making the entire RPG experience phenomenal.			"

												So Captain, what's your opinion on this game?...Huh? Sorry, I was too busy playing EBF4.Anywho, EBF4 is an RPG where you control 4 characters but you only have 3 at once. That 4th character is your backup, so you're thinking ""Oh I have to take a turn to switch out and now it's going to get mulched by the enemy, great."" but nope! Totally free, just take that action and you can still attack! (You can do this multiple times as well...for fun I suppose?) That's the thing with this game, it leaves out all the bull**** (Pardon my French) and leaves all the fun, such as no random encounters. But doesn't that make the game too easy? Ha ha, no. If the game is too easy, you can easily take on the upgraded bosses in the bonus stages but the normal bosses are hard enough. Considering that I always make sure to be two levels above the current boss's level, it's easy for me but I figure if I didn't do that, it'd be a challenge. A fair challenge, but a challenge nonetheless. The game is exciting and fun to play, there's always things to look out for such as hidden items, enjoyable character banter (Your mileage may vary, obviously), and so much more. It's only 5 bucks due to the sale but if it was priced on merit, I'd say it be 40-50$, 60$ would be stretching it but for a game like this, I sure won't mind coughing up the dosh for it! "

												I've been playing these games since the very beginning, and played 4 when I was testing it on deviantart. This is by far the best one yet, even if I do miss some of the sweet equipment from 3.Very funny game, charming with a sweet array of enemies and abilities for each character, plus a fourth character that isn't in any previous game. (Not-So) Subtle references abound to various other games and anime, and the steam version adds features that even earlier versions of the same game did not have. Quite similar to the classic 90's RPG games, you'll think final fantasy primarily. And like any good Turn Based RPG, it's a thinker's game, great for those who love attention to tactics. I'd reccomend any of these games, any day, play the earlier ones for free, and drop a little cash for this one. Thumbs up~			"

												This is quite easily my favorite game.  It has a great sense of humor and pokes fun at other RPGs/anime in a lighthearted and endearing way.  There is enough to do in order to beat the game (and then again on NG + and then again on NG ++), unlock all achievements/gear, and complete the optional areas, that you will get far more than $12.00 value out of this game.  I'm more than 70 hours in, probably around 100 if you include the first time I played this game on Kongregate, and I still haven't experienced and completed everything the game has to offer.  I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys RPGs!			"

It's everything I've always loved about old school turn based JRPG, but without annoying things like random battles or save points.  The storyline is very entertaining, as are the charactars.  The ability customization system is very fun, as is the charactar equiptment system.  I haven't had this much fun playing a turn based RPG since chrono trigger came out for SNES.			"

												Going at the oft repeated ""Dollar an hour"" mantra and the normal full price, $11.99 AUD, then this game is so very worth your money.This game follows a similar vein to the older turn based Final Fantasy games, but much more forgiving to casual gamers or those who just want to crash and find something fun to play.Not sure if you'll enjoy it or if the artowrk will prove to be too annoying? Go give this game a shot on the many sites that freely (legally!) host this game online. Paying for this game adds many more hours (I estimate 10+ hours) of challenging gameplay.			"

												I've been following the Epic Battle Fantasy series for a few years now. I can safely say that each game is better than the preceding one and that Matt Roszak always delivers. The game is a turn based rpg reminiscent of a particular fantasy series. There are multiple skills, limits, summons, armor, and weapons to acquire throughout the game for the four classes(Swordsman, mage, gunner, and archer). The game features significant replay value(There are achievements for beating it multiple times after all). If you are a fan of rpg games, I'd highly recommend this to you.			"

												This is not your ordinary game. This game is fun. This game is indeed an epic fantasy of battles.This is a tale of three cities: Greenleaf, Whitefall and Goldenbrick. One day, a ranger from Greenleaf - a girl named Anna - woke up to the most horrible sight: the sacred jewel was missing. For about a year, a team made up of a pirate-samurai, his red mage female partner, an ex-Nazish gun aficando and their limbless cat had wandered the land, pilfering their way through. To be honest, this sort of unscrupulous behavior was mainly because they had defeated an elder demon the previous year, and most of the world owed them a few favors - begrudgingly, perhaps - and really didn't mind. Anna's mind instantly wandered over to this group of heroes, and set out in search of them...			"

The entire series is pretty good, but EBF4 takes the same elements from the previous games and improves on them in every way. You can play it for free on Kong, but the paid version has some extra content and it supports the devs. If you like turn-based combat with a side of cats, jigges ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°), and gr8 banter, you'll truly enjoy this gem.EBF5 pls :DEdit: Btw, the game's soundtrack is quite phenomenal.

While it isn't that complex once you actually dig beneath the surface and start playing you quickly find a well crafted turn based RPG with a lot of good mechanics and customization.

Despite my dislike of uncouth humor (and there is quite a bit of uncouth humor), I find this game to be quite enjoyable. And there is also humor that I do like, so there's that. There's more content here than you can get play in any short period of time.It's a FInal Fantasy-esque game, so if you are familiar with that, it is easy enough to figure out. Click on this, click on that, enemies get exploded/shot/sliced/arrow'd/. Level up skills with skill points. Use items. If I were to make one complaint, it would be that it doesn't have a Mac version. The dev said that it won't be happening for a while, so if you don't have a Windows computer, you might be out of luck.Matt does, in fact, like swords. Even if they aren't actually swords.			"

												I don't think I need to try and sell out the game; there are already tonnes of people doing it. However, having completed everything in the game, there is one little thing that irks me: while 2nd and 3rd quest (and maybe epic difficulty) add some replay value, it does get very boring. You do the same thing that you've done in the previous run-throughs except you keep your items etc.Also wish there was something else to do with items other than for it to be used to forge weapons and armours.It's a good game. Now get it  ya b****rd  "

												First off, my hours are not indicitave of actual playtime, I played this game largely offline, not to mention several times online.  In short, this game is amazing - great soundtrack, tactical battles, and a fun world to explore.  It will take 20ish hours the first time through, which gets you your money's worth.The different difficults matter quite a bit.  Easy is easy, epice requires a ton of planning and thought.  The humon is great, bring that flash game interenet meme vibe that existed so much in 2008.			"

												This, in my opinion is an awesome game.Nice atmosphere, the graphics soothe the eyes, and overall, the humor is just enjoyable.Now, there are people on here who would dare give negative reviews about this game, calling it childish, or just terrible, and that might just shake your decision on whether to buy this game or not.There's a solution for that: There IS a free version of this game, but it lacks a certain replayability that the premium (this one) version does. So you could go try that and decide for yourself if you want to buy this game and support the maker at the same time.Heck, or even try the prequel you can find for free online as well! Or even the rest of the series! All the way from Epic Battle Fantasy (the first one). Though the game plays more like an exploratory RPG from the third game forth.So why would you buy this game if you can play the free version online? Well, in my personal opinion, it just doesn't feel complete unless if you have the entire thing. Like the Battle Mountain, where you can test your abilities, skills, and equipment against some of the most difficult enemies in the game despite your level or difficulty. I also followed the creator's games ever since Epic Battle Fantasy 2 came out on Newgrounds and just want to support him and his works. And also I wanted to make my achievements public because I'm like that.Also you'll be a filthy casual if you don't.			"

												Every time you're hit for half your health you almost kill the enemies and you keep seeing monsters spamming moves to instantly kill all your party members while you rely on a random cat with no legs, a tank, a dog, coffee, tactics, and reviving to survive the rest of the battle. That's only a typical battle in epic mode, but this is a great game overall. you can change anything you do, whether you grind or not, use the best skills or not, upgrade your weapons or not, fight optional bosses or not. You can do almost whatever.			"

												I've been with this series since it's humble beginnings as a flash game on kongregate. As far as i'm concerned, this is one of the penultimate in turn based combat games. Between the elemental attcks, status effects, resistances and so much more, this game really makes you think about turn based battles in a whole new light. If you enjoyed paper mario, mario rpg or anything like that then I would highly recommend this game. The art style may not be to everyones liking (particularly in the overworld) but if you can get over that then the rest of the game is super fun! And good luck facing battle mountain!			"

I will probably replay this game soon on Steam.)I just wanted to say that the way farm animals are utilized in this game surpasses any other game.Harvest Moon, Stardew Valley, step aside. None of these games can match how EBF4's animals contribute to their contribution to the setting, interaction with them, and armor capability.Nominate EBF4 for the ""Best Use of a Farm Animal"" Award today to give this game the TRUE recognition it deserves.

This game is more than just a simple RPG, it's an RPG that seems to be made of the entire internet, having references to things you enjoy every day, such as memes, bacon, angry feminists, and more! Honestly the intense boss battles are just bonuses to the great humor in the game and I cannot wait for a 5th Epic Battle Fantasy.			"

												It's a very good game for it's price if you don't take it too seriously. The game is very easy (specially if you compare it to some old rpgs) but the gameplay is fun with no random encounters (you can still powerlevel by leaving the area and coming back).It has a simple UI, easy to understand and allows you to battle faster than in other turn-based rpgs.Nice crafting system, very simple but effective, only really needed to play on max difficulty (where you get most steam achievements)Don't expect too much from the storyline though.Fun game overall to spend some hours. (I'd recomend using some sort of speedhack like in most rpgs if you plan on powerleveling)			"

												Epic Battle Fantasy 4 is easily one of my most favorite games I have played. It has over 72 hours worth of game play(which is becoming more rare in newer games) and four difficulties for even further challenge. There are many skills you can learn in the game and some are character specific while some can be learned buy multiple characters to add strategy to the game. In addition to many skills, there are many different types of equipment, each with their own special effect and stats. Aside from the excellent game play, Epic Battle Fantasy 4 has great music that really sets the tone for the game in each area. Epic Battle Fantasy 4 is definetely worth the $12 since most games that have 24+ hours gameplay cost 5+ times as much. Very excited that the developer will be making an Epic Battle Fantasy 5. Will definetely buy that when it comes out.			"

Great entry point for those inexperienced in turn-based JRPGs and curious to try them out, because of it's simplicity: Everything about the game is easy to grasp and satisfying to master. The combat and customization will never get you lost and yet decisions are not entirely brainless, the exploration is rewarding and backtracking never feels like a chore, the level and grinding curve is done just right. Seasoned veterans of the RPG genre may find it too basic, and they'd be right, but even them can find something to love about this game.			"

												I've been a fan of the Epic Battle Fantasy since I first found the original on Newgrounds five years ago. Seeing the series evolve as much as it has, finally reaching an actual release on Steam? It's a great sight.I've never been a fan of JRPGs, but I never found EBF to be frustratingly difficult. It requires the right enough amount of micromanagement, planning, and strategy to appeal to both casual and hardcore RPG players. It's also got a very parody-minded sense of humor that's usually quite fun and rarely runs dry. One example in it's favor is South Park: The Stick of Truth, which I did like for it's humor, but the tongue-in-cheek delivery kind of killed it for me halfway. EBF doesn't do that, and I'm glad about that.While my only real complaint would be the relative lack of backstory to cover the events of past games for those who might be new to these games, it's never so drawn out and overly complicated to not pick up on quickly. If you're looking for a new RPG to add to your library, I'd definitely make no higher recommendations.			"

This game is more than just a simple RPG, it's an RPG that seems to be made of the entire internet, having references to things you enjoy every day, such as memes, bacon, angry feminists, and more! Honestly the intense boss battles are just bonuses to the great humor in the game and I cannot wait for a 5th Epic Battle Fantasy.			"

												I am more than happy to spend money on this game, it's overall a great game. Played it on Kongregate, got it on here. The combat is your standard turn based type, but this series is the only one that seems to do it right for me. Maybe it's the equipment system, maybe it's the way the skills are done, I don't know. I just know that it is fantastic. The story is kinda silly, and parody-ish, but it's funny and clever. For me, this game is in a similar class as Dust: AET.			"

												I've been following the Epic Battle Fantasy series for a few years now. I can safely say that each game is better than the preceding one and that Matt Roszak always delivers. The game is a turn based rpg reminiscent of a particular fantasy series. There are multiple skills, limits, summons, armor, and weapons to acquire throughout the game for the four classes(Swordsman, mage, gunner, and archer). The game features significant replay value(There are achievements for beating it multiple times after all). If you are a fan of rpg games, I'd highly recommend this to you.			"

It's everything I've always loved about old school turn based JRPG, but without annoying things like random battles or save points.  The storyline is very entertaining, as are the charactars.  The ability customization system is very fun, as is the charactar equiptment system.  I haven't had this much fun playing a turn based RPG since chrono trigger came out for SNES.			"

Go give this game a shot on the many sites that freely (legally!) host this game online. Paying for this game adds many more hours (I estimate 10+ hours) of challenging gameplay.			"

You do the same thing that you've done in the previous run-throughs except you keep your items etc.Also wish there was something else to do with items other than for it to be used to forge weapons and armours.It's a good game.

												I was looking for a game to stray away from my action RPG binge in the last few weeks. I wanted something easy to play and comedic. Epic Battle Fantasy 4 was my pick.This game concept is very interesting. It borrows a lot from the classical JRPGs of the old days, but it also adds its own flavor to the mix. The graphics are unique and are based on Flash animations, similar to lots of web games, which I loved.The dialogue, and the battle system, is filled with humor, dark humor, internet humor, memes, references to classical JRPGs, etc.This game was designed for internet-savvy audience to enjoy it. There is a lot to love about this game.I never played the previous games in this series, however, I can not wait to see what is next. I am striving to have a 100% achievement score on this one. This feeling is similar to when I used to play Pokemon, and gotta catch'em all vibe, it was tedious to do yet fun and we wanted to do it. EBF4 is definitely in that category of games. Players will not only enjoy its humor and battle system, but also will enjoy being completionists.I recommend this game to any RPG, JRPG, humor, internet, and anime fans. All of you will enjoy it.P.S.The ""Pervert"" achievement was the best!			"

												Having only played one of the prequels without even finishing it I don't feel adequate enough to write a review for it, but I will because I think it really deserves one.For being a flash game, it really does a lot of things very well. It has a bunch of content and the feel of the game and combat offers more replay value than most other games. I'm positive there's some kind of overpowered gear/party setup to be found somewhere/sometime but as far as I have seen there is the complexity where switching equipment to counteract the zones you're currently in will benefit you considerably which is great. It should not be mistaken for an easy game other than being an RPG where you can farm/outlevel zones, because the highest difficulty setting does offer quite a challenge.There's a whole lot of fun to be had with just the humorous dialogues and references to popular video games and anime culture. If that's not your thing, then you may want to seek elsewhere. The game may run a little bit slower during intense scenes where there's a lot happening on the screen (depending on your graphic settings) but other than that, the only downside I can possibly imagine is feeling a bit disconnected with the story if you haven't played the previous games.. though in my opinion, even that can be nullified because the story is quite bonkers to begin with.The game can be played for free, but the Steam version does offer a lot more extra content. Whether that's worth the price is subject to personal opinion, but I think the sheer awesomeness of the included soundtrack by the great music artist (and another personal favorite) HalcyonicFalconX definitely makes up for it.

												I recommend the entire Epic Battle Fantasy series, especially this one and Epic Battle Fantasy 3, almost solely on the wit that Matt Roszak put in these turn-based RPG games.Epic Battle Fantasy 4 introduces a new character to the party in the previous installment. It also adds even more humorous wit, clever allusions and references, and allegory that sets EBF apart from other RPGs. It plays like an RPG: you have a party; you can select which enemies on the world map to attack; you collect equipment, items (coffee to revive dead players, pizza and other foodstuffs to restore health, etc.), and gold (""chocolate coins""); and you beat bosses. Any more details would be spoilers, so play it for yourself!Play the previous games first (they're free on various online game portals) to get the story, but don't miss out on EBF4, which is too clever to pass on.

												An amazing game that proves a big budget isn't needed for many well-spent hours of fun.  It has both good gameplay, especially at higher difficulty settings, and well-written comedy embedded throughout the whole game.  The soundtrack is also quite good, and worth listening to outside of the game with it's free DLC.			"

												A ridiculously fun game that will have you clenching your fists during the tough battles that make you want to pretend you are like the hulk and punch walls. However, then you quickly realize you are human and break your knuckles. Don't worry though, the comedy and parodies galore in the game will take all that stress away and make you crack up laughing. Has very nice customization, weapons, skills, and I love how the characters react to the battle and their own new skills. This game is a walking parody with a great storyline. 10/10.

												Been a fan since you started the series way back when. Always wanted a game that pulled it all together.I'm not a huge fan of the character design (at least for humans) outside of battles, as it seems inconsistent with the rest presented. A few of the inventories could stand to be combined instead of having a separate one for equipping and upgrading. Those are the only two glaring flaws I'd noticedExcellent battles, characters, weapons, items. Oh and the art is gorgeous, staying true to the style but looking more clear and pretty than ever. Awesome game.TL;DR 10/10 would earn ""Pervert"" again.			"

												Best RPG combat system I've played in my life (have played about 40 RPGs). This game is not easy and you really have to think and understand it to play on harder difficulties (and you must min-max to win on hardest), but you can enjoy lower difficulty without much thought if you prefer to just have fun. About 50-100 hours of content. Fun and detailed art style, TONS of personality, a lot of scenario variety, and lots of humor.  I haven't had this much fun playing an RPG since I was a kid playing FFX. I cannot recommend this game highly enough. I strongly suggest you stop reading, buy this game (small file-size) and if for some reason you aren't wholly, ridiculously and entirely entertained... well, you can just refund it then (unlikely scenario).

												One of the best RPG games I have played.I had originally played the online Kongregate version way before the Steam version released. Everything from the characters to the anime references and memes are memorable. Gameplay is fair, it isn't too hard on normal, and although it is challenging to beat on Epic (very hard), it is not relentlessly so. This version also contains features that were not present in the Kongregate version, such as the Battle Mountain, as well as new pieces of equipment. The music is phenomenonal. Fitting for the scenario and masterfully made. Overall a great game.Pros: Improves upon what made the previous version better and adds more replay value. Good music. Humourous. Great difficulty. Addicting.Cons: The challenges imposed by Battle Mountain may be too rigourous for some, and that could lead to frustration (also, the final boss, lol). But other than that, I cannot seem to find any other bad things about this game.			"

												It's a fun game, made even better if you have a guide handy. I've played the others in the series too but it's not really necessary to have played them to understand this one. THe only downs I've come across is it will after some time start seriously lagging, sometimes to the point of locking up completely during particularly active battles. I have a pretty decent computer setup and even with it running on my SSD I have this problem. I would blame it on the limitations of Flash. Fortunately it auto saves each screen so when it does lock up you won't lose much progress.			"

												Let me start by saying it's definitely not worth full price, this just doesn't have enough content over the free version that's been available for years to be worth anywhere near $10. I got it for about $2.50 and at that price I heartily recommend it. Anyone who likes turn based fights like FF or Pokemon will enjoy this. The humor isn't bad although there are a lot of running jokes from the previous games, so if you're not into the series you probably won't be into this. 100% achievements in 25 hours pretty damn good for a flash game. Only downsides are some performance issues due to being flash (usually can be fixed with a restart) and low replayability once you've done everything in the game once. NG+ is more of a grind for an achievement than a chance to play around with early enemies with end game skills and gear since the enemies scale with you from start to finish.			"

												I've been a fan of the Epic Battle Fantasy since I first found the original on Newgrounds five years ago. Seeing the series evolve as much as it has, finally reaching an actual release on Steam? It's a great sight.I've never been a fan of JRPGs, but I never found EBF to be frustratingly difficult. It requires the right enough amount of micromanagement, planning, and strategy to appeal to both casual and hardcore RPG players. It's also got a very parody-minded sense of humor that's usually quite fun and rarely runs dry. One example in it's favor is South Park: The Stick of Truth, which I did like for it's humor, but the tongue-in-cheek delivery kind of killed it for me halfway. EBF doesn't do that, and I'm glad about that.While my only real complaint would be the relative lack of backstory to cover the events of past games for those who might be new to these games, it's never so drawn out and overly complicated to not pick up on quickly. If you're looking for a new RPG to add to your library, I'd definitely make no higher recommendations.			"

It constantly makes fun of the genre, the characters are animated and lovable inside and outside of combat.

												tl;dr - if you can deal with the performance problems and like JRPGs definitely worth a playthough but expect frequent disruption even on top-end systems.Pros - Good JRPG style game. Includes all the typical trope along with a unique plot (sort of - team up and save the world, JRPG style) and likeable characters. Very fun and funny game, easy to learn and a ton of stuff to do. Decent but not great controls.Cons - None with the content or gameplay. Better controls would be helpful but not a big deal. Only real issue was frequent performance problems (the reason I stopped playing). With no resource pressure game frequently lags during combat and screen transitions. Searching the web, this is a common issue. It's apparently a side effect of translating from a Flash game to an exe and the dev can't do anything about it. The issue becomes increasingly more frustrating as you advance - the longer a fight is, the more frequently you'll see framerate drops or even complete freezes that don't correlate to resource contention. Once you get into long fights (post-endgame content) it's not worth the trouble.			"

												Epic Battle Fantasy 4 is a good, even great, JRPG that nails the Final fantasy style of game in an indie package pretty damn well. First and foremost it´s extremely flashy and looks great thanks to constant lively animations, vibrant colours and a ton of variety. The combat is engaging enough to keep up the pace and as the game progresses one does need to start paying more and more attention to elemental strengths/weaknesses, though it doesn´t get overly complex at any point(at least on the first playthrough).The structure of the game carries it and exploring the world opening treasure chests, new story bits, talking to people and beating some mosnters is blast all the way through. The humour works with some stuff landing, some not but the tone is consistent and enjoyable. That said it´s worth keeping in mind that this is very much a full-blown JRPG first and a comedy-game second. Epic Battle Fantasy 4 is both proudly part of the genre and makes fun of the funny parts of it, exaclty as a good comedy-game should be.All and all I couldn´t really recommend this game more for anyone feeling like playing a solid and pretty as hell JRPG			"

												A highly polished gem that takes the older Final Fantasy battle system, and does it really right. ProsThe battle system - Highly polished. Enemies can attack in waves. Summoning done in an intelligent way that makes them significantly more useful.Incredibly enemy variety. It seems like nearly every screen in the game introduces new enemies to fight. Plenty of strategy in battlesCharacters CustomizationSecrets are littered throughout the game, if you like collecting items.The characters, although cheesy were enjoyable.ConsThe story, being a parody isn't particularly great, but it's not terrible. I think the ending was a little disappointing.Overall - I give this game a 9/10. If it were made by squeenix, or some other large company I would give it an 8.5/10. It's all around excelllent, and I really enjoyed it. And this game has cats.How can it go wrong?			"

												Epic battle fantasy 4 was actually the best game I've played all year, hands down. Balanced but challenging gameplay, witty humor and a ton of innuendoes all thrown together into one RPG is a once in a lifetime game. I really enjoyed the strategy to it, especially the weapon and armor system. In EBF4, There isnt such thing as endgame armor or weapons. Its all balanced. The sword you start out with on matt will be useful for some battles, but not all. Likewise, a shiny new sword from a hard dungeon might be great at taking out certain foes, but not much else. The same goes for the games armor. Overall I give it a 10/10, and I highly reccomend it. Easily worth the cheap price tag. To be honest I'd say it worth much more. If you like a fun engaging game with a lot of references and jokes, pick it up!			"

												A highly polished gem that takes the older Final Fantasy battle system, and does it really right. ProsThe battle system - Highly polished. Enemies can attack in waves. Summoning done in an intelligent way that makes them significantly more useful.Incredibly enemy variety. It seems like nearly every screen in the game introduces new enemies to fight. Plenty of strategy in battlesCharacters CustomizationSecrets are littered throughout the game, if you like collecting items.The characters, although cheesy were enjoyable.ConsThe story, being a parody isn't particularly great, but it's not terrible. I think the ending was a little disappointing.Overall - I give this game a 9/10. If it were made by squeenix, or some other large company I would give it an 8.5/10. It's all around excelllent, and I really enjoyed it. And this game has cats.How can it go wrong?			"

												Epic battle fantasy 4 was actually the best game I've played all year, hands down. Balanced but challenging gameplay, witty humor and a ton of innuendoes all thrown together into one RPG is a once in a lifetime game. I really enjoyed the strategy to it, especially the weapon and armor system. In EBF4, There isnt such thing as endgame armor or weapons. Its all balanced. The sword you start out with on matt will be useful for some battles, but not all. Likewise, a shiny new sword from a hard dungeon might be great at taking out certain foes, but not much else. The same goes for the games armor. Overall I give it a 10/10, and I highly reccomend it. Easily worth the cheap price tag. To be honest I'd say it worth much more. If you like a fun engaging game with a lot of references and jokes, pick it up!			"

												I've been a fan of the Epic Battle Fantasy since I first found the original on Newgrounds five years ago. Seeing the series evolve as much as it has, finally reaching an actual release on Steam? It's a great sight.I've never been a fan of JRPGs, but I never found EBF to be frustratingly difficult. It requires the right enough amount of micromanagement, planning, and strategy to appeal to both casual and hardcore RPG players. It's also got a very parody-minded sense of humor that's usually quite fun and rarely runs dry. One example in it's favor is South Park: The Stick of Truth, which I did like for it's humor, but the tongue-in-cheek delivery kind of killed it for me halfway. EBF doesn't do that, and I'm glad about that.While my only real complaint would be the relative lack of backstory to cover the events of past games for those who might be new to these games, it's never so drawn out and overly complicated to not pick up on quickly. If you're looking for a new RPG to add to your library, I'd definitely make no higher recommendations.			"

												Pros+great music+dosent take itself seriously+just the right amount of 'fan service' (you will see)+great timekillerCons-dont see much re-playability-becuase its a flash game it suffers from performance issues over long playtimes(and sometimes when loading an area), however a quick restart fixes that.overall i love this game, and if you are unsure about it EBF3 is on steam for free and a believe you can find 1 and 2 on newgrounds.(but he might add those on steam too, we'll just need to wait and see.)

												Ignore the playtime, I played the crap out of this on Kongregate. This is my favorite RPG. Very fun, well made, and high replayability (at least for me, I either beat this 4 or 5 times on Kongregate). If you're looking for a fun, turn-based RPG look no further, this game will fill that role nicely.			"

												Very fun little RPG game.  It's a bit hard to figure out what spells, stats, etc. do since I guess they expect people to have played the earlier ones.  Overall, on normal it also has spikes where you'll be barely thinking and killing battle after battle, then get completely owned in one fight or another, usually boss fights, but not always.  Still great game and the 3rd is free to play on Steam (permenently?) and if you like fairly basic light RPGs it's hard not to love this one.			"

												Epic Battle Fantasy 4 is a Fairly mindless JRPG parody. It's 45% JRPG jokes and 45% Internet memes and 10% random stuff (which could be memes I don't recognize.) The leveling system is just interactive enough to be satisfying. Your characters level linearly but they also accumulate AP to learn and level up skills however you like. Equipment can be leveled up by spending materials you collect. This might be the ideal RPG to play when you're sick.			"

												The story is silly and funny. It's full of little intenet speech and memes references.The big thing that has me recommend this game though is the combat system. It is hands down one of the single best turn based combat systems I have EVER played. I have been playing RPGs for over 20 years, hundreds of them completed. This not small praise. It's an excellent system.Unlike many RPGs, elemental effects actually matter. Ever single enemy has elemental weaknesses to take advantage of. All your weapons (bar a few non-elemental ones) have elements that deal damage of its type and buff spells of its type.The game actively encourages you to swap equipment mid-combat to take advantage of the situation. Giving yourself over 100% resistance to an element will allow you to be HEALED by that element! More than once I've had all my team with close to, if not over, 100% resistance and the normally very strong enemy deals pathetic amounts of damage.I cannot recommend this enough if you love RPGs and especially love good combat systems.

												Except for the occasional instadeath attack (which can be easily countered with a certain buff), I've actually come to appreciate this game. As you can see on the video the combat feels nostalgic as in turn-based, deals heavily with element dynamics and has a rather expansive rock paper scissors feel to it.  It wasn't an extremely long adventure but there was a bit of grinding toward the end (If you choose to leave it on hard).  I should mention I got it in a bundle, as that sweetened the deal for me a bit.			"

												tl;dr - if you can deal with the performance problems and like JRPGs definitely worth a playthough but expect frequent disruption even on top-end systems.Pros - Good JRPG style game. Includes all the typical trope along with a unique plot (sort of - team up and save the world, JRPG style) and likeable characters. Very fun and funny game, easy to learn and a ton of stuff to do. Decent but not great controls.Cons - None with the content or gameplay. Better controls would be helpful but not a big deal. Only real issue was frequent performance problems (the reason I stopped playing). With no resource pressure game frequently lags during combat and screen transitions. Searching the web, this is a common issue. It's apparently a side effect of translating from a Flash game to an exe and the dev can't do anything about it. The issue becomes increasingly more frustrating as you advance - the longer a fight is, the more frequently you'll see framerate drops or even complete freezes that don't correlate to resource contention. Once you get into long fights (post-endgame content) it's not worth the trouble.			"

												This is a very fun indie RPG.  It's light hearted, cheeky dialogue and enemies are very memorable and endearing.  I've played it through 4 full times and haven't gotten sick of it yet.Pros:- The music is unbelievably good.  Phyrnna (the composer) is up there with the best in the business.  While the game is great, the single most impressive aspect is the music.- The underlying battle system is very well balanced and expansive.  Tons of skills, summons, items, weapons, variety and it also works well.  You don't find yourself having to rely on the same tactic over and over.  Different enemies require different tactics.- The dialogue is really enjoyable.  Many, many hilarious lines in this game.- Nice variety of achievements to add replay value.- Characters have strong personalities and are very unique.  Quite memorable.- Puzzles are fun, not too common and well designed.- The game itself is nicely designed and does a good job of rewarding you for searching for secrets (hidden treasures and stuff, nothing super important)Cons:- Can feel a bit grindy at times especially when you get to the battles that have 3 waves.  Fortunately amazing music is there to take the edge off.- Not enough reason to utilize your 4th character.  It's too easy to just park Lance in the back up slot and never use him.  He's a fun character, but Anna is the better support character since she has access to the party defense up and reflex up buffs.  Lance just can't keep up with her and thus gets overlooked for important battles.Overall:This is unquestionably a fun, well made game.  The game knows what it is trying to be and pulls it off extraordinarily well.  Kupo Games is a one man, independent studio who puts out high quality games at good prices.  For the price, this game is a no brainer.  I couldn't recommend it more strongly!			"
