												Our Darker Purpose has had the unfortunate luck of existing in a world that has already experienced The Binding of Isaac and will be forcibly labeled as a pretender and compared to that game until the end of time. Let it be known that looks are quite deceiving, and Our Darker Purpose's resemblance to Edmund McMillan's indie blockbuster begins and ends with the top-down, twin-stick shooter appearance that both share. Where The Binding of Isaac is a fast-paced, almost bullet-hell game, Our Darker Purpose is much less about quick reflexes and more about patience and planning. You will never achieve Isaac levels of speed and destructiveness in this game, because that isn't the point or the core of its challenge. This game is about endurance and taking in the world around you. There are times I've felt more engaged by Our Darker Purpose's gameplay than Isaac's simply because it is a more demanding game. If Isaac is about reflexes and becoming mighty, then Our Darker Purpose is about staying two steps ahead of the game, because once you perform any action, you are committed to it. The game features a wonderful art direction and soundtrack that blends together into a beautifully gothic piece of design that I fell in love with from the first trailer I watched. There is a detailed lore and story woven throughout this game that is surprisingly esoteric and adds a flavor of mystery to this pleasantly Dark little journey. Similar to the original Dark Souls, the different elements of this game support each other in such a way that were any one of them removed or altered, the entire game would lose its unique atmosphere. Long story short: Don't go into this game expecting anything similar to The Binding of Isaac. It isn't a copycat just because it bears some surface level similarities. If you allow yourself to approach this game on its own terms, you will find a unique game whose world is enchanting and challenging in its own right.			"

												People will compare this to The Binding of Isaac, and they aren't wrong in doing so. They are both very similar, and yet play very differently.The similarities follow: Twin stick top-down-ish shooter. Procedurally generated levels. Items to pick up which improve your character. Bosses at the end of levels.That is where most of the similarities stop however, and the games become very different.The Binding of IsaacOur Darker PurposeCompletely new run every time.Fast-paced and ""bullet-hell""-ish.Massively powerful pickups allowing godly powerful characters.Minimal mechanics to keep track of for the average player.Simple heart-based health system.Cartoony semi-cute art style.Traps are a minute threat, especially late game.Certain things can persist between runs allowing for a slightly better character each time.Relatively slower paced but hugely more stategic. There is no run-n-gun strategy.Pickups allow for slightly to moderately better characters. Additionally, there is a leveling system that offers you a choice of two ""upgrades"" neither usually being too powerful.Several mechanics to keep track of. Enemies are tricky to deal with even after practice. More mechanics with the character as well, including a rolling ""dodge"".Point-based health system, with varying damage from different sources.Darker Tim Burton-esque art style, making the game feel dark, empty, and abandoned.Traps are an ever-present threat, and just as deadly as the enemies.In conclusion, The Binding of Isaac and Our Darker Purpose are both great rougue-like twinsticks, however, they are pitched very differently. The Binding of Isaac is made to make you feel powerful, yet fragile, while Our Darker Purpose makes you feel weak and alone, trying to survive, while also being relatively sturdy.			"

												Great game, very enjoyable, a lot of depth and some interesting lore. Add to that a fantastic sound track and appealing visuals and there's really not much to ask for.If you enjoyed The Binding of Isaac, you'll enjoy this as well. And there's less poop, so that's always a plus.			"

												Our Darker Purpose is a gorgeous game in many ways. The way the story and setting is drip-fed to you via talking desks or boss descriptions allows you to engage with it or get on with the gameplay itself, and the writing manages to be funny without being cringe-worthy. The music is also truly amazing, perhaps the best I've heard in any indie game.I find the gameplay particularly engaging as well. On the surface it does hug closely to Binding of Isaac gameplay, with randomised rooms, unlockable items and locations, starting over when you die etc. But it does go beyond that. The emphasis on choice over randomness is far more evident in ODP: Each time you level up you choose between two perks that may boost your attack or survivabilty in some way (life leech, attack speed, or some more exotic perks), and you unlock lessons that you can equip before a play-through that can have a dramatic effect on your gameplay. You can also choose which floor to enter after a boss battle, and each floor may have different enemies or modifiers to them (enemies will drop more juice boxes, won't have champion enemies, you and the enemy will take more damage etc.)These elements allow for less of a feeling that the RNG was against you, and more that if you die you messed up in some way. It also means that even if you are having trouble, you may unlock lessons that will help you in the future, so there is always a small sense of progression without making the early levels feel trivial.One downside to the game is that earlier areas can feel repetitive, as there is a smaller set of potential enemies and items that you will encounter. Earlier levels can also look a little too grey for my liking. It also isn't clear how to unlock each of the lessons - something I find frustrating but other people may enjoy discovering the unknown.Over all its a good game to play for several hours in a row or just half an hour, and its easy to sink at least 30 hours into the game (for those who care about replayability). And the music is to die for - that cannot be said enough!			"

This review will hopefully bust the myth that Our Darker Purpose is a cheap copy of Binding of Isaac:  This game deserves so much more attention! I can't think of many reasons why anyone would dislike it, except maybe its difficulty. One thing that might be putting people off is the game's seeming similarity to Binding of Isaac, which is understandable, but very superficial. I played the hell out of Binding of Isaac. I finished both the original and the remake with all their DLCs on 100%. It's got a very special place in my heart. But I would never say Our Darker Purpose is a cheap copy of it. It's very much a game of its own. Besides belonging in the same game category as Isaac, it's not affected or derived from it in any way. There are indie games out there that downright copy Isaac and use the word 'homage' as an excuse for their lack of creativity. And creativity is something any sane person can't deny this game has. The gothic/Burtonesque art style is so neat and polished, it almost tops the phenomenal orchestral soundtrack, which is probably the thing I loved most about this game. It's unheard of amongst indie games. Yes, Binding of Isaac had addictive tunes, but it's like comparing the Looney Tunes theme to Star Wars. Both are addictive, but only one is epic and blows your mind. Too bad you can't truly enjoy it, until you reach higher floors. From the little background I could find, the music is made by an experienced composer who writes scores for famous TV shows. Big thumbs up to the devs for getting him on board! One thing I shouldn't forget when mentioning creativity is the story. While I love the art style of Binding of Isaac, I've always felt it lacks a deeper concept, yet alone a story. It's gore-ish and grotesque, but somehow bland. This game has such a dark, depressive and deep story, it actually feels like playing a game based on a novel. Have you ever read through the Harry Potter books and thought the last book was dark and depressing compared to the first ones? Well imagine the same leap, but use the last book as a starting point. The gameplay itself is much less fast paced, bullet-hellish and much more about strategy. Where Isaac relies on reflexes and synerging good items, ODP is much more about the learning curve, which is very distinguishable and steep. Every time you play, you get at least one step further. Also there's almost no grinding involved, which in my opinion is a good thing. Sure, there are better items unlocked by finishing challenges, but they aren't essential for a succesful playthrough. Each time you finish a floor, you get to choose between 2-4 ways to continue. There are different sets/clans of enemies on each floor type and random floor traits you get to choose from. Usually floors with the more rewarding traits (e.g. higher loot rate) have more difficult enemy sets. You also level up during every run and gain perks in the process. Another thing I really appreciate is that ODP, unlike Isaac, isn't locked to 60 FPS (let alone 30), so I can fully enjoy it on my 120hz screen.I never really loved bossfights in Binding of Isaac. Most of them feel the same and instead of finding a strategy and/or weak spots, you just have to keep dealing massive damage and dodge projectiles. Bosses in Our Darker Purpose remind me more of Dark Souls / Titan Souls. There's a total of 24 bossfights and each one of them is smart, unique and requires a different approach. For example there's a bossfight inside a maze with an enemy that randomly teleports every 10 seconds. There's a slow trail of fire behind you and floating projectiles that reduce your movement speed on hit (to an eventual zero), so if you aren't careful enough, you get too slow and either burn or can't keep up with the boss anymore. I don't want to spoil too much, but there's even a boss involving a little game of chess!   All in all this game is very though-through and if it had half the support and fanbase Binding of Isaac has, it could be legendary. I can't wait for another game by the same developer and I'll do my best to spread the word about it, so it doesn't die off.______________________Summary/TLDR: This isn't a Binding of Isaac clone! It's a very creative game of its own, that does many things different and lots of them even better! Don't get discouraged by the few superficial similarities and its rather high difficulty. Visually, musically and even story-wise it's a piece of art! I'm a roguelike games lover and this is game is one of my favorites. Its bossfights remind me of Dark Souls/Titan Souls. Give this hidden gem a chance, it deserves it!9/10!			"

												This game is getting a lot of crap for being too close to Binding of Isaac. To be fair, it does resemble Binding of Isaac a lot, a keyboard, top-down shooter with accumulation of items and perks. The mechanics differ enough to give this game an entirely differnet backbone, though, and let it be said that Avidly Wild games did not rip off Edmund Macmillan in any way, shape, or form.That being said, though this gives some pretty good Binding of Isaac type gameplay, whether it helps the addicts who are weaning themselves off that famous game remains to be seen. Our Darker Purpose's art style is, in my humble opinion, far more beautiful and intriguing than Isaac's quirky and humorous one, and the music in this game is subtle yet stellar, offering a nice, edgy background to the game's ominous atmosphere.The lore in Our Darker Purpose is uniquely amazing. Binding of Isaac came with tons of items and an allegory within a story, but it's story is hardly as good, interesting, or compelling as that found in Our Darker Purpose. Many words went into the lore of this game and for that, Avidly Wild, I applaud you. Cordy is a character one can sympathize for, have fun with, and imagine a backstory for in the dark orphanage she lives in. The fragments about bosses, items, and Edgewood are equally fun to read, and all offer a dark humor that is quite well done. Our Darker Purpose adds more choice than Isaac as well. Isaac's customization had two options: yes or no. You took the item, or you didn't. In this game, the perks and items are a bit more varied and a bit more easier to alter. Arguably, Our Darker Purpose is more user-friendly and easier in that sense. The wiggle room allowed by its choice of perks upon level up and its item stores allow one to build up Cordy in a more specific and designed manner than Binding of Isaac.Now that I've said everything it has over Binding of Isaac, let me warn you about what NOT to expect from this game. Many people fell in love with the sobbing little boy sitting on poop because of the game's learning curve and skill requirements. You had to be fast on your fingers, or else the unforgiving monsters of the basement would get you. In Our Darker Purpose, however, speed and reaction time is less important. Cordy, though she moves smoothly as of the most recent update, will never hit the speed of Isaac with speed-ups, Wooden Spoon, and the Belt. Though this might seem like it makes the game easier, the enemies in this game are far more advanced, difficult, and tankier than those in Binding of Isaac. This game prioritizes thought over reaction time, and you'll find yourself frustrated not because you didn't tap down fast enough, but because you didn't think to roll at the right time.TL;DR: Our Darker Purpose has the same surface mechanics as Binding of Isaac, but a deeper story, fresh graphics, and an entirely new item customization system. While it will never replace the mad speed dashing and the crazy bullet and fly frenzies in Binding of Isaac, it offers a new dimension of thought and planning while in the midst of combat. It is definitely worth looking at and getting if the abovementioned bonuses are attractive.			"

												Our Darker Purpose has so much potential - the art style is gothic and frequently impressive, the lore of the Edgewood Orphanage setting is rich, and it has a few unique mechanics in terms of incremental buffs tied in with a leveling system. And it squanders it all. Our Darker Purpose aspires to be the next Binding of Isaac - it's a top down, twin-stick, rogue-lite with an exhausting array of usable and passive items. But it's worse in every way, and three times more expensive to boot. I couldn't even fathom pouring more than 10 hours into this game, let alone the 100 hours Isaac can satisfy. What it comes down to is gameplay. Signs of sloppy design are on display almost by the minute. The hitboxes of enemies are incomprehensible and your pathetic, pixel-size shots pass through even the largest of bosses for no discernible reason. Movement is imprecise and, without rolling everywhere, is slow and clunky. Everything takes far too much damage before it dies and deals far too much damage, each creature doubling in strength, HP and defense after every level, as opposed to the strict rules governing monster types in Isaac. Difficulty is never an issue if it's fair, but the poor design choices present the challenge as cruelly unfair. A player's skill will never be able to respond to impossible to dodge hazards that appear the instant a player enters a room, or the awkward placement of innumerable indecipherable objects that block player projectiles and obstruct any sense of movement.In the end, the greatest crime Our Darker Purpose commits is an obvious empty ploy to prolong the length of its campaign. Rather than implement as large an array of items as Isaac or Risk of Rain, encouraging a sense of discovery and experimentation, a lazily implemented upgrade system built around earning 'credits' in a poorly designed menu sets positive bonuses for the next run. A next run that you won't want to make.			"

												I love The Binding of Isaac. I love roguelikes, I love twin-stick shooters, and I love that bizarre crossing of dark and cute. I mention this because it's impossible to review Our Darker Purpose without bringing up BoI at almost every turn. The gameplay, the progression, the enemies, the items, even the aesthetic are all heavily informed by Isaac, and while there are some interesting tweaks to the formula, they come at a cost.ODP poses you as a wayward resident at the Edgewood Home for Lost Children, a mix of orphanage, asylum, and Hogwarts. Within its randomly-generated halls you will meet all manner of disturbed students, monstrous school supplies, and debris. While the first two are interesting and varied in their Tim Burntony designs, the debris and traps are the only features of the rooms, lending them much less variety than the maps in Binding. Levels themselves can have random attributes, though, like lower light (+light radius is a thing again!), extra healing items, or more damage.Items can be found in rare chests, from defeating rare minibosses, or buying them from vending machines. They come far less frequently than BoI items and have far smaller effects on gameplay, usually providing a random chance for an effect or a very corner case bonus. Your main method of progression is earning EXP from kills, leveling up, and picking one perk from a randomized pair. The game definitely has a stronger RPG vibe than you-know-what, with full stats for your character, critical hits, dodge chance, and so on. It adds a bit of complexity but also dilutes some of the raw appeal of combat and simple progression.Hopefully by now you're recognizing the trend that Our Darker Purpose follows. Everything it does in deference to Binding of Isaac is done in half-measures, never quite meeting the quality of the originator. The look is interesting and more detailed, but lacks weight and impact. The progression is more complex, but never gets as creative. The sound design is also rather off, reusing many effects and missing some key feedback cues. Worst of all, though, is the uneven difficulty. Some rooms and bosses will just absolutely wreck you in ways the progression may not account for, ending otherwise promising runs in pretty sour ways. There's an overarching progression system with more perks to unlock, but it looks to take ages to get anything particularly interesting, if it even exists.It's not a bad game by any stretch, just one that never lives up to the example set for it. If you've burned out on Binding of Isaac it's worth a try, and fans of the look or the RPG progression may even find it more engrossing.			"

												There are definitely things to like in Our Darker Purpose. It has great atmosphere backed up by a great art style and music. Everything is functional, but the more I played, the more one thought kept coming back: ""The Binding of Isaac did this better.""Our Darker Purpose plays very similarly to Binding of Isaac, but just about everything it does, Isaac does better. Isaac has more variety of powerups and enemies. Isaac has a deeper and more interesting resource management system. Our Darker Purpose is much more focussed on the moment-to-moment combat then big picture balancing of resources. There are no keys, and your ""bombs"" are used exclusively for fighting. Most upgrades offer only numerical stat increases. The actual gameplay, however, has different ideas. Hit detection is awkward, enemies and hazards are more annoying or frustrating than interesting, and for all the focus on numerical upgrades, you never really feel more powerful than when you start. Isaac had it's share of numerical upgrades, but on any given run, you were bound to find at least one item that fundamentally changed how you approached the rest of the game. Each run felt different and unique. Each run of Our Darker Purpose just feels the same, but with the numbers shuffled around a bit.At the end of the day, if you spend all your time with a game thinking about a different, better game, then that's not a very good sign for the game you're playing. If you've completed everything in The Binding of Isaac and really need something similar to hold you over until the remake, you'll get some enjoyment out of Our Darker Purpose. To everyone else, I cannot recommend this game as long as The Binding of Isaac exists.			"

												The game blends the twin-stick shooter style like Binding of Isaac or SMASH TV with an artistic style similar to Don't Starve into something great with a dark theme.You take on the role of Cordy.  The only girl that, of all the students that grouped up with her, survived being killed by two other groups: the strong, and the charming.  Now it's up to her to fight these students with the power of her voice in order to find out Edgewood's dark purpose.Dying in this game isn't the end.  Nor is winning in some cases.  The floors you complete in this game grants credits.  These are used to unlock classes, most of which are locked and have to be gained by completing an achievement, or by donating to the counselor which gives added perks like an extra juice box.The music blends with the game well.  The childish, yet dark, feeling of the music complements the game in a way that gives you the feeling that you are in the game.The thing about this game is that traversing through Edgewood can be lengthy if you end up having a good run.  For example: My videos of this game can take about a half-hour to an hour depending on how far I've reached and it takes about an hour or more to reach the second big boss of this game.Regardless, this game can keep you occupied with how deep Edgewood is.

												""Our Darker Purpose"" is a stew composed of ""Binding of Isaac""'s  gameplay, a ""Don't Starve"" art style, and an atmosphere similar to Tim Burton's earlier movies. Whenever I start it up, I feel like I am playing an extension of ""Coraline.""If you have played ""Binding of Isaac,"" you will feel at home. If not, do not fret. This is an isometric roguelike game. You start off as a weak Cordy, throwing tiny fireballs at malformed students. You progress through levels, picking up items, until you either die and start over, or beat a chapter and repeat the process, having unlocked another section of the towering orphanage. By the end, you feel powerful, even though you will only have a maximum of two active attacks (your basic fireball and an on-use item). This game is tough. Even if you are extremely skilled at dodging enemy attacks, you will likely fail or take a very long time to win. Your victory depends on getting the right item drops and the right upgrades when you level up. However, there is a permanent upgrade system, where you spend credits earned after beating levels. Along with that, new items are unlocked, for accomplishing ingame achievements. This gives ""Our Darker Purpose"" heaps of replay value, and there is even a hard mode that can be unlocked, for those interested in an even bigger challenge.There are some balance issues in the game, mainly with bosses. Some bosses feel like they have just the right amount of health, and others, mainly at the middle sections of the game, have way too much health and on-screen attacks *cough Time Keeper cough stationary plant boss that I cannot remember the name of* going on. If you get lucky with items, they are not too bad, but even then, these bosses will take quite some time to down. End-game enemies also take a lot of hits, depending on your build. By itself, this would not be an issue. These enemies, however, are usually jammed together in rooms full of hazards, causing some mild annoyance with the amount of kiting that has to be done.The game is, as a whole, fantastic. The developers have given it several sizable updates, and it looks like it will get even more. It is very polished, with anti-crash measures put in place. It even has a borderless window mode (!!!). Help support these developers, and buy this game.			"

												In normal games, you get frustrated by dying and re-playing it from the begining. In this game, however, you will die and fail time and time again, and you still eagerly try to beat it again, since you are able to keep a little something from each attempt, witch you can use to have edge in the next attempts to come.You learn by trying and dying.Setting is also nice, you will never see the same levels no matter how many times you re-try, boss batttles are fun, not to mention decent amount of weird items with even weirder descriptions, that will give you a fair insight into game lore.This game is 300mb of awesomeness.

												Let me start off by saying that while I enjoyed this game for a while, I found it lacking. Most of the items found during runs don't greatly change the way the game is played. There will be a lot of ""+10% damage"" or ""+15% speed"" items that don't feel terribly rewarding to get. This makes every run feel very similar. The rolling is a nice mechanic. One of the things that bothered me the most was the hit boxes, both on myself and the enemies. While the sprites are cute, they often cover more area than the unit actually occupies, leading to a blurred line as to where the enemy can be hit and will contact you, or not. It's not altogether a bad game, it's just that for a game that requires many many runs to progress through, it seldom left me wanting to try again			"

												People who like Binding of Isaac and similar games will love Our Darker Purpose. The game has its own, beautiful hand-drawn art style and lots of interesting items and enemies. It is also quite hard (took me 22 hours until I've finally been able to beat the final boss). Every playthrough is different, and as you aquire different items each time you'll also have to play very different each time. You will die often when starting to play Our Darker Purpose. But that doesn't matter, because with every achievement you get you'll also unlock classes, which are permament and can be chosen as you like.The only downside to this game are the strange controller keybinds. The inventory and log, for example, are both on the right analog stick, as is the ""use"" button. It's also not possible to change this keybinds, which is a bit sad. However, this is just a small problem and the rest of the game more than makes up for it.			"

Posted: January 29, 2014
												This game shows a great deal of promise and has some interesting mechanics that could potentially provide a nice change of pace compared to other games in the genre.The problem, at least in its current state (review written at launch) is that it really doesn't stand up well in comparison to obvious influences like Binding of Isaac. I will list some of the issues I have with the game at launch, some may sound minor but have a very real impact on the way the game is played.-- movement speed --The starting character (there may be others to unlock) is woefully sluggish. This slow movement combined with much-quicker-than-you enemy projectiles and othewrwise acceptable mechanics like your momentum affecting your own projectiles can lead to frustrating and needlessly tiresome encounters.There are a number of perks available at level up that profess to increase movement speed, these are either completely incorrect in their supposed effect or the gains are far too minimal as even after taking more than one such perk there is never any noticable increase in your movement speed.The interesting thing is the roll mechanic which acts as a little boost to evade enemies, the inclusion of which would have been unnecessary if the overall movement wasn't so awful. What I'm curious about is whether the roll was added to compensate for the overly slow base movement speed or whether the base movement speed was deliberately made that slow so as to make the planned roll mechanic relevant and useful.-- hitboxes / collision detection --The hitboxes on both the player character and some enemies is, in my opinion, a little off. I suppose the issue here is that the hitbox on the player character is a little too big, a hit is registered even though your character sprite wasn't contacted by the projectile, environmental effect, etc etc. It's true that with continued play you would probably adapt to this slightly too big hit box and learn to compensate but you shouldn't have to, a game like this needs a reliable, accurate and finely tuned hit detection system. In contrast, enemy hit boxes seem, at times, bafflingly arbitrary and with zero reference to their character sprites. More than once I've seen a projectile pass straight though an enemy without registering a hit, only for the next projectile on the same trajectory to instead register a successful hit. Again, this type of game thrives on tight, accurate hit detection, which at present, just isnt here.A lesser issue is with collision detection on environmental objects. This could well be tied to the above issue of your slightly oversized hit box but occasionally you do get stuck on environmental objects, even though it looks as though there is room enough to get by.-- pacing -- This is more of a personal one but I really feel the pacing of the game needs to be addressed, both in terms of character progression and item acquisition. In short, leveling up seems to take a little too long. Combined with the...underwhelming, shall we say, perks that you get on level up, this makes the whole level system seem honestly quite redundant. I never once found myself pleased, excited or glad to have levelled up, it just doesn't feel like much of a reward.Item acquisition is probably a bigger issue, more specifically WHEN you get items. This game lists Binding of Isaac as one influencing game and it really shows. In Isaac however, there is a reliable and reasonable pacing to item acquisition. By and large each floor has one item room and an item from the boss room. There's no guarantee either one will be any good but at least there are reliably (keys allowing), AT LEAST two items per floor. This game does not have item rooms on each floor nor does it provide items as rewards after boss fights. In fact your most reliable source of items are the occasional mini-boss enemies (like elites from Diablo). These enemies are fairly few and far between however, you MIGHT find one per floor and some floors don't have any by design. This means you end up with very few items and the majority of itemsa you do find are unremarkable. I'm being quite generous when I say unremarkable by the way.I should note you can get items from vending machines but most are limited use and almost all are more than you can afford given the relative scarcity of money.All in all, despite how critical you may feel I've been, I really do think this game has potential and there are some things to enjoy here but there are more things that I feel need to be addressed by the developer before this game can really be recommended.In short, if you want to play an enjoyable but challanging twin stick shooter with tight controls and good pacing, play Binding of Isaac. It's pretty much all this game aspires to be and is considerably cheaper to boot.			"

												Our Darker Purpose is essentially a bullet Hell rogue-like with a passive, persistent upgrade system.  I do like the game but right now, I cannot recommend it for the simple reason it needs more time to bake.  Currently, my two major issues with the game are gameplay and balance.  The game lacks a decent reward system.  Your character starts off weak and stays weak throughout the game.  You can earn experience, level up, and get 1 of 2 perks.  Unfortunately, some of the perks are completely worthless (for example, -10% move speed for +2 healing pack capacity.) while others offer such a negligble benefit you can hardly tell they are there (+50% drop rate to items.)  You do find gear that can be useful but a lot of them don't work on bosses, others are broken, and some are so poorly implemented they do not make sense (2% health per 5 enemies killed. Worthless when you have around 100 life on average; why bother?).  Health, coins, and chalk (bombs essentially) drop in the game at a pathetic rate, leaving players scrambling for health.  I have had several runs where healing packs don't even drop.  You can buy items at vending machines but you cannot rely on them for survivability for long.  Lastly, you can donate credits (which you earn by completing levels) to unlock lasting benefits called ""lessons"" or donate to a counselor for passive, persistent upgrades.  You can only carry so many lessons and you only get more by donating to the counselor.  Unfortunately, you are forced to waste thousands of credits on the counselor and you only get upgrades every other level.  So while it is great to get +2 health pack capacity, it really sucks wasting 500 credits and being told the counselor was ""expecting more.""  I get the purpose behind it but since you get so few credits per level, it's insulting more than anything.The enemy balance right now is all over the place.  Most are fine the way they are while a few are ridiculously cheap (firing homing clouds that phase through everything and confuse you [interesting bug with that; if you exit to the menu while confused, the menu controls are inverted]).  Enemy strength scales with level so you take more damage while having very little way to heal yourself due to the aforementioned awful drop rates.  Bosses are incredbily tedious due to how long fights last.  If boss health was shaved 20%, I think the balance would be right.  Currently, all you get for defeating bosses is decent amount of experience and progression to the next level.As to the graphics, I greatly enjoy the grim feel of the game.  The music is appropriate and the sound effects are adequate.  Due to the lack of balance at this point, I cannot recommend it.  I enjoy hard games.  I have spent way more time than I should in Binding of Issac and Dark Souls.  Those games offered a sense of accomplishment when you defeated a hard enemy.  Our Darker Purpose offers little for anything you accomplish.  That said, I would watch the progression of the game.  The developers are working hard and constantly updating the game.  I believe when all is said and done, Our Darker Purpose will be a great product.			"

												As I discovered Our Darker Purpose in the Steam Store I was really happy. I was always interested in the ""Binding of Isaac""-like gameplay but I just couldn't get over its special art direction. While Our Darker Purpose has an equally special art direction I like it personally a lot more. The goth design of the whole game works very well with its Lore and is interesting to watch.As for the gameplay: The game begins with Cordy awakening after surviving the attack of her co-students. Your goal is to reach the highest floor (there are twelve in total) of the  Edgewood Home for Lost Children. Every floor consists of multiple rooms (taken from a pool of predefined rooms) which will be arranged in a random order. Everytime you enter a new room you have to kill all enemies inside to unlock the doors to the connected rooms. In order to ascend to the next floor you have to beat one of the many floor bosses. At floor 4, 7 and 11 you will always meet the same boss since they are story-based encounters. While playing you will die a lot and everytime you die you have to start anew from floor 1. The same happens the FIRST time you beat any of the story bosses. To help you in your quest to reach the top of the building there are several ways to get stronger:- On every floor you can find items either in chests, dropped by a champion (a stronger version of a normal enemy) or buyable in a vending machine with collected coins. They range from giving you an additional attack like bubbles or to slowing down enemies or reducing damage when hit. What items you get is random so there is a certain amount of luck involved in the game. Atleast at the vending machines you have some choice.- For killing enemies you get experience and so you can level up. Every level up you have to choose between two randomly chosen perks so have the possibility to adjust them to your playstyle or your found items.- In the process of the games you will earn (for example by unlocking the in-game achievements) different lessons and a number of periods needed to ""equip"" those lessons. This is the part you have to choose between two game sessions and where you have the largest influence on your own playstyle.So as you see there is a lot of luck and random elements to assure replay value but also the possibilty for some own choices to adjust the game to your liking.For the story: Genre typical it appears rather easy, has an interesting lore and another story hidden behind the surface. Take your time and find it yourself.For the graphical and musical aspects: As stated before I really like the goth-like art style. The whole game fits nicely together and doesn't make a difference between high and low end pcs. The music fits the game nicely, most time more eerie and for the boss fights  more action orientated. If you find yourself liking the game I can only recommand to buy the available OST.All in all ""Our Darker Purpose"" is a very recommandable game with a lot of replay value, an interesting art style, good music and a challenge for every skilled and/or patient gamer. As a special side note: The developers still update the game irregularly and try to give their customers the best experience possible. You can check this out in the update section yourself (Edit: It seems that there are no longer updates but the game is working and has a lot of content).PS: If you have questions just post them and I'll try to get back at them as fast as possible.PPS: If you want some more infos and you don't care for the obvious spoilers then I have here a guide showing and describing everyone of the 25 bosses of the game:

												Appealing art style, fantastic soundtrack, and overall an atmosphere I find much more interesting than Binding of Issac, which is the first thing all people compare it to.Some quick things to note: You only have 4-directional shooting. If you're shooting while strafing, the shot will fire at an angle, also requiring precise movement while shooting.Hitboxes are odd, but you get used to them after a while.Your character isn't very mobile unless you utilize the dodge mechanic, so remember to use it in combat.It's very expensive for what it is. It's on Humble Bundle right now, so I'd recommend getting it there.Where the balls is the soundtrack!?Got the Touhou flowing through my veins a few times.Ultimately, though, this review is coming from someone who has never played Risk of Rain, Binding of Issac, or any other games people compare it to. But this is because it's the first that I looked at that just from the screenshots and description, it grabbed a lot more of my attention.I'll check out Binding of Issac when the rerelease comes out.

												this game is similar to binding of isaac but it is not a rip-off of binding of isaac. The game has gothic atmosphere and tone. it has a great replay value and its hard(very hard). The game has a mystery that you need to discover and figure out what happened. Every life is a completely different which makes the replay value much more better. Unlike Binding of isaac you have to understand the enemies, because every approach to an enemy is different, the bosses have different types of attack and unlike binding of isaac where you have to just dodge and attack them, here you have to figure out every move of every boss, so unlike TBOI the bosses kind of remind bosses from dark souls. After you beat the game you unlock its hard mode which gives everyone new attack move(as if the game wasn hard at first).Overall its a hard game but its very addictive that doesnt forgive mistakes.9\10			"

												I must admit, when I first heard about this game I imediately thought it was a Binding of Isaac clone. It has a similar structure, and a lot familiar feelings associated with it. However this game plays a lot differently to BoI. The story is interesting, and has me really interested to find out what will happen. The patterns of monsters are frustrating at first(like BoI) but you will eventually get the hand of it and when in critical danger you can roll to move away faster. That ability alone makes this game a lot different to BoI. All in all I would recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of roguelikes. The items are really neat to explore and use, and the lessons are a nice add-on, as well as the counselor system.Still a fun game but hasn't recieved an update in quite some time.			"

												Describing Our Darker Purpose as ""The Binding of Isaac, but all Tim Burtoned up"" would probably be fairly accurate at first glance.Its basically a rogue-lite twin-stick shooter, the same way Isaac is, with a similar difficulty level, but a few odd design choices which make it over difficult.Most notable is the lack of 8 way control on where you shoot - you're limited to 4 directions for shooting, but 8 for movement, which is odd. Isaac has similar limitations, but thats due it's heritage as a flash game, and its tileset based environments and level design account for that, but not so here.Add to that things like odd hitboxes, clunky movement, a sound menu which doesn't actually show what you have selected, and seemingly randomly set difficulty don't help, either.I'd recommended it, but not at the current price (around $15) when there are better alternatives - probably worth picking up cheap in a bundle though.

												I'm not gonna write about the good stuff in this game, 'cause there is no point. You MUST try it out. You like The Binding of Isaac? You will like this. You didn't like TBoI? You WILL like this, 'cause it's so same, but so different. What can make it better?Steam achievements. Or at least in-game achievements, but all of them, not just the ones about the bosses. We want to know what do we unlock when we get an achievement. That's what kept me going in TBoI.More items/upgrades. I just got to chapter 2 and there is not much items/upgrades when you levelup for now and that's the first thing that was driving me to play Isaac in the first place.And there's no menstruating ♥♥♥♥♥♥s attacking you.So, basically, what I want is more variety in items, especially the ones that can change my ""weapon"", like lasers, bombs and new tears in TBoI and list of achievements and what they gave you after you unlocked them,Keep it up.9/10 for now.

												Binding of Isaac gameplay meets Risk of Rain character development, with Don't Starve style art.This game may not be extremely novel, but it stands by itself nonetheless. Despite its playability, it has a strong whiff of 'devs first game' about it. Look to a newer release from Avidly Wild Games if you like high polish (as far as I know, no newer release is actually forthcoming, but playing this game convinces me that it should).If you can get past the poor polish, you'll see that the game has its own strengths and weaknesses.Strengths:-Strong storybased gameplay. This is often difficult for roguelikes to achieve, but Our Darker Purpose does an admirable job with its lore and achievement system.-Strong sense of progression. Again, the achievement system, along with a credit system and a chapter progression, combine to make you seem like you're moving forward even if you're dying over and over.Weaknesses:-Non-procedural generation. There are only so many rooms that spawn. Fighting the same enemies in the same room gets old after the tenth time, even with multiple play styles.-There are bugs. Aside from the somewhat klutzy feel of the hitboxes in the game, some interactions don't work as explained or intended (I'm looking at you, the 6 people you meet in Edgewood).			"

												This is my 1st review and I am not use to writing anything online so if there are any problems please kindly let me know.Playtime is very wrong, while steam says 35 hours, I have played over 150 hours.A great game with a lot of replayability. The gameplay is very nice and it can be very hard at times. Enemies are grouped in factions, each faction has it own theme, appearance and they play differently from one and another. The each faction is harder then the last, the final faction can be very difficult to fight. The bosses are also unqiue, there is only two bosses that are similar. Most boss fights are fun and hard, only some are annoying. The levels also impact the game, the level are just as different as the factions. The music for the game is amazing. Each theme go greaty with it's faction or boss. The music makes the game even more fun and it also make some bosses feel more challenging .The game also has a nice story and lore. There is no voice acting, the story is all text base but should not be a problem for most. Most of the story need to be discovered  and most of the story is left to the player to interpret. The art is very good. I like how they made it look hand draw. It has a story book feel to it. The art is dark but not gory which suit the game. The final faction look great and very unqiue.Gameplay: 9/10Music: 10/10Art:10/10Story:8/10Final Score 10/10Edit: There two version of the game, the beta update and the normal. It been in beta for year with no word of a update. The Beta is better but have some bad bugs such as bosses not being killed and one boss have loss the power to attack at all (except it has a short range attack in Hard mode).			"

tl;dr: It's Binding of Isaac as a girl.  If you liked Binding of Isaac, you'll like this game.It's obvious -- an overhead, oldschool Zelda-inspired, 4-directional dual-stick shooter in which you play as a hapless, ambiguously 'innocent' child in a dark, gothic setting, moving from floor to floor collecting powerups and fighting huge, challenging bosses in a rogulike gameplay shell.  Yep, it's Binding of Isaac.  But not exactly.First of all, the little aesthetic differences on the surface; to start off with, you play as a girl (though one could argue you can technically play as a ""girl"" in BoI, and this game's Cordy looks kinda like Eve, but that's besides the point).  And instead of tears, you shoot fireballs.  And instead of going down an increasingly surreal basement, you go up an increasingly surreal schoolhouse / orphanage.  And instead of vicious, freakish abominations of nature, you fight vicious, freakish orphaned children (and eventually abominations of nature).  Yeah, really similar stuff... though overall ODP has a slightly less cartoonish, more Tim Burton-esque gothic style to it, which depending on your tastes may look a lot better than BoI's, and it's at least marginally ""classier"", with a LOT less bodily fluids and toilet humor, though its share of less-than-prudish bits here and there; it's more on the ""somewhat unsettling/disturbing, but kind of cool"" level than the ""gross-out until you get used to it and just laugh the rest of the way"" level BoI sits on.But what about the gameplay?  Well, it is indeed EXTREMELY similar to Isaac, but with a few fundamental differences.  The biggest ones are:A) an experience/levelling system, which guarantees at least semi-regular increases in power comparable to a useful passive item upgrade, especially if you're one of those players like me who insists on clearing every single room in every floor.  This kind of replaces BoI's item rooms on each floor, though this is somewhat of a blessing since level-up bonuses are nearly ALWAYS good if not great.B) a persistant upgrade system to make yourself or the world around you more geared for your success as you build up tokens earned by completing floors and getting achievements, which you can spend on either 'lessons' (passive effects you earn through achievements as well) or your 'guidance counselor' (which is basically a way to bank extra currency for gradual bonuses, similar to the coin bank in BoI in a way)C) the ability to DODGE ROLL.  You have no idea how good this is and how it changes the experience compared to BoI!  Not only is it just a universally useful thing to have but it allows you to, say, take a slow movement-speed build and not be forced to tank countless hits from enemies/projectiles that are literally unavoidable without speed past a certain threshold like in BoI.There are other smaller differences, like the fact you get to manually choose your next floor out of 2-4 choices and see the variables they have (kind of like curses in BoI but often with both positive and negative, or even outright positive, effects)... or the fact that instead of bombs which I say are of dubious quality anyway in BoI, you get chalk which is basically a very rare but very powerful utility that can be used both offensively and defensely.  Also, as opposed to your regular bombable secret rooms, in this game they're rather obvious and easy to find and only occur once every few floors on average, anyway.Aside from those points, it's more or less an identical game.  But that's not a bad thing.  Like so many great games of PC gaming past copied the original Rogue and created the genre we now know as roguelike, ODP copies Binding of Isaac which is this generation's most well-known and quite possibly well-made roguelike.  And it is a great game.  There's really no reason I can think of NOT to buy it if you like Isaac at all, or just action rpg/overhead shooter/roguelikes in a general sense.  The graphics are unique and lovely, the music is atmospheric, the gameplay is tight and spot-on, and it never seems unfair, far less than Isaac.I suppose if I had one criticism, it'd be that it's more 'subdued' than BoI... besides in an aethetic sense as mentioned earlier, there are definitely far less ways to make your character / shots nearly as 'wild' or unique as you can in Isaac, and it's basically a matter of doing what you can to make them stronger, faster, have longer range, and add as many supplementary alternate 'bullets' as you can through various means.  But since the game's designed and balanced around this less over-the-top style it's really not that big of a deal.			"

												Binding of Isaac meets Tim Burton? Add some magic to the already surrealistic world and you get Our Darker Purpose: the story of Cordy who has to survive in this magical, yet treacherous school as all students turned on one another. The similarity to Binding of Isaac is out of question. Procedurally generated world? Check. Going from one room to the next till we reach a randomly picked boss in every chapter? Check. Very (and I mean VERY) difficult, challenging gameplay that is unforgiving from the very beginning? Check. When the going gets tough, the tough get going: just because you have only one life you will still return to see if you can defeat the boss during the umpteenth time.I liked the game's graphics as well as its excellent soundtrack. Both create a unique atmosphere: the further progress you make (you basically go upstairs in the school) the more diverse the rooms and enemies get. Levelling up and collecting items (that either give you passive or active abilities) make you stronger which is a must especially when it comes to boss battles. One particular thing I liked about the game is how it rewards you with ""lessons"" for achievement completion. These are all aids that help you during your next run: you can activate them from the main menu by spending the credits you earn during each floor. And if you haven't gotten any achis unlocked during an unsuccessful run, don't worry: the counselor is always waiting you in the main menu and by donating credits he gives you various bonuses. Make sure you look for the archivist as by exploring his study you can get info on what achievements you need to unlock for rewards (you need information on the game's lore as all achievements are hidden).The game is tough. Boss fights require you to get to know your enemy very well. And if you mastered the fight with them you can still add an extra challenge by defeating them with a criterion; this must always be met if you want the corresponding achievement. I still find it hard to believe the Disciplined can be eliminated just under 75 seconds. Also, there's still a hard mode for those that find normal not challenging enough. I do not think there's such a person, though.It's always nice to see the active support from the community. ODP started as a Kickstarter project and people pledged their support by donating around 50,000 dollars. Half a year later the game was greenlit on Steam and in just a couple of more months it was fully released. If you liked Binding of Isaac and are happy to try something a bit more gothic in style then you are in for a treat. Just don't forget: trial and error will be the ultimate problem solving method here.			"

												Comparisons to The Binding of Isaac are unavoidable, but Our Darker Purpose is no clone. While the rogue-like elements, dark tone, and general playstyle are certainly similar, ODP adds plenty of new elements to the formula. Any resemblances to the 2011 indie hit should be considered characteristics of this new genre. The first thing veteran BOI players will notice is that the individual rooms are different sizes, the majority of them significantly larger than before. Visibility then becomes more of an issue and - combined with a reduced movement speed - positioning Cordy around obstacles becomes more critical. This is reenforced by a roll mechanic that increases movement speed for a short time after dodging. The leveling system and the more persistent credit system makes for an experience that leans on its RPG elements rather than the arcade-like variability BOI relies on. Each level up is rewarded with a choice between two power-ups, keeping things random while providing an opportunity for strategy. Credits allow for even more control with consistent upgrades, but in turn encourage grinding to get a better chance of overcoming the challenge at hand. And those advantages are needed as the developer has specifically stated that parts of this game were meant to give even Platinum God BOI players a run for their money. While the feeling of a desperate and narrow survival invoked by all the challenge, randomization, and even the permadeath suits the game's narrative perfectly, the richness of Edgewood's story struggles to be told through the long string of failed runs required to learn a new set of patterns and terrain. Repetition allows for a greater ability to strategize; however, ODP does not avoid tedium like BOI does. Don't get me wrong, the enemies themselves are a joy to learn and become familiar with. Each is distinct and varied, most even possessing a rare champion version which adds yet another layer of complexity. Each new room is chosen from a list of predesigned rooms meaning strategies can be formulated not just around particular enemies, but also particular combinations of enemies in specific surroundings. Overall the game is a slow build that pays off wonderfully, the only frustration is a result of impatiently hunting for the next tidbit of such an enticing story.			"

Playing ODP is like having look of The Binding of Isaac and play style of Hero Siege.I'm using a controller on this one and makes it a bit easyer to shoot and move around.The animations and art work is done real nice and looks a bit Tim Burton-ish .There are a good bit of power ups and lvl up skills in this one to play around with.So if you like Rogue-like games or the ones i mentioned above ,i say give this one a shot !!

												Think of it as a less random Binding of Isaac, with more persistent unlocks that affect how you play.It doesn't look pretty all the time, but Our Darker Purpose has it where it counts. It's got a bit of awkward style, but where it really shines is in how it plays. Enemies interact in interesting ways with the environment. It has two separate tracks of progression, items and levels, as opposed to Isaac's items, which means fewer runs where you end up daunted by the random item generator. The persistent unlocks, meanwhile, let you emphasize specific builds, making a lot of choices pretty tactical.And you can roll! Rolling makes this game. Isaac tends to overwhelm you with bullets as it ups the difficulty; Our Darker Purpose throws very angry, charging enemies at you, and expects you to be able to dance around them. Which, with the roll, you definitely can.The writing's pretty cute, too. The level up books are a nice touch, as are the series of in-universe middle grade excerpts that come as lore. It's not a classic of videogaming, but it's charming and challenging and strangely compulsive.			"

												Incredibly high-quality game for how relatively obscure it is. The very high initial learning curve makes it feel very, very rewarding when you finally get things right. Vastly improved item balance compared to Binding of Isaac means that victory isn't quite so feast-or-famine; it's entirely possible to finish a run even with the worst items and even the best won't save you from terrible play. The story is tense and well-written, and the spectacularly atmospheric soundtrack makes every step up the tower feel like a step deeper into the dark.The best roguelike I have ever played, and among the best games. 9.5/10, the only complaint I have is the godawful bouncing-spiky-ball mechanic (which fortunately does not overly affect the late-game).

												Our Darker Purpose is a great 2D Rogue game similar to the Binding of Isaac. This one is very challenging. You can choose your own route until the endboss. Each random generated level has a special condition so you need to choose it wisely. You only have one life and if you die you need to start over. Unlocking achievements will unlock more random stuff ingame and perks for your characters. There are some achievements here where you need a lot of skill and luck to get. The 3 last achievement is too much for me >.<. This one is pretty hardcore imo, especially the hard mode.			"

												I bought Our Darker Purpose on a whim because of the obvious similarities to Binding of Isaac. It certainly delivers on those appearances. Instead of a little boy exploring his basement/hellscape, you are a young girl exploring a boarding school where the adults have disappeared and the children have gone feral and otherwise run rampant (it may also be a hellscape in its own right). Room layouts and enemy types are random, items drop that augement your shots/defenses/etc, there are bosses at the end of every floor, and so on. The differences are in the details; ODP is a bit more strategic and less random than BoI. Player movement is much slower (but you can roll for extra speed), projectiles also tend to be slower, and enemy patterns tend to be a little more predictable. Further:- There is an XP system, and every level up you get to choose between two books, which are essentially Fallout-style perks- most are only beneficial, some require trade-offs. - Pickup items, bosses, etc, all unlock in greater quantities as you progress.- As you unlock achievements and generally progress in the game, you unlock different ""classes"" which are persistent perks, and can be equipped using available ""class periods"" so you can mix and match your class schedule and have a somewhat persistent build. For example, my current character starts with a few extra coins, extra crit chance when close to enemies, and the ability to shoot while rolling. I may want to switch these for other classes once more lucrative ones are unlocked.I have played for 11 hours and completed the first of three (four?) chapters at the 9 hour mark. I've only gotten past that point a couple of times since. I am still seeing new enemies and bosses and have less than 50% of the pickup items unlocked according to the ingame stats. All of the artwork is hand-drawn (the player and enemy sprites at least) with great thick ink lines. I almost think the assets were done on paper and scanned into sprites. Just like the screenshots indicate, it's very reminiscent of Edward Gorey, Tim Burton, Neil Gaiman's Coraline, and other media in the Goth Kid style. It's clean and consistent throughout. The music is decent and fits thematically with the visuals. Some of the tracks (especially the boss battles) sound properly big and orchestral which is impressive considering it was composed and orchestrated by one guy[natefenwicksmith.bandcamp.com] (this is a link to the soundtrack). As for the setting and story, the game again draws deep from its obvious influences but adds enough of its own spin that things never feel derivitave or cliched. The ingame writing- the item descriptions and lore pages and such- is effectively humorous and creepy, often at the same time. The slow drip of the plot and absolute consistency in the narrative (a school where things are not quite right) are high points.Perhaps my biggest praise for Our Darker Purpose is that in all the hours I've played (now 19 at the time of this edit) I have always felt a sense of progression. Every run seems to go a little further than the last, or I find a new item for the first time, or unlock one thing or another and want to go right back for another run. It hasn't just been a smooth learning curve -- everything about it has improved with as I've played more.This was a rare day-one impulse buy for me - I had never heard of Our Darker Purpose before it launched on Steam. And what a pleasant surprise it's been! Highly recommended to any BoI fan or really anyone who enjoys these ""rogue"" influenced action games.			"

												Simply put, its a masterpeice.  Its similar to Binding of Isaac in terms of gameplay, but like Dark Souls, the purpose of this game isn't to beat it on one go.  It is difficult, but you will overcome every challenge eventually.  Not buggy, constant flow of content to unclock and an aesthetic which is unique and entertaining.  I've played way over 100 hours and I've still to unlock all of the easy ot unlock things.  The randomized gameplay makes every run through entertaining.  Worth the price and over.  Just don't buy it if you can't take a challenge or can't handle dying alot.  If you want an easy game, choose a puzzle game....			"

												Usually, I don't like games that are difficult. But this game has a somewhat Series of Unfortunate Events charm that I respond well to. It gets easier as you go along, you basically grind for a while until you can buy perks. And for a while, I mean a loooooong while. There are many items and level-up perks that have both a positive and a negative to using them. Every time you get an achievement, it unlocks a perk. Usually achievements just sit pretty and give others an indication of how much you've played and how well, but now there's even more reason to get them.This game makes it feel like you're getting somewhere, e.g. ""Now I have enough points to donate to the counsellor. He gave me nothing. :/ I'm broke again""Honestly, I suck at these games, but this one does a great job of keeping me interested.			"

Posted: August 10, 2016
												This is a golden gem of a game.I've played far more than the meager 76 minutes it says on Steam. Possibly due to offline mode, possibly due to unknown issues.Regardless, as you might guess by the fact I went out of my way to earn the ""10 games wining streak"" achievement, I absolutely love this game.Let's list it's few cons first:-It's extremely luck based. The traits and items you get can and will make or break a run. While skill has a ton to do with it as well, it's simply impossible to win if you didn't get any options for bonus damage items or traits; enemies have far too much health and deal way too much damage in projectiles that are all across the screen.Even if it was possible to kite and slowly whittle away at the enemies until you won, you would've had to have spent hours doing so.-It's heart breaking to lose because of an unlucky boss fight; perhaps you picked a few things that were bad against that one specific boss, or you just made a mistake (some bosses can hit HARD, so one mistake is enough), and lost a run that had potential.-The game is very difficult, with no choice for easy mode. There is hardmode once you've finished the game, but if you aren't sure of your skills you should probably NOT play this game. Seriously.-Some of the items (especially a few of the actives) are worthless without synergy. For example, if you override your dodge roll with a haste effect then dodge roll modifiers will have no effect. If you have no non-standard damage types then a non-standard damage amplifier will do nothing for you. Etc.-For you completionists out there, hardmode doesn't always feel fair, and might be a real stopper from getting 100% achievements in this game.And now, the pros:-The sound design is SUPERB. From the music to the sound of things breaking, sounds of bosses as you fight them - everything is perfect.-Items are plentiful and varied, and are not all boring in their effects. Yes, there is some ""+range"" or ""+damage"" items, but most of them are ""+25% attack speed but your shots now have an angle variance"" or ""you get double-damage, but if you miss you lose health"" etc. This makes the items not only powerful but also fundamentally alter your play-style.-The traits you can choose can also drastically change your play-style; they offer health, sustain, damage, attack speed, movement speed, increased item drops, increased mini-boss spawns etc.-When a run goes well, the game is amazingly fun, and when the run is close it's a true nail-biter. Especially if you're on the ""10 games wining streak"" challenge.-Environments are detailed enough to be interesting, but not enough to distract you.-The story is told through bits and pieces; each time you beat a room's challenges the furniture might spout some dialog. Each item has a description or comment from the administrators, and each perk you choose also contains a similar thing. Beating challenges (or discovering them) also usually yields some lore, in addition to unlocking new items or skills.-The game is fair in it's hit-boxes. You'll rarely think ""That shouldn't have hit' or ""I was sure that'd have hit!""-All of the controls are extremely simple and very intuitive.-The somewhat dark, depressing theme is excellently contrasted with the game's humor. This is about as well done as Darkest Dungeon's depressing and hopeless theme.-And finally, it's fun.If you have your doubts, pick this up on a sale. You probably won't regret it, if you're up to the challenge and spending some time in RNG-land. 8/10.-Sleepy			"

												When you first play Our Darker Purpose, everything about that game seems frustratingly hard. I remember playing this for the first time and thinking that everything was unfair. Your character, Cordy, is painfully slow and she does barely any damage. The enemies on the other hand seems to have too much health, too much speed, and whittle away your health very quickly. You can dodge using the roll to move faster, but you can't attack while rolling and you always seem to roll into the enemy attack and harmful environment instead of away from it. Why the hell can't I attack diagonally? How does anyone get enough tokens to pay for the exorbitant prices of items in vending machine? How am I supposed to get stronger if the items are too expensive to buy? How can anyone maintain decent health with the lack of juice boxes around to heal you? The bosses were incredibly difficult too. Their sole purpose seem to be to lower your health to less than half percent so that even if you do somehow beat the boss, you'll probably die to the more difficult enemies on the next floor. These bosses aren't even the main boss, there's a chapter boss after three ""mini"" bosses. After my first playthrough, I remember thinking that there was no ♥♥♥♥ing way I'd ever get good enough to beat even the first chapter. I didn't feel like playing anymore. But I got this game as a gift and I sure as hell wasn't wasting that person's money by playing less than an hour. So I kept playing, and I'm glad I did.One thing you have to realize is that this game is hard. The learner's curve is freaking huge and you will die a lot. A lot a lot. You will die every time you encounter new enemies, you will die when you see new bosses, you will die when you play in different floor types. However you will eventually get used to the game. You will learn the way certain enemies move. Eventually you'll be breezing through entire floors while only taking a few hits the entire time. You start rolling and dodging like a champ. The slow movement and low damage no longer becomes an issue. The credits you earn after completing a floor can be used to gradually improve your character by unlocking ""lessons"" and permanent upgrades that last throughout your subsequent playthroughs. Every time you encounter a new boss or enemy, it seems like the difficulty suddenly spikes. Yet the game always gets easier after the first time you defeat a boss. You  will	 learn how to play this game, but only if you keep playing it. People like to compare this to Binding of Isaac. They say it's BOI except worse. Same twin-stick gameplay with a dodge mechanic and gothic artstyle, but less variety in items and clunkier mechanics. I myself have never played BOI, but I'm telling you now that the more you compare this game to BOI the less likely you'll enjoy this game. There are some criticisms I'd agree with, like having less variety in items. But Our Darker Purpose is NOT BOI. If you try to play this game like how you'd play BOI, then you're going to have a bad time. The game seems sadistic and cruel and UNFAIR when you first play, but once you learn how to play the game gets much easier. Personally, I don't view the smaller hitboxes, weaker character, and slow movement as ""gameplay flaws"" but rather as things you better get used to and use to adjust your playstyle accordingly. I understand if you don't enjoy this game because of that, but I disagree when people call them bad mechanics.This game is my surprising Indie game of the year, even though I started playing this a year and a half after launch. I really enjoy playing this game, and I imagine I still have quite a few more hours to play before I reach the final boss.			"

												I really like the game but I also have to say that I'm way into rogue-lites in the vain of Binding of Isaac or similar games. So ODP is basically a twin stick roguelike with a heavy emphasis on finding the right item at the right time. Unlocking the right items can be a bit tedious since the first rounds tend to be quite difficult. But after the first bumpy runs you get used to the flow of the game and it really opens up. It's a bit short but you'll want to run the game more than one time anyway. The art style and music is really great and transports the atmosphere of the abandoned children shelter quite nicely. The lore is great if you want to invest the time in reading it. Overall a great game which I can only recommend since the devs are still providing patches for the game with new items or the newly added controller support, there is nothing which I could really criticize. A good buy which I don't regret. For fans of the genre a great buy, everyone else can buy on sale and the chances that you may like it aren't that slim.			"

												This game is a hidden little gem and I really wish people paid more attention to it. There's pretty much no flaws to it, other then a few meager little nitpicks.Now first off, I want you to imagine Tim Burton made the Binding of Isaac. Now remove anything remotely similar to Johnny Depp. That's what our Darker Purpose is. The game plays almost identically to BOI, albeit a bit more slow-paced. You collect items and level up every once and a while.This game is a rogue-like, it has randomly generated floors, each with randomly generated rooms. Many of these floors will have a certain level-feeling (i.e. To Big, Leaderless, Power Struggle, Sensetive, etc.) that can make or break your playthrough. It's very rare that a death in this game will be the game's fault, although it won't be uncommon that your playthrough may get harder thanks to the luck of the draw present in all rogue-likes.In short, Our Darker Purpose is a fine piece of work, and by-and-far one of my more favorite games. It has a nice sense of humour, a gorgousley grim art-style, plays near perfectly, and is hard to boot.			"

												""Our Darker Purpose"" is a ""me too"" roguelike that no doubt means to sail in the wake of runaway successes like The Binding of Isaac. Unlike the others, though, ODP offers significantly more in the way of RPG elements. In terms of gameplay, ODP is very much in the real-time roguelike tradition, with a series of rooms in which the player faces challenges of combat or dexterity. You are locked in a room until you complete it, and then may enter an adjoining one.ProsCompared to other roguelikes, ODP has level progression per session, with choices of perks at each level-up. Your choices are effectively a build for the session, and reduce the randomness normally associated with roguelikes.The gothic art style is a good choice, and was no doubt influenced by Edward Gorey, a personal favorite of mine, as well as more recent expressions of the genre, such as ""Don't Starve.""ODP has a story that unfolds in fragments, and while it's hardly a masterpiece, it's far more than one would expect for the genre.ConsThe lack of controller support is a big mark against the game, and an oversight that is more egregious considering the genre.I like the sketchy, gothic art style, but ODP's art style feels amateur and inconsistent. Some objects feature sharp, fine lines and hard edges, while others are soft and look like they've been heavily resampled. Also, there is insufficient variation in room props. I've seen many pixel-perfect-identical desks or chairs spawn in neat grids in the room.The pacing is poorly managed, and the rooms quickly become boring and repetitive. Many rooms require far more patience than actual skill, at times making the game a tedious slog.Pickups are mostly uninteresting and give small bonuses to stats like health, critical chance, and damage. Roguelikes usually feature a variety of highly powerful objects or abilities, or at a minimum, very interesting ones with multiplicative synergy. ODP's pickups lack synergy and (generally ) only linearly affect stats.The game's difficulty is disappointing. The game is very easy when compared to hardcore roguelikes, and will probably disappoint players who expect a serious challenge.			"

												Pros:+ Rogeu-lite with lore, which is quite interesting+ Cons:- Lacking of sound effects.- Grey everything. Almost everything is grey.- Unimpressive animation. Every character/enemies in the game is like a stiff cutout. Don't expect something like Don't Starve.- Boring boss. Discipline King is the most boring boss I've encountered.- Questionable enemy hitboxes.- Items that you picked up does nothing to your character. I mean, you picked some glasses that will extend your projectile range. But your character stays the same from start to end.I've tried to like the game. My first impression on the game was like ""I can't believe I paid 10 bucks for this."" So I played give the game some more time, played it some more. The devs has patched the game with some updates, changing the item drop rates, starting movement speed and firing rate. The result: the game got better.The most noticeable flaw in this game is the lack of sound effect. The lore said something like the kids killed all the ""quiet ones"". But all the enemies in the game is mute, no screaming kids, no nothing. I bought this game hoping for something like Binding of Isaac, so I can't help but to compare it to BoI eventhough it was a different game than this. I do however, praise the devs for being brave to do something new by introducing ""rolling"". Cordy was intentionally be made to move slow like a sloth so that you will have to depend more on the rolling. At the current state, this game is unfinished. Should be an early access title. Go ahead, buy it but you'll need to manage your expectations a little bit. Try to search for Our Darker Purpose demo last year, and compare it to this final product.			"

												        Incredibly disappointing, on the surface Our Darker Purpose seemed like it would be a promising addition to the ""Procedural Death Labyrinth"" style of roguelike games, but once you start playing the bad quickly outweighs the good.        One thing that drew me in was the art style shown in the previews, looking very dark and bleak. While it is prevalent throughout the whole of the game, it quickly loses its shine after repeated playings, especially when the player character looks ripped from a chibi manga for no apparent reason. All in all it looks like a 13 year old A Series of Unfortunate Events fan's failed deviantART page, with very little that's truly original in design, not to mention the framerate for pretty much all character animations are stiff and awful, and not in an intentional way designed to add to the atmosphere.        The biggest problem is the gameplay, though. Attacks are bland, enemies show little sign of taking damage when hurt and die in tiny puffs of smoke, movement is slow, items can be near-useless, leveling up isn't exciting, bosses are either boring and tedious or ridiculously difficult, traps are hard to dodge or are so easy to avoid they don't even have a purpose of being there (unless one of your item's effects sets it off unintentionally, which is INCREDIBLY annoying, by the way), there's a light mechanic which seriously doesn't gel with the game mechanics, the areas blend together into monochromatic vomit and overall it's just not fun to experience. I seriously had to push myself to play it, saying to myself that I probably just didn't get far enough into it for it to grab me, but that's pretty poor reasoning, as a roguelike it should be MOST grabbing on first run since it's your first time stepping into the game's atmosphere and mechanics, it should fill you with excitement for a new experience, not make you catatonic within three hours of playing.         I should probably talk about the story. It's bland. It's SO bland. There's a boarding school where the faculty are an evil sovereignity who barely care for the students that act as an anarchy except for the major social cliques who behave like warring tribes and you already know this plot because you angrily scribbled it into your diary when you were an emo kid in middle school.There's barely a drop of originality in the worldbuilding or plot, 90% of it is concepts that have been used several times before, the bullies being giants, the younger students acting like feral demi-humans and using school supplies as adhoc weaponry, the school faculty underreacting to student death or actively causing it, it's all been done before and done better.          Overall this game is a lot like taking an x-ray of Tim Burton making love to A Series of Unfortunate Events while The Addams Family watches from out the window with a tub of store brand petroleum jelly: it's awful, pretentious, empty, not as slick as it could be, hard to see without proper light and has a chance of giving you cancer.          And with that awkward metaphor said I slip back into my cave.			"

												Gotta love how my best purchases are <5 euros, while (at least one of) my worst purchases are at full or nearly full price. Don't let the similarities to Binding of Isaac deter you, get that game! At the very least the atmosphere is worth the price tag. That being said, the controls and the handling of the projectiles your hero shoots take a bit of getting used to. Still, it does have that magic touch, and that ""just one more run"" mark of quality.Edit: 8 months later. I wanted to review the game again, and positively, having forgotten I'd written that. That being said, it does hit a plateau at some point for me where progress is glacial, even non-existent at points			"

												As much as people will keep calling it out for having mechanics present in The Binding of Isaac they may as well be calling out Sniper Elite for having mechanics that exist in C.o.D or any other shooter.Personally I find Isaac to be a middling game with a fair few issues (mostly minor but all annoying, like the cutscene audio not being tied to any audio slider and them patching out synergies making it more bland).This is a lot more about planning than the more bullet hell style of Isaac and I prefer the theme of ODP to Isaac, one being a religion filled mess getting by on toilet humour and gore while being impossible to try and follow what the story is meant to be the other being more gothic and far easier to follow the story once you've uncovered enough of it to get a clear picture.You'll clearly prefer one of the two if you sinke the time in both though you may well enjoy both.I'd hardly say either one is overly similar outside of the shared top level mechanics of the whole twin (not sure stick is the right word as most people use kb/m for em) stick rouguelite thing.

												They thought The Binding Of Isaac was dark.This is DARKER.Set in a supernatural boarding house surrounded by an endless wasteland, you play as a cute little girl who is fated to die hundreds of times in the Worst School Ever. Children are heartlessly sacrificed to the various horrors of this ever-changing labyrinth of death, while the administrators crack jokes, admire the obituaries, and encourage increasingly-fatal proposals to make their deaths even more humiliating and horrifying. The few children who have survived this far have grouped into factions that fight each other to the death using anything they can find, and punish unaffiliated students with suicidal fervor. The stew is jumping. The potatoes are rambling. The desks and beds are discussing the intricate madness of the world they live in, unaware that they are not as invinicble as they think. Everything else has a lock on you and will grow in damage and dakka until you are dead, dead, dead.Your character has a few advantages. Her main attack involves throwing high-damage fireballs and she can acquire up to a hundred different upgrades and a dozen special attacks. Unlike Isaac, she can dodge roll away from danger, which increases her speed and can be upgraded with a few extra items. She also has access to a limited number of perks from both the start of the game and whenever she levels up.But none of this power compares to the sheer atomosphere of this cursed hellscape. Hands will claw their way into the room and swipe at you. Rooms will lose power to the lights. Ghosts will explode various objects at will. And sometimes, everything is on fire. You are the prey, you are SO out of your element, and you need to get to the end with enough health to destroy the insanely difficult bosses.Good luck. Morsel.			"

												First off, if you're expecting this game to be exactly like, or VERY similar to, The Binding of Isaac and cannot leave Isaac off in its own corner while playing this game, then don't buy it.  You're going to try to play it like Isaac and just be disappointed that it doesn't play in the same manner and then spread dislike about this game because it's highly likely that you're not going to adapt to how the game should be played.Second, if you do buy the game, download the test, aka ""beta"", version first to get the latest version (400 or higher) if the game isn't already at it.  The patch addresses a majority of the problems most people have of it, even though I felt the base game was actually pretty good to begin with.Third, this game is hard.  There's no ifs, ands, or buts about this at all.  You HAVE to stick with it and unlock lessons, classes, and the counselor bonuses to make it easier for you.  Some of the attempts will require luck to unlock the boss/chapter achievements.  Others involve great skill.  It gets easier, especially with practice, trust me.  However, the difficulty of the game makes it that much more rewarding when you finally do succeed in various aspects of the game, like beating the chapter 1 boss for the first time.Straight up, I like this game and that's why I'm recommending it.  I'm not going to talk about aesthetics of the game, the actual feel of the game play, or anything else that's subjective to me in this review due to the fact that everyone likes different things in games.  All I can suggest is watching videos of it being played.  Hell, leave a comment and I'll record videos, with or without commentary (though I don't know if I can provide entertaining commentary).  If you like what you see, buy it.  If not, buy something else that suits your tastes.  But I think that if you like what you see, and like the genre, chances are, you will like this game.			"

												Our Darker Purpose is a fantastic game, but due to Binding of Isaac being around, comparisons are inevitable. Of course we have the top-down perspective, shooting projectiles at enemies while running through rooms and picking up items. Heck, even the stragely sized rooms of ODP have been matched now that Rebirth is out. However, that is where comparisons for me end. Where as Isaac is focused on action and unsubtle humor, ODP is more about atmosphere, mystery, and discovery, with a sprinkle of humor mixed in for the dedicated or patient. How many games have idle conversations between pieces of furniture or sacks of potatoes? Its atmosphere is where it stands out the most in comparison. It is far darker (both in tone and in actual lighting) and there is far more to learn as the game progresses. Defeating bosses, finding secret rooms, and collecting certain items gives you insite into how the orphanage work and what dark secrets it was hiding, even before the events of the game. I felt like the lore of ODP is much deeper than Isaac, because where Isaac is more about interpretation, ODP is more about discovery.The gameplay is the most similar between the two, but it has enough that sets it appart. There is dodge-rolling, recovery items (juice boxes) that you can hold for when you need them, a level up system, and a health bar with a value instead of hearts. Another huge difference is that in ODP, there is a special ability board of sorts in which you can unlock abilities, spend the points you get on each run to get use of them, and use a certain number of them to help improve your chances in various ways. And yes, improve your chances. This game is far more difficult than Isaac. There are very few, if any, overpowered items, although a number of them do synergize nicely. You have to work with what you have and hopefully use those preselected abilities to your advantage.Overall, I really enjoy Our Darker Purpose. While I do find Isaac more fun due to its wacky combinations and god-like status by the end of a run, Our Darker Purpose feels more satisfying. Going up the floors feels like far more of an accomplishment, beating a boss without taking damage or by beating it in its own special way is more fun, and the difficulty spikes so hard that if you aren't prepared you will die, no questions asked.

												It's a very well-designed game similar to that of Binding of Isaac, but with a lore that feels like if Hogwarts were run by the Addams family. The gameplay is crisp and challenging, but the biggest star is the atmosphere. The style, music, and mythology is wonderously enganging. The dialogue between furniture is quite delightful too.			"

												An evil version of the wayside school looms in a vast depressing void where you the player will guide a seemingly innocent fire ball girl named Cordy, who recently had all her friends murdered when all the adults vanished, through a school filled with psychopathic orphanage/boarding school students up an irrational amount of floors to seek answers from the entity known as the administrators. Cordy is destined to die many times, but still mysteriously can restart her journey a bit differently every death afterwards. In the afterlife you can take classes which if equipped give different abilities to help you on your journey.Pros:•	The boss fights are epic and each requires a different strategy for beating them.•	The story is one of the best I’ve seen in videogames with a lot of world building, secrets, and interesting characters, but not many people will find that out because of the lore/memory room system.  This game’s story is mysterious and is slowly fed to the player over time through boss battles and memory rooms (more on that later).•	The gothic pencil drawn art style is unique and really makes ODP stand out. •	There’s tons of content and gameplay mechanics to master. •	Understanding and strategizing juice box health management and exactly how to approach a screen are key here. Much more about item management and survival than running and gunning, so this is much more slowly paced than many top down shooters.•	There are tons of different challenges that give you access to new items, classes to you if you beat them and also encourage experimentation in what items to buy and how you approach bosses. •	The game definitely has a good sense of humor which is mainly shown through the Administrators who make sarcastic comments in a very GLaDOS like way.•	The class system allows a variety of different lessons to equip which significantly alter the way you play. You can run a crit build, a juice box build, a chalk build, there’s a lot to choose from, but you have to unlock the classes first.Cons:•	The various pieces props like the potatoes, furniture, rocks, and pipes have strange clipping detection and more than once I’ve got stuck on one of their sides when trying to roll away from an enemy.•	Certain important aspects of the game like the class/period system and memory rooms are not explained and huge parts of the game can be missed out on.•	There is a high skill ceiling on this game, more so than with the Binding of Isaac. Many people will get stuck on the Woundwort Dormitory which is the first difficulty spike and will feel like they can’t progress causing them to stop playing. Most of the fun items, abilities, and the majority of the story are beyond this first spike of difficulty so a lot of players are going to stop playing before they even crack the surface and actually know what the game is all about. I played this game off and on for more than a year before actually beating it, so you either have to be good or have enough patience.•	The majority of the power ups in this game are very boring and scarce, whereas with Binding of Isaac almost every power up alters the game and your appearance in a major way ODP’s power ups are more conservative like with damage, speed, and drop boosts that don’t alter appearances at all. The power ups in ODP that aren’t stat boosts like the classes and items are still pretty boring besides a select few.•	Some may think that after a while all the environments look the same and become boring.•	The Shakespeare references to King Lear and Romeo and Juliet don’t have any strong parallels to the plot and as a result are pointless.•	Hard mode for me at least isn’t even really fun, with my skill level there are only a couple builds and items that let me get anywhere, so it always feels constrictive and dependent on RNG.Things I wish I knew: Our Darker Purpose doesn’t explain things well sometimes, and those omitted instructions kept me from progressing and understanding the story for a long time. Hopefully now you can understand the game immediately with these slick reminders.Memory Rooms: There are these ghost librarians called Archivists which occasionally walk from room to room on certain floors. You’re supposed to follow them and when they walk into a wall you can go inside that wall also. Through that wall is a memory room where there are either props scattered through the room which you can investigate with the E button to find coins and important lore pages or an Archivist to fight which drops lore or items. The game never tells the player they can walk through the wall after the Archivists and go to a secret room to find all the non-boss specific lore that is ESSENTIAL for understanding the real story and that is a big screw up. I hope I just skipped over the instructions that tell the player about this.Challenges/Lore: Lore pages are really important not just because it’s the only way to find out the full story, which is awesome, in game, but it also gives the players challenges at the bottom of their pages that if completed can get new classes and items that the player will probably need to finish the game. So definitely complete the lore challenges. Class System: I’m probably really stupid but I did not figure out how the class-equip system worked until my 40th hour. Basically throughout the game you get new lessons you can learn in the afterlife by completing challenges, you take these classes with periods which are basically reusable aptitude points that you allocate between your desired classes. I didn’t understand that the periods were reusable so I just stuck with the first classes I spent them on for 40 hours when in fact I could have tried tons of new classes with those same periods during that time. But, now you know that if you don’t want to spend periods on a class anymore you can just click on that class and get your periods back to spend on whatever you want.Final Verdict: I’ve tried to give this game a fair review, but I definitely am biased because after 90+ hours I really do love this game a lot faults and all. I ignore all the problems this game has or have adapted to them at this point, but I can understand why they might put some people off especially the steep difficulty. This game isn’t for everyone. But, for patient gamers Our Darker Purpose has amazing boss fights, an intriguing dark story that unfolds organically through found lore, a striking and beautiful art style, and deep gameplay which allows players to play how they like.I will probably update this review in the future to fix mistakes and improve it.

												I learned about Our Darker Purpose from reading a Game Informer review (They gave it an 8.75) and  based on the cool looking stillshots they had of the game, I felt the need to try it out. The first thing I noticed about the game was the Atmosphere: The dark, gothic visuals juxtaposed with the  brooding, orchestral soudtrack and the cynical humor parceled throughout the game made for a wonderfully melancholy environment that I just loved. The soundtrack particularly stood out to me as I am an audio engineer and I really appreciate how the music absolutely nails the mood of the game. The second thing I noticed about Our Darker Purpose was how ungodly difficult it is. The gameplay is deceptively simple but tense and addictive. you mainly enter a room, run around throwing fire at enemies while dodging ememy attacks untill you clear the room, level up, pick up items, etc. The difficulty lies in the various enemies and their increasingly powerful attacks, the general scarcity of health, and the fact that when you die, the game is over. I know several people who started playing this game but gave up after a few hours because the game was too hard for them. I, on the other hand, just found this game too good to quit. The rooms, items, and abilities when you level up are all randomized which means that the game is different every time you play. After playing and dying more than a few times, you'll start to understand that good reflexes, pattern recognition, a considerable amount of luck, and sheer tenacity are needed to beat this game. Overall, I think Our Darker Purpose is amazing and I would recommend it to any gamer who can appreciate the gothic atmosphere, dark humor, and is not willing to back down from a real challenge.			"

You can also buy power ups, which is neat.-The game looks really good, the art style is fantastic, and the atmosphere and setting is dark and eerie.Cons:-The game is pretty slow paced. -The hitboxes are really odd and clunky, which is a real turn off.I would give this game a 7,3/10This game is good and I would definitely recommend it.

												   Our Darker Purpose is yet another entry in the rogue-lite genre. This one seems to take the same starting point as The Binding of Isaac, and steering the game towards another direction entirely.    What I mean by this is that takes a very similar formula (a randomly generated Zelda-like dungeon with bosses, ""shops"" and items), but focuses on different aspects. While TBoI was a more visceral and kept item effects to more mysterious (not a lot of detailed description and stats), Our Darker Purpose tries to take things more precise in terms of gameplay, making the runs longer and significantly more difficult, and embelishes it with a fully fleshed lore as well as permanent progression.   Unfortunately, it's a very tall order to beat. Taking the same genre but opposite design choices isn't always the best option. In this case, while I can see some people having a great time with this game, I can't say that I've enjoyed it nearly as much as the TBoI.   I can't write a full review on a game like this, since the details are the secrets to this genre. If you're not very familiar with Binding of Isaac, I can't guarantee that you'll understand my points. Sorry if that's the case.   First off, presentation. In this game, presentation is one of the highlights, and certainly something that took the developer's focus. It has a very gothic, Tim Burton-esque feel to it. While it may be a bit rough around the edges, it's pretty awesome in this regard. Everything seems to work towards delivering the same feeling, and it succeeds in doing so. From the music to the artstyle and the backstory, it is definitely very solid.   Each Boss has a lore that you're told about after beating them, there are achievements to be unlocked (in-game only) that also give you even more story about them, etc. Everything you do seems to have a bit of story attached to it, which is good, if that's what you're looking for. If you're a purely mechanical player in these kinds of game (which is totally understandable), it may not matter as much, but it's still good that it's there.   One problem I have with it, is that it is not very subtle, for the most part. Lore is usually presented through full pages of text that require you to stop playing to read them... On the other hand, the furniture also talk to each other! After you finish a room, there's a chance that the tables and chairs will start talking, revealing a bit more of the game's dark humour. Later on, however, you'll be trying to beat the game rather than patiently waiting for them to stop talking to resume your gameplay so, while I like what they were trying to do, I don't think it worked particularly well.   I can't divide this very well, so I'm just going to mention topics that come to mind about main differences to other games in the genre (and what makes them/this more fun).   Floors are, as expected, randomly generated. In this, however, the algorithm had some problems, as adjacent rooms rarely had a connection (aside from the one exit/entrance). In each floor you have normal enemies, a secret room chance, a vending machine, a Boss fight, and possibly Elite enemies. Normal enemies may drop Health/Chalk consumables or money. The vending machines may also have consumables, or items for you to buy, both passive or active.   The Boss fight rewards you with XP only, but not an item. To counter this, Elite enemies always drop an item. There are also some environmental hazard rooms with a chest in them. Some are hard to reach, while others are locked for a given time, and you have to try and survive during that time. Chests also contain items.   Only very cool aspect, is that every floor has a twist to it. When you finish one, you're given choices of several random floors, and you're given some information about them. The most important, is floor modifiers. Some are very dark but provide discounts (or more XP), some have more Elites, others guarantee you a secret room, some have 2 vendings machines, some have none, but give you more money, etc. etc. There are a bunch of them that you'll encounters, and their effects are not 100% clear at first. It provides another source of variety in playstyle nonetheless, once you get the hang of it.   One of the main sources of power, is leveling up. You get XP by killing enemies (or getting some items that improve your gain, or level you up instantly) and with each level, you can choose one of two perks. These are also random (although I believe the pair is fixed. Two perks are often together, although you may get different choices, randomly).   Unlike many games in the genre, they're very clear about what they do. They give you +20damage, or 15% moving speed and more consumable drops, etc. In my opinion, it makes the game less fun. One of the great aspects of the genre , is experimentation. You get some cryptic items, but discover what they do with time. In here, it's all very... safe. It's mostly straight up upgrades, although some require you to sacrifice one attribute to gain other.   The most important aspect in this game that took my enjoyment out of it, was the fact that the items are not very fun at all. There aren't as many items as one would expect, and they don't change gameplay all that much. While some do (maybe create 2 shots when you're not moving, or slow projectiles near you, or discharge electricity near you), most of them are simply stat changes, and it makes the game feel very stale.    In say, TBoI, there are often items that change your run drastically, and many of them synergise unpredictably with one other, which oftens leads to some crazy runs that are really fun. In here, there's very little of that. Besides, due to the low number of items, every run ends up feeling very same-y, and you require the same items to succeed.   Another very important aspect, is how the game feels. You character feels very impotent. Shots are tiny, with huge rooms full of enemies, often with hazards that are much bigger and faster than you. You do have a roll ability, though, you allows you to walk faster, but not shoot (unless you had a certain perk -- more on that later).   While it may seem very intentional, the game doesn't benefit a lot from these details at all. Another problem, is how hitboxes are a bit too dodgy and don't match with the perspective. It's also a bit dodgy in other games of the genre, but it's especially noticeable here, and it doesn't feel right.    And lastly, regarding this, is how the movement and shooting feels. I'm sorry for bringing it up again, but look at TBoI (LOL). Tears travel faster when you're shooting in the direction that you're walking, and travel slower if you talk on the opposite directions. When you walk to the sides, it changes the angle AND speed. In Our Darker Purpose, there's no speed change, only angle. This doesn't seems that big of a problem, but you can't imagine how much worst the shots feel as a result! It's something I hadn't considered before, but it's really impactful. Vlambeer, for example, is known to make great feeling games, so that's something I'll need to dive into soon enough. But yeah, movement and shooting doesn't feel very good to play, unfortunately.   Only one last aspect I want to mention. The game features a permanent progression system. Completing floors awards you with credits, and completing achievements and chapters (groups of floors gated by a final boss) grant you Lessons.    You can use credits to donate to a character (and gain passive benefits), or buy Lessons. Lessons then require you to have periods (you get one per chapter) to activate them, and they also give you passive benefits, although you'll have to choose carefuly between them. These have the ability to change your game quite a bit and give you some headstart.   In this game, this is a good thing, because it would be even more nightmarishly difficult without it.			"

												At the moment I heavily recomend this game, though I haven't fully cleared it (when I do I will update this review). If you're a lontime fan of the rougelike/rougelite genera you should have no qualms with picking this game up for full price, if you're new and your skeptical then I would still recomend picking up full price but if you have a tight budget then consider putting it on your wishlist and picking it up when you find the funds or when it goes on sale.As a cavieat to that I will say that if you haven't played rougelike/rougelite games that you should understand what those labels mean. This type of game will challenge you and it will frustrate you, but if your patient and dedicated then you will find that the feeling you get when you push past whatever was holding you back before is one of the most rewarding things you'll experience in gaming.General Gameplay:The gameplay of this game is increadibly fun and while it's difficulty can be frustrating at times, like many games in the rougelike/rougelite it's increadibly rewarding when you do finally manage to beat whatever you might have gotten stuck on before. The controls are very smooth and responsive and everything works as described. I haven't encountered any bugs or glitches so far.Design Of Levels & Enemies:The design of the enemies/levels/rooms/hazards/bosses is such that there is a very smooth difficulty curve. You really never find yourself in a position where the game is impossible to beat and you will never find yourself in a position where your victory is assured. Yes, because of the RNG involved in the game you will find that some runs are easier and some runs are harder, but every run win is a victory earned and every defeat will be something in the end you can only really blame on yourself and mistakes you've made.My only gripe about the level design is that the procedural engine requires that the levels broken into linear branches. I.E. if a room has two diffrent doors that lead to two diffrent branches then those branches won't meet up again even if two rooms in those branches end up touching later on. Though it doesn't really distract from gameplay so it's a really minor thing.Story/Atmosphere/Theme:The atmosphere of this game is increadibly compelling with an artstyle and soundtrack that while simple are quite compelling. The theme is very dark and sinister and after more and more of the backstory is revealed about diffrent enemies and bosses and about the games world in general you'll find yourself wondering what exactly happened in the halls of Edgewood before Cordy woke up after the encounter again and what is really going on in the school.I have noticed many people commenting about the game's story feeling unfinished, but I can't really comment on that due to the fact that I haven't actually finished the game yet.My only advice in that regard is that if you do get this game that you should keep playing, the end might not exactly be where you thought it was and it might take a few more runs through before you can get to it. That's something I learned that plesantly surprised me.Replayability:The game like many of the more recent additions of this genera is predicated on being replayable. You will try and fail multiple times before you're finally able to succeed, and when you do succeed you'll unlock new content that will give you a reason to play through a few more times.The game also has a system where you can customize your character to a degree between runs. This is not only something that is nessary for you to do to be able to get through to the endgame content, but it's also something that allows you to experiment with competley diffrent playstyles and turn the game into something diffrent. An example of this would be that after you complete the prerequisite challenge and then unlock the option with the games credit system you can change Cordy's dodge roll into a blink. Another example of this is the option to drastically increase Cordy's health pool at the start for the downside of not being able to replenish your health normally. There are a number of big changes you can make like those as well as a very large number of minor tweeks you can make as well.As I mentioned in the above paragraph there are a multitude of challenges in the game and they all reward something, be that additonal credits, lore, item unlocks, character options, or even staight character upgrades. Some of them are rather simple, while others are diaboliclly difficult. If you are a completionist you will not be wanting for something to do with this game. Though if I remember correctly there is one specific challenge regarding the champion cat enemy that can appear that is either bugged or is just virtually impossible because the chance of finding that particular variant is effectivley zero.Oh, and did I mention that this game also has a hard mode for those of among us who might find the base games content too easy? I haven't tried it myself, so I can't speak about it, but whenever finish the game's base content then I'll be sure to let you know if it's balanced as well as the rest of the game.tl;drThis game is better than Binding of Issac, and this is coming from someone who has completed the original Binding of Issac and has 100% cleared Binding of Issac Rebirth and it's Afterbirth DLC (currently working on Afterbirth+ so I can leave a proper review on that game)			"

												A solid roguelike, very much like The Binding of Isaac.  I like a few things about this game a bit better, but it could really use some controller support.			"

												Worth picking up on sale if you like roguelikes and want something a bit different.  It's quite difficult, to the point that I finally gave up on it, but it makes an interesting entry into the roguelike genre.  Just don't expect something as good as Isaac, or any number of other rougelikes.			"

												However, the combination of sloppy design and unrewarding gameplay quickly dissolved what enjoyment I was deriving from the otherwise gorgeous art style.Problems arise the moment you press a directional key to shoot your fireball projectles. Hit detection is unreliable, your range is rubbish and the sound for smacking an enemy in the face is almost exactly the same as your projectile puttering out fight in front of them: I found myself firing at a boss thinking ""boy, this guy is really soaking up the hits"" only to realize that half of my shots are either landing harmlessly in front of him or striking/passing through a section that apparently doesn't take damage (And no, we're not talking about bosses who can only be hurt in one vulnerable section). And don't get me started on the fast, unpredictable bosses who are hard enough to hit WITHOUT the crazy amounts of shots they fire out.Enemy/room balancing leaves a lot to be desired. The game uses a ""lighting"" mechanic which makes it hard to see very far: a nice gimmick, but incredibly annoying when faced with enemies with extremely fast projectiles that come with no warning in huge rooms, or traps that spring when you come vaguely close. The props dealt about rooms lends some aethetic charm, but at times are difficult to predict whether they'll block movement or projectles. My main bugbear are certain enemies that fire slow moving clouds in your general direction. Doesn't sound too bad? Wait until there's four of them in a tight room, and they're all huddled away in hidey holes that can only be shot at from one direction (which you can't reach because the clouds chase you away while your aforementioned rubbish range can't hit them), AND there's an extra enemy who's raining down chairs so you can't even stand in the sweet spots for two seconds.I like hard games. I don't like games that get their difficulty from tedious play and horrible controls. I want to fail for reasons that are my fault, not because I didn't want to spend two minutes in ONE room taking potshot at those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ entrenched smog ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, or because I couldn't tell all my shots were missing because there's no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ audio/visual difference between hitting and missing something, or because the game wants to be a bullet hell without polished, reliable mechanics.And to think some people accuse this game of being a Binding of Isaac ripoff. If only that were true...			"

												This game tries very hard to be Binding of Isaac. In some ways, it succeeds, but in others, it fails.Our Darker Purpose features a fairly dark storyline involving rogue children in a boarding school of sorts, with a faculty akin to The Addams Family. Gameplay is very reminiscent of Binding of Isaac, as are the controls. Instead of bombs, you have chalk, which you can use to create puffs of chalk dust that damage and stun enemies caught within. Items are gained from killing minibosses or found in rooms similar to Binding of Isaac, though the game is much less accomodating and even the item rooms are generally full of traps and environmental hazards waiting to kill you. You have a dodge roll available (on a 2ish second cooldown) that can be used to move quicker or get out of tight spots, and works well with. You get health potions in the form of juice boxes that can be stored and used when needed, and rather than crying to damage enemies, you use some sort of magic to throw fireballs (this isn't really explained, at least in the first two chapters, which is what I've seen of the game as of the time of this writing). Completing levels and achievements earns you a currency which can be spent on unlocking permanent bonuses (extra juice box slots, for instance), and there's a number of passive bonuses that can be toggled on or off (you have a limited number of slots to fill with these, so choosing a set that works for your playstyle is key). This allows for a feeling of progression even when you aren't actually winning. This is good.The game has more RPG and less arcade feel than Binding did - you have a character sheet of sorts with actual stats like crit chance, dodge chance, damage resistance and hit points, all visible to you at any time you care to look. Items increase or decrease these stats, and damage you deal or take is shown via floating numbers so there's much less guesswork than in Binding. Similarly, items tell you exactly what they do when you pick them up (or review them on your character sheet) so there's no need to try and figure out what that thing you just picked up does.The game offers some interesting flavor / lore text attached to items, and bosses all come with a few paragraphs of lore (which becomes viewable when they're defeated), and occasionally after clearing a room the furnature (!) will have little conversations with each other that you can get tidbits of story hints from; I can't comment on the quality of the storyline conclusion (nor would I in a review such as this, but that's beside the point) as, as mentioned earlier, I haven't finished the game as of yet, but it's got enough mysterious elements to keep me interested.The game isn't without flaws, though - the biggest of which, in my opinion, is the hitboxes. They're very illogical in some cases, and it becomes a matter of trying to memorize what each enemy's hitbox looks like so you can hit them reliably. It's difficult to explain this without illustrations, but some enemies have a hitbox covering their entire body, while some, the hitbox only covers their lower half, some have hitboxes that are wider or skinnier than the actual sprite, and the furnature / obstructions in the rooms have even stranger hitboxes - from some angles, shots will go through them, and from others, shots will 'hit' them without actually touching them. This is by and large the most frustrating thing about the game, to me. It also doesn't help that the characters are very tall and thin, for the most part, so it's significantly more difficult to dodge something from the left or right than it is from the top or bottom, as your hitbox is significantly larger on those sides.Some of the room layouts can seem pretty unfair, especially considering the hitbox problems noted above. A particular enemy may normally be no problem at all, but in certain rooms, because of the number of unkillable traps and obstruction placement, may result in losing 30+ hit points (out of the base 100) before being able to kill it. While this is, naturally, part of the game, the room layouts in Binding of Isaac never felt anywhere near this big of a factor.The art style is very similar to Don't Starve (this may be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on your personal preference), and this art direction certainly doesn't detract from the experience. The animations feel a little lacking, though - characters have a 'walk left' and 'walk right' animation, and an 'attack' animation, but not much else. Granted most games of this style use a similar system, but it feels much more noticeable here than in others due to the detail of the sprites.Overall, the game is quite fun. It doesn't feel as polished as Binding of Isaac did, but if you enjoyed Binding's gameplay, you'll likely enjoy this, too.The Good:- Flavor / Lore is well done and interesting- Dodge roll mechanic leaves you feeling more in control- Items are interesting and varied- Gameplay is fairly addictive- Has a definite 'Just One More Try' effect- Bosses are varied and interesting (and numerous)The Bad:- Hit boxes are a little funky.- Some room layouts feel unfair, even very early in the game- Animations feel too lackluster considering the detail of the spritesOverall Verdict:Good game, worth the $15.

												Our Darker Purpose is a very addictive, fast paced, challenging game.  It keeps you on your toes, becoming reckless in just a few rooms can ruin a great run.  The challenges are a great added bonus difficulty to unlock perks that will help you ascend edgewood and defeat the schools hierarchy one floor at a time.  The chalk like aesthetics of the game are much more stylized than that cliche flash looking game of similar style. I'll be honest, even the lowly Brogs and Woundworts gave me trouble at first, but try after try I was easily making it to chapter 3 each time...which I'll admit I still haven't beaten the administrator.  There are a few bad corners to get caught up on, sometimes you almost feel cheated, or waiting for a bad run to turn good never happens, but it's still fun.  Runs are long, but you can quit mid run and return where you left off if you only have time for quick sessions.   Hit boxes can be wonkey,  with the parallax view it's sometimes better to aim at the center of an enemy than at the base.  I'd use a 3rd part controller config until they add one to the game, the default native controls are garbage.Overall I'd pick it over BoI any day.			"

Generally speaking it's good but not great save for the soundtrack, which is actually pretty great. If you liked BoI you'll probably like this, but you can certainly wait for it to be on sale without missing much.			"

												I'd like to retract my prior harsh statements on ODP. I was compairing this to one of the greatest games ever made (BoI) and didn't really review ODP as its own game with its own challenges and characteristics. What also made a huge difference for me was the updates in the hit detection. Which also shows that the dev's are listening, updating and I commend them for that. Surprisingly, the updates also balanced the games difficulty more and the shots seem a little less cheap. You still get stuck on just everything but is what makes this more challenging. What ODP does have in common with Binding of Isaac is how it is played. In BoI, the game cannot be beaten in one run, which is where ODP shares a commonality. The only other 2 things in common between them is the game play and large selection of random powerups. I am still a little disappointed in the mini bosses. A little more effort in the character design would go a long way and makes a huge difference both in first impressions and the replayability but I'll look past that. ODP overall is a good game, sorry not $14.99, but on-sale good. I can now recommend this to any twin stick shooter fan. I also retract my UGH!/10 rating and effective immediately, am giving this a 8/10. * -1 Miniboss clones, - 1 Progression = - 2#-+--+---+-------+------+---+-Prior-Review-+---+------+-------+---+--+-#Welp, it took me a couple games to make up my mind whether or not I liked this one and now that the nostalgia of a possible Binding of Isaac replacement fix has worn off I can now honestly say in one massively huge sigh, No, I do not like this one bit. First of all, this game, in every aspect of it is unfair, every little task seems like a chore, and has absolutely no balance to the dificulty, of which is only one, impossible. Also seems like every shot you take is a cheap one. Hit detection is♥♥♥♥♥♥poor on computer sprites, on top of being thrown into rooms which are traps with no way out. You are thrown into option screens at the most inopportune times. ""Press Start to die"" is what the menu should say. There is no progression as the first world at times can be harder than the next 2. I'm not sure if this is attributed by th random world generations or poor coding but the room design is aweful ans is comprised of some objects that make no sense but you'll get stuck on everyone of them! This game is not even a good challenge where it feels as if you did a little better you might make it through but feels more like Peyton Manning did after the first play of the Super Bowl. Hopeless. I really question if the hardness factor is due to a lack of content. I mean, if you can't reach the end, it's not like we know if its a short game. Boss fights are long, drawn out, and repetative. Mini bosses aren't original, just common enemies recolored, which are also repetative. Its like repeting repitious repitition. Out of 10 I give it an UGH!But! It all makes sense now. We know I what their darker purpose is... its to rip those BOI fans of their $14.99. Don't fall for it.			"

It has great graphics, animations, and its imagination clearly shines through.  For anyone who liked Binding of Isaac but couldn't get past the presentation (gross out humor, etc.), this is worth your time.  It does some things better than BoI and some things worse, but it is certainly a quality game from what little I've played. "

												A game with a Binding of isaac style gameplay with dark art and humor and also it's hard in fact maybe even harder due to angled shots, map having obstacles that will block your movement,  and your sight is limited to a range since it's almost in total darkness making you watch your rolls and navigation. You'll play as a school girl climbing a dark and dangerous randomized dungeon tower until you reach the top, killing crazy students and monsters alike on your way to unlock the doors. The path choices branches as you beat the levels and you will be able to pick the path that is right for you either it'll be hard or harder, along with randomized mobs, bosses and maps.. New items powerups passive ,useables, and a leveling system that'll give you 2 choice to pick from as you level up. pretty solid game. Watch out for the pot hoss Holy crap you'll know what i'am talking about.+The art is dark and morbid creepy but very cool+The game is hard (I like it)+The music is as creepy as the game+This game includes Lore!+powerups, passive skills, leveling system with choice on perks (usually 2),  randomized maps, bosses, and mobs = replayability supreme+Roguelike game, Death = permanent -No controller support-No voice acting for the texts- Can be fustrating if you suck at these sort of games expect plenty of death.

												Our Dark Purpose is in effect, a clone of Bindings of Isaac, I say this in a positive light as it has a lot to offer in its own right, but the similarities are too close to not state. As in bindings of Isaac, the game is a top down, survival Rogue-Lite game, with immense amounts of variety and randomness throughout, it features a mild horror element and is set within an orphan's home. (Or is it? dun dun) The game play is fun, though it will take a few tries to get used to and the boss fights are suitably epic, whilst I dont see the appeal lasting as long as Isaac, there is a nice progression system and I will enjoy the game immensely for the foreseeable future.

Posted: February 8, 2014
												This game... It's actually pretty hard to recommend it, although I really want to do it. It has nice visuals, great art style and pleasant music. It has a certain Burton-esque feel because of that, which I like, I won't lie. In gameplay terms ""Our Darker Purpose"" looks like a follow-up to ""The Binding of Isaac"", there's no doubt about that. And to a degree it does some things even better that ""Isaac"" - personally, I like the fact that rooms are different in size almost every time, instead of 3x3 blocks in ""Isaac"". It gives variation. With that, and with addition of a level up mechanic and the ability to roll and dodge, it makes this game to stand out next to ""TBoI"". But...There are problems. And they are pretty bad. First of all, level up benefits and bonuses from items. They are practically non-existent. The only time I actually saw a slight change in combat performance was with rate of fire, and that was only because I've leveled this stat with basically every level up and item that have dropped from mini-bosses. And again - this was almost a non-existent change. As for the other stats... Well, there was no feel of change at all - not with range of fire, not with movement speed, not with anything.The movement speed is one of the biggest problems. You move with the speed and grace of a snail, no matter how many level ups you dump into a movement speed upgrades. Developers added the roll as a way to move faster, sure, but it doesn't make it better. It feels more like a cheap way to justify the roll mechanic.There is another problem - hit detection. I have a feeling that the hit box of your character is actually bigger than the characther herself. Because of that it's hard to say when you would take damage and when not. Not to mention an always present chance of stucking in an environmental object while walking or rolling at the most crucial moment because of those odd hit boxes. But it's worse with enemies. Some times your projectiles just fly through them, doing nothing. Granted, that's more likely to happen with enemies bigger then Cordy. For instance, the only way to actually hit that tall-as-a-mountain girl who throws chairs at you is (when you are not above or under her) is to shoot in her legs/belly. Why? She is twice as big as Cordy! Why I can't shoot her in a head, for god sake?With all that, the game is supposed to be that ""fiendishly hard platformer/action"", I guess. Basically a game genre on it's own these days. Yes, it is hard. But not in a good way, unfortunatly. Take, for instance, ""They bleed pixels"". It is a great ""fiendisly hard platformer"". Why? Because it's hard but fair. Unfortunatly I can't say the same about ""Our Darker Purpose"". Here all this difficulty comes mostly from one source - the game throws tons of projectiles and enemies at you at the same time. Combine that with odd hit detection, slow movement speed, basically non-existent stat changes, and you get your ""fiendish"" difficulty. And what's more depressing is that it feels cheap. ""You want your game to be very difficult? Make your character slow, make his damage output weak and throw tons of stuff at him! Have fun!"".Overall, would I recommend this game at all, considering its problems?.. Suprisingly, yes. Under all these problems lies a good game. It's just that right now ""Our Darker Purpose"" feels unpolished, almost unfinished in terms of game mechanics. Would I recommend you to buy it? Yes. Maybe not for a full price, but yes. Support ""Avidly Wild Games"", show them that this game has potential on the market, that gamers are interrested in it. So that they would look at all these problems and fix them. Because this game deserve this.			"

But it's still fair and also, every time you die, that run wasn't a complete waste, since you get crystals to upgrade stuff for future runs.Generally, the game has an awesome, Tim Burton-like art style, combined with very atmospheric music.The mechanics work a lot like The Binding Of Isaac, but faster, harder and with bigger rooms. Especially the boss monsters are freaking creative and cool to fight. Some are harder than others, but with the right upgrades and playstyle, you should be able to defeat every single one of them.So yeah, if you aren't a complete newbie in the Indie Game-szene, I'm definitely giving a big ""YES"" for this game, it's really worth every penny!

												ODP is a great game, full of tense moments and replayability. It will invariably draw comparisons to the Binding of Isaac, and fair enough, it's probably the most similar game to it. People will say the devs copied, devs will say they were inspired... play ODP for a bit and you won't care. If you like the play-style of BoI you will love this and comparisons will melt away as you get drawn to ODPs unique features it brings to the genre. Comparisons at this stage are possibly analogous to saying Sonic ripped off Mario because one came later and similarly involved jumping on platforms, picking up coins/rings and powerups in a side-scrolling 2D environment -I'm sure there will be others a lot like BoI to come. But ODP is great in its own right and excels at putting together a creepy room-crawler that feels like some kind of macabre harry potter adams family mish-mash. The lore and occasional talking furniture keep things interesting and darkly light-hearted and the music and art evidence that a lot of love went into making this. For a first game, Avidly Wild games did a great job. I've somehow invested over 100 hours in BoI, so I look forward to being ruined by this.			"

												Our Darker Purpose is an outstanding ""rogue-lite"" action RPG. The influence from The Binding Of Isaac is obvious, however the game is vastly different. The mechanics are amazing, and give the game its own, distinct feel. In particular, the class and level up system are amazing methods of tackling character customisation. The graphics and music are a delight to behold, and assist in the immersion of the game. The game is challenging, and I would say more so than The Binding Of Isaac. However, it has kept me coming back for more attempts despite this. Having just cleared the final chapter, I am currently hunting a couple more achievements before moving on to hardmode (another wonderful addition which in a sense makes the game 1.5 times longer.)The lore is another difference from The Binding Of Isaac. It gives an additional layer of mystery and story to this already wonderful game, and it will make you curious about what exactly the game is about.Definitely give it a try!			"

												It's a challenging roguelike with mechanics somewhat similar to Binding of Isaac (in that you uncover rooms and pick up activated and passive items), but the gameplay feels very different.  There are OP builds and bad builds for sure, but it doesn't go too far in either direction.  Your skill plays a big roll in whether you'll succeed, which is a nice thing.  I also like the theme.  The artwork, music, and lore are really nice.  I really like the writing in this game even though it's not super common.My favorite thing about this game is probably the floor generation.  Each floor can have a different modifier that adds a special trait to that floor.  The traits can be good or bad, but a lot of them are both good and bad at the same time.  For example, ""wealthy"" makes more money spawn on the floor, but you can't spend money on that floor because there are no shops.  After you finish a floor, you're allowed to choose the next floor from a pool of 2 to 3 floors, and you can consider these special traits in your decision.My least favorite thing about this game is the bad controller support.  Walking/attacking/using items are all fine, but the default keymappings for the menus are really dumb and you can't change them.  It makes no sense to hit the start button for ""confirm"" and the back button for ""cancel"", rather than the A and B buttons.  I get that the A and B button are also used to shoot, but you're not shooting while you're in a menu. But the biggest offender is how you have to press down the right stick to pick up an item.  This is already a weird button, but what makes it really dumb is that moving the right stick brings up the menu.  So if you're trying to pick up an item, you might end up bringing up the menu instead.  Even better, there's a glitch where if you bring up the menu while you pick up an item, the item's description pop-up goes blank so now you don't know what the item does.  You can see the item's description in the menu, luckily, but if it's an activated item, you're out of luck since those don't seem to show up in the menu.So yeah, keyboard users will have no trouble, this game is great.  Controller users... well, the game is still playable and enjoyable, and you can try joy-to-key.  But I hope they fix these issues someday, since it's really the only thing that annoys me about the game.			"

												Is it fun? Yes. So why do I not recomend it? Because I could be playing a handful of other Rogue-Lites that do this better. BoI has more items, more characters, more bad guys, more variance and that adds up to more replayability.What it does bring to the table is a very solid look. The art design is amazing and I love it. The ability to dodge is a very nice addition.However, there is one very large issue, readability. Hit boxes are not what they seem, and due to how the art is set up, you can find yourself geting hung up on odd things or being hit when you thought you were in the clear.Its fun, but there are better out there.

												Playing this game, I had to check several times to make sure it wasn't an early access; the game feels horribly unfinished, and uncreative. It is, at its heart, a Binding Of Isaac clone, set in a haunted/♥♥♥♥♥♥/abusive orphanage/boarding-school. The issues with this game are not in its concept, but in its execution. Binding Of Isaac works because of randomly generated but stable room plans, simple yet challenging monsters, and hundreds of wacky but serviceable powerups, all of which build on eachother to make a game that takes seconds to learn, and weeks to master. ODP falls flat on each and every one of those points. The room plans are disorganized and random, with hazards and set dressing not clearly divided, and the rooms themselves often being far too large to suit the gameplay. The enemies have very little variation, and only offer challenge in situations where you get boxed in and have no other choice than to take damage to escape. The powerups, what should be the most interesting and creative aspect of a rogue-lite game, are bafflingly bland and do little other than provide paltry bonuses which hardly ever change how you pay the game, compared to better games of the same type where a single item can change playstyle completely, or at least open up new options. To top it all off, the gameplay is functional, but features many features it flat out does not need, from chalk-dust clouds that are objectivly useless, to treasure chests and items requiring manual interaction (why would I not want to just pick it up? Why can I only interact with treasure chests from one side?). To make matters worse, though the game is obviously sprite based, it tries to emulate an isometric layering effect, which only produces annoying hit detection issues, especially on bosses. I could honestly go on about everything the devs did wrong in this game, and how the lore and art style have a ton of great potential, but I think anyone who wont listen to me  already owns this game, anyone who's curious will no longer be interested in buying it, and anyone who thinks this game looks like crap will just end up saving money.

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a Roguelike  game.Interface/Menu/SettingsYou can play in fullscreen mode or windowed mode.You are able to play the game with a controller. But not recommended.You can change the controls on the keyboard.There is a master volume slidebar available. It changes by 10% each time.There is a music volume slidebar available. it changes by 10% each time.There is a sound volume slidebar available. it changes by 10% each time.You are able to delete your save file.About the game.If you know the game ""Binding of Isaac"", Then you will know the basics about the gameplay in this game too. You have to walk in each room, killing all the enemies and move onto the next room. Killing enemies will give you experience, which will you need to level up. Once you are level up, You can choose between 1 of the 2 books to get the permanent effect. The books are always random whenever you level up. Whenever you have reached the boss room. You will have to kill the boss in order to move to a higher floor. Each boss has their own challenge. Like the dragon boss ""Kill him without taking any damage"". You can choose your own floor direction and some even has their own effect. This could be positive but also negative for you, so read the last lines of the current floor to know what the floor is about. Sometimes you might encounter mini-bosses they usually drop items. Great soundtrack.Good atmosphere.Able to unlock lores and perks.Able to get experience and level up.Each boss has their own kind of a challenge.Has item list. Alot of fun.Difficult.You have a map in the middle of the screen and you are able to toggle this off with TAB. Map will not show you the boss location/shop location or any other things. Only the paths.Other things.Darker version than binding of isaac.Sometimes the hitbox are a bit off.Sometimes the desks are talking, This could provide information.-------------------I Give this game a 8/10			"

												Better designed than Binding of Isaac, in my opinion, with more child-friendly creepiness.  While BoI has deep (and mocking) religious undertones, uncomfortable flesh and bodily function creepiness, and other such strange design choices, Our Darker Purpose feels more like Tim Burton - just slightly dark and creepy and spooky.Even though it has problems, like the controller support being half-hearted (but functional), the game is a fun rogue-like-lite.

												So, i bought this game, and i must say - it isnt worth it. At least at its current state (and its not alpha, so i dont think its getting a lot better later).First complain - there is not much things to do. Lets compare it to something like Binding Of Isaac. On each floor it has secret rooms, item room, shop, consumables are constantly dropping like pills, tarot cards, chests, there is a meta-games with keys and bombs involved and its not even full list of stuff you can find in isaac. But in here, there is barely anything going on, except klling enemies over and over again. Yeah there is a vending machine on each level, but you rarely get enough money to buy stuff, and there is not that much stuff you can buy, in first place. And yeah there is a level up mechanics, but again, it happens rarely.Second complain - too much freaking invincible enemies. I guess its developers trying to solve the problem of there not being much to do. So you are constantly feeling at least something. And the thing i felt was anger. In every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ room, not one, but several enemies you cant do anything about.Third complain - scarcity of items. At least in my experince i was getting like 5-7 same items every time i played the game. Are there even more items exist? And also, you get items rarely.So in the end, this game sure has its positives, but all the negatives mentioned above are killing any fun you could have had.If youre a fan of Binding Of Isaac, dont buy this game - you'll be disappointed.

												I'm struggling with it. The primary villain is darkness - it's yet another game that thinks that ""not being able to see anything"" is equivalent with ""moody and immersive"". There's other minor problems (eg: hitbox bigger than character) but mostly it's the darkness. The art is nice, so let me see it! Another problem is that so many of the upgrades are yawn-worthy 10% bonuses - coming from Binding of Isaac where every pickup alters your character in some way, a 10% bonus as a reward is pretty miserable.It's not terrible. There's some interesting ideas, but also some things that don't quite gel. For example, the art is bleak gothic boarding school, but the main character has an anime face. Enemies attack you with things you'd find in such a boarding school, but the main character attacks with some sort of mystical zappiness that spins around her waist (admittedly, I haven't got past chap 1 yet, so this may get explained later)I'd give it a thumbs up - it's a reasonable game - but that bloody darkness is just frustrating, and so far, hasn't added anything to gameplay nor immersion for me.

YouTube™ Video: MOB Review: Our Darker Purpose 

			Views: 81		

			Our Darker Purpose is a Rogue-lite game now available on Steam here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/262790/ Please thumbs up and share the video if you are feeling generous, or thumbs down if you...		

Our Darker Purpose is a Rogue-lite game done with a strong bite in its difficulty. It holds its theme well as its art style and atmosphere fit all together as the levels ups and items are well placed and balanced. Its not a game for people new to Rogue-lites as it will chew you up and spit you out, why spit you out because your not good enough to be in its belly.

												Long before Binding of Isaac (BoI), there was a diverse cornucopia of rogue-likes. This is not one of them. Instead, it borrows whole-heartedly from the formula that made BoI so successful. The similarities make it impossible to review in its own universe.First, the difficulty is increased relative to BoI. This isn't neccessarily a bad thing, but I would recommend you play that game first if you are unfamiliar with the top-down rogue-like.The artistic direction is superb. It still certainly draws on themes from BoI, but still manages to differentiate itself through its story-telling which was by-and-large non-existent in BoI. The story is generally told in the form of text with accompanying images, through small chunks of ""lore"" found after accomplishments, or by overhearing the conversations of sacks of potatoes. The small details like chattering furniture paint a more complete picture of the Edgeworth School for Lost Children.The quantity and variety of items is somewhat lackluster. Most items act solely to adjust the unseen variables of the system (e.g. +10% movement speed. +10% range.) The items which alter gameplay stand out, but are relatively rare and thus, the stat-altering items feel monotonous by comparison. Sure, it is easier to design several items around the ""attack speed"" variable, but grabbing those items is not as impactful as picking up one that changes the trajectory of projectiles.However, ODP play the rogue-like balance well. As opposed to a more hardcore rogue, it has a system of persistent upgrades known as ""classes"" which grant the player new traits. The classes add depth by removing some of the randomness over multiple playthroughs while not detracting from the difficulty. Additionally, it incorporates a ""leveling"" system within each individual session that allows the player to augment the strength of the character to suit his styles.Overall, if you like BoI, you will like Our Darker Purpose. You are getting the same dish cooked and served by a new chef.If you haven't played BoI, you can still enjoy Our Darker Purpose, albeit with a slightly steeper difficulty curve. In either case, if you are looking for a challenging game saturated in gallows humor, I would recommend Our Darker Purpose.			"

It's simular yes but it is it's own game with it's own power structure to it, which does swing both for it and against it. One way to look at this game is that it's like The Binding of Isiac, with simular combat style, mapping, and ""pick-ups"" that last only as long as your current treck. It also has a persistant aspect like League of Legends, where the credits you earned from your last few runs can be used to buy other passive upgrades like starting fromt he second floor, or start with more in run currency. The good thing about the system is that yes it does allow you to slowly get more powerful and rewards you for playing well. That being said i'm stuck on the first chapter because I either suck at know how to dodge(likely), or i'm not getting good combos to kill things or kite them quick enough. Overall this game is fun with some glitches like being randomaly teleported away from a boss room into a black room. This game is still enjoyable to play with it's humour and references while still having a very dark storyline.			"

												This game is a very difficult progressive dungeon crawler, and unfortunately I can't recommend it because I don't derive any pleasure for it at all. Binding of Isaac was fun, most definitely, and this game tries to emulate the cutesy-creepy angle with a more ""Addams Family gothic"" angle, and while that's always pleasing (if a bit shallow), the mechanics are a bit stilted and I don't feel like I die knowing any more strategy than before. Also, it has the very annoying habit of claiming it's already running when it isn't, so accessing the game in the first place is nearly impossible. I can start up all my other games except for this one. Much like a leech, it seems to latch on out of sight until it meeses up my other processes. Restarting my laptop takes time, and time is money. And if I'm wasting time, I'm wasting money. AND THAT'S JUST SICK.			"

												This game at first may resemble The Binding of Isaac in playstyle but those who asume have not played enough of Binding of Isaac or Our Darker Purpose. In Binding of Isaac the run you have is dictated through the items you get and even the most mediocre player can easily beat Binding of Isaac with the right combination of items. But Our Darker Purpose on the other hand relies on the skill of the player far more than the items that you get. I am not saying Binding of Isaac does not  rely on skill butit definitly requires less. In Binding of Isaac the boss's you face can all be brute forced while in Our Darker Purpose some boss's can not be beaten unless a certain tactic is employed. This along with the level up system, the constant lore that is provided (granted you look for it), and gothic drawn art style paired with harrowing music provide a very enjoyable experience.			"

												One of the better games I've played recently! Great story to go along with the gameplay. I love that this game is difficult because it makes it that much more rewarding as I get better and better at it. There are tons of items and other game mechanics, including a leveling system, that create a unique run every time. The floors are random also adding to the replay-ability of this game. It is certainly worth the money if you like this type of almost twin stick shooter style game.I have some videos here: www.youtube.com/user/Chikari2010 of the game if you'd like to check that out before buying.

I don't know if it's the art style or how the game actually seems to handle that puts me off. It just feels like it isn't as polished as what it should be. This being said I was originally really excited for this game as it was coming out as I love rougelikes. I enjoyed it a little at first ,however, I think even the flash version of Isaac feels more polished than this game.			"

The RPG elements on this game is quite intriguing as they all use different types of text book stuff from yoru usla rpg games.

												Our Darker Purpose is a great tribute to classic (older) and modern  rogue-like games. True, it does share similarities to many familiar ones (Binding of Isaac is a frequently over used comparison by example), however, it is quite a bit different in quite a few ways.  This game has a harsh learning curve, you will die, you will be punished for mistakes, you will in general get stomped in some runs when you wished you hadn't. In return though, your experience in learning the patterns of the enemies, unlocking challenges, items, courses, and more will help with your progression through this amazing, yet harsh game.The soundtrack is a mixed bag, many of the themes are quite memorable in my opinion, including but not limited too:  Welcome to Edgewood (level 1 theme) to Madness theme a later stage boss's theme. Catchy, dark (sinister), and very suting for your romp through Edgewood's dark halls.The level up system you gain from killing enemies by obtaining EXP, are actually quite useful most of the time which some powers can easily make or break a run, depending on the RNG of which traits you manage to obtain in a run. For example one level up trait allows you to gain +1 damage for each Edgewood coin you pick up. Which doesn't sound that good until you start picking up large quantities of coins and watch your default 60-80 damage hitting for upwards of 150-300 damage in later stages if you manage to find a fortune of coins.The course system which are perma-traits you can unlock and choose which to use can also be quite helpful, whether it be giving you a few additional starting Juice Boxes (which help restore HP when you are damaged by enemies or the misc. traps within Edgewood) to giving your critical hit a boost, to even expanding each individual room by 3 rooms.  Sure, you are forced to pick and choose which one you will start with, but most of them feel quite useful.The enemies and bosses within the game are well varied,  and as you progress main enemies get improved in their damage dealing capabilities, and how much they themselves can endure which is also true for the bosses.  Sure, for a few floors you may face similar generic enemies, but they do switch up as you progress. Like I made mention of the learning curve, of how you approach each floor, the traits of each floor (which also givs variety to each independent floor) makes this a very harsh but rewarding game.In comparison to similar games (Binding of Isaac): Yes, they are both rogue-like games, that have you progressing through levels, killing bosses, and obtaining a random assortment of items with varying effects, that's about where the comparison ends however:Where Binding of Isaac is only moderately (at best) difficult, Our Darker Purpose is quite a learning experience in both success and failure.  Where Binding of Isaac most runs are easily feasible as long as you don't get certain items, Our Darker Purpose requires you to be wise to your own playstyle, and make wise decisions if you wish to progress far. Where Binding of Isaac main mechanics revolve around the items, in Our Darker Purpose, the items, level up traits, Course abilities, and even level traits will majorly effect how the game plays out. But in the long run, if you can handle facing a challenge or don't mind a learning curve, this game is certainly a worthy purchase, and now and then it still gets updated with tweaks (new level traits/items/etc.)... To finish, this game is great, and I easily recommend it.			"

												If you can get this game on sale and you enjoy roguelikes then go ahead and pick it up for a few hours of fun. It plays differently than any other roguelike so don't go in expecting it to be Binding of Isaac other than room exploration. One of the real nice features is a store like aspect that lets you unlock upgrades and tweeks to how the game plays using currency use earn in each playthrough. +Cute animations+More story that I was expecting and more than most roguelikes+Nice purchasable aspect that sets it apart-not quite as polished as other games-no 'save' system that lets you pick up where you left off if you have to leave-can be a little cryptic (but what game isn't these days)			"

												It's Binding of Isaac but with core gameplay that fails to engage. Character movement and shooting feels clunky, and bosses are tedious, home-made affairs. Novel ideas, like rooms larger than a single screen, are poorly executed when in practice they result in the player running into haphazardly placed enemies they couldn't see at the initial scroll. The art is often difficult to read, and hitboxes are wonky.The overwrought text interludes and gothic aesthetic are potentially charming, but don't make up for the sheer clunkiness of moving and shooting in a game that relies on those things as its core mechanics. At this price, a very bad idea!			"

This might be alright!But wait, I hear they're angry, ""die now!"", that cred.Is that where my subconscious thinks to send this this cool kid?Well, I guess so, but I'll see when I get there.I hope I'm prepared for Edgewood's upper layers!

It would be like refurbishing my old 80's PC and playing a text-based RPG game.Story is there, but otherwise it is a misdemeanor of gaming history.A few of the exact same desks or boxes randomly scattered in the dungeons, and call it a ""randomly generated"" adventure game.Great story content, but repetitive gameplay, direction-locked attacking, repetition in layout, counter-intuitive level design, and a shoddy game engine, all kill this game.It's a struggle to keep even a moderate FPS without near crashing at times, or experiencing HEAVY lag in sound, as well as some poorly mapped hit-boxes for the player's character model, not following how the enemymodel hit boxe mechanics act.If you want a game for bullet-hell, go play a professionally made title such as Touhou.Don't purchase this indie-game disgrace, it is a flat-out waste of money, in my honest opinion.Somewhat of a good idea, but terrible execution botched this one for me.3/10			"

												If you love Binding of Isaac, you'll very much enjoy this game. It has slightly more of a story and has exp points that allow you to pick between two random upgrades per level up. Add in the item system similar to BoI and you've got yourself a very enjoyable game. The fact that the main character is slow but can roll to dodge attacks brings in something new to the action roguelike genre. To be honest, I still think BoI is the superior title because of the synergy between items and combos and challenges, but this is still worth the price that I paid for it ($10 as of this post). I'm still enjoying it 22 hours later. Definitely recommended, and I hope more ""BoI clones"" are made.			"

												An excellent challenge, difficult in all the right ways.Anyone looking for a change of pace from Binding of Isaac or whatever your latest roguelike is should absolutely check this game out. Thoughtful, well-balanced controls combined with well designed encounters leaves you with a game that rewards you for your increasing skill at surviving, while setting the bar higher notch by notch across four robust chapters.When they say brutal difficulty, they are not joking. Straight into the first chapter or even the first floor you will find yourself barely scraping by your first few runs, but though it may be unforgiving, it is also fair. The difficulty curve is smooth, and every monster has a clearly obvious attack pattern, every bullet is easy to track. Nothing you come up against will surprise you, but that doesn't lessen the challenge. If anything, it adds to the enjoyment. It's very satisfying to come out the other side of a difficult boss battle unscathed knowing that it was purely your skill and experience that got you through it.Character customization is fairly robust in the form of 'lessons,' powers you unlock over time and can then mix and match at the start of the game. Through this system you could, say, shoot while rolling. Or, alternatively, shoot further while standing still. It's a nice way to complement your individual playstyles. In addition, you can level up through your run and choose from a pair of random perks to further enhance or alter your play. Combine that with 80 items and you've got plenty of variety run to run to enjoy. Certain items even offer challenges of their own to activate, and the most powerful can break after you take damage, further incentivizing smarter and better play.It's not without it's certain annoyances, however, and the worst offender is probably the room terrain. Objects can be 'sticky' or in fact be angular when they do not appear to be so. Seems minor until you realize your dodge was halted by an unseen prong sticking out from a desk, or a bouncing projectile suddenly taking a hard 60 degree turn off the door frame. You can learn to adjust to this, but it's counterintuitive and could have been better executed.Those small issues aren't be nearly enough to throw me off what is a great game. One of the few roguelikes I constantly walk away from with a sense of satisfaction, as I and the game both know I did better this time than the last.Highly recommended.Be sure to check out my video review for a partial run and some gameplay footage along with me saying juice box wrong a MILLION times:

												Our Darker Purpose is (let's not beat around the bush) a bad Binding of Isaac clone I do not recommend at all.Pros:-Well designed bosses-Power-up system is well done-Good artstyle (Very reminiscent of Don't Starve)-Wide variety of enemiesCons:-Repetitive-There is something wrong with the hitboxes, making some bosses way too hard.-Boring-Unrewarding-Your character is underpowered-Bad animations-Items have almost no influence on your characterBottem line: Tries way too hard to immitate the Binding of Isaac and ends up being inferior.The game feels like it is very much unfinished.I don't recommend it, even when on sale.

												Imagine if you got Tim Burton to write the premise of a Binding of Isaac-type game, and then had dearly departed illustrator Edward Gorey do the visuals. Then imagine it was fiendishly difficult, cleverly based on King Lear, and had rooms that weren't locked into one shape and size like in BoI. Pretty cool, right?			"

												Our Darker Purpose is a decent top-down roguelike shooter in the style of Binding of Isaac, which is to say, it has a similar perspective and level layout to Legend of Zelda: Link to the Past, minus the puzzles.You'll quickly discover, however, that Our Darker Purpose lacks the terrific depth and balance of the truly great roguelike games.As you progress you'll find passive powerups which provide any number of abilities, from adding bubbles to your projectiles to speeding up your foot speed. Sadly, you'll find these powerups are mostly useless, and you'll inevitably find yourself slowly, slowly, losing the game due to gradual loss of health. There juist isn't enough health around, and there aren't enough tokens (money). Time and again you'll find a vending machine and barely have any money to spend. There aren't nearly enough enemy or level drops of money or health, and, as the aforementioned powerups aren't very compelling or suseful, you'll be wondering why you're even playing, there's no sense of progression, you never feel like you're really getting more powerful.all this might be acceptable if the gameplay itself was spectacular, which it's not. The enemies and graphics quickly become repetitive (there's almost no color whatsoever), and the game's overall darkness also makes it less fun than it should be.Not a bad game, maybe check it out if you're a huge fan of BoI roguelikes, but otherwise avoid.

												Oh jesus. Oh man. I so wanted to like this game. But wow its so boring. Not really bad, just really really boring.Now, I've played many Isaac-esque games and I've loved most, one or two even taking my favor over isaac. And not once did I feel the need to compare the two. But in this case? The entire time I played it (which if you look really isnt long) I just kept thinking 'This is isaac this is isaac' until I realized 'No, of course its not, Isaac was actually fun.'Lets start with the positives. The music is gorgeous, I adore the soundtrack to this and hoestly, despite not liking the game I would buy the soundtrack. The art style is great, for what setting they were going for it works, almost like a more detailed 'Dont Starve' look to it. They also have a dodge roll type feature which I like the idea of, but it also has its downsides. But thats really all I can give it.I found this game just didn't feel right, it lacked the polish. First off, the controls, your forced to used the keyboard only, so WASD for movement, arrows for shooting. And right away that put me off, I didn't like those controls in isaac (Used mouse in the first and controller in rebirth) and I certainly don't like them here. They feel really tight, and not in the good way, you feel so restricted to having both hands in a set place on your keyboard and the fluid motions of moving and using the mouse for shooting cant be replicated through a keyboard. Also but having to use the keyboard, you are forced to snake your fingers around trying to use your active item, chalk or rolling. Yeah remember I said about rolling having its downsides? Being forced to use the keyboard it limits how effective the rolling can really be when your also trying to shoot at the time time almost making the rolling redundant.The animations are lazy. I can't really say it any other way than that. Especially on the main character (Cordy) where you would expect to see the most. Her movements look clunky (all 3 frames of it (not including the rolling)) and most enemies just seem to rock side to side. One thing I find amusing is the store page for this game 'Key Features: Fast-Paced'. Let me tell you, it most certainly is not. The combat is so incredibly tedious and slow its insane. Even the weakest of the enemies take more than a necessary amount of hits. I've seen people say that this adds a level of depth and strategy to the game. I say it adds too much monotony and repepativeness to the game. While were talking about combat, you know with isaac how shooting things feels so satisfying? You feel the thud, you hear the collision? You don't get that with this. Due to everything taking so long to die it became quick to realize that its not satisfying to shoot things, the sound effects are incredibly bad and really get on your nerves really fast plus things just seem to waltz through your shots like nothing. I also saw someones review saying 'Where The Binding of Isaac is a fast-paced, almost bullet-hell game', which yes isaac is much more fast-pace, but the 'bullet-hell' thing also applys to this game, more so than isaac in my opinion. While not directly bullets the begining floors at least had A LOT of electrifying obsticals making it very difficult to maneuver while in combat and not getting hit. Not to mention the second boss I faced (some cauldron thing) which quite literally a bullet hell boss, an insanely tanky one at that.So while no its not a bad game per-sey, its incredibly boring and slow and while you play it, like it or not your thinking 'Isaac did this better'. With that I genuinely cannot recommend this game when other games like Isaac, Hero Seige, Risk Of Rain etc exist.			"

												Beware, this game should display a large ""early access"" sign, because it is rather unfinished....at least that is how it feels to me at the moment.You basically run along a maze of rooms tht are mapped automatically while you enter them.In those rooms, you either face monsters (some of which are creative while some are not) or end up with a vending machine.Because most rooms will be filled with monsters, I'll simply skip the vending machine.Fighting those monsters is where the game shows its lack of polish:- walking around is slower than most monsters can walk, so they'll catch up easily and (without displaying a special animation) will take a bite off of your health- in order to ""outrun"" those monsters, you'll find yourself rolling around the rooms aimlessly (while always having to push the space bar again for each roll)- you actually have to fight monsters, or rather shoot them with small fire balls - which would not be too bad, were it not for a terrible aiming system (you can walk diagonally, but for some obscure reason are only able to shoot vertically or horizontally)- there is no visual feedback for a hit besides the white number floating up (the enemy does not stop in place, there's no blood, no bursting flame, no ...) which kind of ruins the whole fight monsters in almost every singe room-principle- boss monsters (I've only faced a dragon so far) will follow a set path and ignore the player (they would probably follow that path even if there was no player), with only a few flames appearing on the ground from thin air stalking the player and trying to catch up with him (again: those flames are as fast as the player if not faster, so you need to roll around - again)- the animations are rather stiff and resemble games of the Play Station-era (which would be fine, if this game was a homage to those times - but seeing that there is no further resemblance, I am not willing to follow that thought)Overall, I can't help but wonder whether this game might have been enjoyable if it had seen a lot more polish....or had been honest about its unfinished state beforehand.

												As far as the gameplay goes, it's what you expect. Smooth, challenging, constantly on your toes fun. Lives up to the atmosphere displayed in the trailer, the literature is fantastic. Unfortunately that becomes difficult to enjoy.For some reason though the development and engineering of this game is horrible. The 2GB ram requirement is a LIE because the game runs 2/3 instances at a time, it can easily eat up 3 - 4 (as far as I can physically tell) gigs of ram for absolutely no reason other then the developer chose not to leak memory and after constant play (unless you have a few spare gigs of ram floating about, which most do up to 8) it will start skipping freezing up until crash. The game also constantly writes to a sql server running concurrently to store data for *every* stat (no literally everything, constantly) in the game, rather then your own computer. I play on a junk system sure (I only have 2gigs of ram), the requirements fit up for me, so I should of had no problem enjoying this. But I've had a HORRIBLE time trying to enjoy this due to poor development (engine?/Scripting? wise) and I'm shocked that steam allows such poorly designed indie games in their store. I guess I'll have to study a lot more about the game/read more reviews before purchase then trust the minimum specs. I feel like I shouldn't need a LOT of processing power to run this. Don't recommend.			"

												This game tries to similar to Binding of Isaac. The setting and art style is unique (Harry Potter vs. Tim Burton) and there are many rewards and unlockables.Everything is fine except the most important part: gameplay. Playing is just no fun, really slow even when rolling. That kills an action game for me. Player movement and shot frequency should be doubled from the beginning.As in BoI optimizing the character means backtracking the level -> even more slow creeping around.I wanted to see the unlockables and the higher level rewards but it feels like work not playing.

												This game is kind of like a different flavor of the Binding of Isaac.  It goes for dark and creepy instead of gross and unsettling.  The game features relatively tight controls, a feeling of progression as you can unlock new abilities each play through, even though each death sets you back to the beginning, and there is a wonderful sense of lore and mystery surrounding the story.  I don't like the ending, but the game itself is solid, save for a few hit box issues, where larger enemies have to be hit in the center to take any damage...which is annoying.  However, I consider this a fun little rogue-like, and the addition of a dodge roll makes this feel much more fluid and survivable than many out there.  It's tough, but ultimately, surprisingly addicting.			"

												In It's current state ODP is slightly lack-luster in terms of balance, sure the roguelikey design does encourage unfair gameplay but while this can be used to create a more engaging game this game takes it much farther then is appreciated.Difficulty is often conducive to engagement in a game where it is implimented well, it allows the feeling of immense satisfaction when the player eventually overcomes the obstacles that once held them back so much, however with bad implimentation as is the case in Isaac and sadly ODP as well.ODP does greatly depend on luck for pickups and such, luck varies less than in Isaac howver that is simply because the game does not have any memorable or standalone powerful items.The hitboxes are incredibly unfinished with player hitboxes being larger then they graphically appear and for some stupid reason circular items have square hitboxes, in summnation the game is very, very unfinished but it is very promising.As of yet I do not reccommend it			"

												I hadn't heard too much of Our Darker Purpose, and it popped back onto my radar when I read an article about it on Joystiq or Polygon. Logged onto Steam when it was released, bought it, and have been thoroughly enjoying it. I haven't played much at the time of this review (just under an hour), but it's got me hooked, and as soon as I have a block of free time, a lot of it will be devoted to this game.The visuals are dark, good, and oddly cute. The gameplay is fast and frantic. I love the difficulty, and that dying forces you to restart from the beginning. Being a roguelike game, levels will always be different, and therefore it will be extremely hard to predict who will be in what room, if that same room even exists.The multiple pathways and plethora of items to collect guarantee replayability, and each playthrough will provide more details and more background to why Edgewood is the way it is. I'm a huge fan of story games, so I'm anxious to get as much as information as possible. There are multiple items to pick up throughout to help you, such as increased attack speed, or move faster after every roll (moreso than the default speed increase). Leveling up allows you to read a book, which offers a nice boost. As a beginner to this game and dying quite frequently, I like taking the extra life book, assuming it pops up. Again, a roguelike game, so level up bonuses might not be the same.I'm in love with the soundtrack, and if it's ever offered as a purchase, I'd buy it.I easily recommend Our Darker Purpose to everybody and anybody.

												In my very recently developed passion for roguelike games, I stumbled upon Our Darker Purpose on the Steam frontpage. Initially I was going to discard it as another indie game that sold entirely on the premise of its pretty art, but seeing as it was a roguelike, I decided to try out my new payment method by buying it.Well, those ten dollars could have been better spent.True to its roguelike nature, the game thrusts you upon the ruins of a school that changes every time you play the game. The thing is, you'll find yourself doing that way more than it'd be fun to.Don't assume I'm giving this game a bad review because of the difficulty.No, it's because of the unfairness. There is practically nothing for your character (a distressed, half-goth-half-moeblob shy little girl named lovingly named Cordy) to do once an enemy has set their sights on you. What I imagine must have initially been designed as an evasive roll is instead little more than a glorified burst of speed where you can still be hit by the enemy. The rest of your abilities are terribly uneffective attacks -or at least, I assume they're attacks, by what little information I managed to absorb from a ""tutorial"" consisting of a few scribbles on the first room of each new game. It's nigh-impossible to dodge enemy attacks, and skill has naught to do with it.The entire game's design either lacks foresight or is simply lazy. The majority of characters have a terrible lack of animations; Cordy herself only has an animation for her roll, and an animation for her walk. Getting hit by an enemy elicits little more than a ""blink"" from your sprite, reminscent of those from a past-decade arcade beat 'em up. Even the menus are strange, allowing you the use of your mouse in one menu, and taking it away from you in the next one. Like I said, the game offers you little-to-none information on just what the ♥♥♥♥ you're supposed to do, and it wasn't until my third death that I took it upon myself to navigate the jumbled menus to see if there was anything as my reward for future progress. True enough, there was a ""Counselor"" in one of the menus to whom I could pay the ""favors"" I earnt at the end of each level in exchange for tips.Like I said, the game didn't tell me any of this. I could have potentially gone an entire playthrough without even realizing there was a friendly NPC in the main menu. There may even be more helpful stuff out there for me to find. Perhaps if I type in the Konami code I'll get a lightsaber? If I don't experiment I'll never know.Those are the two main downfalls of this game. The lack of information, and the tediousness of the design. Oh, and the unfairness; did I mention you're screwed for the whole game?Now, the game has just come out, so it may be unfair for me to write a review this early. But you're supposed to release a game when it's at least completed enough to be /fun/, not as a half-baked cake with an IOU. If you're looking for a game with similar art, get Don't Starve. If you're looking for a roguelike, get Rogue Legacy or Spelunky. At least at the moment I am writing this review, this game is not worth touching.			"

												Short description: Altered The Binding of Isaac.The shop description uses pretty words and says you keep the ""lessons"" learned between playthroughs, considering the theme you might believe you keep abilities or passives for subsequent playthroughs; you don't, the system is actually a point reward every floor, the harder floors giving more points, which after your death you can spend in the main menu for passives, which not only minor, are limited in acquisition, they are in no way game-changing, for example, improved 15% crit chance while in short range of your target. If in Isaac your success depended on farming exploits or rolling useful items at the start, here it is even more randomized. Although there is a leveling system in the game, when you level you can choose between two abilities, some with partially detrimental effects, but worse, even these options are random abd you can easily get a nearly worthless roll every time. Frankly, that's not difficulty, that's merely luck-based gameplay, akin to playing dice, as your natural projectile and such can be nearly useless in most situations.Additionally the rooms are cluttered with big junk that not only stays in your way, but actually have uneven, rough hit detection and often hold you in place if you walk near enough, making you that more vulnerable.Yet again, if you liked Isaac, you might like this more randomized version (you could finish Isaac without a single item if you were good, here you'll be struggling with movement and projectile issues.), if you haven't played a roguelike before, try Isaac before coming around this.

""missing elements"" to it that kill the appeal to me. It's a bullet hell one moment and a race the next. In my last review, I though Our Darker Purpose was difficult, but really I wasn't playing well due to the lack of reward for really doing so. You can get treasure, items, coins, loot and grades on how well you did - but NONE of that seems rewarding enough to turn the satisfaction of getting such things into entertainment... In a sense, there is no penalty for losing in this game, you get to keep the rewards from floor grades anyway.I don't recommend this game to people who want a more thrilling exciting experience in their rogue-like games. This game executes it's purpose well - being dull, being depressing, and being dark. 6/10 but not my kind of game...			"

												Some games want to be The Binding of Isaac but have neither the controls nor the diversity to do so. This is one such game. Nice visuals, a tiny bit of decent gallows humor. Gets repetative rather quickly, and while it's not without it's charms, it's a love it or hate it experience that left me wanting more than it had to offer. I dislike the way you and your enemies attack in this game. I tried so very hard to enjoy Our Darker Purpose, but it just doesn't try hard enough. If you just can't get enough of these kinds of games and you've played Isaac til your eyes bled, maybe get it when it's on sale, but otherwise you're better off saving your pennies for an overall more pleasant experience.

												I wish that I could recommend this game. Much like other twin sticks, such as Binding of Isaac, there is a casual feel to a game which becomes difficult as you make it into the depths.I liked some aspects of this game such as the level up system. It gives you two options for each level up, giving the illusion of choice. In the end, most of the skills make very little difference in the game. Like one or two of the skills makes a huge difference, but those come around at times when the game seems to know you won't have time to use them. Which is a reason I have to give it a thumbs down.The boss sequence seems to just be built about prolonging the game. You beat the first chapter boss, only to find that you've been sent back to the menu to restart for a second attempt. You have to beat it a second time to progress to chapter 2. Each chapter sends you back to the start to grind through it again. This was a big downfall for me. I finally decided to not give a recommendation when playing some of the bosses. Some of the bosses are just ridiculous and tedious (such as the Disciplined King and Cyndar's Timekeeper). There is nothing enjoyable about the boss mechanics. It just becomes how long do you want to dodge before stopping and just finish the fight by taking hits. The second chapter boss literally had me thinking, ""Did the developer just want to see how much♥♥♥♥♥♥they could put on a screen at once while you're rolling around!?"" Although I finished the game, I would go back and spend the money on something else. It could hold you over until the next big twin-stick game, but there are other games out there that provide better entertainment.			"

												A wonderful game. Difficult, randomly generated, and if you loved Binding of Isaac, you will love this game. The slow speed on the character allows for skill needed to navigate the floors. And the bosses and mobs are extremely fair (a few bosses could be buffed). As you progress you gain credits to give yourself extra skills and the lore in this game was a surprising A+ for me. The lore bits, the story created around it, the conversations between the ______ (won't spoil), and the achievements. All really wonderful.A few things need to be addressed, when champion mobs begin moving after you, their shadow remains on the ground and does not follow them, where as for all otehr mobs the shadow correctly follows. But apart from balance and tidbits that would have many opinions, that's about it. Overall a great roguelike, cyptic, and enjoyable with an immersive story and great soundtrack!			"

The gameplay is simple, but I really enjoy that the items you find are reusable on future playthroughs, but that the effects stack, Looking forward to finishing and getting a few more ""class period"" bonuses.

												Take Binding of Isaac, add some Rouge Legacy and a pinch of Dark Souls with some bullet hell segments. That is Our Darker Purpose. The only real problem with that game is that it takes some time to get used to the character being super slow. You need to learn how to roll. And once you beat the first chapter story boss and unlock it's lesson you can shoot while rolling. Also there is like tons of bosses. And they are very fun to fight. But do be warned the game is very very hard. Oh and let's not forget that the game has a gorgous art style.			"

												It's pretty okay. The dodge roll is for actually dodging and moving around stuff. No invincibility  frames. So, you'll have to take some time to get use to that. The upgrade drip is slow and unrewarding aside from a few 'upgrades'.You'll (almost) never have enough money for the first floor vending machine.Bosses offer no rewards or upgrades for beating them (Aside from the one time achievements.)A run will usually fail within the first few floors.You're squishy.Monsters get tanky quickly.It basically needs a lot of changes to the backbone stuff, upgrades and items need to be more varied and fun to tool around with. They need to drop more often, as well as your other support supplies. I'd like to see something else aside from chalk in that slot as well.Some of the design vices help to make the game harder but for all the wrong reasons. It'll be a grind to finish it either way since the game forces you to replay it at least four times.It's a solid seven of ten or so.			"

												As the developers are hard at work making this game better, I grow more fond of this game with each update. I got this game when it first came out. It draws multiple parallels with Binding of Isaac, one of my favorite games and the only game that I achieved 100% achievements on. What turned me off was the awkward hitboxes and being trapped behind corners of obstacles. With the new updates, I can say that this game is more polished than it was before, and that it is a game worth trying for those who love roguelikes.There is a ""credits"" system that lets you carry on some bonuses you earned with each playthrough. It took me at least 50 tries before I finally got to the ending of the game. Story-wise, I am still a bit confused but I shall go back and figure it out. The dodge-roll system is very tight and responsive. The items and levelling up are both very satisfying near end-game.How does this game compare to the Binding of Isaac? It's not as friendly as you first pick it up as the Binding of Isaac. I found myself frustrated at the number of projectiles flying towards me. It was infuriating to dodge a projectile only to realize that ALL PROJECTILES are semi-homing. This makes the game a lot harder to get used to as compared to the Binding of Isaac. To make things worse, the projectile that comes out of Cordy is small, unlike the Binding of isaac where the tears are about 1/5 of the enemies' size or more. Cordy's projectile is super small. The projectile doesn't work the same was as Isaac's so it takes awhile to get used to that too.All in all, get Binding of Isaac first. Play that game, get the DLC, love the game. If you're up for a more advanced and more satisfying challenge, Our Darker Purpose is your game. It is the advanced Binding of Isaac.edit: new updates, unforgiving. metaphorically, the fun is the brick in your mouth you end up trying to eat.			"

												A great game with a lot to offer. It has enough enemies to make sure you don't get tired of them, but you know what to expect. The bosses are very well done, with just the nescessary level of difficulty. Items can be a bit repetitive, but are very unique in what they do. Rouge-legacy style out of game progression means that you will have a chance to get to the later floors, but does not help you enough to negate skill. Overall, a very well put together game. If you like games such as the The Binding of Isaac, or more recently, A Wizard's Lizard, you will like this game.			"

												Really good modern rogue-like, or ""isaac-like"", or whatever you wanna call a procedurally generated, top-down view, twin-stick shooter.It's surely harder than Binding of Isaac, due to the lack of really overpowered items, and really rare powerful combinations. Most items and upgrades are situational, or only work while at low life. This adds a lot of difficulty. That also means it is no Isaac in terms of replayability. I personally haven't made it past the floor of the level 2 boss yet, and I can't say for sure whether I'll keep playing long enough to ever ""finish"" the game. Let alone the ""hard mode"" that unlocks once you beat level 4.If you're looking for a challenge, definitely try it. If you can't even get through The Binding of Isaac, you'll probably won't leave the first 2 floors in this game.			"

												I really like the game. So far I've played it for 2 hours. The gameplay is simple and it reminds me of Binding of Isaac. The artstyle of the game reminds me of Dont Starve. What I really like about the game is that it allows you to customize your character the way you see fit. You have the freedom to play the game the way you want. You can choose between two upgrades everytime you level up (boosting speed, health, atc.) On top of it you can also pick up items in certain rooms that give added effects like instant level ups in the next chapter or damage resistance.However I feel like the movement speed is a little too slow. It wouldnt be such a big deal, but the movement speed upgrades feel like they dont give a boost at all.Besides that this game awesome. The game is challenging and it forces you to play strategically, which makes it fun.  I recommend it especially if you're a fan of difficult rogue-like games. "

												This game is great, but difficult to review. It has a great art style and story, and I really love the atmosphere of it. That said, it is incredibly difficult to win, and it seems like it requires luck to get a specific level-up upgrade in order to win. I've never been able to win without the ""Coins and Punishment"" upgrade, and that's a bummer. Maybe I'm not good enough, but the game could use a little balancing IMO. I wish I didn't miss the kickstarter, and the small dev. team is inspiring. Despite everything, this game is an enjoyable one. Also, it isn't just a Binding of Iscaac clone. I think the devs put plenty of originality in here to warrant some recognition as an idependant title. 9/10			"

												This is a nice game:Pros:- dark steampunk-like Artstyle inspired by the gashlycrumb tinies- horror (especially the lord of the flies style battle of the different factions of former pupils) story which builds slowly with each play session- possibility of strategical builds for own gameplay style or unlocking challanges Cons:- relatively hard- some items doesn't add much to gameplay (they make no difference)- somewhat repetitive (after finishing a chapter you have to replay it)[although there's a nice story twist behind it]I did not finish it yet but i like it. Therefore i recommend it.			"

												Can't rave enough about this game. I bought it in early access, and was surprised at how solid the game was, even when supposedly ""unfinished"". Gameplay is similar to Binding of Isaac and the countless other roguelikes out there, but what sets Our Darker Purpose apart is it's unique Burton-esque art style and mysterious backstory (which is unlocked in pieces as you play through the game).Tons of replayability. Each playthrough will earn ""credits"" that can be spent on upgrades for future playthroughs, though it only allows a certain number to keep the game difficult. I've played over 50 hours and have only faced the final boss once. I can stop playing for awhile, then pick it up again weeks (or even months) later with ease and it's still just as enjoyable.I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys roguelikes. It's a steal at $15, and you will find yourself playing again and again.			"

If you are a bit tired of Binding of Isaac and want a little twist, go get this gem! I don't think you would regret it.Recommended.			"

												A wonderful game. Difficult, randomly generated, and if you loved Binding of Isaac, you will love this game. The slow speed on the character allows for skill needed to navigate the floors. And the bosses and mobs are extremely fair (a few bosses could be buffed). As you progress you gain credits to give yourself extra skills and the lore in this game was a surprising A+ for me. The lore bits, the story created around it, the conversations between the ______ (won't spoil), and the achievements. All really wonderful.A few things need to be addressed, when champion mobs begin moving after you, their shadow remains on the ground and does not follow them, where as for all otehr mobs the shadow correctly follows. But apart from balance and tidbits that would have many opinions, that's about it. Overall a great roguelike, cyptic, and enjoyable with an immersive story and great soundtrack!			"

												Our Darker Purpose is what the spawn of Dark Souls and Binding of Issac would be if it raided Tim Burton's wardrobe and splashed just a dash of Lovcraftian horror onto its plotline. With tight controls and well programmed enemy A.I. your heart will be pounding as you attempt to traverse the halls of Edgewood's Home for Lost Children and repeatedly die with each new or old enemy you encounter. This doesn't mean the game is unfair, no despite the steap learning curve it is possible to even traverse (at least) the first floor without getting hurt using the knowledge from all your previous failings which is to be expected. There's also small upgrades that you can choose from in and before the game that while don't make the game easier will help you survive an extra minute if you learn to utilize them. The plot is simple: you are Cordy, a little girl trying to untangle the mystery behind the orphanage when all the teachers dissapear and the students scream Mad Max-esqe rules and start killing each other while establishing a new heirarchy with the most nasty creatures at the top floors of the svhool.My favourite part however has to be the bosses, all amazingly unique in design with the only similarites being in how some of them attack or defend. But this is only one overlap between a miniscule amount of monsters who accidentally showed up wearing identical pairs of socks while the rest giggle in their ballgowns made of the player's carcass.However there is a point in the game where it (not completely) delflates a bit where as you progress you only come across maybe two levels (at most) of the really hard enemies. You could say I was being greedy at this point and the game was only trying to reflect a traditional social triangle, but when I'm being beaten by enemies and they finally bring out a paddle to add to the fun I'd like it to last more than two wacks!

												Honestly I feel that this game is criminally underrated, as a big fan of Binding of Isaac (which is a very easy game to compare this to) I felt that this game, while similar in mechanics and gameplay, was successful to make it's own identity, because while I see Binding of Isaac as a moderately difficult game when you figure things out (aside from the Lost but let's not go there) I felt that no matter how much better I got at Our Darker Purpose I would always end up getting bested by this game's difficulty. This game is a real challenge compared to Isaac and I enjoy it profusely, I haven't felt as much of a rush as I did when I got to the game's second ""final"" boss and to know that there's so much more is just outstanding. And the progression system the game has to offer that keeps gaining progress even if you lose your run is just great, giving you an extra currency that stays with you throughout your entire game career that allows you start off better than your last run really helps, I probably would never be able to progress as much as I have without getting the extra 4 juice boxes (basically health kits) to start off the run with that I earned through my many past mistakes I had made through the corridors of Edgewood.Speaking of, the story of Edgewood and the character you come to play as is quite interesting, with the strange happenings of this orphanage linked towards a dark and paranormal conspiracy surrounding ""The Administrators"", a mysterious group of adults who seem to run the place and have apparently never been seen by any child living there. A lot of the lore you find throughout the game is unlocked by defeating new bosses, finding a ""memory room"", or even sometimes from random desks and potato sacks lying around who somehow have the ability to speak (and break the 4th wall too I might add). It very much reminds me of the Dark Souls way of storytelling with giving you very little at the start and then giving you the option of looking into it and seeing what's really going on or just ignoring it and continue slaying your makeshift cardboard dragons and living elevator controls.The artstyle of this game has a very Tim Burton-esque feel to it that compliments the mood of the game rather well and is sort of charming in it's own, creepy way. Another point I enjoyed a lot with this game was the music, which seemed to compliment the environments and the bosses they usually accompanied, which is what is to be expected of video game musicMy few complaints of this game though is the annoying hitboxes that some bosses or enemies have, where the attack clearly connects with them but it yields no damage. Another complaint is the attack you use itself, which to me, is a bit hard to keep track of due to it's tiny size, I'm not saying they should make it bigger but at least make it more noticeable, especially in some of the more bullet hell-type areas later on.Overall I'd say Our Darker Purpose is a great game that deserves a lot more credit then it's given, and while it doesn't contribute a huge amount to the genre, it makes up for it in an interesting story and a higher difficulty curve that for me, felt a lot harder then Isaac had. However I wouldn't necessarily call Our Darker Purpose a replacement to Binding of Isaac, but I would definitely say it deserves to be played by so much more people then it has currently attracted.

												I think thirteen hours in and an agonizing defeat near the top is enough time to give this game a fair review.Our Darker Purpose is an insanely hard Rogue-lite with many similar elements to Binding of Isaac only with a sort of Tim Burton / A Series of Unfortunate Events twist which really allows it to shine on its own merits. To quickly go into the simularities this game has to Binding of Isaac, there are several different floors with increasing difficulty and theming, interesting bosses, an open-to-interpretation plot, tons of unlockables that you grab over the course of several games, and steady length increasing (every time you complete a run, you unlock a newer harder area which becomes the new end of the next run). What Our Darker Purpose does differently is that it escalates... well, just about everything. But the most important aspects are the bullet hell style evasion, more RPG leveling and stats, and how very quickly the game can bite you in the♥♥♥♥♥no matter how hard you try. To say that it's unforgiving is putting it mildly, if you're willing to put up with failure after constant failure, learning and adapting to the game, then this is a great fun game with a steady incline in difficulty. To be honest calling it a Rogue-LITE feels inappropriate as almost everything in this game is dependant upon what items you get with a constantly changing metagame. You can have an amazing early game, grab lots of amazing items, and then get your♥♥♥♥♥handed five times to sunday because you're not getting any more tokens or Juice Box spawns. Not that it matters considering that enemies deal steadily increased damage as time goes on. I had two hundred health by the top floor and hard hitting, fast shooting enemies were dealing about thirty damage. I died in that room in agony.I love Binding of Isaac and found Rebirth to be almost a little too easy for my tastes, so Our Darker Purpose was a great amount of difficulty I thrived for. But, I've also found that Our Darker Purpose's greatest strengths were also its greatest weaknesses. For starters the game constantly gets harder, which is awesome as before long I was beating Chapter one without a sweat. Because the game is exponentally harder as you progress, you can never really have much time to practice those floors. bosses, enemies, and learn their patterns. And when you die, it'll take a good hour or so just to make it back to that place again, and who knows what items you'll get - if any - when you get back there. There's great variety in items and leveling perks (you can choose between two random ones every level) that work together very well. But you only get items from enemy Leaders, chests, and vending machines, not bosses, which means that if the first two decide not to appear and there aren't enough tokens around the map, then you're without items. Leveling also quickly dips off as enemies give more XP, but not enough to give you additional levels. Plus there's no way to grind levels as once you finish a floor you're onto the next. Also the books are randomized, so you could never get the book perks that you need to really make a run beautiful. By itself the darkly comedic (and straight up horrific) lore is wonderful, and manages to shine without any real falterings. So good for it.So - again - Our Darker Purpose takes the Isaac formula and runs with it, to mixed results. As the game continues to get balancing and general gameplay patches, I can expect some of my complaints to change or at least be diminished in time. Eventually it may become the go-to game for a more demanding Rogue-lite bullet hell game. It has the atmosphere, it just needs that polish. Personally I hope for an easy mode or some sort of continue option so I can at least learn how painful the upper floors will be without having that cloud of ""if I lose I'm going to have to start all over again"" hanging over my head. I think it'll also make the game a bit more accessible as it's already really amazing for more dedicated players (there's a hard mode! A ♥♥♥♥ing hard mode!).Highly recommended if you like Binding of Isaac, or at least its formula, and want something much harder. Recommended if you want to see what the hype is about and are willing to put a lot of time into learning how to play the game through constant failure. Not recommended if you get frustrated easily, or just are on the edge about games like this. This game will not change your mind, if anything it'll make you feel like the hundreds of poor hilariously abused orphans in this game.			"

												Fantastic, addictive game! Similar to the Binding of Isaac in a few ways, such as top-down shooter, horde of collectible items and powerups and whatnot, and similar overall level design, but that's it! This game has it's own unique story, it's own enemies and bosses, it's own traps and obstacles, IT HAS A LEVELING SYSTEM! (something tBoI is unfortunately lacking), different moveset + functions, such as ROLLING!!, a number value for hp, (instead of hearts), and JUICE!!!!(as healthpacks!!!) The art style, animation, and use of light are also fantastic imo. Much more rogue-like, with unlockables...unlocked by replaying the game and earning credits to purchase new powers to START the game with, as well as passive bonuses. To those saying this game is too like tBoI, I both agree and disagree. They have a similar starting formula as tBoI, but expanded in so many wonderful ways that tBoI never did. I've spent a collective 375 hours playing The Binding of Isaac and Rebirth, so I feel as if I may say that it is one of my favorite games of all time. The fact that Our Darker Purpose shares some similar components, (while adding plenty of their own), to tBoI should mean it should be praised as another good game, in the same genre, not called a ripoff and hated and♥♥♥♥♥♥on for that fact. (Sidenote: IMO more challenging than tBoI)I really enjoy(ed) playing ODP, and think that anyone who loves the binding, will surely love this game.  :) 8.5-9/10			"

												I like this game. It provides the difficulty I never seemed to feel while playing BoI.Dark story, unsettling atmosphere, and sketched out graphics all seem to highlight the game perfectly.While it does a feel a little clunky at times, as aiming can get a little getting used to, as well as poor starting range, the player has a very large health pool which is forgiving. However, try not to get hit as boss battles tend to be very lengthy and damaging, someimes taking out the majority of your health leaving you helpless for ensuing levels.All the items in the game, as well as bosses and areas, have little tid bits of lore which I find absolutely fascinating, encouraging me to play more and more as I learn about the story.I can see how people would not like this game, as the difficulty spike, multitude of unkillable traps, and controls may be offputting. But for me, I like it. Maybe games with female protagonists who aren't especially glorified for their sexiness is something I praise in games.			"

												Ok... let's be perfectly honest about this.  Our Darker Purpose is a very close rip-off of binding of Isaac (which itself is a rip-off of Smash TV, which is a rip-off of that robot shooter arcade game I used to play when I was a kid (forgot the name)).  It's important not to get overly self-righteous about this.  But Binding of Isaac was comlpetely  original in it's weird, demented atmosphere.  The imagery of the setting, the enemies, and even the protagonist himself reflects this obtuse reality.  Our Darker Purpose tries to imitate that, but with less success.  It draws the line at being creepy.  And creepy is good.  But it falls short of it's predecessor.Now, that being said, it does pass the most important test of all... it's fun!  My favorite gameplay element is that you can build your character between playthroughs, which means that your progression isn't entirely skills-based -- good for those of use who lack the natural fast-twitch abilities of the modern teen.  I like the creepy as well, though not as much as I relish the deranged from Isaac.  But the designers did an excellent job of crafting a dark, unpleasant locale.  Also, a big positive over Isaac is that rooms are larger and can extend beyond the screen.   This makes for much more frenetic combat.If you liked Binding of Isaac, you will have fun with this... no question.			"

												Love this game,  despite it's faults.It's aesthetic, visual and soundtrack,  are great.   Some sound effects could use some work,  namely for the basic attack.The only real problem with this game is how slow the progression is.  It feels like it takes way too long to make a difference.  Dozens of play throughs before you earn things to use throughout the playthroughs.    There's a lot of polish that could be done, including new features that would help it out.  Such as the ability to spend credits to directly increase starting stats as perma-buffs persistent throughout play.   Perhaps the ability to choose starting abilities that replace chalk, juice, the basic attack, and even the roll with similar but different effects.   If I were to change anything about Our Darker Purpose,  and believe me I'd love to see the change,  is a drastically increased pacing.  The hit box issue people often complain about isn't much of a problem once you get use to it and can even benefit you on occasion.The pacing however is a serious problem and limits the enjoyability.I'd say to -DOUBLE- the amount of XP gained,  start with the option of a level up perk from the get-go,  and have bosses award either an immediate level up perk or an item,   then up credit gain significantly.   From there I really do believe that having the ability to spend credits to directly augment stats persistently would be a fantastic addition.   With these,  I think Our Darker Purpose would be one of my favorite games to play.It could be really fantastic then.    I still prefer it over Binding of Isaac personally,  I think the biggest reason is the aesthetic and lore but also the timed cooldowns on items and numerical HP rather than room-based cooldowns.I would recommend it.  It seems to be a love/hate thing for most Binding of Isaac players,  who either prefer the differences or tote it as being ""inferior in every way"".			"

												It's like Binding of Isaac with a Tim Burton make over.I like this game, but it's far from perfect.(I play offline and have played many more hours then the stat above suggests.)Pros:The game looks and sounds niceControls wellHas a great atmosphereHas an extensive upgrade systemA branching level system where levels have different random properties to considerCons:The game can feel like a grind for permanent upgrades, because your character starts too slow, does too little damage, and has extremely poor weapon range. (There are upgrades you can start the game with once unlocked)In addition to walking you have a roll move. The first is too slow to dodge much and the second loses too much precision of control to dodge effectively. This is a problem in what often feels like a bullet hell game. Also why does the dodge move have a cooldown timer?Enemies (both regular and especially bosses) take too long to kill. I often get frustrated and take more hits then I need to because I just want a boss fight to end already. The boss fights can also get very repetitious because you will see the same bosses again and again on every play throughTo optimise your chances of dodging you need to keep a moderate distance from enemies so you have more reaction time when they shoot, but the default weapon range is very short. So often you will want to sneak into range, fire a few shots, then back away again. Combined with the high enemy health fights become really long-winded.The game has rooms that scroll rather then being single screen which works very poorly in some situations. For example one enemy type throws furniture into the air which disappears off screen before coming down where you are standing. If the enemy is offscreen you'll only realise they are there when you get hitAfter all that complaining, I will still say that if you are a Binding of Isaac fan, you will get some fun out of this one. Try to get it on sale.			"

												Our Darker Purpose is fantastic, and despite its superficial similarities to The Binding of Isaac, it's a very different beast; for one thing, this game is not afraid to punish the player for failing to use her dodge button, or for attempting to tank his way through damage. This game is very much focused on making the player think strategically and defensively. Moreover, I dig the game's institutional-Gothic aesthetic quite a bit, and the lore he game revels to you bit by bit I find enthralling. Go buy this--it's worth it.			"

												I want to like this game. I really do, I love the semi story, I like the art style, the concept is a classic from other roguelikes (namely isaac). However.. The gameplay is just.. not as fun as it could be, the hitboxes are not accurate, you think you dodge something.. turns out you didn't. Rooms are never calm, traps keep running in rooms you've already beat, making moving about a trying matter that's just not as fun as it could be.However... the humour is there, you'll find it to be rather grim. But it's there. So there's that. Also dragon bosses.			"

												After reading other reviews, there is a lot of negativity about how much this game resembles the Binding of Isaac. I will not deny that it shares a lot of things with Isaac, but I completely disagree with that negativity. This game is much much more difficult than Isaac. And i like that. Isaac is (in my opinion) too easy. I have played much of Isaac, and nowhere near as much of this.  Isaac lends itself to item collection as opposed to Our Darker Purpose, which lends itself to actually getting better at the game.the first time i beat mom in isaac it was entirely because i had a lineup of extremely powerful pickups. this made it much easier than it should have been.ODP forces you to get better with less than one item per floor, and these items arent game changing items that make the game easier. Both games are great in their own respects, and I really hate that everyone is comparing them to no end. I really enjoy the difficulty of this game and my friends have compared the later levels in this game to Dark Souls. and validly so.			"

												Interesting game.  Graphics are a little ...blurry?  Maybe that's intentional, but it made the game feel a little dated.  The gameplay is very Binding of Isaac, there's no getting around that comparison.  The background and story of the game are more coherent and relevant than BoI.  If I've got one complaint, it's how grindy the game is.  The need to play-until-you-die over and over again to farm the necessary points to get the persistent bonuses to have a shot at moving on in the story was somewhat overwhelming.All in all though, it's a decent game.

												If you're wary about roguelike games because you like making progress, even if it's slow, I would avoid this game. The permanent unlocks seem to come far and few between. I only got one permanent unlock in two playthroughs of the first two levels, and the game doesn't seem to tell you how to get more permanent unlocks/upgrades. I just had one come up for purchase after my first failed run. I don't know why and it didn't say why. If you are a super masochist, then you'll love this game. If you are one, good for you. There's nothing wrong with that. Just not my cup of tea and I'd like people who aren't masochists to know that this game probably isn't for them.			"

												At first, I was unimpressed. Cordy moves so dang slow and doesn't shoot far at all and it's just the most unfair game ever.But it's also a little addicting, so I gradually learned the tricks of the trade and so it's more fun, now that I know exactly how to play it well.It gets away with being a Binding of Isaac copy with the fact that it's got some very lovely design -- Cordy herself is really very pretty -- and that the desks and potatoes talk about how it's a Binding of Isaac copycat. The potatoes and desks make the game tbh.I would not recommend if you're looking for super smooth gameplay or a relatively quick/easy game. Our Darker Purpose is far from it, and it's very far from being a perfect masterpiece. Perhaps it's not as good as Binding of Isaac -- but it is a different game and functions as such if you give it a chance.			"

												I really, really wanted to like this game. I love Binding of Isaac and I've beaten it to the point I wanted something new, this offered that. I was disappointed as it controls poorly in comparison. Plays poorly in comparison and is just downright unfair at points.This game advertizes as being difficult, it's not.Binding of Isaac is difficult, even if you obtain broken items you cannot survive if you don't plan ahead and think on your feet.This game is false-ly difficult. It's difficulty is artificial, it is a time sink. Health items are rare and next to useless. You have to dodge each and every single bullet ever, this game also loves spawning large amounts of these bullets.Enemies spawn various types of screen consuming projectiles, with maze like obsticles to protect them from your pitiful single shot projectile.Do not play this game. Look at some art of it and listen to the music, maybe read the lore, these things are good, but the game at it's core, is not.			"

												It's unfortunate that this game is considered a Binding of Isaac clone because while it shares some similarities, they are far from being the same game. This game is slower paced and a bit more tactical. You will need to pay more attention to your surroundings and more quick on your feet.  In any case if you enjoy rogue like isometric third person shooters, this is a fun game to consider.			"

												ODP is fun... at first.   My issues with it are:1.  Targetting seems random.  With no controller support, you use the arrow keys to shoot.  Shots go everywhere.  Shooting right, the shot can go up to 25 degrees off course.  This can be very frustrating.2.  It's perma-death.  That in itself wouldn't be an issue if the game wasn't tough.  Compounded with issue #1 above.3. There is no item reference, or log when you're in-game.  When you grab an item the description flies by way too fast.  I still don't know what the eraser does!YMMV but I find this game to be more annoying then fun.  It would be a few really easy fixes (and maybe a few harder ones... controller support would be good), but as it is now, I doubt I'll play it again.			"

												Although this game is not as random as Binding of Isaac as you will end up fighting many of the same bosses on multiple play throughs. The RPG aspect is a nice touch and the Achivement system is well done. The floors and enemies are pretty well conceived but alot of the items lacking in usablity. There are times through the random drops you will find yourself at the final stages seriously under powered. The difficulty of this game is a few steps above BOI as alot of boss fights are ""Bullet Hells"", One irritating factor is that your first play through of a stage always end the game at the boss of that stage.Over all If you liked Binding of Isaac, you'll like this game.

												Very underrated Isaac-like with elements of Rogue Legacy, I.E., there are ""credits"" that you earn on every run on the side to help you on each subsequent run you have. A few negatives I have with this game are that on later floors, there are some design choices I wouldn't have made regarding a lack of opportunity to hone experience with the game in terms of not getting hit. For example, there are some mobs that endlessly spam homing projectiles to the point where there's very little counterplay even for the most seasoned player. Still, I think people are a bit too hard on the game in terms of its quality ans especially its lore focus, especially when youtuber Northernlion reviewed it in a sort of unprofessional and biased manner.

												Our Darker Purpose is an AMAZING game! It's very similar to the game The Binding of Isaac, in the dungeon-rogue like way that  you have to collect items to improve your character and how you have to fight enemies and bosses to move on to the next floor. I've enjoyed playing this game for a number of reason some of whice are: The soundtrack is amazing, the storyline is pretty well done and detailed, the items are interesting, the dodging system is pretty nice and something new that I haven't seen before in any other games I've played, and it has talking potatoes! What more could you possibly want! The one thing that I've noticed they could improve on is how the hitbox works but other then that it's a great game! I rate it 8.5/10. If you want to see a brand new lets play to see what it's like check out mine

												In a nutshell, if you like the Binding of Isaac, you'll like Our Darker purpose. The game controls in the exact same way as Isaac, with the addition of the space bar adding a ""sonic spin dash"" like dodge that allows you to get out of some tricky situation. Our Darker Purpose has a much darker tone (yes, somehow darker than the story of a mom killing her child) and it's hand drawn graphics style are pretty neat to look at. Enemies and bosses are pretty unique, ranging from things like cardboard dragons, a chalkboard drawing, and a pot of gruel. The game of course has rogue like elements, floor, enemy, and item placement change every playthrough, and the game is designed to kill you as much as possible. The game gets a little easier with every death, as you start learning the enemies better, along with being able to unlock and equip various skills by accomplishing certain acheivemnts in the game. Donating credits to the ""school counsler"" also gives you certain upgrades, like being able to carry more healing items, and chalk, which acts a projectile clearing, enemy smashing super weapon. The game isn't without it's flaws. Sometimes there are so many projectiles on screen it almost becomes a bullet hell game, and feels like it's just impossible to get through an encounter without taking serious damage, and since the doors remain locked in every room until you defeat every enemy death can come quickly if you're not careful. Certain enemies are very annoying when placed in certain parts of the room, such as the chalk duster clapping enemies that produce a cloud of chalk that stalks you around the room. In certain places these enemies can only be hit in one precise spot and since they can produce two chalk clouds at once you'll only be able to get one or two shots in before you have to retreat and wait again. At one point two of these enemies were side by side, surrounded by walls, with a floor trap beside the only opening that sprung whenever I approached, meaning about 70% of my health dropped in a matter of seconds as I had no choice but to defeat them. I loved the Binding of Isaac, and any game that can give me even a hint of that games greatness is very welcome in my book. While not quite as fun or memorable as Isaac, ""Our Darker Purpose"" is a great game for anyone looking for more of that same flavor, I can't recommend it enough. "

Although the furniture is in slight disrepair, they have lively conversations that are well worth stopping and listening to.

												At first glance it is easy to make comparrisons to The Binding of Issac, and in this case it is to the games benefit. The very stylish art combines with a moody atmosphere in a dark and creative story that makes it a hit in my book. Where as the Binding of Issac is the shining light of Rogue-Likes and good gaming all around, Our Darker Purpose is a sleeper hit, often overlooked BUT completely worth your time as its endearing concept has the potential to become it's own heavy weight like the Binding of Issac.Given some tender loving care, and time this could potentially become some truly awesome.However it would be remiss of me not to point out that its down side is that it is only partially controller supported. I would like to see it fully supported in time.			"

												I've seen several other reviewers compare this game to Binding of Isaac and kidney punch it with these comparisons as much as humanly possible. I'll be the first person to admit, I love Binding of Isaac. It is a great game, between vanilla and Rebirth I've got over seven-hundred hours of Binding of Isaac and I will also be the first person to tell you that I think it unfair to compare the two.	Yes, this is a rogue dungeon crawling game about suffering, where you time your projectiles other creatures who also exist in a perpetual state of suffering, but it offers some subtleties that compliment the gaming experience in a completely different way. Between each level your are offered your choice of a few new randomly generated levels to choose from, each with its own unique attributes that are usually focused around making you feel sore in the bathing suit area. 	The art and music is charming with gothic overtones and playful undertones. My feelings toward the game are quite different though there are some distinct similarities between it and Binding of Isaac. If you want another Binding of Isaac game though, pick up Rebirth, it's amazing, but there is no need for another developer to create a clone of a game that exists. This product stands alone in its own light (or darkness rather). 	Gameplay wise this game reminds me of Gradius more than anything. It's more about dodging than getting more powerful to kill bigger uglier baddies. In Gradius a player found themselves weaving in tight spaces to avoid getting hit and dying. This game is a ton of that, squeeze in the little space that isn't on fire, covered in caltrops, or saturated in electricity, then shooting your pew pews hoping they'll kill the guy who is trying to derp you in the bathing suit area. It may not be a game for everyone, but I wish it was.			"

												Our Darker Purpose is what the spawn of Dark Souls and Binding of Issac would be if it raided Tim Burton's wardrobe and splashed just a dash of Lovcraftian horror onto its plotline. With tight controls and well programmed enemy A.I. your heart will be pounding as you attempt to traverse the halls of Edgewood's Home for Lost Children and repeatedly die with each new or old enemy you encounter. This doesn't mean the game is unfair, no despite the steap learning curve it is possible to even traverse (at least) the first floor without getting hurt using the knowledge from all your previous failings which is to be expected. There's also small upgrades that you can choose from in and before the game that while don't make the game easier will help you survive an extra minute if you learn to utilize them. The plot is simple: you are Cordy, a little girl trying to untangle the mystery behind the orphanage when all the teachers dissapear and the students scream Mad Max-esqe rules and start killing each other while establishing a new heirarchy with the most nasty creatures at the top floors of the svhool.My favourite part however has to be the bosses, all amazingly unique in design with the only similarites being in how some of them attack or defend. But this is only one overlap between a miniscule amount of monsters who accidentally showed up wearing identical pairs of socks while the rest giggle in their ballgowns made of the player's carcass.However there is a point in the game where it (not completely) delflates a bit where as you progress you only come across maybe two levels (at most) of the really hard enemies. You could say I was being greedy at this point and the game was only trying to reflect a traditional social triangle, but when I'm being beaten by enemies and they finally bring out a paddle to add to the fun I'd like it to last more than two wacks!

												A fun little diversion, not without flaw, but still good. Very similar to The Binding of Isaac. Worth a couple bucks. The only complaint I have so far is that there's no joystick support. (It's 2014 developers, WASD only is barely acceptable for in browser flash games.)			"

												I want to like this game. I really do, I love the semi story, I like the art style, the concept is a classic from other roguelikes (namely isaac). However.. The gameplay is just.. not as fun as it could be, the hitboxes are not accurate, you think you dodge something.. turns out you didn't. Rooms are never calm, traps keep running in rooms you've already beat, making moving about a trying matter that's just not as fun as it could be.However... the humour is there, you'll find it to be rather grim. But it's there. So there's that. Also dragon bosses.			"

												Interesting game.  Graphics are a little ...blurry?  Maybe that's intentional, but it made the game feel a little dated.  The gameplay is very Binding of Isaac, there's no getting around that comparison.  The background and story of the game are more coherent and relevant than BoI.  If I've got one complaint, it's how grindy the game is.  The need to play-until-you-die over and over again to farm the necessary points to get the persistent bonuses to have a shot at moving on in the story was somewhat overwhelming.All in all though, it's a decent game.

Reasons why I like this game:1)The player is always finding new things items and combos, keeping the gameplay as fresh as a newly dug grave 2) The music is simple, yet really catches the creepy charm that Edgewood has3) Upgrades that don't make you overpowered, yet still feel very staisfying 4) I know this is an odd one, but it is really nice to have a game that doesnt feel the need to flash bright colors at the player to make me feel all nice and powerful (the crits speak for themselves, thank you very much!)5)Even though it's repetitive(ish), it gives me the same feeling that MOBAs do: it let's me learn from my mistakes and earn my upgrades so that I can do better against familar foes and, EVENTUALLY, best themAll and all: 9/10  (one point off for giant-catus-balls-of-death-and-sadness)			"

												As a fan of dark and gothic games, this is one of the best. Yes, people will compare this to the Binding of Isaac but those who choose to skip this title will surely be sorry. The gameplay is great although I feel it could be better if played with a controller. The writing is truly the best part. With its wonderful dark humor and intriguging story, I will surely remember the Edgeworth Home for Lost Children for many years to come. I guess the game has something not a lot of games have anymore. Character. This game is overloaded with its charm and is certainly a buy for those who love rogue-like games and casual games. Almost forgot, the music (especially the title theme) is great and worth the price.			"

												The Administrators wish to remind you that we are not responsible for injuries sustained by rolling from room to room in your home after prolonged exposure to Our Darker Purpose.This game is really fun. Tough as nails, but fun. The enemies and bosses are lovingly designed. It has a charming art style. What little music there is is haunting and well put together. It still sees periodic updates that are carefully balanced and improve the overall experience.The most glaring problem with this game is that Cordy has no firing animation aside from some swirly fire that moves independent of her. That will never stop bugging me even though I'm not looking at Cordy most of the time when playing this game. The hitboxes are also strange and not entirely obvious upon looking at the sprites.That said, the items and upgrades you get can change your gameplay in important ways, but it seems as if there are a specific few upgrades or items that you absolutely need in order to beat the game. At least a few of the items from that group, anyway. But overall the pacing and balance of the game is pretty good, especially after unlocking better lessons (permanent upgrades in-game).Is it worth 15 bucks? It's getting there, yeah. Every update refines the experience. If I were writing this review for past-me, I would tell myself to get it for 15 dollars. But this game certainly isn't for everyone.			"

												Cordelia somehow managed to survive her peers violently taking over the Edgewood Home for Lost Children. Starting from the ""Waking Floor"", she must travel to the highest library to find out exactly what is happening in a school with only the most casual relationships with reality. Along the way, she'll fight her feral peers, former best friends, and horrible monsters that dwell within the shadows.A fantastically fun and brutal game reminiscent of Binding of Isaac only with a heavier emphasis on movement and slightly more player choice. The inclusion of the ability to roll changes the pace of combat entirely, allowing for quick escapes from bum-rushing foes or projectiles. Outside of the items that buff your character to various degrees, you also get level ups which allow you to choose between two potential boosts in a variety of stas--speed, attack power, health, etc. Further, completing floors gets you credits, which can be used to buy ""classes"" which serve to alter the base abilities that Cordy starts with, either by giving her more items, more selection at vending machines, exchanging the roll for a teleport, or other minor-to-game-changing options.The art style is Edward Gorey-esque (basically the guy who Tim Burton wants to be), the soundtrack effectively atmospheric, and the story is peppered with subtle ""ah ha!"" moments for those who take the time to dive into the lore. It's also a charmingly (though darkly) funny game, with witty descriptions and dialogue detailing the slow unravelling of Edgewood's secrets. The bosses are the game's biggest strength, in my opinion--creative and fun to fight, each big bad needs to be approached in a way that is different from everything else. Nothing seems to be a simple reskin of an earlier foe with extra health, which is greatly appreciated.There are some downsides, the biggest of which is the fact that hard mode is a bit too geared against the player in that if you don't have 2-3 damage boosting levels/items by the first chapter boss, later bosses are going to be nightmarish slogs of whittling down massive health bars protected by obscene defense stats. While I appreciate difficult games, patience isn't really the thing to be testing. It also makes me dread fights I was looking forward to--to reiterate, the boss battles really are some of the game's strongest moments.But, really, my misgivings are just on the optional hard mode. And it could be that I'm just awful, so what do I know? If you like this kind of game, check it out.			"

												It's unfortunate that this game is considered a Binding of Isaac clone because while it shares some similarities, they are far from being the same game. This game is slower paced and a bit more tactical. You will need to pay more attention to your surroundings and more quick on your feet.  In any case if you enjoy rogue like isometric third person shooters, this is a fun game to consider.			"

												At first, I was unimpressed. Cordy moves so dang slow and doesn't shoot far at all and it's just the most unfair game ever.But it's also a little addicting, so I gradually learned the tricks of the trade and so it's more fun, now that I know exactly how to play it well.It gets away with being a Binding of Isaac copy with the fact that it's got some very lovely design -- Cordy herself is really very pretty -- and that the desks and potatoes talk about how it's a Binding of Isaac copycat. The potatoes and desks make the game tbh.I would not recommend if you're looking for super smooth gameplay or a relatively quick/easy game. Our Darker Purpose is far from it, and it's very far from being a perfect masterpiece. Perhaps it's not as good as Binding of Isaac -- but it is a different game and functions as such if you give it a chance.			"

												I think thirteen hours in and an agonizing defeat near the top is enough time to give this game a fair review.Our Darker Purpose is an insanely hard Rogue-lite with many similar elements to Binding of Isaac only with a sort of Tim Burton / A Series of Unfortunate Events twist which really allows it to shine on its own merits. To quickly go into the simularities this game has to Binding of Isaac, there are several different floors with increasing difficulty and theming, interesting bosses, an open-to-interpretation plot, tons of unlockables that you grab over the course of several games, and steady length increasing (every time you complete a run, you unlock a newer harder area which becomes the new end of the next run). What Our Darker Purpose does differently is that it escalates... well, just about everything. But the most important aspects are the bullet hell style evasion, more RPG leveling and stats, and how very quickly the game can bite you in the♥♥♥♥♥no matter how hard you try. To say that it's unforgiving is putting it mildly, if you're willing to put up with failure after constant failure, learning and adapting to the game, then this is a great fun game with a steady incline in difficulty. To be honest calling it a Rogue-LITE feels inappropriate as almost everything in this game is dependant upon what items you get with a constantly changing metagame. You can have an amazing early game, grab lots of amazing items, and then get your♥♥♥♥♥handed five times to sunday because you're not getting any more tokens or Juice Box spawns. Not that it matters considering that enemies deal steadily increased damage as time goes on. I had two hundred health by the top floor and hard hitting, fast shooting enemies were dealing about thirty damage. I died in that room in agony.I love Binding of Isaac and found Rebirth to be almost a little too easy for my tastes, so Our Darker Purpose was a great amount of difficulty I thrived for. But, I've also found that Our Darker Purpose's greatest strengths were also its greatest weaknesses. For starters the game constantly gets harder, which is awesome as before long I was beating Chapter one without a sweat. Because the game is exponentally harder as you progress, you can never really have much time to practice those floors. bosses, enemies, and learn their patterns. And when you die, it'll take a good hour or so just to make it back to that place again, and who knows what items you'll get - if any - when you get back there. There's great variety in items and leveling perks (you can choose between two random ones every level) that work together very well. But you only get items from enemy Leaders, chests, and vending machines, not bosses, which means that if the first two decide not to appear and there aren't enough tokens around the map, then you're without items. Leveling also quickly dips off as enemies give more XP, but not enough to give you additional levels. Plus there's no way to grind levels as once you finish a floor you're onto the next. Also the books are randomized, so you could never get the book perks that you need to really make a run beautiful. By itself the darkly comedic (and straight up horrific) lore is wonderful, and manages to shine without any real falterings. So good for it.So - again - Our Darker Purpose takes the Isaac formula and runs with it, to mixed results. As the game continues to get balancing and general gameplay patches, I can expect some of my complaints to change or at least be diminished in time. Eventually it may become the go-to game for a more demanding Rogue-lite bullet hell game. It has the atmosphere, it just needs that polish. Personally I hope for an easy mode or some sort of continue option so I can at least learn how painful the upper floors will be without having that cloud of ""if I lose I'm going to have to start all over again"" hanging over my head. I think it'll also make the game a bit more accessible as it's already really amazing for more dedicated players (there's a hard mode! A ♥♥♥♥ing hard mode!).Highly recommended if you like Binding of Isaac, or at least its formula, and want something much harder. Recommended if you want to see what the hype is about and are willing to put a lot of time into learning how to play the game through constant failure. Not recommended if you get frustrated easily, or just are on the edge about games like this. This game will not change your mind, if anything it'll make you feel like the hundreds of poor hilariously abused orphans in this game.			"

												Do I recommend this game?If you are a fan of Binding of Isaac and roguelike genre, and if you already played Binding of Isaac: Rebirth enough (more than 100-200 hrs) then YES, I will definately recomend this game (specially on 85% off).This game adds some new elements to the BoI's genre, like leveling up and selecting paths between school's floors. Plus this game has a beautiful art style and atmosphere, but unfortunately there are three problems that prevent this game to shine like a true gem. And what are those 3 flaws of the game?1. Lack of enough polish 2. Lack of enough polish 3. Lack of enough polish.In fact this game still look like an early access game, even 1 year after release. Here are some examples:- There are problems with colliders, for example door's collider is placed so poorly that going to next room is always frustrating.- Particle effects and FX of the game isn't in proper shape for release.- Sound design of the game is ridiculous: lots of charracters doesn't have any sound for their actions! and the in-game music doesn't match the gameplay, it's more proper for a walking simulator genre. devs should definately look into BoI's musics- Animations of characters don't have enough frames, so they aren't catchy enough.- Some here and there bugs.- Chalks aren't as useful as BoI's bombs. one reason for this is very low item/coin drop rate in the game. so you will never have enough chalks on the path to make them game changing.- After all leveling up and picking different items, you will never feel that your character is powerful enough. usually effects of items aren't very tangible. for example at start of the game, fire rate of our hero is 1.6 and at the end of the game it's something like 2.4 and that's something like 2 shots per second (not so fast). shot's range and damage are the same as fire rate. the result is that items and leveling up aren't rewarding enough.This game could be a wonderful game with a score of 8.5 or 9. But in the current state, it still is a good game but it's more like a wasted potential.7/10			"

												At first glance it is easy to make comparrisons to The Binding of Issac, and in this case it is to the games benefit. The very stylish art combines with a moody atmosphere in a dark and creative story that makes it a hit in my book. Where as the Binding of Issac is the shining light of Rogue-Likes and good gaming all around, Our Darker Purpose is a sleeper hit, often overlooked BUT completely worth your time as its endearing concept has the potential to become it's own heavy weight like the Binding of Issac.Given some tender loving care, and time this could potentially become some truly awesome.However it would be remiss of me not to point out that its down side is that it is only partially controller supported. I would like to see it fully supported in time.			"

												One sentence review:  All the difficulty, metagame, and child abuse of Binding of Isaac but with more maturity and polish.Our Darker Purpose is an action roguelike very similar to Binding of Isaac - your shots can be angled with movement, there's a significant metagame, it's Nintendo Hard and each playthrough makes you stronger both in terms of your experience and unlocked potential.If some of the more immature elements of the Binding of Isaac turned you off though, then this may be more suited to you.  The artwork is elegent, the music just as good, and while the controls could be better failure in Our Darker Purpose feels very much one's own fault over simply being dealt a poor hand which is more a factor in Binding of Isaac.  I'm not sure of the fun, game-breaking elements of BoI are present in Our Darker Purpose -- I've only beaten one chapter -- but this is a game designed to be played through repeatedly.  If you like hard games, if you like a different experience each time, if you enjoyed Risk of Rain, Binding of Isaac and other games where you've just one shot to complete it but don't want to be screwed over with simple bad luck then this could be the game for you.  If you enjoy Tim Burton, ""A Series of Unfortunate Events"", and top-down bullet-hells then this is also the game for you.			"

												Upon my initial reading of the reviews here, what I took away was that Our Darker Purpose was a harder, gothier Binding of Isaac clone. And I figured that I would be okay with that; I picked the game up on sale, and I've honestly spent two dollars on worse things.If you've played Binding of Isaac, the gameplay is done in the same style. The floor layout and enemies are randomly generated. When you die, you go back to the beginning. Yeah, that all sounds familiar.But Our Darker Purpose is so much more than Binding of Isaac in a different skin. I've played a handful of hours (at the time of writing), and have barely cracked the third floor. I mean, I'm not a hardcore roguelike player (or usually a fan of the genre at all), so my thrill comes from getting just that little bit further each time. Right now I think of Hard Mode and shudder, seeing as how I regularly get mowed down by run-of-the-mill enemies.But that's part of what makes the game accessible. Well, to me at least. People in the same boat as myself can enjoy the game. We can hunt down the bits of lore, delight in our achievements (because, to us, they really ARE achievements), giggle/sigh at the conversations between inanimate objects, wonder at the art and the music, raise a very pointed eyebrow at some of the character design, and then get back to business because we ARE going to beat Chapter 1 tonight, d@mmit!And then the people who are great at these games, who want a challenge, can chew their way through Hard Mode. I honestly don't know if story matters as much to that type of player as the gameplay itself; I can image that is where disappointment lurks.Our Darker Purpose pulled me in in a way that Binding of Isaac never did. It's that drive to find more nuggets of dialogue that brings me back to empty rooms. It's getting to the next floor with 9 HP and, for a lark, seeing how far you can get anyway. It's not having enough juice boxes to heal through the boss's damage, but he's almost dead, and oh god I hope I can kill him before he kills me.If you're a player who enjoys sinking into a fresh new world, where the details come in bits and fragments, where wit and charm can overcome a few oversights in artistic direction, then this game might be for you.

												While I would really want to recommend this game, it is fairly enjoyable with interesting progression, decent bosses, and challenging but not overly hard. Unforunitly there is one single thing that prevents me from recommending this game. The hitboxes are horrible, shots that look like they should hit don't, shots that look like they should miss hit, I mean it may just me being used to the locations of the hitboxes in Binding of Isaac, but you basiclly have to aim all your left/right shots above their head to hit them, sure you can just figure the enemy is about 2/3rds of a body length higher up on the screen then you expect, but it just doesn't feel right.Other then that one bug bear I would fully recomend the game, but that is a big issue that makes the game a lot less enjoyable then it should feel. The choosing between two different perks (that some have possitives and negitives attached to them) every time you level up, the unlocking permint perk chooses (you can unlock 36 of them but are limited to x amount per run) by completing challenges like defeat the chandeller boss without ever leaving it's light radius, or defeat the cualdron boss before its add, or defeat the present boss with 4 or more adds left alive (like the 4 drakes achievment in the one raid in WoW)... So challenging things to do that take skill to complete that unlock perks that make the game a bit easier (or harder depending) which you get to choose a few to bring into each run.Fix the hitboxes and I would fully recommend, but the hitboxes are just to much of a turn off to recommend with games like Binding of Isaac Rebirth at the same price feeling like you have better control due to the hit boxes being where you would expect.

												This is a nice game:Pros:- dark steampunk-like Artstyle inspired by the gashlycrumb tinies- horror (especially the lord of the flies style battle of the different factions of former pupils) story which builds slowly with each play session- possibility of strategical builds for own gameplay style or unlocking challanges Cons:- relatively hard- some items doesn't add much to gameplay (they make no difference)- somewhat repetitive (after finishing a chapter you have to replay it)[although there's a nice story twist behind it]I did not finish it yet but i like it. Therefore i recommend it.			"

												Well, this game looks and plays like a copy of Binding of Isaac. The base game mechanics are just the same.But there is something different enough to make this game feel very different once you play 2+ hours. You can donate tokens to the counsellers (from main menu). This makes your character stronger as you donate more and more tokens. You earn these tokens every time you clear a level.So, this game is totally worth getting at a >50% off. "

												It's like Binding of Isaac except slower paced and less addictive/fun. Which isn't to say it's bad, but unfortunately the RPG elements just mean you have to grind the early levels over and over to unlock stuff and save up credits rather than having the chance to get further in thanks to a good set of pick-ups. The sort of game you get sick of and swear off while playing but end up going back to again a few hours later.			"

												I want to reccomend this game; but only barely. the art is wonderful, the style is great, and the gameplay is... Adequate. But CLOSE to being a really good game.Overall, the gameplay is slow, and very different from most other ARPGs of this type. It has a way steeper learning curve than most, and is much slower and more methodical - while also having a bullet hell element. You'd better get good at dodging. And no matter what you do, sometimes, the game just kicks you in the teeth and gives you nothing usful at all.But when you win, man, it's satisfying.			"

												I like this game :) just kinda like isaac in gameplay. And this game is suuper hard, but super fun.may seem a little half grindy for those crystals, since you dont get that many, compared to what you need to gather up.But, overall, still fun and worth buying if you like rouge-like hard games or binding of isaac.

												I want to like this game. I really do, I love the semi story, I like the art style, the concept is a classic from other roguelikes (namely isaac). However.. The gameplay is just.. not as fun as it could be, the hitboxes are not accurate, you think you dodge something.. turns out you didn't. Rooms are never calm, traps keep running in rooms you've already beat, making moving about a trying matter that's just not as fun as it could be.However... the humour is there, you'll find it to be rather grim. But it's there. So there's that. Also dragon bosses.			"

												If you're wary about roguelike games because you like making progress, even if it's slow, I would avoid this game. The permanent unlocks seem to come far and few between. I only got one permanent unlock in two playthroughs of the first two levels, and the game doesn't seem to tell you how to get more permanent unlocks/upgrades. I just had one come up for purchase after my first failed run. I don't know why and it didn't say why. If you are a super masochist, then you'll love this game. If you are one, good for you. There's nothing wrong with that. Just not my cup of tea and I'd like people who aren't masochists to know that this game probably isn't for them.			"

												Can't rave enough about this game. I bought it in early access, and was surprised at how solid the game was, even when supposedly ""unfinished"". Gameplay is similar to Binding of Isaac and the countless other roguelikes out there, but what sets Our Darker Purpose apart is it's unique Burton-esque art style and mysterious backstory (which is unlocked in pieces as you play through the game).Tons of replayability. Each playthrough will earn ""credits"" that can be spent on upgrades for future playthroughs, though it only allows a certain number to keep the game difficult. I've played over 50 hours and have only faced the final boss once. I can stop playing for awhile, then pick it up again weeks (or even months) later with ease and it's still just as enjoyable.I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys roguelikes. It's a steal at $15, and you will find yourself playing again and again.			"

												If you like The Binding of Isaac, then you should totally get this. It's funny, it's skillfull, it's hard but ALWAYS FAIR. it has ton of great Lore (if you are into this) Burtonien/don't starve graphic style. Even if it's inspired by the binding of isaac, by no mean is it a copycat, the whole system is different.Portal references. I have all the achievement on BOTH Isaac game, and I rediscovered that I had this one on my acount, while waiting for afterbirth+ I decided to launch it again, Oh boy, why did I forgot about it ? 10/10 would bake again. Love you Avidly Wild Games team you did a wonderful job <3 I'm going to try to 100% before febuary the third.			"

												A shame this game never caught on more. It's actually almost as good as binding of isaac and indeed a fair bit like it. Very challanging an unique, it doesn't look very fun from the video, and your first few plays it might seem pretty dull, but if you stick with it, it turns into one of the most brilliantly thought out games.Very carefully designed gameplay, and impressively addictive game once you get into it. You should use a controller with this game, and joy2key if needed to make it work correctly with it.The music is just awesome. Sad, errie, epic, powerful, mournful, this is stunning work, one of my fav soundtracks in all of gaming. The visuals are pretty unique too!The story is mysterious, and you will unlock more of it as you play, along with unlocking upgrades for future plays. It's not a super famous rock star like isaac, but it deserves to be.  I am sad you devs didn't get more attention with this game, don't give up though! You made something pretty special even if the masses can't see that.			"

												The game is enjoyable, maybe not to the point that I'd play it constantly, but sufficiently enough. However, The Binding of Isaac is a better option, especially when looking at the price tag. I'd recommand you only get this game during a large sale, rather than paying the full price.			"

												Upon my initial reading of the reviews here, what I took away was that Our Darker Purpose was a harder, gothier Binding of Isaac clone. And I figured that I would be okay with that; I picked the game up on sale, and I've honestly spent two dollars on worse things.If you've played Binding of Isaac, the gameplay is done in the same style. The floor layout and enemies are randomly generated. When you die, you go back to the beginning. Yeah, that all sounds familiar.But Our Darker Purpose is so much more than Binding of Isaac in a different skin. I've played a handful of hours (at the time of writing), and have barely cracked the third floor. I mean, I'm not a hardcore roguelike player (or usually a fan of the genre at all), so my thrill comes from getting just that little bit further each time. Right now I think of Hard Mode and shudder, seeing as how I regularly get mowed down by run-of-the-mill enemies.But that's part of what makes the game accessible. Well, to me at least. People in the same boat as myself can enjoy the game. We can hunt down the bits of lore, delight in our achievements (because, to us, they really ARE achievements), giggle/sigh at the conversations between inanimate objects, wonder at the art and the music, raise a very pointed eyebrow at some of the character design, and then get back to business because we ARE going to beat Chapter 1 tonight, d@mmit!And then the people who are great at these games, who want a challenge, can chew their way through Hard Mode. I honestly don't know if story matters as much to that type of player as the gameplay itself; I can image that is where disappointment lurks.Our Darker Purpose pulled me in in a way that Binding of Isaac never did. It's that drive to find more nuggets of dialogue that brings me back to empty rooms. It's getting to the next floor with 9 HP and, for a lark, seeing how far you can get anyway. It's not having enough juice boxes to heal through the boss's damage, but he's almost dead, and oh god I hope I can kill him before he kills me.If you're a player who enjoys sinking into a fresh new world, where the details come in bits and fragments, where wit and charm can overcome a few oversights in artistic direction, then this game might be for you.

												So, this game keeps getting better.I've had this game for a while, and I'll be honest - I was looking for a Binding clone when I got it, and I was not dissapointed. At the end of the day, this is a cute (from a goth/emo perspective) twin-stick shooter in the same vein as Binding of Issac or even Geometry Wars. There are power-ups to be had, boss and mini-boss battles, and a fun sorta ""Classic Addams Family Comic"" vibe to the art style. The controls are not terrible, but not great - you're stuck with either awkward keyboard or slightly less responsive gamepad, but gamepad works well enough to not get in the way of the fun, so I say use that.I'm not gonna lie - my favorite part of this game is the art. It seriously looks like the old Addams Family comics (the ones that inspired the TV series and, later, the movies). It's dark and gothic, but not opressive. Combine that with consistant atmosphere that matches the art style, and you've got a real visual winner.I've reviewed this one twice before, making this my third review for this game and, if the devs keep improving it, not my last. It's an almost great game on the way to greatness, and I'm loving it. It can kill five minutes or a couple hours, and that's pretty awesome, too. So, yeah - get this one. I mean, if twin-stick shooting is your vibe, and you have a decent game pad to use (I advocate for the Xbox 360 or PS3 controllers, but what the hell do I know?) - no matter what, though, the art is great and the game itself is fun. Add that in with Devs who keep improving the game and you've got what I'd call a total win.			"

												A beautiful game, Whenever I died, rarely did I feel cheated by the game, generally I found myself at fault. the soundtrack is wonderful. I find myself continually returning to this game to make a few run throughs before returning to the real world.  I have yet to play binding of issac, but one things for sure, it will not have this beautiful gothic art style.			"

												Our Darker Purpose was a game where you can simplified to ""Binding of Issac Clone"". The game does took a fair share amount of inspiration from the said game and somehow able to convert all into their own style. Instead of go Pro/Con like Usual, This time I'll be more detailed than usual. This game deserve it anyway.The Story    You play as once muted little girl name Cordy, whom somehow survive from class massacare which occured when Mr.L (The teacher) absent from class to see ""the administrator"" and never came back. Cordy will fight her classmate with her ""power"" and anything she could found in school floor only to climbing up higher and higher to the top of her school building to discover the mastermind behind all of this madness.Gameplay    Its simple really, especially if you were ever beat Binding of Issac. You got either seperate movement/attack direction or movement+attack control scheme. You will also equpied with ""passive"" item which will usually boost your stats and also a ""manually"" use item which will take time to cool dow before able to used again. All are almost as identical as Binding of Issac but the most standing out mechanic in this game was these three things:-Rolling: You can roll all the time you like, which will temporarily boost your speed and evade yourself from oncoming danger.-Darkness: As you progress your ""Range of view"" will slowly taken away bit by bit to the point where you can't see a whole room without moving your character here and there. -Level Up: This game has a leveling up mechanic which will popped out ""two books"" for you each time you get into the point of leveling up. Each book has its own advantage and disadvantage but mostly govern around Speed/Damage output/Token etc.The Graphic/Art     Got to admit but this game done the 'art' quite pretty well. The style look dark and gothic like. I believe the most highlight on this game was when you finish each chapter and saw the background art, It was quite intersting to look at. But the movement of character are a bit ""flat"".Ps. This game was quite very interesting in term of reading an art style. But I  would suggest anyone who aint ""roughlike"" fan to stay away from this game.			"

												My review of ""Our Darker Purpose""Pros: Simple but effective gameplay,  ""Randomly generated"" levels,  Good atmosphere,  Good story,  4th wall breaking desks Con: When you die the game resets (To a point) and while you can get permanent upgrades it takes a long time and you don't really feel like you're getting anywhere,  maybe Im just bad but I can't even get past level 3 :3Rating:  7/10-Good,  if you like rogue lite games with permadeath then you will probably like this :)			"
