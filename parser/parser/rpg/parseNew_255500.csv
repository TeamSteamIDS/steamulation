								considering Ursa, Russian,Gatsu and myself have been the only players left from release and have done a RIDICULOUS amount of testing and bug reporting, yea something should be given to the remaining dedicated players since THEY PAID TO TEST YOUR GAME FOR YOU ARTPLANT i for one am done, theres nothing left with any meaning in the game.-Mining(worthless just go to barrums buy wat u need) -Salvage(non-existent :/ great call btw devs) -Refining/Crafting(obviously not done yet so no judgement other than NOT DONE YET)-Combat(pull>turn>pewpew wow must have been sooooo hard to program that) -Trade(total ♥♥♥♥in waste of time just give yourself infinite creds with the exploit) -Player Economy(been over year guys absolutely none other than an expensive repair bill for supporting who? the npcs?) -PVP(current 30day avg 2.9 so yea, ursa vs russian) -Mods(all broken & easily exploited) -Ships(not a single balance or new ship since release) -Map(now we have an incredibly small ""3d"" map, thx for that)The forums are literally more fun and exciting as well as much more active than the game itself, whats that say for your gameplay artplant? Anyway im done ranting, best of luck guys			"

								This game does have a lot of potential but it's just way too early to buy now. I can't seem to complete any missions beyond the tutorial. I get pirate kill missions and don't get credit for any of the kills. I did ""find thief"" missions and no one could find where sectors 1 - 5 were. All the space traveling is done in a 2d birds eye view, which I am not a fan of. This game is extremely instanced and each instance is very small. I hit loading screens every 3-4 minutes on average. I tried using my saitek x52 pro and there seems to be no joystick support. I think this game may be fun in the future but at this time I feel like I purchased this game thinking it was something else than it is.			"

								I know its in Alpha stage so a lot of the fanboys and devs are saying its alpha dont complain. Please don't get fooled like a lot of us did. There is nothing to do no pvp no free flight through space you fly on a 2d map for 80% of the time yer playing, 10% of yer time on a space station with no missions and the other 10% flying around either mining rocks or dropping of cargo. So if you want to be confused and bored out of yer mind then by all means give them some of your money. The color orange is overused too imo. You would be better off playing Star Conflict or Eve or anything for that matter. Im not trying to be mean im just being honest.			"

								So, ArtPlant decided they would put a couple of devs on this game and continue work on it very slowly. They have a rough plan listed in the forums, but who can actually tell if they are following it or not. The first thing in that list is ""Solo gameplay"" but this gameplay is still largely broken. In a new, vague update they state they are working on ""the ability to intercept other players in fast travel and minor pirate gameplay improvements"" which isn't solo play at all.There are things have been changed in the game such as some graphics and mission boards, but seriously it's all broken right now. I just tried again to play the game with a brand new character and the game constantly ""hiccups"" and lags. I tried doing a mission from the mission board and there were no rewards. In fact, all of them were fetch missions but I had no idea where to fetch the item from. I tried to follow the tutorial but, even though I had a fighter, it wanted me to mine an asteroid stating a laser works best but all I had on my ship was a projectile firing railgun and missiles that I couldn't fire. After shooting at the asteroid for a couple of minutes and fighting the lag which was causing my ship to jerk around, I just quit.It's sad to say after all the years fighting to keep this game alive and pushing the devs to continue development, this game is a buggy, unfinished mess. It could turn around at one point, but why waste your time and money. There still are only a couple people playing it according to the stats (you never see them online) and even the devs don't know when the game will be finished (by their own admission). There are other games out there, and more to come. I'm done waiting and wasting my time.// - - - OLD REVIEWAbandoned.I bought this game about 2 years ago because it looked like a great Freelancer-esque game and it was. Things seemed like they were developing nicely, but now it's dead in the water.One big debate was a 2d map travel system (which you don't see in the videos except for 2 seconds) which was voted out for full 3d by the users. This took some development time away from the game and apparently they lost motivation to work on the game and, by the Devs own admission, they thought about scrapping the game altogether. Over a month ago they said they would continue work on the game with a smaller team but haven't released any updates or intention in the forums. It's been over half a year since an actual game update was released. Current game is bug ridden and largely unplayable plus has only a handful of players (literally, I think five people play the game).So much potential, but as of now it's all lost. DO NOT BUY.			"

								It's all dead in space. I bought this a while ago, being excited about the idea of an MMO in spaceships. Graphics in the vids looked cool and a flat-rate buy-in with no subscription in the future to play!Now I see there is no future. The game seems pretty much dead. I don't think I've seen any updates since last October, but you don't have to quote me on that because I don't know... it's such an uninteresting game that I quit caring.The biggest thing right off the start was the ""2D Navigation Map"" yep... 2D. And you won't find it Highlighted in ANY of the screenshots on the StorePage. But you know that one bright picture, of the Orange Sun, asteroids, and ships flying in; well you see that ONE picture ALL THE TIME as the loadscreen. 


Loadscreen 
Community Created Artwork for Steam Artwork
By: Opt_0™

			This is used for example in my review. If I remember correctly this is the load screen, and you would see it constantly as you load for everything.		


So you spend 80% of your time on this 2D map, loading in and out of EVERY little thing. So you get that picture all the time as you engage any enemy, mine, change sectors (which you have to do constaly), enter a Station's Space (instance), enter a station, leave a station, leave the space, 2Dmap, fly around in this little retro feeling cutesy version of the game you thought you were going to play.Combat, well that was disappointing to during my short and uneventful tries playing. Any time you want to engage in combat (or mining) you have to load in to the instance from the 2D map, and the space is Small. The Space Box looked real pretty, but the ships felt like logs in space and almost always (at the time) the Ai would just fly in circles. Literally Circles, you'ld get close fire and it would turn into the most disappointing space combat you can imagine. The kind where you constantly excellerate past each other, firing wildly, just missing ships, then you both flip around and pass each other in the other direction. If it's too much, you just fly away; either to the edge of that rendered space (before loading out to the 2D nav map,) and turn around, or just fly off to ""warp away""... lame. After a bit you really just get irritated and so you stop moving, which seemed to confuse the AI for a bit. Then you basically play space turret and just spin around shooting at the AI. kill them get some items and return to the 2D navmap... real uneventful. Even the mining was tedious and consisted of no more thanmoving near some asteroids and hitting them with a colored laser. Area's with Enemy AI could be avoided, or you could eneter and simply avoid the circling AI at the center of the instanced-space.I could go on and on. Basically, there is NOT as much bad*ss space fighting as you'ld like. It's a heavily ""instanced"" game, meaning it loads into EVERYTHING> it is NOT SEEMLESS. The one apparently fully functioning mechanic is trade, but AI trade. You basically run around chasing automated but ""random"" shiftes in the AI market buying goods at low prices and trying to make it back in time to sell somewhere else. If you are a SUPER cash/trade managment player you may enjoy it. But really you'll hop on that 2D map too and immediately feel like you just wasted 20$, even if it is ""perminet access"". 'Cause you will spend ALL that running around time on that damned 2D map. It really does feel like a classic ""bait and switch"". You pay for the game shown in the vids and screens, but you get to play this ""other"" game of 2D map flight about 80-90% of the time. There are better games to play if trade is really your thing. SO MANY OTHERS! SAVE YOU CASH, LOOK ANYWAY ELSE. Buy Kerbal Space Program on sale, or Any of the New Gen Space Games, or Nexus, Sins of a Solar Empire, AYTHING other than this. PLay Star Trek Online for FREE!!!!! I swear you'll get tons more hours of better, although sometimes clunky, gameplay out of that than you will on this.Also... it appears the online comminity is really dead. There was barely anyone on when I tried and almost no one now. Seriously you can get on and play an MMO alone. My last minute advice if you still feel like you want to buy this: DON'T.Watch videos of the 2D nav map, then consider that's about 80% of your gameplay right there.			"

								I got 100+ hours in this game and I've very mixed.  If you like ""buy low here, sell high here"" then you should enjoy this game.  However, looking at the bigger picture be warned.  It seems the game devs have simply stopped updating the game.  I have seen no activity in months (currently Oct 2014)  Worse over 99% of the community has left.  So if you like playing a MMO all by yourself with little fear of hostile action, then yes you'll enjoy it. "

Early Access Review
								Summary : Boring 2d game, Buggy, And extreme griefing of new players.This game is now setup to allow griefing of any new player. Existing players were able to exploit bugs in the game to trade up to the top level of ships and weapons. They could not be attacked whilst trading. Then the developers turned on pvp for all new ships from high level players. The only efective way to build credits to upgrade your ship is to trade. if you trade any player can simply fly past you and take your goods with a couple of button clicks destroying your ship. There is no place you can go no skill or option you can use to prevent this. it takes many hours to build up trading credits and goods it takes seconds to be put right back at the beginning. If this happens you are best deleting your character and starting again as you will then at least get starting credits again.Mining , salvage parts of game are redundant. Rolling a pvp ship to begin is also redundant still get killed 1 -2 shots outside your range by a ship that i faster than you and beins the pvp session directly behind you ship.I have never sees a worse setup to ensure griefing of new players in many many mmos i have played.Also there are only three quests in the chain followed by pointless and broken find a theif. and pirate killer missions.You can be ganked whilst trading, you can even jump into a quest instance of another player and gank them.This game is setup for children who like to walk around the playground with their gang stealing from everybody else. nothing more.Worst most boring mmo ever i've wasted my time thinking this would be a new 'elite' or fun space  trading game.Last but by no means least the game constantly has issues on combat / quest loading screens meaning you often go into combat but cannot see the screen.Way to go Entropy beta / alpha or not one of the worst implemented mmos ever. Wooden spoon of the year maybe the decade.Played the game to level 5 and 10 million credits as i was lucky to get in before they turned the griefing on. I could buy a top level ship now but am leaving anyway as the ethics of this game are so poor now i see new players come and pretty soon leave in disgust after being ganked in starting space repeatedly laughed at and told to learn to play by the rude and offensive existing player base.Can't believe i actually parted with money as well as my time for this. A 2d space game in 2014 wow way to go this would be poor by the flash / web / mobile game standards.			"

								This was an interesting spinoff idea of Eve Online, however, due to a toxic fanbase that did nothing but spam negative reviews down with ""non helpful"" votes, this game has as of today officially died out, having ZERO people play it: http://steamcharts.com/app/255500Not to say that this was the only reason for It's demise. It offered a very restrictive and bland 2d-planed ""star system"" travel map with invisible wall borders closing you in like a sheep (last thing you want in a Space game), a dumb AI and extreme grinding requirements in order to buy even the smallest of ships reaching digits of 8,000,000+ with you only earning maybe a few ten thousands (if you're good) every hour.TL;DR: A title that had a toxic community, died as a result and will be a game that no one remembers.

								I enjoy space games immensely and I do hope for this game to turn around, but currently I can not recommend it.Controls - Feels very clunky for me.Updates are far and few between.Dead community - Lucky to see 2-5 people online.Latency issues (I can live with that, I live on a rock (Australia - connected via 100/40 m/s Cable connection) and have to deal with high pings, but this is 3-5 times worse than any other MMO I ever played.Shall re-visit this maybe in another 6-12 months and I do hope that a miracle has happened and its turned around and doing well. Which I hope I can change my review to a positive one and a Thumbs up.If you see Entropy on a Steam sale, it be worth it. But until its at release and showing promise I wouldn't pay current retail.

								First thing is first. This is early access, so there's going to be a lot of bugs and features that just simply aren't created yet. With that said, this game popped up out of nowhere and is a pleasant surprise. Imagine if Freelancer & EVE Online had a kid. In fact, my first impressions of Entropy feels like an open world Star Conflict with mining & trading.There are a lot of quirks with the combat, system travel, trading, etc. and it will take a bit to get used to. For instance:There is a lot you have to figure out for yourself. You simply can't right click on an object and get info for it right now. Flying around sectors needs an overhaul. I see what they are trying to do, but moving around on a 2D plane just takes me out of the game - but thats how you get to places. Everything takes place in little zones and you can't exactly explore to your hearts content, as you are unable to go outside of the ""grid"". There are tons upon tons of loading screens. Everything you do = loading screen. They just released a patch that has made loading significantly faster, but I wish that there was less 2D traveling/cutscenes and more space.All in all, Entropy is a nice little surprise before Christmas. I recommend it to anyone who, like me, got a big Egoshaft up their *** from X Rebirth. It's simply a whole lot more fun, surprisingly polished for Early Access, and takes the edge off of waiting for Star Citizen and Elite Dangerous.			"

Early Access Review
								I know this game is early access, and that there will be bugs and things that are not quite complete, and I accept that, so I am not going to mention anything involving bugs or glitches, and will instead focus on the playability and feeling of the game.To be blunt, this game is an unplayable abomination.The only good thing I can say about it, is whoever worked on the character creation did a good job, as for the rest of the game, not much good can be said.When I first started, I chose to be a merchant, and went through the tutorial. As a merchant, you start off with a ship that handles like a brick that is drifting in space. All you get are a couple of crappy laser guns, and you are off, fighting enemies, selling vaccines, and doing stuff.After a few missions, I found myself noticing how slow and long winded and just plain boring the game was, and found myself bored and frustrated.The game is so boring, that I literally found myself rolling cigarettes and making sandwiches while I wated for my ship to fly from being in-view of a station to at the door of the station.I decided to try another character, and this time went with a survival/combat guy. I was given a slightly faster ship, but it looked practically identical to the slow cargo ship I had been given as a merchant. Furthermore, while the top speed of the ship was slightly higher, it still handled like a brick drifting in space.With the combat ship, I was given a few guns instead of the two lame lazers you get with the cargo ship, but for some reason, I could kill enemies easier with the lame lazers than with the big combat guns. For some reason, they just did not do as much damage.It seems that whatever you start off as, merchant or fighter, you will have slow unresponsive controls. Also, you will go through the exact same tutorial.I have not played much at the time of typing this, and I will be checking back in from time to time to see if things improve, and if they do, I will come back and edit this post, but for now, I can't even stand to load the game up and see it.It is slow, boring, and frustrating. However, it is more than just that, the problems are much more fundamental and deep rooted.Here are the negative things that I have noticed:-It is not an open single world, it is divided up into instances that need to be loaded. I understand that space is big, and you can't have loads of solar systems all in one world, but they have not only divided it up by solar system, they have also divided it up by whatever is in each system. Instead of load a solar system and fly from 1 planet to another, you load a solar system, then load a planet, and if you fly too far away from the planet, asteroid belt, ship, or whatever else you are near, you will come to an orange floating grid, that if you go beyond, will take you back to the main menu for what part you want to load.-Not only does the ship handle like a drifting brick, but the controls have been designed by a madman, because nothing is where you would expect it to be, and it just feels very uncomfortable and awkward to move.-The loading menu, has been disguised as a 2D top view of your ship flying around the solar system. So instead of just choosing what instance you want to load, you have to fly there very slowly.-You can fly directly through the sun or planets, and it does not blow you up or do anything to you, this does not seem like a bug either, it looks like its just how its going to be. When you are in the weird flying around slowly choosing what instance to load menu, you can't crash in to anything, suns, planets, ships, whatever, its all without mass.-The user interface and writing are so small that you simply can't read it. I have this loaded on a large 32'' screen, and no matter what resolution I put it at, all the writing is about size 6px.-It is too organge. From the logo to the UI, there is orange all over the place.-There are giant chunks of information that are just missing, with most of the things being unexplained.-The whole system is totally over complicated for the sake of being over complicated. For example, if you buy a new gun for your ship. First you have to buy the gun, then it will get moved to your warehouse menu. Once this happens, you can open your warehouse and then your ship cargo and drag it over, and once you have done that, you can drag it from your cargo to the slot you want to equip it on. This means you can end up buying things to trade, only to spend ages slowly flying bored out of your mind to sell them for peanuts, just to discover you left them in your warehouse anyway, and have to fly all the way back again.-A whole load more that I wont bother boring you with.How anyone can have the guts to ask for money for this is beyond my understanding. I rather give the cash to a beggar on the street, and at least get the feeling of having helped someone in return.Buying this game is like paying to be arrested so you can be made to wait for bail.Overall, I give this one a 2/10 at best. Lets see if it improves with time.			"

								Oh look, my first review.I doubt even going F2P would revitalize this game. The original concept behind Entropy still holds some merit but in the two years I've owned it the development has been so clunky and poorly planned that every other update for the past few months seems to have been the introduction of a half working totally unecessary feature and the rearranging of the UI, and said updates few and far between.It's like in 2013 they had a sizable development team churning out a decent potential-riddled game but now it seems as though the secondary texture artist and the worst programmer of the bunch are the only two left in the studio trying to do the job of an entire dev team. Fixing of the most fundamental issues of grandiose lag, game crashes and an economy comparable to buying US mansions with Indian rupees go either ignored or unknown and I doubt building a pyramid of bugged features atop a foundation so bugged it's literally a writhing mass of spiders and stick insects is a good omen for the future of the game. Updates are increasingly rare, any worthy updates will be massively overshadowed by the amount of negative reviews accumulated over time thanks to the barren wasteland that is progress in this game and I doubt anybody would purchase it. Eventually Entropy will sink to the dark depths of Steam hell and probably finally be removed from the store and sit in the hard drive of somebody's abandoned desk PC collecting metaphorical dust for the next 80 years.

Early Access Review
								Ultimately not worth the purchase price at this time.While the game is still in Early Access, the core experience is lacking on entertainment value. All immersion is lost when you must travel through a 2D map and enter small variation-lacking instances to complete content akin to a lobby based game. Once you arrive at your destination, the missions, interface and controls leave you wondering why you made the trip in the first place. Due to a variety of issues, most notably the UI scaling issues, I was unable to play the game efficiently.Pros:Game Looks GoodFrequent UpdatesCons:Missions are uninspiring and duplicated dozens of timesControls feel VERY disjointed and laggy -- combat is not smooth at allUser Interface that is unintuitive and ugly (YMMV)Higher resolutions (4k, surround/eyefinity setups) will be affected by user interface bugs that remove the functionality of target reticles making aiming nigh impossibleFrequent updates come with issues -- little bug testing often leads to performance issuesCutscenes every time you dock, depart, travel...SPACEBAR SPACEBAR SPACEBAR SPACEBAR...Grey area when it comes to ""No character reset in early access, get ahead before launch "" due to Alt-F4 trade exploits (Search for more information) -- If currency/items are wiped, it may not be worth paying to get an early ""advantage"" when more complete games are available for a lower costI recommend sticking to some of the non-MMO space simulators while you wait for this game to mature. Unfortunately, even with all of these cons fixed, the game still does not seem to offer anything over other titles.			"

								Abandoned shell of a game. Entropy was aiming to be your standard space game MMO where you can trade, pirate, pvp, craft and so on. Sadly something went wrong, game lost players, developers were too slow with advertising, updating the game - its pretty much dead now. No point in describing it more - do not purchase this.			"

Empty Mission boards. Empty NPC encounters in space. I would not recommend to buy it now, wait until it reaches Beta at least.			"

Early Access Review
								This is definately a game I wish there was a neutral review setting for.  For I cannot reccomend it nor can I dismiss it.    So, here goes my updated review after about 4 months.	Entropy is another space based MMO.  The developer, ArtPlant has done space games before in the iteration of BattleStar Galactica Online, a browser based dog fighting space game.  Entropy is trying to be like that but on a much grander scale.  2 years ago, when this came to Steam, Entropy had a 2D map that you would fly around and players absolutely hated it.  There was zero immersion.  After constant complaints from the player base, Art decided to scrap the 2D map and create a fully 3D experience.  The only loading screens would be when you docked, undocked and flew to the next system.  The map itself isn't very big.  Doing things like updating the map to 3D took several months.  About 4 to be exact.  During this time, ArtPlant didn't communicate with its playerbase like, at all.  People would ask in the forums what was going on but the dev's stayed tight lipped.  Around October of 2014, after 4-5 months of zero communication, the player base basically said ♥♥♥♥ it, and left.  Everyone assumed the project was dead.  This, righ there, is the epitome of a bad developer.  This company has spent almost nothing on advertising.  I think I've seen one or two adverts for Entropy online while I was perusing youtube.  Those ads lasted all of a month then poof, nary an ad.  Finally in late 2014, after zero communication, ArtPlant decided to chime in and posted an update on the state of the game.  They said they spent alot of money updating the 3D map and were going to move onto other problems with the game.  They really didn't want to update the map but felt like the player base hated it so much, that it would affect the sales of the game....which it did.Fast forward to the beginning of 2015 and Art is running out of patience.  A post is made declaring that the dev's are thinking of♥♥♥♥♥♥canning the project.  They spent alot of time and money on the map and were considering ending it.  After this post was made, most of the remaining playerbase flew into a rage and flamed the company.  This is why, today, at the time of this review, there are literally 0 players playing this online.  I jumped in tonight to check out the updates and I was the only one.  Noone in chat.  So most of 2015 was wasted on God knows what.  They released a few updates in late 2015 (if memory serves) and did a complete wipe of all player ships in late 2015.  So when I logged in, my ship and all its modules were missing.  You pretty much had to start over even though ArtPlant said there would be no wipes during development. But hey, its early access so whatever.That is just a brief history of the dismal development that Entropy has endured in last year and a half.  This is testament to how terrible Art is as a developer.  They talk to their player base....finally!  Most of the old players are gone, maybe a handful still read the forums on steam and keep up to date with development.  Art has managed to fix alot of the problems that plagued the initial release, such as trading being pretty terrible, and finally a crafting system.  As of this review, while in early access, I would say DON'T buy Entropy due to the development cycle of the past year.  Art is indeed releasing more constant updates, but I still wouldn't want someone to lay down 20-40 bucks for an early access game that may never finish.  There are a few die hard players still around but they almost never log in and play.  If you check steam charts, you will almost always see 0 players playing this bare bones space game.     Gameplay	Gameplay consists of accepting missions from the mission board in a station, then un-docking and flying to a pre-determined area in the next system.  This feels alot like Eve online here.  While traversing systems via a gateway, sometimes you will run into randomly generated pirate gangs. This is kind of neat, and breaks the tedium.  You can also mine asteroids with just your weapons.  You don't need to equip a special mining laser.  This is also nice.  Trading is just like in every other space game.  You haul goods from one station to another and hope to find a good route.  Since there are only like 20 systems, this isn't that hard.  Nothing extrenous like Elite Dangerous for example.  I haven't dabbled in the crafting yet.  I almost never do crafting in any MMO.  Crafting to me is extremely dull.  You equip modules on your ship just like in Eve and Elite Dangerous.  Not going over your capacitor is key.  So bigger ships can carry more of a payload.So there you are.  Make up your own decisions from the previous reviews.  Some of them are pretty pathetic and don't explain that much.  Don't pay too much attention to reviews written before December 2015 as those were before Art was releasing more consistent updates and was basically not talking that much to the community, so the community was peeved.

								Been playing for about 4 hours now. And while this game reminds me a lot of battlestar galactica online it does have its improvements. That being said, this is an Alpha build and it shows. It has a lot of bugs (as expected) and i myself at the moment cannot play the game due to a bug that keeps me from even logging in.The game has a lot of potential, it just needs to get rid of the bugs and have a bit clearer way of finding information in the game. As an example, i've just finnished the first quest and am now trying to mine minerals (which was quite straight forward to find). But i cannot for the life of me find a processing plant. Or any information about one.			"

								Sadly I do not recommend this game, several reasons is it is not a true Space sim, more a combined 2D / 3D hybrid pseudo simulator. Which the screenshots do not reflect of what you are really seeing. The game starts off great for an alpha, but then after looking at a 2D map for a majority of you time traveling around the universe you soon realize you are cheated a space sim, and are just given some 2004 recreated game with shiny 'orange' graphics. In short, its pirates of the 7 seas hosted in space with some small 3d shoot outs included. And when I mean small, I do mean small, combat is limited to short range dog fighting where I found myself sometimes bumping into the other ship. Not really dog fighting but more 'get as close and blast first' to win. The devs did make progress with missions and cleaning things up, but what killed it was the devs have decided AGAINST making a 3d map/space instance of the game but having a 2d travel map (with ice skating) mixed with 3d instanced zones. This is a buzz kill as you lose a lot of tactics in 2d as there is no X Y Z and just a chess board field to skid on. Since this news has been released I decided it’s not my cup of tea and have found other games more entertaining and worth value over this. I would strongly recommend looking at other games that are on the horizon over this game if you are looking for a real 3d space sim as I find this game will not become the space sim people are looking for.

								Just don't spend you money on this, I deeply regret spending mine on it.There was a update recently so I decided to give it a second shot. After months of just ignoring it because my first attempt at playing the game was well bad. It didn't get any better, it even got worse. The interface is in my opinion unfriendly, compared to was is done these days. Last time I played I could at least fire my guns, this time around for some reason it just didn't work and it's technically pretty simple: left click to fire cannons. But they just wouldn't work even if I have 3 shiny activated cannons. On top of that my energy level won't recharge even if I have 'Rapid Charge Energy Bank' on my ship. They look pretty pointless now, even if when I look at the stat of my ship it DOES have a positive energy recharge (bug?).An other thing is travel in painful, so as I mentionned before guns don't work. Which I found out once I had two npc on my back. Since my guns din't seem to work I decided to bug out to try to figure out how to make my gun work after about 5 minutes of trying to do it with the NPCs on my back. You see there's a fast travel option in the game. This option make you go about 20 times faster then normal. Which is sadly still kind of slow, it will take you a few minutes to get between points on fast travel. But the thing is fast travel will disable as soon as you ship gets hit. So it there's NPCs on you and your guns won't work (in normal case you could run out of ammo, in my case they just didn't work at all). There is nothing you can do except maybe fly for a few hours to get back to the station or self destruct.So basically it was a very bad and frustrating experience.This game is simply horrible.			"

								In it's current state I can't recommend a buy for this. Not even at the lowest level. The controls aren't very good. You can't rebind keys. Missions are basically broken. The 2nd mission they gave me I'm supposed  to buy an item that is no where to be  found. A side mission I took there's zero guidance on how to complete it because the mission tracking feature doesn't work. There are frequent game crashes or game blocking bugs. It almost seems as if you spend more time in loading screens (because they are very frequent) or animation sequences than you do actually playing. I'm not fond of travel mechanics. The ui needs serious work. (small text, can't move anything around) Reloading mechanics are kind of a joke. Quite frankly the game is a bit of a mess at this point.There is some potential here but it's got a long way to go. Since I'm already bought in I'll give a few months and see where the development goes. I recommend everyone wait as well.			"

BUT DO NOT BUY! unless you like a game that is developed by people whom do not care about the people who payed to get this founder pack and put time and lots of money hoping every month that the developers would actually do an update. game was abandoned, then late 4th quarter of 2015 ENTROPY HAS NEW UPDATES!!! well kinda, the new game basicly wiped out my old game, all my ships ect. try to load in and wouldnt you know it your stuck at the station with your prevoius character and cannout undock..... must be a bug.so my final hope was to create a new character and start all over again, once i loaded in the ship kept spining in circles..... no control ..... must be a bug......so i went from having around 100 mil in ships and moduels to getting all that wiped and no refund ect. so if you happen to get this game please do your self a favor and try not to cry after you dumped 100 bucks and got nothing... good scam guys way to really push your potential customers to other games that took your idea and made it work........

			2D map...................		

Some people are going to like the 2d map.  Some people like LARPing, some like dungeons and dragons and tabletop games, but I'm not one of those people, and I was really hoping this could be a little bit more of a flight simulator because the combat instances already have the foundation for it.  We already HAVE a tactical 3d space   mmo, EVE ONLINE!  Ever heard of it?  Why do we need this one to go that route too!?  This game already has a solid foundation for 3D combat and flight mechanics.  Lol c'mon! Here are the following ways Entropy will defeat EvE as a tactical space simulation (it won't):-No way in hell-Absolutly not-I would rather go play eve.  -Eve makes the tactical gameplay somewhat enjoyable, this does not and the 2d map makes it worse.Here is how Entropy will defeat EvE as a flight simulation in full 3d space:-Combat from the pilots perspective-Enough appeal to the pilot to pull them away from eve-Trade/mine and travel in full 3d from system to system from the pilots perspective.-Feel immersed in the world, looking out your cockpit as you travel.

Eve has the server population already and will never be defeated in the tactical space simulator world.  Just the same as WoW reigns supreme to this day in the realm of Themepark MMO's.

However it seems less and less likely as time goes on and more features are being added to it instead of brainstorming how to get rid of it.  Save the map for the M key and not for the gameplay! "

								this game is not off to good start  i could not even complete the first starter quest 1 of the items you need to inspect disappeared so i only got credit for 2of 3  so unless you get three u just sit thier in open space doing nothing because quest chain does nothing til you get all three im guessing. guess ill never know so i deleted the quest to hopefully restart it and it did nothing so i quit game reloged and it still did nothing would not even reload my game after deleting the quest. so i took further action and deleted my toon and lost my extra creds from my higher purchase wow thats in first 10 min of game advise stay in beta a long time i would like my money back and steam says to get it back from the retialer i bought it from wich is steam who does not give refunds since thier is no link to forums for this game who in hell do you contact well who knows going to stick to developers i trust			"

								as of December 2013, this game is quite unplayable. Between slow loading screens for entering a sector to slow travel times to reach destinations, then more loading screens as you zone into that destination... a 30 second trip can take up to 5 unrewarding minutes. Serverside connections mean that anyone outside of US or EU locations will suffer greatly when trying to fly away from pirates, which rules out combat entirely (about 50% of the game) and if you find yourself attacked while trading, you will not be able to escape at all (ruling out the other 50%; trade).Entropy still has a long while to go before it is ready, and what time I did spend playing it was frustrating and time consuming to say the least. There is plenty of room for improvement so I would wait on this title, the foundations are there but it needs a lot of work.Gameplay - BadGraphics - GoodReplayability - GoodImmersion - Bad			"

Don't think your speakers don't work when you jump into the game... there's no sound during character creation. They could also do a bit better of a job with tutorializing things, as it's a bit confusing and things don't immediately show up as completed when you do them.  High hopes.			"

Early Access Review
								This game needs a lot of work before release from what I have seen in the short amount of time playing. The different bundles you can buy, giving you different amount of starting credits, without any real scope of what those credits could possibly buy. Basically the 500k credits can buy you a piece of gum in the universe they created. You can also earn money from bounties of pirates you killed, unfortunately the cost to resupply your ammo will far exceed the bounty reward. Mining is also possible, where you won't expend any ammo if you use a mining laser. And after 60 minutes of mining, I earned nearly 20k credits. So if I were to really buckle down and mine for 5 days straight, I could maybe afford a better ship. Well let's start from the beginning shall we? The game drops you in rather clunkily, no exposition, just in the middle of a mission, with some guy chirping in your ear. You coax more money out of him, to complete the mission after a fight. Then the goal is to get destroyed by some drones, so you can get back to the station. I thought this game was more open world, than story based. Well at this point I was proved right.  After getting a new ship for free from insurance, I leave the station, with no new missions in my journal, and no way to accept news on the station that I could find. Some guy yells for help, so I go help him. Win another extremely easy battle, then a cruise liner needs help right after I finish the fight. I go help them, kill 2 more weak pirate scouts, and head towards the lone remaining enemy ship, who proceeds to kill me in 2 shots. There was no lead up to harder and harder enemies, just a nice thank you for not returning to the station to unload the first meaningful cargo I hard before attempting to kill the boss pirate. Mission failed as well. Now another thing, I bought a mining laser, which made my rail gun seemingly disappear. Not sure the deal with that, but definitely annoying. It is early access of course, and the devs decided to again work on the game after an apparent long break where they contemplated taking the money they had earned so far and running. This game has some potential, but it needs a lot of work to be worth $20 in today's game market. I would recommend holding onto your money, following the game, and make sure the devs are serious about working on this game again, before giving them anymore money.			"

								its a good game concept... it is very much still a work in progress.  cartels (guild / clan etc) do not work nor does the friendlist work at this time.  it is very much a development in progress and does not have a lot to do at this time. however as i said it is a good game concept. Also the the development team is active and responsive for most part.  this is not a polished or even beta game so dont play it if you expect something that works as intended. the basic gameplay works and the game is very much in need of ways to keep the player entertained as for right now you can mine salvage do kill or transport missions with only minor issues such as infrequent disconnects. the community thus far is great folks are helpful friendly and many of us are eager to see where the game goes.  however at this time you spend much play time in a 2d map which needs some sort of flare added to it to keep it interesting.overall the game is unique and has a lot of potential i give it a no due to the fact that is still early accsess and you should not play it expecting a fully functional game... however if you want to help test give input and get involved with a exceptional alpha i give it 431.5 thumbs up			"

								This is a good game but an early Alpha if you are looking to get an early start on what could be a great game then I would say yet get the game. If you are wanting a complete and full experiance then I would wait a while. Alpha is Alpha and this is an early one. Devs seem to be active taking suggestions and asking for feedback so I have no issues supporting and playing this game to be honest I am enjoying it at the moment. Missions are buggy, that is being worked on.Trading seems to be working as intended, I have had no issues at all.There is basic mining in the game but again no crafting added yet. Combat for myself is fun but then again I love space twitch based shooters.Again I am recommending this for the pure fact I am enjoying this product and even though this is early alpha I can see this game getting better and better with each patch.

Expect alot of bugs like freezing the loading screen and binding issues, BUT you can repair them in no time and enjoy your alpha stay!EDIT : Notice the borring 2D system map. Dont get surprised, yes 2D all over where are you traveling around. Game is almost dead right now and waste of money for alpha testing.

								THis Game would be great if only the instances worked correctly. Just started a Miner however every time I go into an Asteroid belt or a derilct ship instance I can never find ANYTHING! to Mine or Salvage!!! (This is in the begining area).Until the basic workings of the game are fixed i dont think i will be playing or recommend this game to anyone. It is very frustrating flying around for no reason. Even the combat areas stop working after a few instances. its dumb!			"

								I was a bit excited when I first came across this. But, I should have just hung out in the forums and just watched vids for the next year..lolDecent GFX's isnt going to make the game any good.For a EA game, the dev's refuse to listen to the players. What little there is. And insist on not taking care of extreme issues and game play that the players have been begging for. Instead, they implement features that no one wanted or likes, now that its there. Im pretty sure that the whole purpose to go with the ""EA"" route, is to get that ""kickstarter"" and make the game for the fans. Not to get early money, and do nothing the fans ask...I did throw 20 bucks at it, because I dont see the big harm in that. Most ppl blow that at a resturaunt and only rent that..lolBut, I wouldnt recommend this for anyone interested in actual game play. I really tried to stay positive, but alias, I have my limit. DO NOT BOTHER!!Go play their F2P BSGO, and just leave this alone. BSGO, is the same game as this, but sooo much better. And, you dont have to DL anything..They are trying to make a BSGO clone, and are failing hard. Good Luck to anyone who decides to take the plunge. You could save some time and aggravation by letting your dog eat 20$.EDIT: Ok, since me writing this, I have seen that they have done some kind of update...2 years later....But, the forum is dead, besides the one guys who thinks he is talking to someone in a sticky that made their post months ago..lol It's a dead horse...still....So Im continuing my opinion that you should stay away! Don't beat this dead horse by throwing any money at it...I highly doubt that going F2P would help this at all......Dead....			"

								Was sold on the screenshots and the video. Much like the awesome trailer to a bad movie, Entropy's current state is not worth the price of admission. Was hoping for a cool space game to bide my time before Star Citizen - maybe this will be a contender with some major work done. I budget $5 a week to gaming, so this early access game took me a month to earn. Really wishing I saved my money. Do yourself a favor and save your cash for a game like Guns of Icarus or Artemis The Spaceship Bridge Simulator.			"

								Looks really good but for Beta game... The lack of mouse settings makes the game unplayable in combat as the point and shoot will cause your ship to move and your aim also moves, thus causing you to recorrect and then ship moves again and you recorrect and just go on and on and on and on.... To give a hint it took 20mins to down my first ship after restarting and took less than 3 sec when the ships aren’t moving, spawn kill :) This game will cause you to burn your house down at the moment....

								Cant load the character I made when I got it around 2 years ago and and it also fails to connect to the server when i try to make a new character that might need some attention for starters. If theyd make it F2P and do something with microtransactions for ship cosmetics etc I think it could still have a chance as long as they stayed away from the P2W sgheme. Not often you see those who payed saying make it free to play, but this needs it, they may want to heed the advice of the people who have already payed for it as all we have to gain is the ability to play it. Shame imo cause it looked like it had potential, waited a long time to do a review for it, but I see they are doing updates again and am hoping maybe theyll take the advice, nothing to lose by doing so really as is its dead in the water as is.

								Entropy is a space simulation mmo alot similar to games like freelancer and EvE. though how the game actually will look is unknown still because the game is still in early access. For a game open this early i think the game is stable, got a fun sence too it. but because it is so early in it's development it is fairly limited to what you can do. But as the developers dish out updates every fortnight ish. More off the game features will be added shortly. It has it's quirk's at the current state but i have had tons of fun with it. the community at the moment is very small.

 ENTROPY - Review v.2 ""One of the central themes of Entropy's setting and background (and the reason for the name itself) is the gradual decay and decline of a once-mighty interstellar civilisation in the wake of a cataclysmic event known as The Shutdown, and the efforts of the survivors to 'rage, rage against the dying of the light' and rebuild and reclaim what's been lost."" - Bridger (Dev)(Please ignore the reviews by the people who played only 1 hour or just over. They either had no idea what an Alpha consists of or just didnt bother to ask any of the very helpful people who play regularly! I believe you have to put time into something to really find out what it is like.)Entropy is in early Alhpa stage of its game design - with three Tiers to choose from, Colonist £14.99, Explorer £29.99 or Founder £75.99 - Each with its own merits as stated before purchasing. It is an MMO (Massively Multiplayer Online) so you will encounter other people.  I was sure I wanted to have a half decent start so opted for the 2nd Tier (Explorers Pack). I had read on google that the top two tiers would allow you to carry over any stats, items and money (Credits) earned to the the full launch edition.To start - There is a 2D System view and a 3D view. You manouvre your ship in the 2D view (Imagine Mass Effect) and then enter specific Instances for 3D view.The game works by using these ""Instances"" to allow you to fly in 3rd person (3D) which gives you full control of your ship. These instances are sometimes random (Interceptions by Pirates) or you can choose to enter an instance by flying close to a marker (Asteroid belt, Space station or Jumpgate) on the 2D system screen and selecting ""Enter"" with your mouse. You will see on the 2D map you can enter space stations in certain systems which enable you to Trade (Marketplace), buy modules (Ship upgrades), increase your own stats (Piloting, trade etc). There a few other things but as this is Alpha they are not yet implemented (Friends list, Cartel/Guilds)When you start, there are a few missions - basically the games missions are not finished and as such you find yourself asking ""what do I do now?"".  The idea of a sandbox/open world game is that there is not a linear line of ""do this, then do that"".  After you complete or in some cases don't complete the early missions, you have a choice of Mining, Salvaging, Trading or Combat (Only Combat gains you XP at this stage).Mining - This is basically a case of equip/buy a mining beam, fly to the Asteroid instances and then target certain asteroids to mine there resources.Salvaging - Same principal as Mining but with ruined/broken ships/drones.Trading - This is simply ""Buy low and sell High""Combat - The instances with combat contain NPC's (Non player PvE). You can also be intercepted by other players (PvP). Currently the only way to level up your character is to enter combat. There is no fixed cap on level progression that anyone is aware of.The game is extremely basic in its present form but has lots of promise, its visuals are great, the gameplay is still being tweaked and it can be very annoying sometimes to get stuck in a bug (which are being removed or worked out) and then have to Alt-F4 which exits the game completely. Imagine Eve Online but in a dumbed down easier to understand format.I have put in a few hours so can say that the game is worth a shot if you enjoy the sandbox type game, for me it is relaxing and can be a challenge if you want it to be - especially if you choose to fly pirate.I hope to see this flourish into a decent MMO and become a classic!

Early Access Review
								So first off, yes the game is still very, very early in alpha stages. However, it is still a playable and enjoyable game and has loads of potential. This is the best space rpg game I've seen since Microsoft's Freelaner (still the best by far, even after more than 10 years). The gameplay is for the most part a good balance between a complex dynamic economy (similar to EVE) and the relative simplicity of combat and manual ship navigation (such as Galaxy on Fire 2). Be warened though, this game has a truly massive learning curve, and besides the downright pitiful intro tutorial, all they give you is a ""pilot's manual"" which is way too wordy for anyone to read. So if you do decide to dive in to this game, be sure you have more than enough pacience to do so. If you need help, the best way to get is just to ask the other players in global chat, they'll help you out.This game advertises itself as an MMO, but right now in the early stages there is nothing massively multiplayer about it. It's a good day if we get more than 10 players online (there is only one server for the US), and even then becasue of the vastness of space it is unlikely you'll stumble across anyone. The lack of a good system for players to trade goods and credits between one another is also a glaring flaw in the game's social ecosystem.While the gameplay is good for the most part once you get the hang of things, there are a couple snags worth mentioning. Navagation though space is based on a 2D map. You use this map to navigate your ship to certain instances, such as stations or asteroid fields, where you enter a 3D interface (the one shown in the screenshots) and fight other players or bots, mine asteroids, etc. This 2D map, sector based gameplay can be a little boring at times, although I've heard rumblings that the dev's are going to replace it sometime soon. Once again, this game is only for people who have the patience and time to deal with it.Now on to some good things. The graphics of the game are great when in 3D space and combat, while sparse, is involved and engaging. The complex and dynamic economy allows for trading to be very profitable, and there is also a large variety of tradable goods. For those who have been looking for a good space rpg it more than delivers. Bottom line, it's a solid game, but with much room for needed improvements. I would recomend this game to anyone who has the patience to tackle the learning curve and the at times slow gameplay. Don't be silly though, just buy the $20 colonist pack. All explorer and founder do is give you some slightly modified versoins of ships that are available to everyone in game, and a small amount of extra credits, of which you can earn twice as many trading comodities in an hour. This game isn't worth more that $20 right now.			"

Entropy Review based on 12/03/2014 patch and known upcoming FeaturesOverviewEntropy is currently in ""early Alpha"" - expect Bugs and broken things, its the nature of an Alpha.The Game is ""buy once play forever"", and therefore i can only recommend it. There are only a few games that can satisfy you for hundreds of hours for a low price like this.There are 2 Servers (EU and US) to avoid too high pings, but they do not plan more servers at the moment.The Devs are extremely active in the community, answering questions, giving hints and talking about features and ideas.It's a little Development team, but very motivated.Last two Patches have shown they know how to bugfix, and if something goes wrong with a patch, its very quickly repatched. (Took them only an hour on last patch to solve 2 major bugs)Currently implemented- mining- salvaging- trading- fighting (PvE + PvP)- Factions (3 Factions + independed + pirates)- Cartels (Guilds)- MissionsUpcoming Main Features- Faction Warfare (players in faction can fight solarsystems to be overtaken for their faction, including station attacks with heavy defenses)- Crafting (not much known yet but expect something more complex then plain crafting)- Cartel Warfare (not much known yet, expect cartels being able to build stations in red solar system, fight and defend them)The potential of EntropyEntropy will for sure never become the next ""EvE Online"" with thousands of players fighting for glory. It's more an EvE Online with direct ship control in a ""family sized environment"". If you like something similar to EvE, with direct ship control and being a name and not a number in fights, Entropy might be yours ;)The upcoming features sound very very good, and i'm sure once faction warfare is in the game (should come soon), people will have things to do for a long time beside farming cash.The direct ship controlYou pilot the ship yourself, and you have a lot methods to move in all directions. Like ""engine kill"" so you can turn while still flying in the old direction. rolling, moving to the side and all kind of things you might needPvP RulesEntropy is designed to be pretty much ""open PvP"". You are only really safe in green solar systems, which are rarely and never connected to each other.Mining and SalvagingBest Mining System i have ever seen so far. Asteroids are quickly mined, and you need to move around a lot and select new asteroids to mine. No more semi-afk mining and salvaging ;)TradingCurrently only moving NPC orders from A to B.Should change later with crafting a lotPlayer PopulationCurrent Population is very low. Developers did not advertise the game yet, so we only have players that found the game by luck somewhere. I'm sure once they start advertising it this will increase a lot.But both servers have some active cartels with majority of players in them so you can always find yourself an active cartel to get hellp and a nice start into the game			"

								Horrible!Looks great and it I love the concept and everything. Would be a great game except its so godam frustrating to control!!!Every keypress and mouse movement has a massive delay in response. Rediculously annoying to control to the point where its unplayable.  Interface is un-intuitive. Hitting escape should pause the game and bring up a basic menu. But you have to change fly mode by pressing ALT and then click on a button to bring up options. And it does not pause the game. You will be shot by enimies while adjusting setting.If they fix the control issues I'd love to get in to this game but as I was enjoying the dogfights with other ships.PS - I tried it again and set all the graphics as low as possible in case there was some rendering lag issue but still the same problem with controls.Also the game had lost my some of my charicters custimisations. Seem to remeber some but not others and it lost my game progress.This game needs a lot of work. It has potential but Im giving up on this one now (DELETED!). If anyone knows of a similar game that works properly let me know.			"

Early Access Review
								HORRIBLE HORRIBLE GAME!  So i bought this to play with my friend, both of us are getting on.  Assuming its close to or simmilar to EVE online, we bought it.  most of the time the game is on a 2d scale with a 3rd person view, horrible controlls that make you want to shoot yourself.  Poorly made insturctions that leave you wondering wtf to do after the 1st mission!  Seriously? just starting out and my mission is to buy a mining laser, 1 i buy the mining laser, equipt it, and well go look for dozens of things that i cannot mine because the game wont let me, and the mission is still active? what do i do, i have the laser and its telling me to buy another one? i cant because i dont have any money! the only mmo about this is from time to time u will see someone off in the distance from ur 2d 3rd person galaxy travel, and thats it!  Trieing to do missions with a team?  HA thats a joke!  Trieing to take on ""space pirates""?  Well theres a guarantee you will run out of ammo and wont be able to buy any or get any to save your life.  This game is horrible, i wasted my money on this assumeing t would be good.  The pictures shown have nothing to do with the game.  The controlls are extrmely chunky even after you edit them the most, your ship always seems to overspin and keep going, and the ""gui"" that guides you through missions is♥♥♥♥♥♥ since it leaves you wondering where sector XXX is in some 2d cheaply drawn solar system.  My advice, a free game is better than this, EVE cannot be compared to this, this is a major waste!			"

								It has potential.  After putting a few days into it I can safely say that I like the dynamic control of my ship. I can also say safely that I don't like flying around on a 2d map for the majority of my traveling. Lots of loading screens and clip animations make traveling time consuming and tedious. Far from a seamless space game, but that's obviously not what they are going for. I would recommend it to people who didn't play Eve.			"

								Updated: May 03 2015 Hello anyone out there?Are Developers still working on this game?There arent any more updates or news on ENTROPY while game is still listed for $19.99What is going to happen.+ Very Simple Gameplay and easy to understand UI+ Graphics are good not Great+ Outstanding communication from Developers+ Regular Updates- Still need a lot of improvement before going into BETA- Controls can be awkard but user friendly enough- NPC Traffic is very limited- 2D MAP is virtually BORING and OLD SCHOOL ( this is where you spend most of your time, 60% )- Too many INSTANCING in this GAME ( even in 2014 come on developers ) - AI need lot of rework before Going into BETA- Right now this feels like a single player game not an MMO but Developers are constanty releasing patches.I Recommend wait before making your purchase.

								Entropy has quite a few faults:Advertised as a full 3D space shooting mmo which is not entirely ture, the map is all done in 2D then swiched over to a 3D interface.Conectivity issues for many of it's players, getting past the lobby screen can be a tiresome task.The game economy is also lacking...finding items is scarce previous players left the game making items hard to come by, plenty of demand just no supply.Gameplay reminds me of a cross between, Eve and Battle Star Galactica...hence forth Entopy = Evelactica. The game does show some promise however with it's current issues the $20 price tag attached to this game should be over looked in my opinion the game should run for $10 instead.			"

								This game has a good idea, and good background to it, but as for the details, it's just not there. This game is too under developed still when it comes to character creation and story. The free roam is amazing, but the gameplay is just not there. Was not impressed with this game, or the price for that matter, I kind of want a refund... but I can't so. I don't recommend this game to people who like high action packed games, I played a game like this before, with less detail than this game, and I liked it better. Also, if you make a female character, it still has a male voice, don't know if you can change that or not, but I find that kind of stupid, a minor detail such as that one, could have been added.			"

								I played through some of the interductory missions of Entropy. The first thing to note is that this game is an alpha and its gameplay is alpha quality. This game has a very good concept that will turn into a good final game, but also a clunky interface. Combat is the particular weakspot. I wouldn't say so much that the rest of its interface is bad as much as counterintuative. I encountered few bugs and I'd suggest that the developers should give priority to the following:1.The tutorials need improvement and the instructions they give lack enough detail for the new player.2.The manual needs to be improved and expanded because it  lacks many important deails about gameplay. 3. The interface needs to be cleaned up and simplified.			"

Early Access Review
								I've not played a great deal of this game, so these are just initial impressions. To put it bluntly the game feels empty and without any structure (lack of structure may sound like a good thing in a sandbox game, but this doesn't feel like a sandbox game, more on this later). As of right now you get the sense that there is nothing you can really do in this game (largely perhaps due to the lack of population, but also due to a lack of depth).The economics and trade side of things are also boring as you can do little more than move generic products around a 2D map, or mining asteroids (boring).The combat has a lot of potential but against NPCs it is hardly satisfying, I have not seen any large scale PvP fights, in fact I haven't seen more than 2 other players in this game (Global chat is dead). Basic combat could be fun though as already mentioned, I just wonder if it is too ""arcadey"" to offer meaningful strategy. Perhaps my largest gripe with this game is the fact that it isn't a true open universe but heavily instanced as other users have pointed out. I read these reviews before purchasing but as I do play some games that employ this method I thought perhaps it wouldn't bother me as much. However in this game it really does break immersion. Fortunately a recent trailer on IGN had them saying they plan to remove the 2D element of the game and make a real sandbox game.Now I'm not sure where to give my advice/ things I would like to see added etc. So I'll just list them here.-Overall much greater player control-Real open world -Fully player run economy with crafting (should be added soon I think)-More depth to combat -Much greater depth in the Cartel system, like EVE online: with departments, clear structure and complexity. Cartel vs Cartel would be awesome.-Some Avatar combat perhaps - landing on stations and sieging stations etc-Player or Cartel controlled structures (ability to create them), stations and territories (systems); the Cartels could get the tax from these station markets and players could fight for control over them.-Better tutorial and more and better missions to help beginners and to add some structure to the experience.-Player created missions, like bounties or trade missions etc.Basically I want EVE online without all the time wasting and grinding. This game has a lot of potential and I will keenly watch how it evolves, but as of right now I do not recommend this to others unless they want to aid in development.This game COULD become something awesome.

								The first thing I noticed was the lack of customization as far as characters are concerned, which isn't that big of a deal because it's early access. The second and more Important thing I noticed was how small the text was and the apparent lack of a UI editor, so I was stuck with tiny text, which made the game really confusing. I personally don't like the combat, but that's just me. I noticed that when you do the vaccine quest if you aren't careful you'll get ruthlessly attacked by pirates who are by most standards, much better off than you. At one point I was stuck in an instance sitting still waiting to die because I was out of ammo. Overall I didn't enjoy the game and I really want my money back. I'm just glad I got the cheapest version of the game.			"

								Being that its still early access... it really needs a lot of work. I was looking for a simple space shooter game that slowly evolves you into the game, instead this lays everything out and the goal to grow seems very far, or what you're expected to grow into you have no idea where to start. I think the field map is cheasy, the space view however is pretty nice... but comparing this to EVE there's a lot of work to be done. I honestly wish I didn't spend $40 dollars on this...			"

								I love this game. It has some things to work out, but what game doesn't? The fact that it's this good in this stage of development is a testament of how enjoyable the game is. I mean this as no disrespect, but I consider Entropy as Star Citizen Jr. The only point I would dock at this point is for the weak avatar creation system and by extension the game needs better avatar integration. I want to ""get into"" my ship. My ships don't feel personal enough. That's just a slight critisism. Otherwise the game is awesome and the dev team is constantly updating and patching it.			"

								18.5 hours in to the game. at th is point, ive done several things. ive met what i believe is the entire player base (about 10 people atm), smashed in to stations and died, smashed in to gates and died, mined for 1 hour straight to make some credits, then smashed in to the gate leaving that sector and lost it all (yes, i know this calls my piloting skills in to question, but there are some control issues (read: minor learning curve)), spent some time mastering ship control, mined for 1 hour straight again, made a pile of money, bought the best mining ship in the game, bought a couple refineries to boost the income from said mining operations, upgraded my ships abilities to suit mining fast full loads, spent 30 minuts mining to fill my ship, refined the minerals i mined, flew to every sector to try and find a place that buys the refined materials, realised the economy is out of balance and nobody wants to buy said materials, flew around a bit more, realised there isnt much else to do but mine, fight or fly ""missions"" generated on stations that basically get you to fly to another station with either freight or passengers. so my thoughts at this point in time are this:DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNLESS YOU ARE DOING SO TO SUPPORT ONGOING DEVELOPMENT. at this stage of development, this game is lacks fun. it also lacks players. the game recently upgraded from 2d to 3d systems and, im told from other players that have been around a while, lost most of both its player base and features at that time. there is a lot of potential that could be realised here, and i fully understand that the developer now has to work hard to put back the systems that werent compatible with the upgrade in graphics. i believe they will come back in future, but they are not there now. the last patch was almost a year ago, so the work is slow but that may just be a tiny team working really hard (or it could be a huge team doing nothing). i love this genre, and i want to see more of it in the future, and i want this game to become something lots of people want to play, so yes please support the devs but again you must understand that is pretty much all you are doing at this time since there is not much to do but grind at this point (if you buy early access, you will keep your toon when the game releases so there is a benefit to grinding in early access too!).

								Changed this to a negative review since barely nothing is happening. They do patch now and then but I really cant wait litterally a lifetime for this game. It will be outdated before it reaches a playable state. We are now at 2-3 years later and the game is basicly unplayable due to the boredom it produces. DO NOT waste your money on an unplayable MMO which has on average 0.01 players online over both the EU and NA servers.This update was done 2016-01-09.			"

In additon it feels much less intimidating compared to other products on the market and hopefully with lots of feedback and polish it'll be perfect for new players entering this genre.Definatly would recommend it, really looking forward to seeing it grow!

								Still in early access, so not a hugely diverse game at the moment; however, the developers are commited and active in updating the player base on the games progress. At the moment the biggest let down is the 2D map travel system, which makes the game feel much like a spreadsheet strategy game like EVE. They are working on switching the game over to a 3D travel system, once this happens I think the game will be way more immersive and enjoyable.			"

Though I never suspected that ENTROPY to fall into the same calibur as other more advanced space sims, I do look for a certain amount of challenge along with an ease of immersion.  Now, I am glad to say that the devs for Entropy has brought ther game to a higher level, removing the 2D environment, making this RPG much more enjoyable.  Though the game still has a long way to go, the changes made recently, brings my personal review up to be adjusted.So many space sims have been coming out, and most of them are demanding high CPUs and high GPUs to run them. Entropy does not.  If ytou ae looking for a good game, check out Entropoy.			"

												Given everything, I feel the game can become something good. The issue is that the developers do not have lots of money to put into advertizing. It also needs You Tubers to feature that game on their channels.  This is a game were the players can shape the future of the game. It will develop as the player base grows. It is an $8 game for a reason. Bring your friends to play this game.The game has a gritty survival feel that accompanies the back story. It is not a supper high tech universe. Humanity had become dependent on AI technology for their existence. When all the AI technology suddenly shuts down, all humanity crumbled and worlds lost contact with each other to falls. Humanity is rediscovering what the AI had set up for them and how to do things for themselves. They are living off salvaged and rediscovered Tech. The 1980's representation of you ship in comparison to the rest of the universe is to add to the feeling of rediscovering old technology. The space stations and ship have an industrial feel and look to them. Trust and communication between human worlds are being rebuilt through trade relationships.  "

								purchased this game because I enjoy Space Sims, and Sci-fi game in general. I also happen to play EVE Online and thought this looked interesting. Well its awful ( yes I know it's still in Alpha ) everything from the UI, Controls, Menu Flow, HUD, etc are god awful. the graphcis seem alright but at this point EVE Online takes the cake and then some. Maybe if the Developers actually work on this game then it could possibly get better but as of now its a 2 out of 10 and a game that will never be heard of in a couple of months which is sad to say. Star Citizen + EVE Online will terminate this game. Nice try better luck next time.			"

								The graphics make my computer slow to fix this i lowered the graphics in options screen. I like the battles and space expoloration. for twenty bucks this game is worth it. Also with how fast the game will update ( according to the developers ) this alpha game so far seems worth it. Check this game for updates from time to time if your waiting till a certain point in the development of this game to buy it. This game reminds me of Colony Wars in many ways that is why i bought it. Check out YOUTUBE for the gameplay videos for more of an idea of what this game has to offer. You can buy sell and fight for your own gain in this game as you make your own legend. I encourage the gamer community to make YOUTUBE videos with permission of the Developers of this game of course to promote this game and to inform people about it. Sorry for scatterbrained review. been awake for 20 hours straight bye			"

								I have only just started to play this game and given that it is an 'early release' I can handle the bugs no problem. It is a great concept for a space game :)Apart from high level pirates beibng able to come into a mining/salvaging zone and blow the hell out of low level miners, now that sucks!A handy thing would be an information list, that was stored in a journal or log, which would be automaticallt updated when you vistited a station, this would enable a faster way to set up your trade routes.But as I said, a great concept for a space game, an early release, looking forward to progressive improvements.Cheers			"

								Pretty buggy and needs a ton of work. The tutorial is boring and the game controls beyond movement are not intuitive. There is First Person Mode but it is buggy and you can look through rocks. No cockpit view unfortunately so emersion is lost. As a miner you will need to ask how to mine since it will not make sense that you cannot mine any asteroid you find. The mine hotkey returns no error just seems unfunctional. You have to seek out asteroid belts and even then only some of the asteroids are minable. I entered my first asteroid belt and none of the rocks were selctable and I was told it was ""mined out"". Give this game a year and even then, hope there is a demo before spending. Nothing original that I can see here.			"

								one of the worst space sims i played, the controls suck so bad, and i know its a beta or early access whatever but when fisrt started the controls were set to NONE, meaning nothing i pressed or clicked worked, had to minimise the game to get mouse to open options to set controls to default then worked.but after all that, the gameplay is so crap, i am a big fan of the X games if anyone knows them, and the controls on that are great, on this, its more on the mouse, you cant or shouldnt be controlling a spaceship with a mouse, and the wasp keys make it go in funny ways i know its side thrust but thats not how a ship suppose to fly. the creators need to do whats done in X games more on the controls side, then might be playeble... also when a message incoming why does my ship freeze and stop. and all enemies are free to attack but i cant move while reading the message, stupid.i have played alot of space sims games and for me the X2 reunion, for example, is awesome, if only they made it online. then i would pay even 100 pounds to play it. but this, i just spent 15 pounds and i wont ever play this again, maybe once more once full final version comes out, but i think they should have a free trial.but if they had free trial they would have lost me as a player and as a customer right from the start, and now they have my 15 pounds, well played Entropy,,, well played....

								The game could be great; the setting is nice, the concept is great and there's potential for a good degree of complexity, but right now it's a mess just getting started - even with the guide. At twenty bucks I'd have hoped for something a bit more mature. Heck, just scrolling down the control settings is a tedious task because the inetrface is broken. Many shortfalls on the most basic things with good intentions on the gameplay down the line. Not ready for market, maybe not even early release. Especially not at twenty bucks.			"

								Now. I know that a lot of these reviews are negative, and as the game is in it current state, it should be. But the developers themselves have already statet this in the game-description, that the game is at lack of content now. The game did also seem to have been abondoned, but, despair not. They are back! After listening to the community, they are back with quite a massive update. If you deny buying this game because people say the game is dead, you they are wrong. It is still quite a buggy game, but the developers have huge support from their fans, and it is developing the right way. Of course there are a lot of bugs, and with a lot, i mean like tons of them. But the idea is very nice, and the team has been working quite hard. Also, this is still early access. It is ment to be broken. Would just let you know :p			"

								This is not a normal mmo. this game is not friendly towards new players. and im not talking about the community. im talking about the interface and game itself. if you don't already know what you're doing you will not beable to get past the first mission which is the worse tutorial mission i have ever seen yet. past that the first major mission involves purchasing an item that if you dont know you need ahead of time will leave you stuck since the shop items are very expensive and there's no known efficient means of earning credits.

Early Access Review
								What I took from this game: Take a game like Uncharted Waters Online and put it into space - which while I was playing UWO, I kept saying there should be a space version of this - though the game is fairly dog-fight based, you don't have to do combat to level up and get better ships and gear. You could be a miner and crafter, or a merchant or, of course, a ruthless pirate - even just a bounty hunter - the options are pretty open. The map itself is gigantic which makes for some long travel times, but nothing that is too nasty.Great graphics. The gameplay is good, but could be better - probably be prime with a Steam controller. Sound is fantastic, but the soundtrack needs a little work. Overall, totally worth the price - especially if you consider it's ""early access"" - there is a considerable amount of content to keep you busy while they finish it.			"

								This review WILL change as time passes, This is more of an early impression.It's a really pretty game, but there's not much going on right now. Youre very basic space sim stuff; Exploring, Mining, shooting other dudes, or salvaging... I wouldnt say it's worth the 20$(or more) right now, unless you are a hard-core space sim'er; ive got under 10 hours in and i'm already getting bored.I feel like a paid for a really pretty chat room, Which most of the time ends up being the same 3-4 guys talking among themselves. It's got alot of promise and i think it's going to be an amazing mmo if they keep it up, i'll check back with it in a month.			"

								First Impressions 08/02/14:The game is what it is atm, an alpha version with minimal features and extremely low population (EU: ~10 peeps in chat, have only encountered 2 players in 50 hours of play).But it has great potential to become a very good game. With biweekly updates and the addition of new upcoming content i can't wait to see what it becomes. It needs serious balancing and new features, such as UI and ease-of-access.Basic sim gameplay is like freelancer, economy/trading/mining is EvE. The 2D map is a let-down and a time sink but it grows on you and has lots of potential for tactical gameplay and strategy. For the time being the 2D map is a bare bones nothing.Main reason to get this is that it being a sandbox it will become greater as a whole with more people playing it while it receives content and updates at the same time.  Even in its current state if it was populated it would be a much better experience than it is now.The review will change as the game develops but for now I recommend you give it a try and back its development due to its raw potential			"

								I like it a lot . For an early access game i would say it's pretty stable and it offers enough to do to keep a person busy although it does have a few minor bugs such as some quests not working as intended . I'm still happy with my purchase and i'm looking forward to seeing this game grow into something really good.			"

								Honestly i understand it is in alpha testing, and it is a great concept with beautiful graphics, Holy hell, why is it so hard just to pass through a tutorial level, i cannot even get near a drone in the very first mission without fifty of them killing me in two seconds, and my character is supposed to be combat savvy.  Explain to me how you can enjoy a game if the tutorial is impossible, id love to hear it, otherwise i feel like i wasted 20 bucks.			"

								Good game. Needs some time to develop and patience from players. It gets better every update. Not many players in EU server atm but i think when crafting is implemented population rises. I am very excited about the future  of this game.  ps. if you are new player there is good player made guides in steam site.			"

								Worst Early Access EVER! Development speed is non-existant, GM doesn't listen to those that actually play the game. Since the game came out two years ago, there has been no major changes, and infact there has been negative changes, such as space being reduced in size, cargo holds/bays have been reduced, previously owned ships have gone missing, the list goes on! Oh, one more mention, the time I spent in this game were spent with friends that were also checking it out and NOTHING to do with Entropy actually holding my attention.			"

								I played for a while. Horrible game, with devs who do not update their game. If you're dumb enough to spend money on this and not read their description, you'll realize that they, too, understand that this trash is a failure. This is a great lesson showing that people should never release unplayable games, even in early access stages. Shame.			"

												Development is not going anywheres, I can no longer recommend this gameOld Review:This game for early access seems to be quiet promising, the community is supportive from what I have had a chance to experience, developers seem to be on their feet and moving forward with the game.If you do buy this game, keep in mind it is still early access, watch and experience the direction this game is going... in my opinion it will be a great game once more features and fixes are applied.If you want a solid game right out of the get go I recommend waiting for this game to be full release or at least till this game is near the end of it's development.
