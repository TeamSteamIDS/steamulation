												Great to see the game on Steam!I am a long term player, so thought I would write up a review to include some of the things a new player will not notice instantly.So the basics:You will start off like most games, learning a few basic attacks and talents. Completing quests and killing creeps to level up your character. When you level up you will receive level up points (to place in melee, range stat etc) and I think after level 4 you will start to receive Talent points. This is when you can browse the talent trees and start to plan a path for your character.You are not limited to any of the class talent trees, which is something I really love. Theory crafting your builds and trying new things that no on else has thought of before can be very rewarding and fun, even when you get it completely wrong! For new players, you are granted a free full respec, so do not worry if you go wrong on your first attempt.I am currently messing around with builds to try in the pvp battlegrounds, and have made a tanky ranger which I am having lots of fun playing at the moment... pewpew! :POnce you level up and make a few friends you can start to tackle group dungeons, these dungeons reward relics which will allow you to buy the best armour sets available (at the dungeon level). If you prefer solo play, they have been adding ""Story Mode"" dungeons too. Here you can gain relics for those same armour sets, but story mode has slightly less loot than group dungeon(weapons etc).When you hit end game, you can group up and tackle the ""Ascended"" dungeons. These are buffed versions of the regular dungeons, much more difficult but much more rewarding! dropping better loot, and relics for the ""Fabled Sets"". When you are happy with your character and gear you can then start checking out pvp battlegrounds, world bosses, trolls that spawn randomly across the world.I do not really care for vanity, pets, mounts etc. but if you are a player who enjoys those things there are loads to collect! some are also only available when completing certain achievements. There are also tons of achievements too, if you enjoy those.If you want to grind Gold, you can do that. If you want to hardcore level up you can do that too. If you want to bum around and chat with your friends you can do that. I have had loads of fun grouping up with people I met in the game, to run dungeons, pvp or just mess around, but I am at heart a player who prefers solo play... and I have enjoyed going off on my own adventures too.I think there are currently 16 professions you can work on, example: Prospecting, Farming, Cooking, Alchemy etc. My advice for these... is stay away from Fishing! damn that is boring, unless you like fishing (of course).There are loads of quest to complete, and many players will find this the easiest way to level up early on. Once you get a grasp of the game, you can then decide what path is most fun for you. Hope this was useful! Enjoy the game :)			"

												A game that knows where to put its priorities. Not in Graphics, but instead in gameplay. Fighting is fun, crafting is fun, the world is nice and full, and the story isn't bad at all.			"

												Alright, so after 14 hours of very enjoyable play, I've decided it's time to write a review.This is going to be a fairly lengthy, very technical and detailed look at the game, from the perspective of an ex-Runescape player. If you played Runescape in the past, and are interested in nitty gritty mechanical details, then this review will be for you. I'm going to be comparing pretty much everything to how Runescape did things.TL;DR: Hands down recommended 100% to any ex-Runescape members. This game is overall absolutely fantastic, and I've just been filled with so much excitement and joy and nostalgia, on top of the fact that this game is better than Runescape in a lot of ways.Rather than Runescape where you have all of your skills mixed up on one tab, here your skills are sorted between two tabs: Gathering and Crafting.For Gathering, you have: Fishing, Skinning, Farming, Foraging, Forestry, Prospecting, and Crystal Cutting.For Crafting, you have: Cooking, Leatherworking, Tailoring, Alchemy, Weaponsmithing, Armorsmithing, and Jewelry.There is indeed a Skinning skill. Rather than RS where you kill a cow and it drops hide and a perfect little red and white steak, now you actually need a knife and can skin your animals, which will give you those, and skin as well. Very enjoyable difference.Smithing has been split up into Armorsmithing and Weaponsmithing. This makes sense and from a gameplay/economy perspective, promotes people to specialize in one or the other. I enjoy the change.Forestry is Woodcutting. Prospecting is Mining which includes smelting, rather than RS where smelting was considered part of Smithing. Foraging is what it sounds like, all different kinds of gathering, from apples to various plants which are used in alchemy. In RS, Herbalism was a combination of gathering herbs and alchemy.There is no general ""Crafting"" skill. It's all been split apart into different things, like Leatherworking and Tailoring and Jewelry and Crystal Cutting. It should be mentioned that getting crystals, or gems, is part of Prospecting.There's quite a few skills missing, although missing isn't really an accurate word. Construction and player housing is really the only skill missed. Strength, Attack, Defense, Ranged, and Magic aren't part of the skills set. You can make fires, though I'm not sure which skill it's a part of, or if it's just a thing on its own. Fires can be used to cook and provide a small ""rested xp"" area like a tavern.Prayer, Constitution, Dungeoneering, and obviously Runecrafting are also not included.Alright, so now I'm going to focus on mining a little.First of all, the animation is different and how you get ore is different. In RS, when you mine a node, you play through a lengthy animation, and at any time during this animation you can get a piece of ore. If you get ore, the animation is interrupted. If you don't, it just loops again. The animation was that you'd first take 3 little picks at the rock with the point of your axe, then take a couple short swings, then a really long hefty swing.With this game, you always take two short swings, and you always get ore after the two swings. Sometimes it's 1, in my experience it's almost always 2, sometimes you get 3, rarely you get 4. I'm not sure if this is influenced by level, it doesn't seem like it. I don't know if you can get more than 4.This is an extremely enjoyable difference. It's more realistic, a LOT faster, and from an animation standpoint is just purely better.On to crafting. Crafting overall, I really prefer how RS did it. RS was simpler. There are so many arbitrary ingredients thrown in to recipes, it's really annoying. For example, cooking. In order to make cooked meat, you have to have salt (which is bought) and basil (which is farmed). Why do I absolutely need these things in order to roast a slab of meat? Why can't I just make some unsalted, unseasoned meat? This is super frustrating coming from RS where you just toss the meat on a fire and call it good. In my opinion, you should have the option of adding salt. If you don't use salt, it should make regular ""cooked meat"". If you add salt, it should make ""salted cooked meat"" which would have better effects.Anyway, moving on to smelting. This is annoying too. In order to smelt copper ore, you need flux, and you need coal. Again, this is extremely annoying where in RS you just tossed the copper in. It makes sense to need flux, and it arguably makes sense to need coal to keep the furnace going, but needing a hunk of coal for every copper bar is just... frustrating.Random note, while it's nice that ore and different things STACK in general, it is annoying that they stack to different amounts. Copper bars stack to 5, copper ore stacks to 10, coal stacks to 25, flux stacks to 50... etc. So when mining you need to figure things out like you need 5 stacks of copper ore for every stack of coal. (because the recipe for smelting copper ore needs 1 coal, 2 copper ore, 1 flux.)Also, when mining you have a rare chance to get ""pure copper ore"". This is all well and good, but how this ore is used is a bit strange. The purpose of smelting regular copper is to get rid of impurities, and make it just copper, i.e. pure. So it makes no sense whatsoever for this ""pure copper ore"" to be used directly in crafting a superior piece of armor. The only difference between pure copper ore and a copper bar is that one is in the shape of a bar. They both get melted down and reshaped into the item anyway.From a gameplay perspective I get it, you have a rare chance to get something that'll allow you to make something better. That's fine. But from a realism standpoint, it makes no sense. I think that instead you should have a chance to make a ""pure copper bar"", which you managed to get more pure than normal.A quick note about farming. It's pretty fun. I haven't done much of it, and I never really did it in Runescape, but I can tell you it's a lot faster and a lot more engaging. Rake the plot, plant the seeds, add water, and it starts growing. Growing takes about 30 seconds. While growing it can start to develop some kind of disease so you need to prune to stop the spread. The more disease, the less yield you'll get from harvest. I like this system a lot.I'm just going to start bullet pointing things because I'm running out of space.The game isn't tile-based, you move exactly where you click, and can move using WASD and control the camera with RMB. It's pretty nice. You can also move by clicking on the minimap.The pathing distance is extremely small. So you can't path around buildings or fences, it's really annoying. If you click on the ground off in the distance, it only registers out a very small way. The same applies to actions. If you right click to open a door or attack an enemy, your guy will run up to that distance, then stop and say he's out of range.You can't set waypoints.It has WoW's hippogryph-style travel system, except with dragons.There are mounts.You have a homestone, again like WoW's hearthstone.You can't fly (mounts) or jump.---Overall, it does have its problems, but it just feels like a better, more modern Runescape.Give it a shot! You won't regret it.			"

												This is a indie MMORPG that has been around 8 years in the making. It has launched in November 2013. For a small team of artists, programmers and developers, they have done an amazing job with the game.What I like about Eldevin:You start off as your character - and Eldevin has a classless system, so you can choose/switch what class you'd like to be - from Warrior, Templar, Assassian, Ranger, Mage, Prophet or even a mixture. You gain talent points every time you level, and you can use those talent points in the tree of the class you wish to use. You also obtain points to increase your health, melee, mage, range etc.The storyline is interesting, and some quests allow you to interact and some allow you to choose the outcome. There are also a few puzzles which is another bonus for me.As long as you don't mind the graphics which kind of has a charming feel to the game itself.  There is alot of content to do, from training skills, to questing, to doing dungs with a team or by yourself (story mode). You can also explore the world of Eldevin, complete achievements, and obtain pets/mounts/vanity.While exploring Eldevin, you can also use forms of ""fast travel"" from using a dragon handler to travel to a place but requires money, to using a homestone which allows you to teleport to the one city that it's attuned to - with a few hours limit - and to buy portals to summon a friend to where you are - to instant dragon which immediatly teleports you to a place of your choice (but requires eldevin points). And yes, Eldevin is that BIG.This game is completley F2P. There are suscriptions available if you wish to recieve bonuses like earning more money/exp from quests/monsters that you kill.Eldevin also has a shop where you can purchase things with Eldevin Points - purchased with real life money or even in-game if you swap gold for EP with other players.You can buy mostly vanity/pets or you can also buy storage like sacks which helps carry your gathered/crafted resources. Fear not, if you can't buy sacks, there is a baby version known as baskets - which you can buy with in-game money - the only difference that it'll hold less. Same goes with backpacks (which gives you more inventory space).There are other things you can buy like skill boosters (gives more exp in gathering/crafting skills).Combat:You can use auto-attack feature to attack NPC's quickly, with the two basic abilities - melee and range.There is also abilities that you can use, either purchased from a NPC shop for in-game money, or unlocked from the Talent Tree.Since it's classless, you are not restricted to one class, and can use abilities from other classes - like healing yourself.Using abilities however uses MANA, so fortunatley there are ways to restore mana through potions/food or letting it restore itself.PVM:PVM can be found in dungs, ascended dungs (hardmode version) and world bosses as well as quest bosses. PVP:There is an area where you can fight other players, gather useful loot, and even fight a world boss when it spawns. So be sure to look out for Trapper's Atoll aka the Wilderness. :)There are also PVP modes you can do as well.Other Modes:There are other modes then just dungs.You can fight in the Eldevin Arena - facing against monsters in a team (not sure if its also solo), and fight in the Trail of Champions. Skills:There are 14 skills in total, which 7 is gathering, and the rest is crafting.Gathering:You can gather items in many places/areas in Eldevin. Different resources spawn in different areas. Crafting:The crafting system is a bit more in-depth, where you don't just need raw resources to make... mage gear as an example. You convert the raw resource and wool into cloth, then you use cloth/thread to make that gear.However, some gears are basic. There are gears which require more resources in order to make it. You can either buy those resources, or obtain them yourselves from doing Dailys and dungs.Another example would be cooking. You don't just need fish, but also items gained from Farming/Foraging. Each type of food has a benefit for a certain class. It can also heal you/restore Mana - but can't use during combat. That's for potions made from the skill Alchemy.What I don't like:Typically you can level up by doing quests, but you can also grind on mobs to gain experience to level up - and sometimes that is only way you can level up and continue doing quests which requires certain levels to complete.Some quests can be boring, like kill that/obtain this for me, and bring it back. Those are usually side quests though.There is no Guilds or Auction Houses yet but it's in the plans of the Hunted Cow Studio team, and thus the wait still continues :). However the postives outwiegh the negatives for me, because the team is willing to listen to feedback - and theres alot of content to enjoy in the game.>I would totally recommend this game to you, if you're looking for a new MMORPG to play.

												TLDR;  Indie mmo game with good mechanics of gameplay, just try it yourself - it is around 70mb client Imagine the crafting and gathering system from the old classic Runescape, mixed with the World of Warcraft gameplay.We've got balanced formula of crafting activities and progressing the main storyline, which isn't that obvious. Game isn't making me more tired after few hours of play.While playing we aren't bound to any typical mmorpg class scheme. We've got 6 different talent class tables - we can spend the talent points ( earned upon lvling) any way we want to. Worth noting is that we can't make superhero skilled in every possible way either. We got to decide wether we want to deal with magics/meele/ranged and use them as our main force.Now onto the community, currently we're all waiting for the update adding guilds feature - but people start making small communities anyway. Character creater once is accessible on every currently online server (we've got separate ones for US, EU, Asia.. ). Everyone is friendly and helpful, game developers are very often updating the game in the evening (eu time) and playing the game itself also. As a quality of the game I will add little story, that happened to me :""Some ranger was selling pretty nice 19lvl rare drop 2handed sword in world chat. The sword's value was 10gold coins - that's pretty much for a early players like me.Seller understood I can not afford the sword yet and offered me this sword for a skinning activity - which took me about 10minutes to gather desired skins.""Forgot to mention - the game is developed by indie studio, they're doing great work there. I can recommend it not only for anyone who misses the old runescape times but anyone else interested in playing a well developed game.			"

												Lovely RPG MMO, you've got 14 skills to train (divided to gathering and crafting, 7 skills for both), up to lvl 47 each(at this moment).Training a skill, such as Leatherworking, requires you to get animal hides and skins, then make leather. With leather, you can make Medium Armors.Plenty of dungeons to do, skills to train, money to farm, item sets to collect etc.Liked/always wanted to try out Runescape? Then this game is totally worth of trying out!Really enjoyable with a group of friends, especially if you have Melee/Tank, Ranged/DPS and Healer teammates for Dungeon runs. Or PvP (CTF or TDM)Definitely ""Thumbs Up"" from me, even though there's Pay to Win elements.Pros Events! Party hats! HATS! You wont run out of things to do too quickly Multiple ""currencies"", smilar to Guild Wars 2 14 Skills to train World feels really big. There's 5 ""areas"", if I remember right You can pick up manure (its true) Mounts and fast travelling (riding dragons, whoo!), so you dont have to go everywhere by foot! You can get XP for your ""overall"" level without actually fighting. Just train skills, you'll get some extra XP (you wont get much, but hey, better than nothing) Wont take much space on your hard drive. Barely anything, to be honest Doesnt need good PC to run - Has some FPS issues though. See below  I almost got killed by small beetle, that was ""only"" 4 levels higher than me (is this good or bad thing? Bosses are actually hard to solo (I am looking at you, Guild Wars 2) - assuming that you are equal/lower lvl than they areNeutral Its Runescape-like ""Pay to win"" ? I am not totally sure about this, but yep, you can buy many useful thing from the store with real money, such as (massive) extra inventory bags, various boost potions, etc. Spend few bucks, and you dont have to farm for money that much. I guess this is the price of the Free to Play game. They must get that money from somewhere, right? However everything (expect ""Premium"") can be obtained, as long as you have enough of Gold to trade for Eldevin Points (Premium currency) Daily quests - Both really nice and bad idea. You get Artisan Points (these are used to buy all kind of useful things) plus little cash and XP, when you complete those. The only problem is, that they're really boring and lame. Make/Get X amount of Y things. You can just run around the city, claiming your rewards from all daily tasks(once in a day, of course), if you've got those resources in your inventory No Auction House - you must sell everything to stores or trade with players. However, they'll add this later though! No Guilds - You'll have a hard time organizing huge player groups, since there's a player limit in Groups. However, like Auction House, they'll add this later as well I found 'tutorials' a little bit weird (skilling) Music - I love it, but it gets repetive, since there's not that many different tracksCons Bots? I'd say that there's plenty of Bots in the starting place's Mine. That place is always crowded, no matter what time it is. Or prehaps everyone are just so excited about Armor/Weaponsmithing? Training enough of both (lets say, lvl 11 both of them?) takes a while, though Sometimes you have to wait pretty long to do Dungeon runs. Waiting over 1h isnt fun. I cant say if this is problem only on EU server, or on other servers as well? You do NOT want to do one quest at the time. Running back and forth - you'll just spend most of your time going from place A to B then. Try to do all quest in that area at once You can buy in-game money(note; only the ""main currency""), with real world money! - This is really stupid in my opinion, kids with their parent's credit cards/ people with extra dosh can get ridiculous amounts of in-game money, without actually doing anything. Expect ""wasting"" their money Uh, graphics...? I am fine with them, but the character models, for example, looks pretty edgy-ish Barely any graphical settings. Only Resolution, Fullscreen on/off, capped FPS on/off, View Distance, Texture Filter, Anisotropy and Rendering, and ""Enable Low Texture Resolution"" thingy World is pretty empty. Too much emptiness, without real purpose Random FPS drops - In City, you'll encounter FPS spikes. Mine swings between 4 and 50 FPS, which is really weird, since I can run at least Skyrim with maxed settings (and some graphics mods). This cant be so heavy game.... How to see FPS(without using any third party programs)? Just type /fps in chat  Clunky camera (controls) - Do NOT use WASD(movement keys) AND turn the camera at the same time. Camera randomly resets, ending you to suddenly change your direction. Hopefully they will fix this soon Most of the items (equipment) that you can buy from NPCs, are really expensive. I see no reason buying any weapons/armors from NPCs. Just make your own, do some Dungeon runs or trade with players During character creation, you have only few things you can change, such as face or body colour. Also, the characters are pretty ugly. But remember, this is only my opinion!I'll give it 4,20 Smuggled Strawberries out of 5.Extra; There was a nude gathering in the city. It was weird. They invited me in. Now I have weird friends.			"

												Games pretty silly in the end, only way to actually level crafting (without spending 500hrs per gather and 2000hrs per craft) is in the pvp zone, where you will just get bombarded all day with server jumpers from the US server no matter what server you play on. I actually subscribed for 1 month and also bought the cheap package on steam. Still never had enough space in bags after spending over 2500gold (gold limit is 1100gold if you dont pay monthly) on bag upgrades and 2000 eldevin points on sacks and bag upgrades as well as the steam backpack from paid package. Dont even think about playing warrior class if you want to do any pvp or even gather resources as said before the areas are constantly bombarded by server jumpers who have played for a year with max gear and only come on to kill lower level players.

												This game is good, but by no means excellent.I've been playing since release and was a beta tester for a little bit (but some have been testing a lot longer than i).What this game really is a disguised pay to play game.If you look at the subscription you'll understand why.You have to unlock certain components for a character, and if you do not want to have all of those things right away, it will take some time to be able to access (if you're slowly gathering ep [in game currency bought with cash]) or being a hardcore trader able to make the sales.the limitation for a f2p player is a bit harsh, but if you can find a way to unlock the the character limitations then it's no problem. It's how you will do it will be either a pain or not.The leveling can get a bit slow at times, especially when you run out of quests (which you will at some points) and have to grind mobs or run dungeons according to your level.non combat skills are great. the game dialogue and story are very, well written.Certain aspects about combat need to be addressed, but it's ultimately how smart you are with every thing that dictates how well you do in a team fight (but 1v1 some classes will just eat you if you're not with out help)The lack of environment expansion (in regards to size and the camera angle) make the maps a little squishes and the mob spawn rate can seem a bit over whelming at times, but it's nothing you can handle.The big thing i like about eldevin is that it adds a bit of suspense when leveling solo. You almost always need to be on your toes (at least for less armored people) and have pots available, or a side kick.This game is very deserving of the 2013 best f2p mmo awar that it was given.If you play this game hardcore, you will get bored and frustrated.This is not world of warcraft, and is even less of a design clone from it too.But, it's fun.8.5/10Big ups and good luck.

Posted: January 23, 2015
												Here is my Eldevin Review.I can not recommend this game to anyone.It is not even close to being finished, a lot of content that makes a mmo is not present.The player base is extremely low, and mostly kids / students.  I mean players who are either still in grade school, high school or a few in college playing the game and doing homework at the same time. I tell this so that you know how the community is for the game.  In all the time I have been here and played on all 3 servers I only talked with one other player who is my age, over 30. Even if the game were populated by people my own age entirely I could in all fairness not recommend it. The current player base is toxic and because of the lack of content at max level / end game it appears that only bullies and thugs stay at max level 45 which I will cover in detail later on.  At best it is mmo lite, if you have never played a mmo in your life you might start here and learn the ropes.PVP – Most new players coming here ask about PVP.  PVP is dead, it is broken and virtually non existent in this game.  There is one small open PVP map in the game called Trappers Atoll, TA.  Here players can enter starting at level 15.  They have not tiered the map at all.  Max level 45 players freely roam this tiny map freely killing players who are 30 levels lower then they are.  It is pretty much the only thing a level 45 can do besides run the final dungeon again for fun at end game.  There are standard 4 on 4 PVP matches that last 10 minutes assuming you can find 8 people to join.  Again the matches are not tiered and you have a 15 and a 45 level in the same match.  Nothing about it I would call PVP.  Again, this is both true in the PVP map and the PVP matches.  Both of them are not tiered.  It is not just the bullying but having someone who played the game over a year with the best gear and best weapons and best gems in the same area as someone who played the game for 4 hours, come on really????????Graphics – The game is a browser game.  It is closest to Runescape with a tad better graphics. If you want eye candy for your new super charged machine look elsewhere.  I personally do not care about graphics, my first PC game was civ 1 by Sid Meirs in grade school to give you an example here.  I know that other people now a days do care.Sound – Again same as graphics.  Characters – The game states to be classless.  I have found that it is really worse then having a fixed class.  All of your talents and spells and stats are based off of the primary weapon you will use throughout the game.  If you pick up a bow and start to use a bow you will only pick talents and spells that uses a bow.  If you want to say play a ranger and use bows and swords you will be out of luck. Then there is the 2-hand weapon guy, the 2 1-hand weapon guy, the 1-hand sword and shield guy and finally your mage.There is not really much variety here, level 45 player builds all look the same with no variety.Crafting / Professions there are 14 and you can learn any of them and max them out at level 45.Please note that currently there is no mailbox or auction house and the populaton on servers drops down to as low as 30 during slow periods of the night.  So if you are thinking of crafting or gathering to raise gold it it pretty much pointless at this time.Quests – The standard go fetch x items, go talk to this npc here, run around the map back and forth.  Again nothing new here.  I got really tired of the run from this city to the other city, talk to a NPC then run back.  Only to find that as soon as you complete that quest the same NPC has you run to the same city you just came from to talk to another NPC 2 feet away.Pay to Win – Not really.  The only bad downside is the fact that there are things here to buy with real cash that are not available for a free to play player.  The worse example is the backpack.  A free to play player can buy and upgrade bags costing thousands of gold pieces for a normal bag each.  A backpack, which holds about twice or three times the best bag a free to play player still costs over $15 in real money to buy.  Also note that you can have multiple bags in both your inventory and in the bank.  There is also no way to extract / upgrade gems except for using real money.  So keep in mind if you put a gem in a slot it will cost real money if you want to use it later on or upgrade it to the next level. There is a cap on gold for free to play players and with a subscription it is removed.  Also a subscriber earns 2x as many relics when running a dungeon so they get the best gear twice as fast.Finally a subscriber will earn an extra 25% more gold from loot drops and when they sell items to a vendor.Loyalty program – What a joke.  You earn 5 tokens a day when you log in.  Then you can turn these points in for free stuff.  Let me give you an example of what they want to reward you with.  For 10 loyalty tokens you can buy a little bit of copper.  Copper is the first metal you can mine in the game, it is found all over the entire map and the amount you get for free you can mine in less then 1 minute on the map.  If the intention is to keep players coming back to play they failed miserably here. Dungeons – You get a new dungeon every 5 levels except for level 30.  The best gear and loot drops from them.  They have opened a can of worms here as well.  There are 2 ways to run a dungeon.  If you have a full party of 5 you can run the dungeon in dungeon mode like a standard mmo dungeon.  However, they also have a story mode where as little as 1 player can enter and do the same dungeon with the monsters being 1/5 health and fewer of them and the loot drop greatly reduced. So now it is almost impossible to get a full dungeon party together because at any time a single player can just run through the dungeon and not have to wait.  You also have a few problems with groups of 5 players speed running the dungeons in story mode to just farm the bosses for relics getting the best gear that way.  There is also a loot system where players can pass, greed or need items that drop.  This creates all sorts of head aches as some players will need on everything and have a better chance to win the loot rolls and they get kicked out quick.Another problem with story mode is players never learn how to play and run dungeons with other players.  At end game and the hardest dungeons, where team work is key to victory, these players have no clue how to work together.Mounts – Yes they have horses and other things to ride here.  As soon as you have 6 gold you can buy the first level ride skill for 5 gold and a flying disc for 1 gold.  There is no mail system or auction house in game.  It may or may not be coming sometime in the future.  This means the only way to trade items is to spam world chat and hope that the one player who may buy/sell you something is on at the same time you are.  It makes crafting and gathering to make gold rather pointless since chances are pretty good no one on will be buying that one thing.This is kind of hard to do when the player base drops to as low as 30 players actually online during the slow periods of the night. The highest I have seen on at one time during my time here is 800 on a weekend during the christmas break when all of the students were out of school.  I understand that the staff is tiny they have more games to support then developers currently.  It is easy to check how many players are on.  Just type /who in chat line and it gives you the number. I tired to cover everything you might want to learn about the game before playing it yourself.At this time of writing I put in just over 400 game hours, my character was max level, all of my quests were done and I have run all dungeons at least once.  Now I choose to leave instead of going to TA and killing brand new players so hopefully some of them will stay past level 15 and play the game.			"

												I do not recommend this game because it has deteriorated into vanity updates for money. Mainly with half baked releases of content, such as a barely there guild system. Their development cycle for any content is massive and hunted cow studios interaction with the community is very limited. A lot of the player base left for numerous reasons and when they first released on steam their population increased due to curious people. This did not last and they rapidly lost the new people who checked the game out.  Getting dungeons on the small player base is very hard.  On average you are talking 100 odd players over 3 servers and they are mainly the hardcore holdouts that are left hoping. They use a lot of asset reskins to put out vanity. This game if you were to play, get to know the small pop and hope to find someone willing to let you tag along on dungeons. They have also some solo dungeons, but mysteriously have stopped them after a certain point even though the population is not there.  For instance on other mmorpg games from what I have played, you have varied options to dungeon and find gear with smaller groups and decent gear. Here they limit your gem finding abilities and gear and almost make you feel ashamed you were forced to go solo. Then after a while you don't have the solo dungeon option as stated. Five man dungeons are the model really and at a certain point, you will need to try to get into them. The queue system is a no go, you can queue there for days, they will never fill. You need to find a group through people you know or chat hopefully.The game could do with more listening to the community and a big injection of development staff and more content options. If you look at the servers, us or eu, These are the ones to go too with a hand full usually online. The third server is empty virtually and just used for farming items.  Pvp island you can gather on. The pvp zone is pretty light on players, but will have a few who like to troll the gathers and kill them as they try to collect items here. I can only assume the island was so devoid of people the developers at one point decided to add nodes for crafters to come collect there to be targets to satisfy pvpers. You can gather outside of course in safe areas at a slower rate. But one can hazard a guess if so they wished why they want crafters on the pvp island. The questing is pretty much standard. Kill x amount of creatures, hand in quest, get xp or item. Can you give this item to someone for me, you run off hand in. Can you kill x amount of this creature until they drop x amount of items so I can have them, go gather then return for xp. Stuff like that. Unless you made friends be prepared for the roadblock at the end as you need dungeons for end gear or I guess buy the materials.  I think that covers most aspects of the game, I will briefly discuss the crafting, you basically gather or buy a rake of materials and take them to crafting stations plant character there and have them work away until the mats are gone. You either go gather more materials then or buy more.  Guilds are bare bones and pvp maps limited and very few playing. No auction house either and it is almost 2016, really mind blowing to even have to type that. There is a subscription payment option also if you want faster exp gain etc and some eldevin points monthly. Check the hcs store for pricing.On a finishing note if you do play. Gold will come easy later in game so do not panic. Eldevin is the currency you buy from other players or hunted cow studios and is far rarer. It is a paid for currency with very limited ways to get it, maybe at end game harvesting gems and selling them to other players for eldevin points. Dungeons give the most easy access to get gems. But you need those dungeon runs, some will get them, others not so muc. Overall, I will say this game should still be in beta and should never have been released for so long without basics in place. But it was released and I reviewed it as a finished product. They need to refocus as a dev team and get away from vanity releases and back to proper content. If you disagree with my review, feel free.  But it is my point of view and I ask you just respect that. It is my opinion. You can play or have played and feel differently. "

												First off please ignore time played as I play this outside of steam.  The only reason I downloaded through steam was to be able to leave a review.This game is AMAZING!  It could easily be my #1 MMO but there are a couple of problems.  First and foremost the developers simply don't pay attention to feedback.  Now that's fine, everyone has opinions and I'll agree it's good to have a development team with a vision and who stick to their guns.  Problem is they're shooting themselves in the foot.  There's one MAJOR flaw with this game that has been brought up repeatedly and IMO is something that keeps it from achieving a much greater level of success.  That problem is - Arbitrary level restrictions.This game has all the hallmarks of a wonderfully open ended sandbox, crafting, and exploration MMO, but it's hog tied by a STUPID and POINTLESS level restriction system that prevents you from going anywhere or even taking a quest that's more than ONE LEVEL above your current level.  It's absolute insanity that they would ruin such potential with something so pointless.  I've played MMOs for well over a decade and I've never experienced something so ridiculous.A ONE level difference between friends, family members, or people you meet in the game, will make playing this game together a NIGHTMARE.  It needlessly burdons players who want to play together and playing with others is the very definition of MMO.PLEASE remove the level restrictions, or at least relax them.  More importantly, let people play the way they want.  If they want to explore higher level areas or take higher level quests and get in over their heads - let them.  That's part of the fun.  That's what makes MMO worlds exciting.			"

												You might have noticed that this review is long. Very long. Before you start reading the next one, I have a TL;DR and Pros and Cons for if you're too lazy to read the whole thing:TL;DR: I wouldn't rate this game very high. A 7/10 at most. Still, it's fun if the few cons don't bother you.Pro:- A very nice storyline. Maybe not very original, but definitely engaging.- Not a lot of paid content. Most content is accessible without having to pay real money.- Very large world.- A bunch of cool dungeons that you can beat solo as well as in a group.- A lot of the armour looks really cool and original.- The UI looks very good.Con:- A bit unoriginal as an MMO.- A lot of (mostly vanity) items are very, VERY expensive, either in real life or ingame currency.- Armour can not be worn as vanity. No matter how cool it looks, once its outdated you can't show it off anymore.- At least in my opinion, the look of the game is not very good. The graphics seem old and the aesthetics are nothing great either.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Eldevin. Your average MMO, to be honest. It doesn't really have a lot to separate it from the crowd; This being both a good and a bad thing.For example, if you're used to other MMOs, it's probably very easy to get in to. But on the other side, why would you, since it's not very different from said MMOs? Well, it of course has *some* elements that most others don't have. For one, the percentage of content you have to pay for to be able to use is very low. The little bit of paid content it does have is also mostly (if not all) vanity stuff, and no entire areas of the map that you have to pay $29,99 for to unlock. So, there's that for a difference with most other MMOs.The world is very large, but most of it isn't accessible until you're a higher level. Well, it is accessible of course, but not recommended. Most mobs are aggressive, so it's difficult to survive in higher leveled areas.The different skills, talents and classes allow for a bunch of different play styles, but quests and sometimes even the storyline will force you to use specific skills and thus upgrade them even if you wouldn't really need them except for those few quests.There's a bunch of 'group instances' throughout the game. They all have their own loot, which includes cool-looking armour sets, weapons, etc. They can be beat in Story Mode (single player, no loot gotten, mainly for quickly doing story quests) and Group Mode (multiplayer, loot divided between group members, all mobs get buffs to be challenging for 5-player groups).I've seen some complaints about the look of the game and yeah, I agree. The graphics look old to me. While without a doubt some like it, I think it makes the game look outdated. Nor the characters nor the terrain have much detail, and just look like something your average game in 2003 could best. The aesthetics aren't great either. The characters move a bit rigid (which is something we see a lot, though). Of course this is understandable because Eldevin isn't some big super blockbuster AAA 300 million dollar game but still. The UI looks good, though. With a lot of small games you see that the UI is just a bunch of grey, half-transparent squares with numbers or text in Times New Roman, but the UI in Eldevin looks very nice.There's maybe not very many different vanity items compared to other games that have just been out for much longer, but there's enough to make each player that has invested some time in the game look different from eachother. A lot of the vanity is (once again) very, very expensive. Either in the sense that it costs a lot of real life money (not very common in this game but it happens) or a lot of ingame money. For example the vanity bought with Prestige Points. Prestige Points are earned by doing some daily quests around the game. Players who have 'just' started playing will get 4 per day at most, more experienced players will get around 10 if they do their best. During Christmas you can get much more (>100 per day is possible, but you'll have to grind christmas mobs for hours). Even then, they're SO EXPENSIVE. One vanity set costs (I think) 50,000 prestige points. I might be horribly wrong, but at this scale, it doesn't matter much. That's why the costs of most vanity items are my main (but almost my only) complaint.I could name more examples and rant about it for hours but I'm already writing a bit too much. So yeah.			"

 Amazing Experience! This game is great, and I've thoroughly enjoyed my experienc thusfar and will continue to play hopefully for a long while.First of all, this game hits that nostalgia factor, as at times it can feel somewhat like runescape. This is mostly due to the different skills and professions you can get yourself into, such as mining, making weapons, leatherwork, cooking, fishing, jewlery making, and much more. It feels nostalgic and rewarding to level up skills that tie in with your play style in order to provide for yourself and sell/supply to others. _________________________________--Overview--Pros: In-Depth storyline Many skills/professions to become skilled in Great community Enjoyable sidequests Diverse world Great for playing in a groupCons: Dwindling playerbase Outdated graphics (Not a con for me personally, as I find the grapics charming, though many people want better graphics._______________________________Premium CurrenciesA big point I like to make about this game is the fact that it does have a premium currency, though it is only for vanity items and special weapons. Throughout the game you will never have premium items shoved in your face unless you choose to visit the shop yourself to see what there is.Questing/ObjectivesQuesting can be fun and rewarding in this game as well. There is an in-depth main storyline which can lead to side-quests, but there are also tons of npc's around the world to get tasks from. In addition, there are quests to start you off in various skills, such as learning how to make weapons from ore, tailor clothes, farm a successful garden, or brew your own potions. The quests can lead you to new, interesting areas, and the big quests involve some depth and are not ridden with fetch objectives. All in all, I've enjoyed most of the quests, and the npc's who give them to you have character and are interesting to interact with.The WorldThe world itself isn't the largest, though it is diverse and it is more expansive than I originally thought when starting out at the beginning of the game. Some quests lead you to  new regions outside the map of the main city and wilderness, but you can find cool areas simply by exploring. Be weary, though, and possibly bring a friend, for you may run into particularly aggressive high-level creatures during your ventures. Throughout the world, characters have connections between areas, and the general feel of the game is prevelant with npc's of different regions.Group/Party PlayPlaying with a group is great. A couple of my friends and I decided to start this game together, and have chosen to focus on certain roles individually (I level up mining and weapon/armor crafting as well as being a melee warrior, one of us is an archer and levels in alchemy for potions, and another is our mage, leveling in magic with focus on healing and supplies us with food and charms). This system works great, as certain quests will lead you to group bosses, or raids, and it is a good idea to have backup on different roles. Also, you get an XP boost and can complete objectives simoultaneously to finish quests faster (defeating x/x enemies counts up together so you don't have to do it twice). CommunityThe community is great as far as I can tell. Starting out a random guy gave me a couple premium currency for free in a trade, which I was greatful of, and me and another similarly leveled player focused on different tasks (me mining, him farming) and exchanged goods to help each other out after randomly meeting. The only thing detrimental is the fact that the amount of players playing this game is dwidling. I hope people in the community can help to kindle a bigger playerbase, because with more players there will be more opportunity to trade and sell services to one another which would make the whole game experience even better.Final VerdictOverall this game is awesome. I've enjoyed grinding skills that I'm interested to supply my friends with better gear and sell to other players. The quests are enjoyable and the storyline has depth, so the whole experience can be quite immersive at times. There is opportunity to build your character whichever way you want, and group play adds to the experience. I definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes games like runescape as well as people who like fulfilling questlines or are just looking for a good f2p mmo.			"

												This game is great.  it captures what made runescape great, mixes it with familiar, traditional mmo mechanics, a friendly, if sometimes childish community and a generally uninvasive payment system that allows free players to experience ALL game content, with no ad interruptions or annoying ""pay me"" prompts outside of a ""SHOP"" button in the top right of the screen.  Currently, the game lets you level to 50, which is pretty difficult due to a long xp bar, but lot's of mmo's were like that while they found their ""butter zone"".Paying players do enjoy ""benefits"",  but if you invite your friends. you can get about 4-5 bucks worth of in-game cash once they hit level 20!   Each!All in all, i feel very happy with this game, and it's made my like-hate relationship with runescape alot easier to deal with.If you'd like to level with me, click this link, sign up, and then send ""MarmaladeBath"" a message!https://www.eldevin.com/invite/UUJADWGLNWESYOVDHave fun guys!

Short Review / Comparison about Eldevin>RuneScape?To make it short for people who played RuneScape.Eldevin is similar to runescape in some ways. I won't go into details, because even though it has similarity, its still diffrent.If you've played runescape and got bored by all the VIP only features, check Eldevin out.>Team PlayersEldevin doesn't have a massive player base. So I recommend to grab a few friends for the start.>Complaints about Inventory spaceI've seen many people complaining how Backpack space is way to expensive and you have not enough space for your items. Which is not really true. I did buy the DLC's shich contains bigger backpacks, but it's not necessary. If you clean up your inventory and save up some gold for Baskets there should be no problem.>Pay2Win?Not at all, you can simply buy cosmetics in the shop. And later on, getting Gold is so easy that you don't even have to buy cosmetics for actual money. The ingame currency is stable at Gold:EldevinPoints(EP) 3:1Important: If you decided to buy EldevinPoints, DO NOT buy gold from the Shop.>My overall playtimeCompared to other MMO RPG's my playtime is quite much. It's very fun to play with friends and Guild Members, specially if there's an event active.>Events / UpdatesThe game has for every international holiday an event ready. Sometimes they have bigger updates and fixes. Whenever an event goes online, there are quite a few bugs and glitches, where you can't finish your event quest. But thats no big deal since the devs fix it right away - 1 day.>I read your review, I still don't know if I should try itTry it. It's free. The only thing that could happen is, that you buy Eldevinpoints at the very beginning and realize that you don't like the game. But I don't think people are that stupid anyways. Have fun trying it out.			"

												As long as you do not require top-notch graphics to enjoy a game, this game will be enjoyable for you. It has all the elements you'd expect in an RPG, and it's built to run in a web browser too! A lot of reviews reference to Runescape, and yes I can see how you might compare the game to it, but being in a browser is probably the closest reason for that comparison. This game has plenty of unique features that will keep you busy.Lots of solo and co-op content, in fact the dungeons even come with a ""story"" mode, if you prefer to play alone. The monsters are easier, and you don't need a bunch of buddies to take the dungeon. However, if you want a challenge, run the dungeon normally and get the full experience.Lots of crafts to keep you busy, piles of quests and content, and a diverse user-built class system, which you can change with a free respec every 60 days if you decide to. Fun PVP zones, arena challenges, seasonal events, lots going on in the game to keep your interest.There is of course a pay for shop, but its not required to enjoy the game. The subscription benefits are nice, but only reduce the grind if you feel the need. The game progresses at a steady rate even without the buff. I've only been playing about a week now, but I see myself sticking to it for quite awhile. Will update my review as I go.What have you got to lose? Its free, give it a try! See you in game.			"

												I have put a few hours into this game and have come to really love it. I played World of Warcraft for years and Eldevin ranks right along with it. The one thing missing is a Auction House. The rest is there including Mailboxes!! The only downside to the mail system is that it requires Eldevin Points to send items. The Points can be purchased or IF you have an item that other players want you can trade them for the points. Most of the players are friendly and will help you out. (Total Strangers Helping you out really!!) The story lines are really easy to understand and you can do most everything by yourself IE: Dungs. These have an option that you can run the Dung on ""Story Mode"" and you can solo them but make and take lots of healing pots, mana pots etc..Storage is an issue and you will soon see the need for Bags. These you can either buy from other players or from the game store ""They cant be made"". You can however gather many items and make things yourself such as weapons, armor, potions, and even mounts. I do however recommend you stay out of the PvP areas until you are leveled and geared for it because most of the chars in this area are maxed in lvl and gear. I LOVE IT!!! Eat your heart out WoW!! You have been Replaced!!			"

												I am not an MMO player. I do not enjoy MMOs or their communities. Most of the time, if a game is listed as MMO I avoid it, and the MMOs I do try I get around 5-to-6 hours in before calling it quits... This game broke that. It's not what one would call ""pretty"", but its humor and storytelling more than make up for that. The mechanics are solid, with an incredibly immersive world that never seems to wind down. There's never a true calm period, as you always see people in a mad rush (at least, in the opening areas; I'll touch on that more when I get pass the Copper-age). The story and plot are cliched, but the way they are portrayed make such a huge difference, and the fact that some portions of the story can be different from anothers by simply choice add so much to replayability and roleplay, as well as gives everyone a potentially different story to swap and love. Overall, if you are looking for that one retro-feel game that can really cure that itch for an MMO, this is probably the one. Now, if you will excuse me, I think my 250 copper bars are done...			"

												Will keep this relatively short -I find this to be a pleasing little game particularly the gathering and crafting aspects.However I quickly found frustration in the extremely limited inventory space making spending $$ almost immediately required after about an hour of play simply due to not having space.   Most of the materials stack to 5 or maybe 10 before taking up another 'slot', and you've also got to carry around a pickaxe, shears, an axe, a fishing rod...whatever.  If you want to actually experience the crafting, prepare to shell out some cash to even have room to do anything.  I spent more time reorganising my inventory (or running allll the way back to the bank and/or vendors) than I did anything else.  A shame, really, because it has a lot of potential.			"

Product received for free
												After installing this game and playing it for a small period of time, I can safely say I'm hooked. I was cautious about the game at first, but after playing it, I think the game is worthwhile anyone's time who enjoys a classic MMORPG. I'll break down the pro's and the con's of the game, and explain why they are in their respective places.The Pro's:1.) There are no classes. You create your own class through the talent system and various abilities you learn as you level.2.) The game is very punishing in terms of not respecting mobs. Especially ""elite"", ""champion"", or ""boss"" mobs.3.) The game feels very interactive with you and your character, very rarely are you not doing something while in combat from my experience.4.) The game is complex, and not in a bad sense, but in terms of that the game doesn't hold your hand past the tutorial, and you have a lot of information to understand and process in order to play efficiently and effectively.5.) There is plenty to do, between quests, events, professions, dungeons, etc.6.) The game has a very small community. This can be a good or bad thing depending on preference, however, because of this, you make friendships with other players very easily, and for the most part, all of the players are very helpful, respectful, and welcoming of new players.7.) The game doesn't feel like a stereotypical MMORPG Grindfest. This may be more relating to the fact that the combat is very interactive in the game.8.) No pay to win garbage. Nearly everything from the cash shop can be purchased with in-game gold at some point or another. (Gold to Paid-Currency Ratio is about 1:3) All of the items from the cash shop are either purely cosmetic, or serve such a minimal purpose, it doesn't impact you.9.) The graphics. I know plenty of people will disagree with me here, but I do enjoy the simplicity of the game's art-style. It's very original and appealing to look at. It's not an overly-glamorous professional graphics design, with high resolution textures and models. Whilst, I do like very high-end graphics, and I give full respect for those who can do such, it's become the norm. Therefore, it's nothing special. These graphics, however, are, in my opinion.10.) The questing isn't linear. I can't go from level one to max level running in basically a straight line.The Con's:1.) (Intended or not) There [appears] to be an issue with auto-attacking where it must remain on your action bars, and you must use the action-slot that it's in, in order to auto-attack. This is not significant in any way, shape, or form, and is only a personal qualm of mine.2.) Not being able to track multiple quests at once can be a tad tedious at times, but it's nothing significant.3.) There appears to be quite a few issues with collision boxes on some in-world items. (I.E: Trees, boxes, etc.)4.) Updates are few and far in between, which, can be a good or bad thing, depending on the way you look at it. It's good if you are a casual player trying to progress to max level, it will give you quite a length of time to get there and not feel the rush or obligation to do so as soon as humanly possible. It's bad if you are already at the end-game, and are sitting on your hands with nothing to do, assuming you've accomplished every thing possible up to that point.Overall? I give this game a 10/10 in honesty. The cons are so insignificant it truly doesn't impact the gameplay enough for me to want to dilute my rating of the game.TL;DR - If you get past the graphics, if you are a graphics junkie, the small community, and lack of updates, then this game is for you.

												Alright, there is a lot to say about this game. I will try to keep this as short as possible while still maintaining all the necessary information. I do not normally write reviews so bare with me on this. There is a reason I am choosing to write this review which you will see towards the end.Now, let's begin with the game itself.This game has been out for just barely more than a year. The staff behind this game have done an absolutely incredible job with quests, with the story line and overall game play.  Sure, there's some little buggy issues here and there, but it's an indie game that hasn't been out long. To expect perfection would be pretty ludicrous. Even EA puts out♥♥♥♥♥♥games and they're a billion dollar corporation.Just like any MMORPG you have the basic classes and subclasses to character creation. Archer, Mage, Healer, Tank and then the subclasses like assassin, warrior ect. This system is pretty much universal but everyone has their own unique ways of doing it. I want to avoid comparing this to runescape, I know this is what everyone is doing. However the ONE thing I will say, is if you are looking for a runescape like game, this is your game.The resource gathering on this game and the profession leveling can be a very painful grind at times. The Community in game is fantastic. You get the occasional jerks that just want to start♥♥♥♥♥♥ but most everyone is very helpful and supportive.The world... even now after 250 hours of game play on this game, I am finding places in this game I didn't even know existed. There's so much to explore, so much to do, there's an insane amount of side quests and story line quests.Most importantly however, is the admin/customer support staff. There is none like this out there. You will not find a friendlier group of guys out there. If you have a problem and need a quick fix, find an online admin, or submit a ticket. Fast response times Monday through Friday and they legitimately seek to help you. The staff is what prompted me to write this review. I could not give this staff enough praise even if I wanted to. If they had the resources as a company like EA, Activision, SEGA, ect, the would would be the limit for these guys.I WANT to rate this game based on potential. For a free to play, pay for benefits game, this game is incredible. It's not a pay to win game by any means. If I were to rate based on potential due to how young of a game this is, I would say 9/10. This game has that kind of potential.However, to give this game a rating as it stands, I would give this game a 7/10. As much praise as I give this game, the only 2 complaints I have about it to drop it from an 8 to a 7 are the fact that the leveling really, really feels like a grind at times and there is somewhat of a lack of customization of armor/weapons. This may get fixed in the future though. There's just a slight lack of weapons/armor content is all.			"

												Great game for a while, the lvling system is good and challenging, tons of quests, massive varity of mobs to killbut the end game is terrible, pvp is complete joke, it has no player market/auction house and the real deal breaker is it has no  players.often less than 40 players on all servers combined And as higher end dungeons can't be solo'd the complete lack of players made me stop playing			"

												The game is like runescape with a action bar and classes. Fun crafting system. Dungeons are also fun to play aswell. The downside is the player base is really small the most players online are 100. Which would turn most people away. The graphics are of a 2002 game. graphics don't always make a good game.			"

												It's a pretty okay MMO.I haven't gotten far in the story yet, but that's because I like crafting too much. hahah. The craft system is okay, and you can farm stuff, fish, mine, skin wildlife, cook, tailor, smith, etc. The game doesn't have forced combat classes either. You can just learn skills from any type. Of course eventually it's best to stick to one or two types for the higher level skills... but you can do whatever. The graphics is a bit mediocre, but the upside is that this game isn't even half a GB. I'm sure other hardware demands are much lower as well. So it's a game pretty much anyone can play, especially since it's also free.All'n all, another good game to keep you busy.			"

												Alright I've been playing Eldevin for a couple hours now and I have to say I really enjoy it. It is not too hard to jump right in. It pretty much resembles runescape in some aspects. I didn't try this game at first because people said it was a knock off of runescape but personally I would say try the game yourself and find out how you feel. I feel as though runescape and eldevin share some simularities but there are some major differences. Also if you decide playing add me. I'm Lawli. :)			"

												So basically this game came up on my recommended and I thought ""wow this looks like old runescape"" which I spent countless hours on during my childhood. This game, however, is exactly what runescape should've been. In the past 3 days i have played over 15 hours of this game. Everything about it makes me nostalgic which is why i keep coming back. This game delivers on everything that you would hope when reminiscing about the past. All the skills are amazing. The combat is great as it introduces more ways to fight then just stand their and watch your character attack. The only bad thing about this game is that the community is not as big as I would hope (but it is growing FAST). In the past week i have seen the number of people almost double. Thank you Hunted Cow for creating this fine piece of work. Definately a must have for anyone who grew up with runescape or just loves mmos			"

												If you have an old school RuneScape fix, then this game is for you. It is literally the closest MMORPG you can find that is like old school RuneScape that isn't RuneScape. It even has the same holiday events that RuneScape had, such as Christmas Crackers and Party hats. The best part about this game is that it's still early in the games life so everyone is nice and everything is new. I was playing this game before it came to Steam, so there's not much time on my Steam account. I got to level 8 and decided to wait until this game came to Steam so I could play with more people, and now that this game has come out, I'll be playing it a lot more. Don't listen to people who are bashing this game. If you've never played RuneScape, you won't really understand this games feel. But it's still a nice little game to play every once in awhile.			"

 It's Refreshing , a bit slow at my level (9)Sometimes after a chain of quests you're left at a dead end and have to grind mobs to the next level before you can keep on going. - The quests are however diverse and surprisingly challenging at times which i see as a plus (no game is fun in the long run if it's too easy).  It has the classics elements of any MMORPG  (Massive Multiplayer online Role Player game) including mounts, proffesions, dungeons and PvP to mention some of them. The soundtracks are delightful!  With a catchy orchestral feeling to make you stop sometimes, and just listen. The graphics may cause a pleasant feeling of nostalgia. It does not need to be better done. This game is pretty good.Thumbs up! - Herman			"

												If you can get past the somewhat outdated graphics this game is one of the best out there!Have you ever wanted a game where you can craft EVERYTHING with one character?How about have you ever wanted a game where YOU MAKE YOUR OWN CLASS?  You put points in 6 different trees at your own leisure and there are ZERO absolute classes.  YOU MAKE YOUR OWN.On top of that the game has a great guild system, fun grouping and the game does not feel too grindy.  Give this game a try, get past the graphics.I have always been an advocate of great gameplay always before graphics.  IF YOU HAVE THAT MINDSET THIS GAME IS FOR YOU.  If you do not have that mindset I still encourage you to give this game a few days.  It is amazing.  The community at this time is small but very tight knit.  I would love to see this game grow even more.			"

TL;DROne of the best RPGMMO's i've ever played. It has no 'locked' classes, meaning you can be either male or female character and be ANY build you want and with the new level cap raise hybrid builds are really good. ONE IMPORTANT DOWNSIDE - This game's playerbase is not as high as it was a year or two ago, so if you like populated games then sadly this is not the game for you. That being said; this game is still very fun with a decent community, a really nice story line and tons of quests to do. Well? What are you waiting for? Go on and try it out!Long(er) review versionThe problem with this game is that it's not being advertised, I only stumbled upon it by accident and man am I glad I did. I made many friends from around the globe and I had alot of amazing experiences in this game. This game is a masterpiece considering the small team of developers behind it. You can have more than one character ( up to 16 ) and it definitely has that replayability value.The classes you can pick from are as follow:~Templar (The Tank, you generate the aggro to keep all the mobs focusing only you. It is your job to take all the damage and punishment. The use of pain-killers are advised).~Warrior (Melee two-handed dps class with high AoE dps skills and talents).~Assassin (Melee dual-wielding dps class with high single target dps).~Ranger (Ranged dps class with balanced AoE and single target dps, a bit weaker than melee classes but it has a familiar with really high armor and HP that acts as a single target tank).~Mage (Ranged magic dps class with high AoE and single target dps. Warrior remaining better AoE- and Assassin better single target dps classes. It also has a familiar but unlike Ranger's tanky-wolf, this Elemental does not generate enough aggro to be used as tank, but it does deal good damage and is nice to use when soloing high ranking mobs. This class is also one of the easiest to level as).~Prophet (The Healer, you keep the group alive with healing spells, damage reduction spells and mana/hp regenrating abilities).There are currently three major servers in this game called: Terra (EU), Zephyr (US) and Cleavius (OC). All the other small servers has been merged with these three (US having the highest playerbase and EU just a bit less).EDIT: I completely forgot to talk about professions, so here goes: This game has a really nice system of professions in two 'categories' namely Gathering and Crafting. Here players can mine, farm hunt, etc and then use the gathered materials to level up the respective Crafting profession for example: Hunting -> Leatherworking; Prospecting (mining) along with Crystal Cutting -> Weaponsmithing, Armorsmithing, Jewelery; Gathering -> Alchemy; and the list goes on. If you are only interested in leveling all your Gathering skills, you can sell or trade the materials to players who need it or sell it at vendor price to the npc's.EDIT 2: Sadly the latest major updates made the game p2w in both pvp and pve, mostly in pvp aspects though. While the previous end-game gear had to be obtained by grinding the respective dungeons, one can now obtain even more powerful gear simply by opening your wallet and buying the required materials from other players. This eliminated the need for people to form parties and run dungeons to obtain their gear, which was more fun. Most players grab their parents' credit cards, buys the required materials and outgears all the old players that had to work for their gear. In Conclusion: Despite what is mentioned above, I really recommend you try this game, it's really unique, tons of fun to play with friends or solo and it stands above the rest.			"

												It's a pretty interesting game but sadly development is mostly dead already. Last ""update"" was a copy & paste event from last year and going by older players they didn't even take time to edit the text to remove part that where no longer valid.When players asked if money spend on the game will be used for it all they did was lock down the topic will saying they hope to provide more content but that they have no timeframe.

												This game is awesome, it's a lot of fun. Since its free to play there's nothing wrong with trying it out to see for yourself.This is kind of like runescape meets V-wow, its somewhere in the middle. Ten times better than runescape, but probably about a quarter of the players.Its tons of fun to go do quests and stuff, not a ton of players though, but that's to be expected honestly. Its only been really out for about a month and from what i heard it wasn't easily playable at first, but that's changed considerably.However, the interface still needs work butI rarely run into bugs. No jumping kind of is disconcerting not only that but there's a lot of other things that I'd like to more or less be updated to fit more modern games. One big thing was that objects are sometimes larger than they appear annd you more or less have to click a point for your character to move around the object, which is a big thing i run into a lot, camera controls and how everything is put together is a bit condense, espically in some areas where you have to be looking almost straight down to be able to move around properly. But over all its a ton of fun for what it is. Graphics aren't bad, but not excatly the best either. Zones are also kind of weird, I like the idea of being able to run about and get killed by high level mobs. Also pvp was more or less an after thought. All levels are thrown into the arena, while lower levels gets a boost it just shows there aren't enough players pvp'ing to do anything great with it, also there's no real pvp armor or anything like that meaning the system is nearly pointless other than getting a mount and some top layers to cover your armor. Also no player aution house means only venders are there for selling or going out and asking people to trade, which since your voice only really has a limited reach it will get very hard to sell something to other players.Now while that might push some away, this is still an amazing game. It has a ton of room to grow and they are planning on expanding it considerbly.			"

												***Pros: Great interesting quests and it doesn't take too much extra mob grinding to reach max level. -Crafting is interesting and fun at first. Devs/GM's are friendly and amazing. -Lots of stuff to keep you entertained (world bosses, pvp, fishing, farming, crafting)***Cons: Crafting gets ridiculously hard (I seriously could level to 45 several times in the same amount of time to max out crafting just once in one profession...). Expect to mine hundreds of thousands of materials (no joke)-Expect to run the same dungeons hundreds of times and by the time you get enough points for your armor you have out-leveled it and need the next armor Lol-The community is very smalll - mostly kids and ego maniacs...  found very few people I could get along with...

												I enjoy this game a lot more than I thought I would, since I was never able to get into Runescape and that seems to be the most often compared title to Eldevin. I like how there's so many different gathering and crafting skills, and that you can do every one of them on one character, I find it enjoyable just to go on gathering trips and then come back and sort what I have for crafting, which is VERY unlike me, typically. Sure, the graphics are not modern and snazzy, but they hold an appeal for me- I really like the visual style of the game. Small touches like the animation of using a table saw to cut logs into planks are very satisfying.  The music is nice, though quite often a bit too understated. The free to play system of Eldevin is fantastic. There's barely any restrictions at all. That being said, I subbed after a couple of days becuase it's only $6.99. If you are the type of player who will just want to level fast without doing crafting or anything to get to 'endgame', that attitude won't work here. The journey really is the point of this game.I can't say if I'll play Eldevin long-term, but right now I'm enjoying the hell out of it. "

												I'm glad I found this game, If your tired of searching for a mmorpg and worn out on the cliche hype, then download this one and get ready for something that you can kick back to and feel that thrill of discovering something new again.  With gameplay kinda like Runescape mixed with Ultima Online, and a dash of Diablo, your not gonna regret this one, easy in and out gameplay, thorough story line, and questing that seems funner than just following arrows, makes it one of the top mmos out there to play, only regret that its not wide known (hardly any advertising on the net).  Its fairly new I believe and that leaves me hoping that much more will be added to this potentially massive and deep game.  Sure the graphics arent eye popping candy, but that is also what sets it apart from the big guys, and thats a good thing, still has plenty of detail and attractiveness to keep you engaged for hours n hours.  Its free to play and is a small download thats easy to play in window mode ( I recommend full screen mode tho ).  Craft, farm,fish, harvest, garden, ect... You could spend all day not killin a thing and still have a good time so come one come all, give it a shot and I bet one day you'll be writing your own review, and trying to get your friends into this world of adventure.!

This game has lots of nice features to it - fishing, mining, wood cuting, cooking, armor/weapon smithing, potion making and lots LOTS more...my english is to poor to describe all the features but I hope you get the point. One thing that I wish that could be implemented..more armor sets to craft, weapons and a auction house to sell my junk in, but otherwise this is the game I will stick to for a while - must try.. easy 8+/10 for devs and friendly community! Keep up the good job..and see you all in the game!			"

												A great online game reminescent of RuneScape.  It has a small community and is deserving of some more players and revenue.			"

TL:DR:  If you are stuck with a computer from 1998 or are into something like RuneScape, go for it.  Otherwise there are many other options out there that offer the same experience or better and you may already be involved in them.  Read on for a little more detail.Overall:  No, I didn't play it very long, but it doesn't take me long to get hooked by RPGs if they are for me and many are not.  The thumbs down is mostly that it offers nothing new really.  It's more for people that enjoy this style of game, graphics and community.  In a game like this the community is likely to be very good as it will be small and tight knit, full of nice helpful people that don't need instant gratification.  For that alone, I CAN recommend it, however overall I don't.  For those that want instant gratification, just don't even try it out.Initial:  The initial experience is very linear as it takes you through the tutorial steps, which I feel, most people don't really need to have forced on them these days.  All I really wanted to do was to grab a 2 hander, some 2 hander skills and start bashing my way through quests.  Unfortunately, that is not an option.  You can't even enter the main city without completing your ""tutorial"" line.  You get to feel the very basics of each archetype; melee, ranged, magic. So you learn the basics of combat quickly.  I am certain that you will of course have more choice once you get through this tutorial wall, but unfortunately I have done these steps in many games before it, felt the same combat, same quests etc.  So as the game felt like more of the same except with outdated visuals, style and mechanics, I grew bored very quickly.  Many likely will.Good Things:  The good thing about all this is, you know what you are getting into.  There seems to be a lot of good lore within the game and it tosses you into that world immediately. There is even a quest to talk to a scribe, catching you up a bit.  Between the archetype skills and the talent tree there seems to be enough skills to keep you interested and the talent trees are rather full of bonuses.  You are also free to choose whatever you want (classless in that regard) and you can use all of the professions (not sure if you can max them all though). There is also good in the fact that it is free to play and it doesn't immediately seem that is any more overbearing with the cash shop than many other free to play games that are considered to have a decent model.  The typical buy inventory, buy xp boosts, cosmetics etc.  The community did seem helpful for those that needed it, although small, but growing thanks to the steam release influx.Conclusion:  There is likely a lot of good in this game for some people, however, for me, it's just not my jam.  I've been there, done that and have moved on to other things, thus I cannot personally recommend it.  However, give it a shot and see, it's free to try and you may or may not like it.  If you do, there's plenty for you to enjoy, including the people. If you don't, nothing lost but maybe a couple hours tops.			"

												There was a time when the greatest free mmo you could find was a game called Runescape. This harkens back to that era in gaming with some significant improvements in gameplay. The game is very ""let's take this classic formula and apply what we've learned over the last decade""The controls take some getting used to after adapting to the new controls of most MMO's, but once you've got that the gameplay is smooth. I intended to give the game half an hour to piddle around with while I waited for a show to aire, but I ended up spending more than 3x that time just enjoying the game.  I will update this review as I get further in, but as of right now (early impressions) this is a game you should give a chance.			"

												Unless you've played Runescape before, this game most likely will not interest you due to its style. However, if you're still interested for any reason, consider this: If you like a game with a nice, wonderous soundtrack (some bits which make you think of a Harry Potter movie) and don't mind low quality graphics, it's worth a try. Keep in mind that the community is very, very small, so the mulitplayer experience may not be that fun, but otherwise you should have a lot to do if you're fine wtih playin this game by yourself.

												There is no set classes so you can make whatever kind of build you want. While I am sure there is some kind of meta/cookie cutter build that works the best, I will keep having fun doing my own thing and so far am enjoying doing so . Reminds me alot of the late 90's style MMO games. The nostalgia will keep me coming back to visit I am sure.			"

												Eldevin started as a browser-based ( client now) MMORPG featuring a rich storyline and hundreds of quests. The decisions you make carry through to later areas, influencing what encounters you will receive, giving the game a very dynamic feel to its play. The world is large, with dungeons to delve, secrets to discover, and towns to visit. Choose from over 100 different skills, and enjoy a classless leveling system where you can develop however you choose.			"

												This game is great, its a full free to play so that means you don't have to spend a penny!You can explore many areas of Eldevin. Pick from the following classes Templar, Warrior, Assassin, Ranger, Mage and Prophet, all having different skills, and If you want, you can mix and match classes to become something like a Assassin Warrior. Theres loads of quests to complete, professions to level and loot to find that will give you loads of hours of gameplay.Currently you can only get your characters to level 45 which still takes forever. The developers are introducing new content all the time. If you are into MMO/RPG games that are FREE you will definetly want to try this out. It brings back some awesome memories of older mmo's I used to play. Thanks for reading up!			"

												These are probably some of the worst graphics for a MMO. Avatar graphics look to be from 2001, and building and water graphics from 2004-2005. There is some lag, especially around extra busy areas.And yet, this could be one of the best MMO's out there currently.After having tried different MMO's out including LOTRO, SWTOR, and Spiral Knights, I can now look back at these and see where Eldevin has some of that or has corrected the mistakes these other popular MMO's have failed. Eldevin has a huge world to explore and discover, much like LOTRO. But with much better free roam possibilities. I just did a lvl 7 quest that had lvl 32 Ai.SWTOR pushes you to choose a class. And theres no going back once its made. So your stuck between better powers or better storyline. SWTOR pretty much makes you need a team of players to fight boss's, and to be a higher level than the one your doing. SWTOR nags you about spending rl money on their game, going so far as to raise prices of the items you buy with credits, just for being a free-to-play player! Eldevin's quests are pretty simple and can be soloed pretty much, with a few tougher quests mixed in where you need a team, giving the game a great balance. I can be lvl 8 and take down a lvl 9 Ai. Might be a big fight and I lose extra HP, but least I dont get one-hit and die. Eldevin also lets you pretty much choose which side you want at a relaxing pace. Eventually you'll choose, but its more of just putting points into character traits. Now compare what I said about SWTOR, and Eldevin. You can easily see that Eldevin is the easier, more relaxed, and better able to get into than SWTOR. Eldevin is also really a free-to-play game! As of when Im writing this, you can spend rl money for cosmetics, mounts, mount riding trait, potions, pets, and other knick-knacks. So no new player can come along, throw 100$ into Eldevin, and suddenly be the #1 player in-game, 2 hours later. Thats perhaps one of Eldevin's brightest points.You can also earn reputation points with different factions in Eldevin. All these points do is show what type of quests you have done and lets you earn special vanity(cosmetic items) to wear in-game! That means you have complete freedom to choose which side(s) you choose to support! Though I have not yet found how to earn good reputation points with some of the factions yet, it would appear that they're out there somewhere.Im still wearing the armour and helmet I recieved at level 4. Im now level 9. Most MMO's would drill you to change your gear every 2-3 ranks, with you dieing in battle every time, due to lack of armour stats. Maybe I have stronger weapons and thats why Im not having much trouble, but it seems the only limit to what gear your wearing is up to you making it, and your level.I still have some mixed feelings about the professions, your healing ability, and the combat. The professions are a nusiance at best, yet the majority of new gear you can get for battle, so far, comes from being able to make your own gear(armoursmithing) which requires Mining. The rest, Im not sure about. The majority of players also agree in-game that this is annoying and perhaps the games worst point(next to the graphics in my book). I find woodcutting to be the useless profession as Im still yet to find whats the point of having logs and turning them into boards. Ill see as the game progress's for me. The magical healing ability is, without a doubt, a very useful ally in-game. However, it heals such a tiny amount of your life, that its almost not worth the few second wait as you heal. Potions and eating food heals more in one use than this ability.Combat is very nice! But maybe just a tad unbalanced. Archery is, no doubt, the strongest attack. I can weaken any enemy with 3 archery shots before it can even start its attack on me. They say melee is strong, but archery will end up being the best attack.There is LOTS more I could say showing how great Eldevin is, but why should I? Just download it and see its awesomness yourself. It took me 4-5 minutes to download and took almost no MB. Hunted Cow Studios also has other computer games, including another MMO which has been out either 8 or 10 years depending where you look, and still seems to be going strong. So this game should be great. And with the promise of guilds coming, things will only look to get better. So install the game, enjoy the game, and see how MMO's should really be like! Especially if you played Free Realms or Star Wars: Clone Wars Adventures before they shutdown(oh terrible day!) then you will also love Eldevin.			"

												The best game from its kind. I have played a lot of MMORPG's but no one was even close to make me want to play as much as Eldevin already does.The community in this game is small but really good.I mean i haven't met much players ingame but those who i met really made my day, game and life way better.The only con i found of this game is that it has to be played with friend. You cant just rush to solo dungeons. It's nearly inmpossible for Mage of Prophet to solo even the first dungeons if they arend ahead for at least +5 levels.Even of this con(Not really a con but lack of friends  who wish to dive in this beatifull and diverse world), I still find this game really entertaining.The people here are so generous thet even one complete stranger gave me gold to buy first level of riding skill + mount, which are quite expensive for starters.Verdict: This game is far ahead of it's time. I really suggest this game before any others of this type. It's a must play for any MMO fan.			"

												Okay, so from the first moment you enter Eldevin, you think: RUNESCAPE! But the layout and controls are more like Everquest.So overall, it's a great game. Community/Most people are usually friendly, some just don't talk at all. There are so many items you can craft, and skills you don't see in any game like camping, meditating, skinning, which make the game more relatable to real life.There are of course all the basics: Farming, fishing, mining, stone-cutting, jewelery, armoursmithing, weaponsmithing, wood-cutting, foraging, hunting.You can be a mage, warrior, templar, prophet, ranger, and you can level up in those aspects pretty nicely.I'm a mage/prophet, and I would love to see more destruction spells and binding spells!Cool ideas I would suggest are sleeping bags (to skip when it turns dark), ability to make a camp-fire/bon fire, swimming?, and lastly auto-rotate camera.Also the mounts are really weird, discs? I don't know, doesn't really fit in the style of the game, I don't know :P			"

												This game is definitely well worth playing despite of the graphics....This game is similar to runescape but all professions can be gained as free to play...no need to spend real money on professions or even expanding inventory...The diversity in this game is truly awesome as well..play as one class or mix them up to what best suits your play style...This game definitely lives up to  the true meaning of free to play..I love this game and its definitely well worth the hours i spend playing..I definitely highly recommend eldevin...

												The biggest complaint is that there are no people in the game and this is somewhat true there are considerably less people than other MMOs but the game is very fun it is a lot like runescape. I actually think that the lack of players works out in everyones favor. See in WOW the servers are very crowded and from a purely social standpoint it is very easy to get lost in the crowd. Here if you try you can make friends I mean there are some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s but there are also a lot of great players. I find it easy to approach sommeone alone by a dungeon and ask if you would like to do it together. There are also only six classes to choose from so a player can get comfortable with each class and the strategy used to play it which is hard to do. It also can be difficult for some people to get used to communicating online and in MMOs and feel this game is great for that. I enjoy the game and hope the developers update it to increase the interest in new players. It is free to play so there is no cost which is good. They also have seasonal events which are quite enjoyable. I guess every MMO has its problems but It has decent multiplayer interface and I lot of quests. The dugeons are fun to go through if you have a good team of people. Again it is basically like runescape so if you like runescape you will like this game. The developers will hopefully continue to update the game and create tasks to keep players involved and hopefully one day they will have enough people to run PVP events. I personally found no trouble to find people to do dugeons with and if you need someone I would definitely go with you.			"

												I will start off with this game has potential but is still by far what I would call a complete game. Story, skill trees, and professions are well designed and has many potentials to be free from the standard playing style where u are fixed to your own class. However there are a few major shortcoming. Story-wise, the quests brings you throught the story quite nicely and smoothly however I would disagree on the breaking up of the major quests to multiple smaller quests and you can only advance when u reach a particular level. This make me feel like the story like always left hanging after a quest completion and there are a few major quests with all different sequence. This really breaks the storytelling part of the game.Skill trees is up for a praise. Freedom to be whatever you want and not restricted by class is one I really like. Feels more fun when you can have a Battle Mage instead of just a mage. It opens up to numerous possiblities of character customization.Professions well its fun if you need a sidetrack from the battle. What I like about the professions is that you are not restricted and you can level whichever profession you like provided you are willing to burn those hours in. What I don't like about professions are the professions' equipments. There is basically no way to upgrade your professions' equipment. It feels static as in you are just a bot mining / fishing / farming / etc. There is no sense of achievement.Overall, like I mentioned, it is a game with potentials but at this moment, it is still far from a complete game. Maybe give it a year or 2 and it will be worthwhile to play. "

												This game is amazing and highly addictive. A good game doesn't need high end graphics to be beautiful. I'm definately going to put a lot of hours into this. The game is basically runescape with a newer twist. The mechanics and animations are very smooth in this. There is also a lot to do! Group dungeons are unlocked at level 5 so you dont need to beat the story before you start doing things you want with your friends. The story is also very well done and your interactions with npc's feel very real. :D			"

												Thus far a pretty decent MMORPG. The control take a bit of getting used to, but I think that's more the fault of the player than the game itself. The quests range from combat-oriented to simple run-around-and-pick-stuff-up quests that can tip you over the experience edge when you don't feel like killing another dozen or so Shigra in the early stages. Crafting is proving to be a fun diversion, too, with options ranging from cooking to alchemy to weaponsmithing. The standard crafts, basically, but that doesn't make them any less amusing to do.My only complaint is that while there's much of the game you can accomplish solo (which is nice for me, since I love the MMO style but am not so keen on random interaction with strangers), there are quests that can't be cleared without a party. And since there are so few players of the game, you can someone be waiting the better part of an hour for someone to jump in the quest queue so you can clear out a dungeon that's ""too hard"" to do alone. (Seriously, when the dungeon level is 5 and I'm level 10, I can do it myself. Really. Just watch me!) You can, to the game's credit, keep doing other things while you wait for a party to be gathered, but it's still frustrating to be forced into group situations when you don't really have to be.			"

												Been playing this game for almost a year and a half off and on.  I feel this game has a good story line that is easy to follow and enjoy.  Even though it is MMO you can also do alot of things on your own.  The community is very sociable towards each other and willing to help anybody who needs it.  So don't be shy to ask anything about the game in global chat.  If you have any suggestions the Developers do listen to the feedback from the community.If you're looking for great graphics in this game.  Eldevin isn't the game for you.  If you're and old school rpg gamer, this is a game you should try.  Gameplay has a old school feel and is very enjoyable with no class restrictions.  For old Runescape players Eldevin resembles it somewhat like professions and crafting.  Though this game is missing a few aspects of a regular MMO.  The Devs made assure that they will be adding it in the future.			"

												I have been looking for an alternative to RuneScape for 3 years.Having gotten sick and tired of their membership system I started looking for an mmo that DOESN'T require a monthly sub for all the content.First I looked at LoTR Online, it was ok, but didn't really have the RS vibe.And after ALMOST buying the Elder Scrolls Online I found Eldevin. And it was exactly what I was looking for.I have been very impressed so far, it looks very well done and it really gives me nostalgic flashbacks, Eldevin is even made in Java for crying out loud like RS was!Then my heart broke when I discovered that the devs weren't paying as much attention to this game, instead focusing on other projects. It meant that this game could go under anytime.But don't let that stop you. This game spells RuneScape clone only better all over. Play it, you won't be disappointed. Plus, you playing also keeps this game alive. So do it people, if you're after an MMO this could be it. People complain about the  lack of people, but the more people decide to give it a chance the more players there'll be. Please. Play it. You (Probably) won't be disappointed.EDIT: They just updated the game this week. Unfortunately the update unbalanced the game regard XP and gathering skills. So I would hold off playing it for now (good time for me to take a break) but I appreciate that the devs still care.They patched it again, and the new gathering skill levels look a bit better at least for players starting out. So go ahead and give this game a try.			"

												This game is far from a Runescape clone, as far as I can tell. The thing I enjoy most about the game however, is its ambience. Now, this may sound odd due to the graphics from 1999, but thats actually what I enjoy. It is a very ""busy"" game that requires a lot of quests, but for the most part the quests are sprawled out enough to the point that it doesnt always feel repetitive, which is a problem I've noticed a lot in mordern MMOs. Nonetheless, if you enjoy MMOs at all, I highly recommend this game.			"

												The player base is very small compared to what it used to be but it is okay because there are still Guilds you can join that are active. Since the player base is small, it is quality instead of quantity. Everyone helps each other out unless you find that one guy who just downloaded the game so he can spend 12 hours straight standing still asking people for low level gear that he could have made himself through ten minutes of mining and crafting. (Yes, that happened.)They added Mailboxes but they aren't useful since they charge quite the fee to use them. But you won't use them anyway since it isn't that much of a hassle to trade.The dungeon designs are pretty unique and the dialogue is good. The only thing I disliked was that you were forced to go through with the tutorial and that you needed to complete a small chain quest to use the bank. The gameplay isn't complicated so i'm not sure why the tutorial was required but maybe it was just to be safe incase the community ended up being kids trying to act old school.The community is mainly adults. I saw a few of the top (though negative) reviews saying the community was kids but that just isn't true. Maybe in 2013 there were a lot of kids playing it but they quit pretty quickly since they didn't have the patience to quest and grind.This game was made by a small indie developer over 8 years and I think they did pretty well. They intentionally went for the Runescape themed MMORPG. For those who are saying ""You might as well play WoW."" Well that is $15 a month and isn't what it used to be. For those who say ""You might as well play Runescape."" Well Runescape also isn't what it used to be. Eldevin is a great game to get the nostalgia feeling of an MMO.			"

												At first this game is absolutely fantastic. Crafting is fun at the beginning. However the more you progress in the game, the more tedious it becomes. Later on crafting is a lot more like work than fun. It turns into the most absurd grind I have ever seen and doubt anyone would have the magnitude of time and patience to see it through. But yeah, great game at the start. Just not something that is playable in it's end game. I played this game over a year ago and thought I should edit my original review which was far too positive, because I wrote it early on.			"

												Let me start off by saying this game is not for everyone. Just like RuneScape - this type of graphics, gameplay and controller is probably disliked by those who like AAA quality games.Personally I find this game really fun and really immersive. I usually get bored of all MMO games within hours because all they contain is shipping the player around the map and end game content. Not Eldevin.Upon minutes of entering the game and walking through the tutorial, I got lost in the map with no consequences. I ended up in a city where I got adopted into a homeless gang through a subquest which escalated to helping cleanse a city from plague and assasinating a poor old man for no reason what so ever. The extreme amount of quests and the game not punishing the player for wandering around the map and picking up random quests is what makes this game amazing.I definitely reccomend it!			"

												Other reviewers have provided solid reasons to like or dislike ths game, however a few small things through a small amount of play have me intrigued.A bit of cleverness and curveball in some of the quests. You can tell that writing and story are important to the devs, and as such you're rewarded better than the usual outing. Its no TSW, but certainly a far better focus on story than most.Open-skill, classless system of advancement. While the levels still tick up traditionally, there are no hard-and-fast rules on who can do what. Personalization is fantastic.Lots of crafting and lots of evidence that ideas like progress and advancement have been re-thought in certain interesting ways.The biggest issue I have is the click-to-move. It kills me.			"

												One of the best F2P MMOs I have played in years. Pretty much one of the best MMOs I've played in a long time. Has the heart and charm of old Runescape with gameplay similar to WoW. People have complained about the graphics being bad but I believe the graphical style of the game add a ton of charm. One thing I think Eldevin does really well is that is very simple in a good way. MMOs now adays are overly complicated and convoluted. I hope the develpers keep the game the way it is in terms of graphics and gameplay because I believe there's something special here.			"

												Are you an older gamer?Do you remember the classic MMO's like Everquest?Or perhaps you are just a fan of the older games that was more about Gameplay then pretty graphics...Eldevin is one of these types of games, it is a free to play MMO that got its start as a browser game but it is now run on its own engine since coming to steam and is quite fun to play...I will talk about what I have seen so far. The launcher is simple and works but does need more work as sometimes it can become buggy, Character creation is pretty simple too but it works, remember this game is NOT about prettty graphics but instead ""Gameplay""!There are a great many of quests to do and some of the story related ones can be quite interesting if you take the time to read them, there are also plenty of side quests that some will skip through to ease the grinding... About the grind, there is a lot of it and most is good if you approach it the correct way such as the crafting system, it is bery robust and lots of depth. You can do prospecting, fishing, cooking, weaponsmithing and armorsmithing and severl more. The way it works is that each time you do something like mining ore it levels up, and so far I have come to see that you can make some really nice gear that you can sell to other players for a decent price.There is plenty of things you can do solo if that is your style, but there is also a pretty nice community of veteran players who will be happy to help you out if you ever want to group up and do some of the cool dungeon quests, some of them can get you some nice rewards such as gear and relics.Overall I would have to say that this is a decent MMO that will only get better as they keep working on it, as it is now there is tons of content to play with and just might find yourself addicted to it :-)			"

												Coming from someone who played oldschool runescape, early WoW and almost every other F2P MMO out there to date..I really enjoy this game. 1. You are completely free to do whatever you want, whenever you want ( just like runescape )2. Many professions, items scaled for each profession as you gain levels in it3. The class tree is basically like Runescape, but better.. and here's why  - You start the game, and during the tutorial you're taught basic MEELE, MAGIC, RANGE skills      then from there on out, you level and spend attributes to whatever you want to increase in     There are talent trees aswell, about 7 of them but you're free to mix them up, ( half points into assasin, and/or mage )     Very free to build yourself the way you want ( Like Skyrim )4. Player base is huge, friendly community, since i've started i've been asked if I wanted help several times from       higher level players.5. Eldevin has been quoted that even though you can pay to gain advantages ( xp boost, profession xp boost )    EVERY ZONE IN THE GAME IS FREE TO EXPLORE for FREE or PAID players and it's staying that way.    This is NOT a P2W game.6. There is PVP, group dungions, solo dungions, great replay value, and grinding is funNow those are just some of the great things in Eldevin.. Here's what will drive some people off right away..1. Bad graphics ( for the average mmo out today ) BUT That goes without saying, it's gameplay is much better than almost every other MMO out today. If you liked Runescape and that playstyle you WILL love this game.2.WASD is in motion, yes you can click on the map to go somewhere, or even right infront of you just like runescape,    Although WASD is much more comfortable to use, it is a bit clunky and should be refined abit more.Hope I helped someone make a decision. I don't normally do reviews ( maybe 1 before this ) but I used to look at games thinking oh that looks good, then read 1 bad review and never look at it again.. well I suggest you try it out for yourself, I did and I do not regret it at all, I'll be playing this for a long time.. If you decide to join, add me as a friend *Koz*			"

												Nobody will care about this review, that is most likely, but here on my thoughts on the game.Starting with the pros and cons.Note: THIS IS MY OPINION.Pros:Decent GraphicsCombat Syrtem is pretty goodStory is okay, but could be better.Dialouge is okay.Cons:Controls break after you get off of the game and get back on it. This is my personal experience. I got off the game, got back on it, and WASD and the spell numbers would not work. They litterally would'nt work, I had to click to move and use spells.Character Customization is not the best. You cannot make your own face and you have to choose from ugly faces.Also, this might not really be major, but the graphics. I said they were decent, but for a 2013 game? Come on, Hunted Cow!That is my opinion on this game, but the main reason for my thumbs-down rating is for the controls breaking.Thanks for reading.			"

												After 8 hours, I review.First of all, DO NOT JUDGE A BOOK BY IT'S COVER. This game has an engaging, imaginative storyline, a class-less combat system, a whole mess of crafting, all in a very large world.The graphics...are terrible. I'll say that right now. But graphics shouldn't matter for a gem like this. If you liked OLD runescape, when it was good, play this. If you want nostalgia, play this game.There are a few bugs, mainly around using WASD to move making your toon move at a crawl or suddenly switch directions or teleport a bit, but I've quickly gotten used to a diablo-style playstyle instead of a rift or SWtOR kind. (FIXED!)All in all:Gameplay-8.5/10Story/lore-9/10Combat-9/10graphics-5/10nostalgia-10/10OVERALL-9.5/10, VERY good, I definitely recommend this to just about anyone.			"

												This game is a neat little gem on steam. I've played this game ever since it came out on Steam and I have to say, even though the playerbase is small, the graphics are a bit outdated and even though I have taken multiple long breaks from this game.....it just always seems to bring me back to it and I enjoy it every time it does. All I have to say is:  don't let the small playerbase scare you away from this game. The community is nice and helpful, heck if you join a guild, you'll form a friendship with other people and it'll feel less lonely and you'll quickly forget how small the playerbase can be.I will give a word of warning though, avoid Trapper's Atol unless you plan to do pvp, there are many players complaining about getting killed at this place despite it being a pvp island. It's a small part of the game so avoiding it wouldn't affect your experience of Eldevin in any wayGive this game a try, after all it's free and the ony thing you lose by playing is the time you used to playing this. I won't guarantee you will like this game, after all everyone has their own preferences, but I do highly recommend this game.			"

												This game is fun and highly enjoyable. If you judge on graphics, you're really only just scratching the surface. For a free MMO (well, mainly free, there is certainly an P2W aspect in here but it's mainly ignorable) this game has a lot of content and a lot of things to sink your time into, especially with a few friends. With a huge skill tree system and no locking into classes, the amount of customisation available to you from the offset it vast and interesting. Although the basic roles offered in most MMOs are also present here - Damage, Tank and Healer - there are other ways to really customise your character and class as much as you would ever want to. There are lots of things to do on the map, such as dungeons, and the professions system is quite in-depth and enjoyable. While there is a lot of grinding, the grinding in this game is among the most enjoyable I have ever had. Overall I would give this game about an 8/10 so far			"

												This game is pretty good, at the start its pretty boring but once you get past a certain point its starts getting better. The game itself can be controlled 2 ways. One, is your standard mmo style play. Second, you can even play the game runescape style, arrow keys to rotate the camera and click to move. Which i thought was neat. As ive played runescape for a good 7 years. This game is similair to runescape. But with a better community. For example, I made 2 characters one was going to be a female assassin, the other a male mage. And both of those characters Ive had people help me get better gear. Even with the small player base the people in the game are VERY helpful and giving. Not once did I ask for anything. So all in all its a pretty good game. Join in on the fun!			"

												Certainly interesting, very first impression is that it reminded of early 3d Runescape. I had 21 hours pre-Steam, and reached only level 14 because it is very difficult to figure out how to gear up, and the lack of an AH makes it a good survival-solo/small group game!			"

												There is something to be said for games following closely to older game models. This game does it well. It feels like I'm a kid again, playing games like Dungeon Siege, only in a fast-loading multiplayer world. What strikes me is that not only does it have that feel, it feels right because all of the controls are quick and responsive. It doesn't exactly feel like you're just playing animations, but instead, doing things. Pretty refreshing. My only complaint is that you can't put the game in fullscreen. Aside from that, cute game, I give it a 8.5/10.			"

I hope lots of people play and like this game because its plays nicely(on my pc) and please remember people, graphics dont make a game!			"

												The severely limited character customization doesn't matter so much to me in a game where, in play, my character is the size of something I used to stick on the eraser end of a pencil when I was in grade school. And what little I saw of the game's story did look kind of interesting, ignoring the ""my character has some kind of amnesia"" detail (you learn this in the tutorial, so I'm not spoiler-warning it). Amnesia is as much of a stock video game thing as, well, elves in fantasy games, and I still play those.Having nosed around the game for a bit, I can say that Eldevin didn't actively do anything to turn me away, it just wasn't what I was looking for right now. It's on my ""maybe try again later"" list. So since it's free-to-play I'd say it's something to at least try if it looks intriguing.[Edited: for clarity.]			"

												Played for an hour and some change. Combine some features from this game and RuneScape and you'd have a pretty intriguing RPG. It was very attention grabbing, the combat was way more entertaining than that of Runescape. That being said the two games are similar feeling. Overall, it was a fun play (for about an hour), but sadly its population is nearly dead and ""running on fumes"", it has potential, but there are way better funded and more populated mmorpg games out there. Still it's worth at least a try and can kill some time. The graphics are dated even compared to ruinscape. For me the very low population is what kills it. If you're looking for a fun rpg to pass time and aren't really serious about pvp or playing with large scales of people,  or even seening a bunch of people in game, then this game would be perfect for you. If the population would pick up this could be a long term dive. Features a classless system, with attribute points and talent trees which boost certain skills power and gives you unique to tree passives. Also an in-game cash shop featuring items such as exp boosters and cosmetics. Unlike Runescape, this game does have mounts. Also various crafting and gathering skills.			"

												I had 25 hours in this game on my old account and have just started playing again. It is a great runescape-esque mmo with tons of quests and tons of skills to level.It is fun to run around, trade with players, and find people to raid harder dungeons with. The only issue is that this game has virtually no playerbase.My first day back I met someone who crafted me some gear and ran around with me for a bit, but after that there was nothing. With less than 100 people playing a day it isn't as good of an experience as it could be. If this game was revamped and could gain a surge in players, then it would be a great time.As of now I've been enjoying leveling skills and completing quests by myself and with the few players that do play, but will probably stop playing soon (again). Overall a fun game if you enjoy some aspects of runescape, but with more easy to handle mechanics. A lack of players makes it undesirable as an mmo to play these days though, which leads to a downwards spiral of even less players.			"

												A really great under appreciated MMO!Despite this games low population, the community that exists is very social and friendlyand I recommend you join a guild if you want to get the most out of the social aspect of this game.But the low population doesn't kill this game, the enjoyable quests and interactive environments breathe plenty of life in it and make this game heaps of fun even playing it solo.Has taken some of my favourite aspects from other MMOs and combined them brilliantly, the graphics aren't outstanding but for a browser based MMO it is pretty impressive.If you're looking for an alternative to RuneScape or just want to try something new, I 100% recommend you give Eldevin a try, 8/8 m8.(Ignore my steam gameplay hours as I play this in my browser because it runs better on my laptop)			"

												I see so many bad reviews for this game lately and i have a strong feeling those are false.Lets make a list:1) The game works since i'm actually playing it and there are many players around, actually more then when i'v started playing (more then an year ago).2) Has nothing to do with no man's sky (this statement was actually so random...).3) It's not heavy demanding for pc specs, i actually play it on my old laptop with only 2gb RAM.This is by all means an old looking game, smooth, fun, with so much grinding you want to put in it. Perfect game to play as a distraction when talking with friends but with a decent story and challenging opportunities. Real money are not needed to play and the store contains just vanity items and a few bigger bags that you can easily opt out.You need to like this genere to like THIS game, but if you do, this can give you a well spent time.If you have extra money to spend, i suggest getting the Deluxe Pack for supporting the developers (they are really working on the game), the very usefull bag and the mount (with licence that works with all your character).Have fun and remember to be honest in your reviewes.

And I am still playing it. There is no lag no strange weird flashing ads while your playing almost like Mabinogi but here human is only race they offer, and they offer story gameplay and finishing it by questing which makes sense. Your a well that would be ruining the story. for my rating system it have 17/20.

That the game was  INDEED  badly optimized and that if you limit the framerate at 20fps, never look at the sky it should be ""playable"".Pretty sad. I wanted to sink countless hours into it.

												HUGE EDIT Okay I've played this game a bit more, learned about it & I've decided to change my rating because of this one fatal flaw that completely ruins the game. YOU HAVE TO PAY TO RESPEC or wait 2 months!  Yes, that one little but HUGE flaw is making me not want to bother playing this game anymore.  Any game that emphasizes class customization makes you WANT to try out all the different specs that you can & this is just plain exploitation of their own system to FORCE you to pay money to try different things & for that I am saying NO.If the game ever gets rid of this pure exploitive tactic then I may come back, until then I'm staying away.REVIEWNow before I start my review let me just say that a lot of people are comparing this game to Runescape & saying it's just a clone.  While this game & Runescape have a few things in common they are both completly different as a whole.  Now, with that said let's get on with the review.GRAPHICSLet me begin with the games graphics since it will be the first thing you see about the game.  The graphics aren't anything amazing or ground breaking but they do have their own unique feel.  It resembles oldschool RPG's like Morrowind & Neverwinter while pulling off it's own look in between.  There are some things I wish the game had graphics wise, however.  The game does have a day/night cycle but this feels like it's simply achieved by a slight contrast change.  Half the time you won't know if it's night or day unless you use the /time command which will bring up the current in game time.  Another thing I wish this game had would be a sun or a moon.  If you choose to bring the games camera down to OTS level you will notice the sky is bland & lifeless.  There is also no real time shading in the game.Just because the graphics aren't great doesn't mean this game doesn't look good because it does.  It also feels alive in the scenery that you will see change depending on the time of day.  Some civilian NPC's have their own schedule & at evening to late night hours you will see the taverns start filling up with people.  They will even start having their own conversations while doing their daily activities that you can eavesdrop on.  The ones I've seen so far have been guards talking while on patrol & drunken men flirting with barmaidens.  This small feature alone brings out a lot more life to the game. GAMEPLAYThe game can be played in 2 different ways.  Point & Click or WASD style.  So, if you prefer the top down camera point & click style ARPG you can play it that way.  If you prefer the OTS camera & walking with WASD you can do that as well.  You can seemlessly move between the 2 styles.  All & all it feels good & responsive.  The animations in the game are lacking, however.  They are simple, smooth & get the job done.  They aren't flashy like most MMO's are doing nowadays..  You won't see any moves that involve jumping around while attacking but you will see your character go into a solid stance.  When you attack it feels a little too quick.  Melee animations consist of quick swipes or jabs sometimes several per second that make it seem like your character is on speed or had too many energy drinks.   I do like the emotes a lot, though.  If you get your character drunk he will stumble around or vomit on himself.  It's pretty funny & probably worth playing the game to see that emote alone.My only real complaint is no matter how much I push spacebar it never jumps.  :'(CRAFTINGThis game has a ton of crafting.  If you like games where you can spend hours upon hours of just crafting then you will probably enjoy this game.  I myself have already spent the majority of my game time doing nothing but crafting.  The best part is you can master all the crafts the game has to offer, so you will be busy for a while.The game has weapon & armor smithing, cooking, leatherwork, jewelcraft, alchemy, tailoring, etc.  Every craft has it's own gathering profession. All of which are available to master.CLASSESThis game utilizes a custom class system.  In short, you are what you want to be.  And I don't mean you are what you want within the games limits.  You are what you really want.  If you want to be a Battlemage in heavy plate you can do that.  If you want to be an archer with a big 2h weapon you can do that too.  This game's class system is possibly one of the coolest in any MMO I've played.You earn points each level & you can put those points into Health, Mana, Melee, Range, Magic, & Crit/Accuraccy,  It's very easy to build a pure style or hybrid class.  If you plan on trying to do all 3 rolls you may have a harder time.  All equipment also increases these stats varying depending on what type of equipment you use.  There are also 6 Talent Trees.  Templar(Shield), Warrior (2H), Assassin (Dual Wield), Ranger, Mage & Prophet (Heals).  These trees each specialize in a specific weapon or spell type & gives passive/active abilities depending on which weapon/armor/spells you plan on using. The best part about this game's class system is how you go about learning spells/abilities.  You simply buy a scroll from a trainer & learn it.  You keep the ability you purchase forever as well.  Respecs are just for points & talents.  The more powerful spells for each class are in the talent trees which you have to unlock by putting in points.  OVERALLIt's got a great oldschool vibe with a mix of modern day elements & manages to also do some things other games haven't done before.  If you're aching for an old school RPG or MMO experience without the subscription then you should check this one out.  I would recommend downloading the game client outside of STEAM, though.  I was having some wierd bugs running the steam version & all of that went away when I used the install from their official website.			"

Some civilian NPC's have their own schedule & at evening to late night hours you will see the taverns start filling up with people.  They will even start having their own conversations while doing their daily activities that you can eavesdrop on.  The ones I've seen so far have been guards talking while on patrol & drunken men flirting with barmaidens.  This small feature alone brings out a lot more life to the game. GAMEPLAYThe game can be played in 2 different ways.  Point & Click or WASD style.  So, if you prefer the top down camera point & click style ARPG you can play it that way.  If you prefer the OTS camera & walking with WASD you can do that as well.  You can seemlessly move between the 2 styles.  All & all it feels good & responsive.  The animations in the game are lacking, however.  They are simple, smooth & get the job done.  They aren't flashy like most MMO's are doing nowadays..  You won't see any moves that involve jumping around while attacking but you will see your character go into a solid stance.  When you attack it feels a little too quick.  Melee animations consist of quick swipes or jabs sometimes several per second that make it seem like your character is on speed or had too many energy drinks.   I do like the emotes a lot, though.  If you get your character drunk he will stumble around or vomit on himself.  It's pretty funny & probably worth playing the game to see that emote alone.My only real complaint is no matter how much I push spacebar it never jumps.  :'(CRAFTINGThis game has a ton of crafting.  If you like games where you can spend hours upon hours of just crafting then you will probably enjoy this game.  I myself have already spent the majority of my game time doing nothing but crafting.  The best part is you can master all the crafts the game has to offer, so you will be busy for a while.The game has weapon & armor smithing, cooking, leatherwork, jewelcraft, alchemy, tailoring, etc.  Every craft has it's own gathering profession. All of which are available to master.CLASSESThis game utilizes a custom class system.  In short, you are what you want to be.  And I don't mean you are what you want within the games limits.  You are what you really want.  If you want to be a Battlemage in heavy plate you can do that.  If you want to be an archer with a big 2h weapon you can do that too.  This game's class system is possibly one of the coolest in any MMO I've played.You earn points each level & you can put those points into Health, Mana, Melee, Range, Magic, & Crit/Accuraccy,  It's very easy to build a pure style or hybrid class.  If you plan on trying to do all 3 rolls you may have a harder time.  All equipment also increases these stats varying depending on what type of equipment you use.  There are also 6 Talent Trees.  Templar(Shield), Warrior (2H), Assassin (Dual Wield), Ranger, Mage & Prophet (Heals).  These trees each specialize in a specific weapon or spell type & gives passive/active abilities depending on which weapon/armor/spells you plan on using. The best part about this game's class system is how you go about learning spells/abilities.  You simply buy a scroll from a trainer & learn it.  You keep the ability you purchase forever as well.  Respecs are just for points & talents.  The more powerful spells for each class are in the talent trees which you have to unlock by putting in points.  OVERALLIt's got a great oldschool vibe with a mix of modern day elements & manages to also do some things other games haven't done before.  If you're aching for an old school RPG or MMO experience without the subscription then you should check this one out.  I would recommend downloading the game client outside of STEAM, though.  I was having some wierd bugs running the steam version & all of that went away when I used the install from their official website.			"

												50 hours in-game:Eldevin is a addictive, slow-paced and story-driven MMORPG that is similar to Runescape 2 in many aspects.You have a freedom of choice when it comes to using your talent points and building your character - You can pick any role and switch later on. When starting out, you are given a bunch of quests - In fact, more than you need to level up. Quests require a lot of travel and in order to do quests you need to have combat stats. It doesn't take long to level combat, but if you just keep doing combat you miss out on various loot and skilling (profession) opportunities - there being 14 different professions.Professions can be tedious to level up because of slow animations (that you have to wait for), having too little inventory space, requiring a lot of travel and the materials costing too much at least early on. The sell price for most items is too low; you are constantly low on cash if you decide to use the materials you find for training professions. Only quests seem to reward a good amount of money at least at lower levels.Crafting professions can require 2-4x more effort to level up than a gathering profession. What I mean by this is that you'll reach the max prospecting level 3 or 4 times in the time you max Jewelry, Armorsmithing and Weaponsmithing. I think this is rather stupid - it's just a time consuming grind to get to higher levels of each crafting profession for almost no benefit.Even at higher levels, the time it takes to get to a level that matches your combat is better spent elsewhere. Instead of spending 10 hours to level 5 crafting levels, you could spend 10 hours questing and get 5 combat levels. Why should you do questing then? Because even if you get one crafting profession to your combat level, you'll only get that profession's specific equipment pieces; for example, a crafted heavy armor helmet to complete the set you just got from a dungeon, leaving rings/amulet/charm and weapons to be made with Jewelry and Weaponsmithing respectively. So yes, in short, the crafting professions feel useless and too tedious to level up.Getting so little money from enemies and items early on creates problems because you need money for repair and training a profession. For example, from a level 10 quest you get 2 silver - it costs 2 silver to buy 4 butter (buy from npc) to go with your 8 ham (skinning/loot) and 4 garlic (farming) that you need to make 4 cooked hams at level 8 cooking. Yes, that's 2 silver or 1 quest to make 4 items.There are a LOT of fetch quests with way too much travel; some are literally ""go talk to north, go talk to south, talk to northeast, talk to southwest..then visit these locations, but first go to the beach and then check out the very end of a dungeon"" type quests. The quests are all over the place (which can be nice, but not when most of them make you travel back and forth so much).. There also needs to be more item rewards in quests - The only weapons you get from quests (or anywhere else) at level 5-10 are either: one level 5 rare (boss or quest), level 6-10 uncommon (crafted) and level 10 legendary for legendary quest and then again you don't get any other good weapons until level 15. Crafted items are useless here too because they are all uncommon up to level 10 or at least worse than your weapons found from quests.The game is good otherwise, but indeed could use some improvements. I really like the soundtrack though, it's great. The graphics are good for a MMO of this type, but the game has some bugs. Your cursor can go crazy at random intervals because the game process starts to use more resources, your camera can start to spin in certain places and make it hard to turn it.The controls are great, being able to either click or move with WASD like in WoW, but it'd be nice if your character tried to get to the given location. Sometimes when you click, for example to move inside a tent through a narrow door, the character goes back and forth. If you move straight towards a small object, your character doesn't try to avoid it either.. I'd think it'd be nice if it did.The in-game mounts don't really feel like mounts with the small 20% speed increase at early levels and 60% at later levels. A small buff would be nice.add later:again a lot of travel from all of thisequipment taking a lot of space if you want to save some of it as a outfit for later - no huge equipment bags (like vanity)there is no auction house and no place for tradingactions take long to doenemies out of range even if in rangeevents for veterans missable by newer playersbecause quest starting points are all over the place and some quests are for the same area, its not uncommon to see higher levels in low level zones still completing some questsbecause of the reasons mentioned above, quests should be shown further to you on the map.soundtrack is awesome, but cannot be found anywhere.5 loyalty points per login for f2p - full loyalty set = 9000 pointsthere are some p2w items; subscription literally gives you extra exp, prestige, profession exp, removes gold cap (WTF literally)even vital skills such as skinning can get behind in your combat level because of so many quests at certain levels and not having enough space for quest items/skinning. this means you have to go back to lower level monsters and just kill them for skinning exp so you can continue questing with the ability to skin your level monsters.skill quests: for example level 16 giving tasks to get level 1 or level 8 gathering prof. items; can be annoying.abilities not powerful, animations take long which makes them very ineffective.certain abilities are broken and some descriptions are a bit off.at least the templar talent tree doesn't feel very optimizedno third skill bar for alt/ctrl/shift + normal keybinds even though there are a lot of skillslevel balance seems to be a bit off. lets say you barely solo a LV10 dungeon in story mode at level 11, then return after getting a new piece of epic boss dropped gear - you'll be able to do it without much worries.most boss fights can't be tanked, but have to be taunt-kited instead; really need some work here...need aoe marks on floor and clear indicators of what the bosses are going to do (this one boss on ""dungeon"" difficulty does 60% of a tanks hp on one melee swing and there aren't many healers playing the game (and if there were, they wouldn't heal much). this is extremely frustrating when paired with the movement / combat system of eldevinthere is an achievement for killing 100 000 players in the wilderness and another one for winning 2000 battlegrounds.this is just pathetic because no one will get those legitly; they just take too long. As a comparison, I, still at rank 20 rogue on my realm in WoW ( even though i haven't played for a year), I had 44025 honorable battleground kills and played 1438 battlegrounds.you have three options1) quest and only level combat, do not pick up profession items - your inventory won't be full at all2) quest, level combat and pick up profession items - your inventory will be very full quickly because two  4-9 slot bags aren't really helpful3) pay 10ecash and get a 64 slot bag a long with other goodies and have no trouble questing, leveling combat and training professions.why can't f2p system be more in between option 1 and 2? Legendaries take too much space for f2ps. whats a legendary item when it has to be sold to npc for 10 silver because you don't have 2 to 6 space for it?target out of range even if close issueinsane respawns at certain locations means you cant melee the monsters or you get overwhelmedI'll edit this later...

												*My play time is rather short as shown on Steam, but I have put about 300 hours into the game before writing this review. I'm no elite top-level player, but I have put enough into the game to have some opinions about it.Ok, on with the review...Eldevin is a fantasy MMORPG that does a lot of really good things, but these things aren't particularly new to the genre. And that's not necessarily a bad thing IMO.Many compare it to other games like Runescape, and that is completely understandable. However, once you start playing, you will see some stark differences. It's approach to the genre is more of a themeparky style with PvE raids and traditional PvP game modes. Grab some loot from these instances and you'll then see the game's emphasis on a wide crafting system in which you make some nice gear. You have lots of quests to do, many of which are fetch-quests, but there are some nice cutscenes that propel the story forward. As either a sword-n-board tank, ranger, healer, warrior, mage, or hybrid build, you'll definitely have some quests to do. I must also say that this game is pretty on the eyes. Yes, others may not be too impressed about this game's graphical fidelity, but the overal *aesthetic* is very nice. Eldevin used to have an isometric view like Diablo, but the devs worked hard to make it 3D since many of the players wanted to see changes. The devs are pretty committed to seeing this game thrive, as they are active on the forums. The community is nice too both ingame and on the official forums. In all, Eldevin does not introduce new ideas, cutting-edge mechanics, or innovative gameplay, but it does what it does very well. Based off of this, you might think ""Well, why should I play this, then?"" If you are looking for a themepark MMO that changes everything and flips the genre upside-down, then Eldevin is *NOT* the game for you. On the other hand, if you are searching for a solid title with grindy-yet-satisfying crafting, good combat with nice build variety, beautiful aesthetics, and on-point gameplay, this is the game for you. All it needs is more content to truly become a premier free-to-play MMO. I'll give it a 7.5/10.			"

												Solo gamers beware, this is by far the most frustrating MMO I have ever played when it comes to mob repops and aggro. You cant stop to take a drink or eat without the same mob you just killed respawning and attacking you. The game has potential but until they change the respawn times so they dont reappear within seconds the aggravation isnt hardly worth the continued effort.			"

												HUGE EDIT Okay I've played this game a bit more, learned about it & I've decided to change my rating because of this one fatal flaw that completely ruins the game. YOU HAVE TO PAY TO RESPEC or wait 2 months!  Yes, that one little but HUGE flaw is making me not want to bother playing this game anymore.  Any game that emphasizes class customization makes you WANT to try out all the different specs that you can & this is just plain exploitation of their own system to FORCE you to pay money to try different things & for that I am saying NO.If the game ever gets rid of this pure exploitive tactic then I may come back, until then I'm staying away.REVIEWNow before I start my review let me just say that a lot of people are comparing this game to Runescape & saying it's just a clone.  While this game & Runescape have a few things in common they are both completly different as a whole.  Now, with that said let's get on with the review.GRAPHICSLet me begin with the games graphics since it will be the first thing you see about the game.  The graphics aren't anything amazing or ground breaking but they do have their own unique feel.  It resembles oldschool RPG's like Morrowind & Neverwinter while pulling off it's own look in between.  There are some things I wish the game had graphics wise, however.  The game does have a day/night cycle but this feels like it's simply achieved by a slight contrast change.  Half the time you won't know if it's night or day unless you use the /time command which will bring up the current in game time.  Another thing I wish this game had would be a sun or a moon.  If you choose to bring the games camera down to OTS level you will notice the sky is bland & lifeless.  There is also no real time shading in the game.Just because the graphics aren't great doesn't mean this game doesn't look good because it does.  It also feels alive in the scenery that you will see change depending on the time of day.  Some civilian NPC's have their own schedule & at evening to late night hours you will see the taverns start filling up with people.  They will even start having their own conversations while doing their daily activities that you can eavesdrop on.  The ones I've seen so far have been guards talking while on patrol & drunken men flirting with barmaidens.  This small feature alone brings out a lot more life to the game. GAMEPLAYThe game can be played in 2 different ways.  Point & Click or WASD style.  So, if you prefer the top down camera point & click style ARPG you can play it that way.  If you prefer the OTS camera & walking with WASD you can do that as well.  You can seemlessly move between the 2 styles.  All & all it feels good & responsive.  The animations in the game are lacking, however.  They are simple, smooth & get the job done.  They aren't flashy like most MMO's are doing nowadays..  You won't see any moves that involve jumping around while attacking but you will see your character go into a solid stance.  When you attack it feels a little too quick.  Melee animations consist of quick swipes or jabs sometimes several per second that make it seem like your character is on speed or had too many energy drinks.   I do like the emotes a lot, though.  If you get your character drunk he will stumble around or vomit on himself.  It's pretty funny & probably worth playing the game to see that emote alone.My only real complaint is no matter how much I push spacebar it never jumps.  :'(CRAFTINGThis game has a ton of crafting.  If you like games where you can spend hours upon hours of just crafting then you will probably enjoy this game.  I myself have already spent the majority of my game time doing nothing but crafting.  The best part is you can master all the crafts the game has to offer, so you will be busy for a while.The game has weapon & armor smithing, cooking, leatherwork, jewelcraft, alchemy, tailoring, etc.  Every craft has it's own gathering profession. All of which are available to master.CLASSESThis game utilizes a custom class system.  In short, you are what you want to be.  And I don't mean you are what you want within the games limits.  You are what you really want.  If you want to be a Battlemage in heavy plate you can do that.  If you want to be an archer with a big 2h weapon you can do that too.  This game's class system is possibly one of the coolest in any MMO I've played.You earn points each level & you can put those points into Health, Mana, Melee, Range, Magic, & Crit/Accuraccy,  It's very easy to build a pure style or hybrid class.  If you plan on trying to do all 3 rolls you may have a harder time.  All equipment also increases these stats varying depending on what type of equipment you use.  There are also 6 Talent Trees.  Templar(Shield), Warrior (2H), Assassin (Dual Wield), Ranger, Mage & Prophet (Heals).  These trees each specialize in a specific weapon or spell type & gives passive/active abilities depending on which weapon/armor/spells you plan on using. The best part about this game's class system is how you go about learning spells/abilities.  You simply buy a scroll from a trainer & learn it.  You keep the ability you purchase forever as well.  Respecs are just for points & talents.  The more powerful spells for each class are in the talent trees which you have to unlock by putting in points.  OVERALLIt's got a great oldschool vibe with a mix of modern day elements & manages to also do some things other games haven't done before.  If you're aching for an old school RPG or MMO experience without the subscription then you should check this one out.  I would recommend downloading the game client outside of STEAM, though.  I was having some wierd bugs running the steam version & all of that went away when I used the install from their official website.			"

												This game lasks in graphic sophistication, but it otherwise pretty good. It is a basic MMORPG that one can learn to play these times of games with. It runs wells: my computer is seven years old with a failing graphics card and spotty internet, but it runs great. I am currently having an issue with the game where my character disappeared, but I believe this is an isolated incident and I would still recommend this game to anyone.			"

												I Really Like The Game!!! Thumbs Up For Sure, I Like All RPG Magic Games But This One Stands Out Its One OF The FIrst RPG's I've Played On Steam. For People WHo Haven't Gotten The Game Yet YOU SHOULD! I Really Like The Statistics With Leveling Up And How You Can Choose Alot Of Classses, I Also Really Like The Different Skills, Gives Me Something To Do When Im On My Way To The Next Quest (Fishing, Farming, Crystal Cutting, Foresting, Mining, Etc.).There Are A Few Things I Wouldn't Recomend This Game For. One Being Multyplayer, When I Play In A Group In Dungeons And On Quests Sometimes It Messes Up My Quest Goals And I Can Never Finish The Quest, (Like When The Quest Is To Kill Someone And Someone In Your Group Kills Them It Bugs Out And YOUR Goal Is Still To Kill The Guy That Your Partner Killed Making Some Quests Impossible To Finish). Two Being That There Is A SERIOUS Graphics And Lighting Glitch, I've Been Fooling Around WIth he Settings And Nothing Works So Please Eldevin Creators If Your Reading My Review PLEASE Fix This Because It Is One Of The Things That Makes Me Wanna Stop Playing.Thanks For Reading My Review And Remember That The Stuff I Meantoned Isn't All To Eldevin There's Alot To It And Its A Time Consuming Game. Overall Out Of 10 I'd Rate It A 8 If They Fixed The Lighting It Would Be Like A 9.5 xD<SPOILERS>A Few Things I Recommend Not Doing In This Game Is Exploring To Far Early On Because It Will Anoy You Later I Did It When I Was Level 6 And I Should Of Been Doing My Basic Quests But Instead I Went Into Eledevin West And It Was Very Anoying To Get Out Because It Was A Level 10+ Area, So To Make The Long Story Short It Took Me What Felt Like FOREVER To Get Out Of There But Eventualy I Did And I Learnt My Lesson. My Secound Thing I Recommend Is To Go On And Hour Long Skill Grind Because Stuff Like Foraging And Cooking And Mining Is Very Useful In The Future To Make Stuff To Heal You And Get Armour. My FInal Recomendation Is To Start Right Away With Doing The Main Quests Until YOu Finish Advanced Training For All Of The Different Groups In Eldevin Because You Can Get Some Useful Knowledge Off Of Those Quests That Helps Alot With The Little Quests!Review Will Be Edited As The Game Gets Updates!  Thx :)!			"

												If there were a sideways thumb, I would have given it here. I'm really just unsure about this game, I do want to say that if your looking for a classic runescape feel. This is it. I'm sure it's been said many times also. I played this game hard, I went on a binge for two days. It's addicting. I thought the game was new, but it's been out for a year. At launch, a year ago, apparently it was very buggy, but of course it would be. I just feel. for a steam launch, they should have cleaned the slate. The game is basic in terms of gameplay, which can be a good thing, however you can bow kite the hard stuff or tab target grind quite easily. I have heard bad rumors. 80% of players are bots. Crazy grind later on and for crafting. Currency is store gems, everyone uses this to trade items. You can just buy the gems and get all the gear you need. For pvp, i have not tried it. But I can assume ranged wins. I hear there aren't much for group dungeons. It is quite story diven, which means plenty of solo play. During my time, I feel that there were too many quests and not enough actuall slaying things. Give us spots to make a group and claim a goblin camp. Dungeons are instanced. It's not exactly freeform like runescape, i got fed up with city quests and went into the sewers, though I needed to do a chain of quests apparently and that's when I stopped playing. This game is still in beta, so a lot of good change is to come. Make a fresh server for steam bro's. Make a ruthless pvp server for the hardcores. (hey p1999 folks) Add in a jump or dodge skill, skillcap for this game is extremly low. Give us interesting classes, monk/necro/enchanter. I'd be fine paying 20 bucks at the front for a non free to play game. So, it's worth playing for a couple of hours, I dunno if you'd wanna go deep into the game.			"

												Best mmo out imo suprisingly for an mmo one of the things i enjoy the most about eldevin is the story although the gameplay stands okay on its own you will be sorely missing out if you dont at least try the story the graphics are pretty bad and can be ran on pretty much any craptop around also complimenting the craptop is the small file size which although means there isnt much room for complexity does make it easily accesible you know how i said that the gameplay would stand on its own well combat isnt one of the best examples it's stiff and robotic wait until your character auto-hits or use an ability or mana/health potion is all there is to it reallyone of the things that pisses me off is this you'll get a quest for level 7 wander into the area the quest guides you and on your way there is a level 28 enemy that wrecks you and makes you feel like a lvl 1 all over againif you need a guider it's like runescape but more story oreientated			"

												I decided to try this game since it was free and my ultimate feedback is this: the game is tedious. Like many MMORPGs, there's a lot of work the game wants you to do rather than actually play. COMBAT: Basically WoW. It's basically pressing buttons. Not much depth at least in the early going when first impressions are made. That is if auto-attack is off...if it's one, I think the game kinda plays for you. I actually wasn't sure what was happening when it was on: my skills kept activating. Anyways, you'll get levels like ""kill X of this kind of bad guy"" and it's all very typical. CRAFTING: You can basically craft a lot. I don't know how the ""player economy"" works or if there even is one but this is where a lot of the tedious works come in. I got a quest from the armorsmith to make a copper belt. Fine. I have to not only collect cooper which I can live with even. What I couldn't? Having to walk ALL THE WAY BACK TO WHERE I first ""learned"" how to make copper in order to mine it and then walk ALL THE WAY BACK. You know what I hate? Having to walk back and forth to places to basically run errans that the game sends me on.It's true I only played two hours but it felt like a lot longer simply because of how much of the game's content is basically just sending you places and back. As for the store, well if you subscribe you get extra XP gain and such so if it's not pay-to-win then it's pretty close.			"

												This is a very casual game for those of you who like casual MMORPGs. You have quests, skills, many stats, classes, spells, levels, mounts, weapons, armour, talents, abilities, professions... the list goes on with the amount of content in this game, much like most MMORPGs. It feels like a 3D version of old school Runescape. This is a game for those who can't afford to pay a ridiculous sum of money to Blizzard to keep your WoW character on the roll. I highly recommed this game to MMORPG veterans or newbies. 9/10. (All it needs is a tad higher graphic change, but story always overrules graphics, which this game has!)			"

												Pretty entertaining when it functions correctly. Something about it causes my computer to completely freeze up and occasionally unfreeze. When I manage to finally end javaw.exe it closes out of the game, and I'm back to normal (Maybe it has a problem with multimonitor setups?). Also when I quit Eldevin it doesn't actually completely quit; Steam still thinks that it's running because it's operating through Java. If they fix these problems, I'll re-download it.			"

Please, if the creator of the game reads this comment, contact me.  I want to understand what goes on inside your head, because I cannot possibly comprehend why you would waste your life doing this.			"

												Planned to play about 20min to check out the game before work... played for 2 hours instead and was late to work.  Highly recommend this game!I did play a little bit of Runescape and even though I loved all the crafting in it, Runescape just seemed slow to me. Hard to explain exactly but I just couldnt stay in Runescape for long. Eldevin in a sense is a lot like RUnescape but it has that ""thing"" thats keeping me interested. Story Line is pretty cool so far and even though im 2 hours into the game I still havent left the new player town because there is just so much to do and learn!!I love the fact I can use WSAD to walk around instead of mouse clicking, which drives me nuts in games that only have that as its way to move around (Runescape). I am Ultimately a ""Crafter MMO Player"" because I only play MMOs for the Professions/Crafting aspects of it. I love Crafting in any game and I dont care what guild im in, ill farm out whatever the guild wants because thats what I enjoy doing. From FIshing/Cooking/Forestry/Mining pretty much anything you can think of you can pretty much do in Edlevin and I love doing it in this game. I can for sure see myself playing this game for a long long time.			"

												So far I'm blown away. I love the Fable style use what you want to be good at system, also reminiscent of the Amalur game as well. Choosing between a path in Magic, or Melee and Archery or a mix of both. I have yet to get too deep into this game but it looks as though the character advancement is right up my alley being level based but with a lot of choices in allocating your stats and learning new spells and skills. I am interested to get into the crafting system and to see how my character progresses down the Sorcery line. It has a very sandbox feel, but with guided quests so you have an easy start to the game. The tutorial was well done and I even enjoyed reading the quest text. I'm hoping that this game holds it's charm as I continue to play. I recommend trying it, as it's free and feels a lot like older style MMOs specifically Asheron's Call mixed with a modern day MMO feel. See you in Eldevin!			"

												Totally rewriting my review.I don't know how, but this game is actually becoming quite fun.I can see how it might shoehorn me into a pretty specific build later on, but so far I have had success going glass cannon crit mage. So ~22 hours in and I can say that, although its very rough around the edges, once you find your way around Eldevin it becomes quite a joy to play.  I still haven't met anyone who I didn't like, so they are attracting the right community somehow so far.  I have two characters who are completely different, and I have barely scratched the surface of what Eldevin has to offer in terms of character building.I would have to say that there is a certain 3-way split in Eldevin's Talent tree that I have noticed:Templars, Warriors, and Assassins have beneficial talents which cross over reasonable due to them all being based on melee damage.Rangers are sorta stuck as a pure ranged class unless they really find a way to minmax there way out of a damage loss they will ultimately incur by going hybrid.  Mages/healers are pretty much the most capable of sharing parts of their talent trees due to the nature of healing being based on the same stat as magic damage ""Sorcery"".As for crafting...its a bit tedious, but its tedious in most games like this.  I will say that you can definitely gather enough resources to go afk crafting for a good half hour at least if you do it right.  Best part about that is you gain xp the whole time.  The balance of costs of materials and such is very tight.  You wont have spare money early on unless you really try very hard to earn it.  I enjoy the challenge, because there is some planning expected of the player here.Dungeons seem a bit easy when you have a full 5-man group, although they can be rough if you are all underleveled and utterly clueless as to how to use your character.All in all I still recommend this game as a 'try me out' mmo.  It's free, after all.			"

												If you're expecting something like Runescape, you're in the wrong place.It tries to copy some ideas from RS, but utterly fails to deliver any of it the way Runescape does, and in the end only looks similar on the surface. Eldevin is just like any other generic MMO. You fight monsters to level up, assign skill points to whatever class you want to play, buy/learn new attack skills, and then move to a higher level area to repeat the process.The map is clearly separated to sections for different character levels. As you move further from the main city, enemy levels increase and collectable resources change colors. You character level completely locks you away from certain places, because you'll be killed instantly by the high level monsters and you can't harvest any of the resouces at all. There's no low level stuff in high level areas, you can't even unlock new dragon travel paths unless you're high level enough, so good luck walking all the way back home because of this completely arbitrary limitation. For comparison, Runescape allows you to roughly do anything anywhere. No matter where you go, you're bound to find some normal trees and low level ores and enemies, different places mostly change in theme and type of content. Hell, you'll find level 60 trees next to your original spawn and level 70 ores 1 minute walk from there in Runescape, if you want to find something you need to actually find it, not go to any random high level area.Quests are largely ""kill X of monster Y"" and ""collect Z from N"", or ""talk to this guy on the other side of the map and then come back"". There's no character dialogue to make it interesting to read, so you'll be reading walls of text if you want to know what's going on. Rewards are coins and some generic items that may or may not go straight to a shop sell window. Not even worth comparison to Runescape quests.Some skills are sort of fun to train for the first hour or less, but then it starts to become a repetitive grind and you start to ask yourself why you're doing it again, especially because all the rewards are just the same thing with higher numbers attached to them and a higher character level requirement to use. No, you can't eat that bread unless you're level 47.Almost all crafted items look identical to one another, not to mention absolutely hideous. But you don't learn to craft anything new besides a very slight remodel of the same thing anyway.I was playing a mage, and combat was literally just clicking an enemy and then tapping the fire spell skill until the enemy died. There's a bit of variation in the skills, but the fire spell was the only one that was worth using.I keep coming back hoping that it's not as bad as I remembered, but it doesn't take 2 minutes to remember that my path is already laid out for me, there isn't a whole lot of options or variety when you want to do something.

												You know what? I'm enjoying this game. It has a Runescape feel without being all ""Buy. Stuff. Buy iiiiiiiit!"". You can be a Premium Member and get cool perks but you can also just do it the old-fashioned, free way and get a very similar experience. It's a quaint game with basic graphics (focusing in on my character's face never fails to elicit a shudder) and my laptop makes the framerate sporadic, but it's a nice time waster. My only gripe is that I wish that the map could expand to include all of my objectives, since with that feature not being there I find myself running all over the place to find someone who may need a quest completed or a place to turn a finished quest in.I recommend it if you want a basic MMO RPG to mess around in without being required to buy everything to get ahead.

I would still prefer a sub only option, but this is decent enough for what it's meant to deliver.OLD REVIEW---I loved this game until I saw it's an item shop cash grab. If you look on their main site they have a hybrid subscription system made to unbalance the game from day one. If this was subscription alone, I'd be playing this game, but you really blew it devs.			"

												*Edit* I have changed my review based on the new direction and updates to the game by the devs. The game is pretty enjoyable now, and the cash shop is only minimally annoying now. I would still prefer a sub only option, but this is decent enough for what it's meant to deliver.OLD REVIEW---I loved this game until I saw it's an item shop cash grab. If you look on their main site they have a hybrid subscription system made to unbalance the game from day one. If this was subscription alone, I'd be playing this game, but you really blew it devs.			"

												After deliciously played almost a year, I'll just say that this game is excelent. but now, the developers of this game have decided to hardly care for their player, not to consult them to make improvements ... and now between 25-90 players online daily (it's beautiful for a massively multi-player game) ... we can say that this game is totally dead with a total lack of update ... you can escape this game, especially pay nothing, it falls into the void.

												For those who are looking for a mix of RuneScape and WoW, then this game is for you. I played RuneScape ever since the release of the game, and I had only played WoW about 3 years so I can say this game relates quite a bit to both of the games. The game is free, however you do have the option to pay a little more to 'support' the game for some nice benefits. As far as graphics, they aren't that bad to say the least compared to the 'Old School RuneScape' graphics. However, they aren't as great as World of Warcraft's graphics. The gameplay is very fun and adventurous, and I haven't really encountered a lot of immaturity on here as I have on WoW and RuneScape. The community doesn't seem too big, but it is pretty big for a small game. I would definitely recommend downloading this game. Give it about 20 or 30 minutes of gameplay and I'm sure you'll like it.			"

												This is an amazing game, if you've ever played Runescape, this is like what Runescape would have been if it remained free and didn't have insane amounts of content members only.In Eldevin you can choose from 6 main character upgrade trees, but you can freely choose which tree to spend your talent points in. The map is enormous, and while you don't often meet other players (unless you are following someone, or you go to one of the popular spots), the vast quest system and varied enemies mean you don't need to find/play with anyone else			"

												So teh game may not look pretty compared tomost games out there, but don't let that turn you away. The gameplay is rather well done, the animations may be a bit rough around the edges but the actualy mechincs inthe core are quite nice. I personally like the hints ofinspiration taht thiis game ahs init fromallkindsof other mmos and rpgs out there. I would reccommendit toanyone lookingtoplay a nice game just free and casual withlots to doin it. Spent about 6+ hoursjust doing things inthe very first area you get putinto XD didnt have to but I did it anyway :p			"

												Ordered a meal in a fine restaurant and pub located in the heart of the kingdom.The service was great. Very polite and prompt. Not to mention some pretty cute servers.It was super expensive, though, so I decided to go with the Loaf of  Bread for 80 copper.After a few moments I can see the waitress coming with a steaming platter.As she comes over the platter vanishes in an instant. There is nothing infront of me at the table. As she leaves I notice my loaf in my backpack. Some kind of joke? No one is laughing, though. I decide to at least quickly eat my meal and leave this awkward establishment. I find myself forced to eat sitting under my chair indefinitely for some reason as I take a bite. Something is very wrong here. I abandon the meal, pay and hit the bar. Chugging 3 of their only drinks in less than a minute I lose consciousness and hit the floor hard. I wake up a few seconds later and find myself to be completely sober. Wicked stuff, cheap too. No one seems to mind. 10/10 would dine again.			"

												I REALLY wanted to like this game, but no. Just no. It is not fun, makes no since, way to many bright colors, and just everything about it is horribly not polished. If this was early acces I would under stand, but its not. It is its full realease but it is so bad. I thought it would be fun because it looked like a runescape type thing but it really isnt. I really couldnt find anything fun about it.			"

												So after seeing the good reviews on this, I thought I'd give it a go.First thing I noticed which is that controls are kinda bugged. Meaning you can't turn the camera angle and walk/strife at the same time. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Solution: I zoomed all the way outy and treated it like an isometric view game.I like the ""class"" system in this, based on weapons and stats. So I assume you could go half'n'half shield'n'board or healer and a DPS class. It would mean you're not doing as good DPS as the rest on your level though.The questing system won't allow you to go further into dungeons unless you have the quest for it. BUT even that failed, I killed the Hobgoblin, THEN for the quest to kill him, and had to do it again.Graphics are really dated, the screenshots on the storepage are very colorful and hides the bad texturing. But bad texturing is bad texturing. It's really dated. Very bad options for both video and sound.I'd tell you to go try Villagers and Heroes instead, it's better than this, but only marginal..			"

												This game is awesome! But needs to fix some bugs, like running and walking, sometimes the player animation, slows up, gets stuck to the ground and sometimes it brings you back to where you walked from, all the time! Please fix that! Players should allow to go in the water, and swim! and I am not sure about this one. If players can fly high/low as they please. If no, then that would be great to be added! Their should be other races, like dragons! And humans should be allow to transform! That would be great also! Please add this suggestions! and please get raid of the bugs! :/ they drive me crazy! I don't mind the grahics though, they remind me of memories long ago, playing few games like Istaria, and Draken Order of the Flame.I rate the game 5 stars! I would rate 10 if you added some of these suggestions, or at least get raid of those bugs. I'm sure others will like these ideas as well. I seen many, want some of these suggestions. In games.			"

												I really wanted to like this game, how ever it has far too many negative features that just plain turn me off from playing it.Starting with it taking minutes to check if it needs an update, no idea what they are trying to do but it takes much to long just to check if its current version number is not up to date.Run, as fast as you can away from any higher level quests, if you have not done lower level quests first. You will not be able to proceed through the game until you do the lower level quests. I got stuck and almost gave up, but went back and did the lower level quests, then discovered that the part I was stuck at was now working.The murky depths quest is one of these quests that is impossible to complete, and higher level areas keep literally pushing you back towards that area, saying you have to complete it first.One major problem with the game is its constant insistence to flip the camera angle on you to some random point of view. Every time you go to move, you have to readjust the camera so see what you are doing, very annoying. 99% of the time this can be solved by holding the RMB, but sometimes you forget. Whilst on rotation of the screen, once the mouse reaches the side of the screen, rotation stops, even though the mouse is still moving, another annoyance.Another problem is turning off the mouse, what possible reason would there be for that. My char just got killed and I had to click on a button on a pop up window to get resurrected, how do you click on it when you don't know where the mouse is. Next problem is the severe lack of storage space!Everything stacks in such small quantities, some as small as 5, just plain crazy because if fills up your backpack too fast to be enjoyable having to sell stuff that you may need sooner or later!You can apparently buy sacks and bags etc for real money, but I don't have any of that so will most likely not bother playing it much more simply because you have to constantly sell stuff that you may need, if they would just let you stack things in much larger multiples!Combat is crap, don't bother trying to move when fighting, it instantly stops fighting. And no dodge what so ever. Stand toe to toe to what ever your fighting and pray that what ever is close by does not decide to join the fight. Even non hostile monsters will occasionally decide that your hurting one of their buddies and then they all gang up on you, end result being a dead character.Crafting is painful, low level stuff requiring on average 10 of an item to craft some thing. So, you get to craft maybe 10 items tops, before having to run back and gather more of what ever resource you were using to craft with. Wonder if it gets better or worse at higher levels.Yet another problem is your gear keeps wearing out and you have to constantly run back to the local smith to get it repaired.Good luck if you decide to play it, but not for me :(			"

												I played Eldevin before it launched on to steam. It is a small comunity of people. Becuse its small and all the players there are max lvl of 45 (we'll get back to that) its hard to get a hand with anything. I think its do to the the bordom of being max lvl for a year now when the devas said they are working on it as well as an AH about 6 month ago and keep pushing back the date. The loading time to move from frame to frame is almost longer as it would take to fly from one side to the other side of the frame. I never got any good feedback form HC except for the one time they thanked me for posting the correct link to a safe mode after a big update that cause lagged. As a player I shouldn't have to correct or do their job for them. If you played the game before steam and wanted to switch to steam you have to do so threw HC as HC did not add a prompt to alert you that you need to transfer an old accout threw them and not via steam and you'll be stuck with a lvl 0 account via steam.

												Let me make this a quick review. When i first started this game, I felt liek playing RuneScape classic. And I Loved it! The huge world, full of secrets, Great Crafting systems, a lot to do, a lot to waste your time and money on. There are some small Issues, like the horrible scaling in PvP (you still get wrecked 2hit by higher Characters) and the Community is fairly small, but the GAME as a product is great. However...Talking about the community - well, it's fairly small, like I said, and this would be no big Problem. It could be a nice family-like community there. But there is a major Problem with it. Like getting in a new class at a new school, if you start there, there will be already formed cliques and groups. And dare you complain about anything or get beef with a player. The community will unite against you and start insulting and trolling with a rating 11/10 in the world chat. So you have 3 Choices:1. You keep your mouth shut untill you reach max level2. You yust say yes to everythign anyone else sais3. You get into an argument which will lead to mass hatered. YOur name will be remembered in this small community and you can forget any type of Group content.To conclude: This GAME is awesome. Tons of fun, tons of stuff to do. If you have Friends you can play with - do it. It's the best RS-like MMO you can get for free (and I mean FREE), as long as you avoid the community. The community itself ruins the whole game for me.			"

Monsters are preety cool but not quite unique.3. Map is pretty huge for the size of the game.Bad concepts1. No jumping or fast running.2. On occassion your character will move at this very slow walk with you getting absolutely nowhere.3. The interace is cluttered with useless stuff, that no one will ever need.Basically a really bad runescape clone.			"

												The graphics are poor, and the gameplay is very dull, but it's a great game if you like to explore vast lands of all kinds. The storyline isn't very original in terms of how it starts off. There are also a lot of times when the game would get really laggy, but I didn't really mind. Eldevin, in my opinion, is a game that has room for many improvements, but can be somewhat addictive.			"

												Similar to Fallen earth controls wise. Although most MMORPG games are like this, I prefer being able to just use the WASD keys, and my mouse automatically moves the screen and my character around without needing to hold my right mouse button or left. The story seemed kinda cool so if you like the controls set like they are, check the game out. But I don't recommend it to those of you like me.			"

												My first few minutes on this game consisted of changing the graphics options several times just for the game to have♥♥♥♥♥♥poor performance. This game doesn't have the graphics to justify the low fps i am getting on my laptop, it clearly has not been optimsed to actually be playable for low spec computers and to think most computers/laptops from 2010, heck even 2009 should be able to run this game from what the game shows. The opening sequence which is probably the most important part of the game as it sets you up for whats ahead is, AWFUL. This game has not had much love put into it in terms of performance and that is very clear. i would not recommend this game for first time mmorpg players, choose another one i promise you will not want to waste your time like i have.

												I came...  I saw...  I quit.The biggest issue with this game is the play control.  Using WASD and the mouse like most every MMO player out there is NOT what this game wants you to do.  Yes, is says to do so at the very beginning of the tutorial, but the game jerks you around when you right click the mouse to move, and once you're in a confined space (goblin cave will be the first time this happens bad) your character will run in slow motion for absolutely no...  ♥♥♥♥ing...  reason.  You can click to move just fine!  But I personally despise MMORPGs that require you to do that.  Awful graphics aside, terrible character animation aside...  the controls are what kill this game.

												Back to basic I would say. If you have never played an mmo, this is a good beginning to take your first steps in the mmo world, it can be played on basically any computer.The gameplay can be fun but in 2014 people may look for something different or better than Runescape, but rather than that, I just see an easy way to cash on some ""older"" concepts.. Scramble with Runescape, put it in a random order and you will probably get something like this.Conclusion: Nothing new, been there, done that. "

												First of all, when you open the game, it isn't automatically in fullscreen. You have to manually put it into fullscreen. Who isn't going to do that? That♥♥♥♥♥♥just bothers me.Second, the graphics are painfully ugly. Vanilla WoW looks way better than this, and it came out ten years ago. Yeah, I know it's an indie game, but the graphics shouldn't look like they were ripped straight from an N64 game. Someone pointed out that my point this point was invalid. I'm not one to normally gripe about graphics, but this is 2014. It should not be acceptable to release a game that looks like this when there is technology to make it look better.Character creation was far to minimal. No different races, no different factions, just humans with a few different skins, faces, and hairstyles. If I'm going to be potentially playing with hundreds of other people at once, I want a bit more cosmetic differences in our characters.Then the gameplay. It is nothing you aren't going to find in better MMOs. It was advertized that you didn't have classes, and instead selecting random skills to level. That could have been awesome, but the game wasn't good enough after the first quest to make me want to continue, and explore this.The second I encuntered other players, we all began to talk about how terrible this was.I did not want to play this for longer than I did, because it just wasn't interesting.

												Lovely scenery, fun quests and being self sufficient. This game is great with or withour friends. There is so much to do it is hard to get bored. It's like the updated version of old runescape but a little bit better. I know this game is in the process of adding more things and they are actually on top of that. They just added a guild feature which is great and everything else id fun. When I don't feel like questing I can cook and mine. The quests are fun not too repetitive at all. I whought it might be a p2w but I was wrong which is good. In the store you can main but some boosts or cosmetics which keeps it fair. Overall I really like this game and you should give it a try. :D			"

												This game is a lot of fun.  I know everyone is saying it is like the old Runescape and the truth is that it really is!  When i first saw it and was looking at the photos the old Runecape was the first thing to come to my mind.  Runescape was one of the first rpg games I ever played and was what got me into pc gaming and this game now Eldevin is bring back a lot of memories.  Its really cool!Enough about Runescape.Eldevin is ust an awesom game.  I woudn't say there is any one unique feature about the game but it is just a lot of fun to play.  It is easy to pick up and just get started playing and be susuccessful.  it has a really cool story line in it as well.  If you enjoy rpg games you should at the very least give this one a chance.

I totally recommend this game , one of the best f2p around here . One single problem is that you have to play with friends because it will be more awesome .. The world is pretty lonely tho'...			"

Sure the graphics look like♥♥♥♥♥♥but the gameplay's solid and in my case is very nostalgic and I'm loving every second of it. Definitely one of the best free games I've played in a while.			"

												Me and a few of my friends picked this up at the same time as a game to all play together. It's free, has quests and dungeons that you can do together, and we had a lot of fun talking♥♥♥♥♥♥to other players who tried to mine our nodes while we were farming. After a while though xp gain slowed dramatically and it finally became impossible to find space in our inventory and bank between quest items, loot, and profession materials. It became very clear that Hunted Cow wanted us to subscribe for extra xp gain and larger bags. I pay money for content, not the ability to hold more items or aquire adequate amounts of xp so as to avoid running out of questing zones and being forced to grind the same dungeon over and over until the next one opens up. However, I give this game a thumbs up because the time we had playing it was legendary and we reference it quite often, and the fun and funny memories make us laugh.			"

												Great music, vibrant world and lovely, nostalgia inducing graphics. You create your own class as you play the game, instead of being forced to choose a class you know nothing about before you've even entered the game world. Crafting is fun to learn and doesn't feel like a useless afterthought. The structure of the world is similar to runescape - instead of wide, empty fields forcing you to spend half your time running, you start in a compact zone full buildings to enter, items you can collect, npcs to give you tasks and monsters to fight. This game feels like a cross between old school runescape and old school WoW. I just started but I can already tell I will love it.			"

												I have to say I enjoyed my time with this game.  However, the dungeons, crafting, and  some quests drive me crazy. Dungeons, well if you are an uber damage type, I guess no problem. but if you decide to be a support type, the mobs spawn faster then you can kill them. To be it is not a challenge, just a stupid pain.  Crafting, if you want to make armor, gather, or prospect  going to TA is insane, People haul away thousands of mats all the time. Make leather or cloth armor, sorry you are screwed with a farming/crafting model that totally sucks. Most quests are a great story, then you run into the ""get me 10 bear claw"" types. Seems like 2/3 of the bears do not have claws. Gee, if you want me to kill 40 darn bears, let me know from the get go. To be fair, they have created a browser based game that is fun, but clearly is designed for a community a whole lot bigger then what is normally online.			"

												There are few MMOs these days that give you that undescribable feeling of MMOness. Since quitting WoW I've tried just about every MMO that's around, and haven't found anything that's given me a similar feeling of enjoyment and interest.That is, until I tried Eldevin. Although the graphics and music seem dated, Eldevin creates a strong sense of life to the world.One of the main problems I've found is that it lacks a large player base: often it feels like you're alone in the world unless using global chat.It is fairly similar to Runescape in its crafting, which is incredible. Very enjoyable.			"

Skilling to get better gear then going to completely annihilate monsters your level and beyond is a satisfying feeling indeed. Wish this game were more popular!			"

												The gameplay in Eldevin is fun, the graphics are ok, not terrible, not great and the story is enjoyable.While the characters and gameplay take some getting use to, there simply are not enough new players to do anything with. Everyone is soloing and ignoring the starter dungeons and group content. Which is fine, but for those of us who would like an opportunity to enjoy the entirety of the game, it was rather lonely.Please keep in mind that I did not join a guild, never visited community forums. This is simply my opinion as someone who grabbed the game and started playing.The character development is fine. However, as you begin to understand more about the game, you come to the conclusion that spending some cash in their shop is inevitable if you want to make any progress. You'll need bag space more than anything. This did not bug me, I do not mind investing in a game I find interesting and fun.In order to get gear in this game past level 28, you need to craft it, or be a part of a guild that will run you through dungeons as you move up and give you what drops. There isn't an auction house for advanced players to offer their goods to others on. However, there is no reason that you couldn't ask for someone to create items for you that already have the skill. I would assume they'd want you to provide materials.I went ahead and purchased the Premium Rhino Pack and Deluxe Pack here on Steam. They helped quite a bit and improved the experience. While leveling itself is quite easy, the grind involved in the crafting system gets annoying. If you're not a crafter, I would suggest joining a guild as soon as possible and making friends with those that have already gone through this grind.I could see an organized guild with solid crafters and dungeon runs doing rather well. All in all, I found the game enjoyable, but do not see it as a free to play game. There is some investment involved to get anywhere.Enjoy!			"

												very good MMO feels old school with new tech, visuals are old school but i actually like that aspect, the maps are a nice size and full of buildings and POI's at every turn. Lots of mobs to smoke everywhere, quests are nice they don't feel to forced or needed except if you want a story line and some cool gear. the crafting makes sense its not to redundant or ridiculous in its recipes, I have done clothier,farmer,cooking,and alchemy. so far i'm lvl 13 had a nice gent help me run a dungeon a few times and got me my mount with a full set of mage gear. folks and community is nice and helpful even in the chat most will answer questions and will team or trade. I have played a lot of fancy MMO's and never stuck around either because of paywalls, content was convoluted or crafting required the time of an actual day job. this game is as hardcore as you want it to be. I myself find the mage life a good one and hope to see the game move forward with more players. Hell its free why not.			"

												First Impressions: I never played RuneScape. I played World of Warcraft, LOTRO, Guild Wars 2, and many other MMO's over they years. This game feels like what I would expect Runescape to feel like, which is quite good. The combat is fast-paced, which I like, the music is standard fantasy stuff, and the graphics induce a sort of nostalgia in me that is just cool. However, if you didn't grow up with a computer, this might not be your game. Also, the camera controls right now kind of suck, but the game definitely makes up for it. 8/10, great game!			"

												(Please ignore my playtime) This game is fun, free, and it's a short download, you can run it on a pretty old computer, just have some good internet connection. PROS:-Unique storyline-Great quest, BARELY you would get the go slay five of these things-Gives an old MMO feeling-Fast Download-Good community (People were willing to help me out seconds after I asked)Cons:-Graphics are outdated (But it can be a good thing for old systems, your choice)-Combat is point and click-Some very useless weaponsOverall: It's a pretty good game, no micro transactions (as far as I know). Definitly should get it, it's a really short download. Really unique storyline, would suggest teaming up with friends and playing it.8.5/10 "

												I like the idea of this game and I support Indie developers but, I can see some problems.  Pixelated world (at least at the start.)  A little bit of lag (possibly my ISP.)  Sorry but, I must be honest.  I have an Alienware 14 gaming laptop and I can run much higher graphic titles at full settings so, I sincerely hope to see a possible patch or fix soon because I really want to play this.  I do like the small file size and the quick loading times are nice.  I would recommend this to my friends.  I know how difficult, time consuming, costly and especially frustrating creating something like this can be.			"

												I must say I am enjoying this more and more as I go along. I have even stopped my WoW subscription. So in short, I would definitely say you should at very least give this a go.On the upside, there are so much content that you don't mind paying the few $/month to be a supporter. Which will give you those points that you need for smooth sailing. You can learn all the crafts and skills. So you can switch classes and take up professions that works with that class without losing progress on anything. The crafting system has got nice depth to it and still makes sense. There are a lot of skills/spells for every class that allows you to build your character the way that fits your play style. You can even use skills from the other classes in your build. Missions missions missions. There are so many. Dailies that for skills, missions for reputation, missions for craft rewards, side missions and main quests. So if you like missions you wont run out quick. Alternatively, if you don't, you can still dungeon grind your way through levels easy enough.Finally, the community is nice and helpful. I have done tons of dungeon runs and never got called a noob or derp if I got stuck not knowing how to proceed when doing a dungeon the first time. People are friendly and helpful, which is rare these days. I am likely missing a lot of things I wanted to add here, but I am rushing to get back in game.There are a few hings that gets to me personally, like small stack sizes in inventory and a lot of back and forth running in quests, but I can also understand why this is so. It is not a pay2win, although it leans towards it. You CAN make it without paying, but it would be quite difficult.			"

												First Impressions: I never played RuneScape. I played World of Warcraft, LOTRO, Guild Wars 2, and many other MMO's over they years. This game feels like what I would expect Runescape to feel like, which is quite good. The combat is fast-paced, which I like, the music is standard fantasy stuff, and the graphics induce a sort of nostalgia in me that is just cool. However, if you didn't grow up with a computer, this might not be your game. Also, the camera controls right now kind of suck, but the game definitely makes up for it. 8/10, great game!			"

												Extremely fun! I expected a runescape rip off but it really is not. This is basically runescape, in-depth. Like take for instance the farming skill. Instead of planting it and waiting it to grow, you have to make sure the plant is watered well and you have to prune the plant if it gets diseased. This game has skills that are really fun to use. For example, the skinning skill enables you to skin animals for their meat,hide and skin. The leatherwork skill allows you to make armour with that leather. Also this game has classes. There are assassins, templars,warriors,rangers and stuff like that. Even through this game is not bursting with content, it is getting updates. This game has alot of potential. Recommended for runescapers who want something new. "

												So yeah i was a fan of mmorpg once. Then i quitted my first mmorpg and ever since i coudn't stop anywhere. All of them seemed so alike and i didn't have the money nor the computer to run world of warcraft. So i found myself jumping from game to game trying to find a mmo experience that woud fit my expectations and create that ""i don't want to stop playing this game"" feeling i had when i was younger - at least a small portion of it- .   Eldevin is exactly that game. It has great mechanics that resembles runescape job system a lot (which is great because runescape has a outstanding job feature). The character customization is poor but this game isn't focused on this minor contents like graphics. It's all about immersive rpg experience with great quest dialogues a good community overall and the possibility of real role play on an mmo experience.10/10 would fail college again			"

												DEV HEAR ME OUT PLEASE. GOLD RESPEC AND I WILL PLAY THIS GAME AGAIN.phew...this game is great, its like RS without crazy grinding, and you can design your hero stat wise, so everytime u lv up you can actually choose how u want to shape your hero.crafting is great although im not much of a crafty person, but i think its really important in this game to craft. or at least have a crafty buddy to play with. dung is cool, cb a bit buggy but alright, fun to play and fight lots of monsters and the loot are nice and link to crafting direct/indirectly. LOVE THIS GAME BUT ADD GOLD RESPEC NOT P2RESPEC AND I WILL PLAY THIS AGAIN.			"

												Extremely fun! I expected a runescape rip off but it really is not. This is basically runescape, in-depth. Like take for instance the farming skill. Instead of planting it and waiting it to grow, you have to make sure the plant is watered well and you have to prune the plant if it gets diseased. This game has skills that are really fun to use. For example, the skinning skill enables you to skin animals for their meat,hide and skin. The leatherwork skill allows you to make armour with that leather. Also this game has classes. There are assassins, templars,warriors,rangers and stuff like that. Even through this game is not bursting with content, it is getting updates. This game has alot of potential. Recommended for runescapers who want something new. "

												Lovely scenery, fun quests and being self sufficient. This game is great with or withour friends. There is so much to do it is hard to get bored. It's like the updated version of old runescape but a little bit better. I know this game is in the process of adding more things and they are actually on top of that. They just added a guild feature which is great and everything else id fun. When I don't feel like questing I can cook and mine. The quests are fun not too repetitive at all. I whought it might be a p2w but I was wrong which is good. In the store you can main but some boosts or cosmetics which keeps it fair. Overall I really like this game and you should give it a try. :D			"

												I'll admit, the graphics aren't really my thing. I don't mid old graphics if they're not trying to be realistic. But other than that, Eldevin is great. It's so big, and there's so much going on that you'll get lost and confused a bit. Don't play while tired, and it might be a little hard to find where you turn in quests. It's a little slow and frusterating to move around early in the game, but if you can get past that you'll invest so much time into this game. There's crafting, exploring, so many things, gathering, interesting NPCs, and just, so much. It's a gem, and I wish more MMORPGs were like this.			"

												I rate it 5/10 and here's why:The graphics are simple, minimal, solid, old-school and I love it. It's not too much, but it's enough. For the gameplay Eldevin has to offer, the graphics just fit right. The story is actually good. And I'm not usually into the lore of games. But I have read every single quest line and every single dialog that I ran into in Eldevin. I can actually feel my character and what the npcs have to go through and that surprised me. The writing is very well done. This is a huge plus overall.If you liked Runescape and it's leveling mechanics, you will love Eldevin. The crafting system is perfect in it's details. You can use any weapon, any skill, at any times. You get talent points and attribute points for you to shape your character. And the possibilities are very much endless. This game doesn't limit you. It doesn't lock you in one class and one class only. And I love that. IT IS NOT PAY-TO-WIN AND IT'S AWESOME.But, you might ask ""Why the low rating, if the game is sooo good?"". And the answer, my friend, is that for me it's quite unplayable. I have read through some forums and noticed that the problem is actually very common. It's the FPS rate. Holy poop does it annoy me. I can play games like skyrim on medium, sometimes even high settings with a smooth FPS, even though my computer is not that good. But on Eldevin the FPS rate has never been higher than 17. I have tried different settings, updated my drivers and Java and still it is awful. Whenever I'm in a big map, like the city, or some fields, the FPS is 6-9. Whenever I am near crafting devices - it's 4. Only in small caves or the sewers I get 15-17 FPS and whenever a quest asks me to go to that kind of maps I become a very happy little llama. Some players said ""you get used to it"". And you do. But when the low FPS ruins your game, by making you defenseless against a gang of mobs, that are 3 levels below you - it's annoying. So, to end my review, I will say that I do recommend this game. I do wish more people would know about this game. And I do believe that old-school mmorpg lovers will indeed fall for this game quickly. But I do warn you all, that the FPS might suck for some of you. And I do wish the developers would work their butts on that. It's not like we are talking about some bug or a glitch. We are talking about the game's PLAYABILITY.			"

												Me and a few of my friends picked this up at the same time as a game to all play together. It's free, has quests and dungeons that you can do together, and we had a lot of fun talking♥♥♥♥♥♥to other players who tried to mine our nodes while we were farming. After a while though xp gain slowed dramatically and it finally became impossible to find space in our inventory and bank between quest items, loot, and profession materials. It became very clear that Hunted Cow wanted us to subscribe for extra xp gain and larger bags. I pay money for content, not the ability to hold more items or aquire adequate amounts of xp so as to avoid running out of questing zones and being forced to grind the same dungeon over and over until the next one opens up. However, I give this game a thumbs up because the time we had playing it was legendary and we reference it quite often, and the fun and funny memories make us laugh.			"

												I have had this game a reasonably long time, and it is a very good game.But eventually I got sucked into other games and when I came back, none of the words on the loading screen would load, and since I couldnt see anything, deleted all my passwords and whatnot, so I have had to restart from level 40, which really stinks. Dont get e wrong, its a really good game, hence me recommending it, but I still felt the need to warn others about the loading screen bug.(Also anyone else whos had this problem and fixed it please tell me how.)

												I rate it 5/10 and here's why:The graphics are simple, minimal, solid, old-school and I love it. It's not too much, but it's enough. For the gameplay Eldevin has to offer, the graphics just fit right. The story is actually good. And I'm not usually into the lore of games. But I have read every single quest line and every single dialog that I ran into in Eldevin. I can actually feel my character and what the npcs have to go through and that surprised me. The writing is very well done. This is a huge plus overall.If you liked Runescape and it's leveling mechanics, you will love Eldevin. The crafting system is perfect in it's details. You can use any weapon, any skill, at any times. You get talent points and attribute points for you to shape your character. And the possibilities are very much endless. This game doesn't limit you. It doesn't lock you in one class and one class only. And I love that. IT IS NOT PAY-TO-WIN AND IT'S AWESOME.But, you might ask ""Why the low rating, if the game is sooo good?"". And the answer, my friend, is that for me it's quite unplayable. I have read through some forums and noticed that the problem is actually very common. It's the FPS rate. Holy poop does it annoy me. I can play games like skyrim on medium, sometimes even high settings with a smooth FPS, even though my computer is not that good. But on Eldevin the FPS rate has never been higher than 17. I have tried different settings, updated my drivers and Java and still it is awful. Whenever I'm in a big map, like the city, or some fields, the FPS is 6-9. Whenever I am near crafting devices - it's 4. Only in small caves or the sewers I get 15-17 FPS and whenever a quest asks me to go to that kind of maps I become a very happy little llama. Some players said ""you get used to it"". And you do. But when the low FPS ruins your game, by making you defenseless against a gang of mobs, that are 3 levels below you - it's annoying. So, to end my review, I will say that I do recommend this game. I do wish more people would know about this game. And I do believe that old-school mmorpg lovers will indeed fall for this game quickly. But I do warn you all, that the FPS might suck for some of you. And I do wish the developers would work their butts on that. It's not like we are talking about some bug or a glitch. We are talking about the game's PLAYABILITY.			"

 A Short Review for Eldevin	Eldevin has potentials in becoming one of the competitive and immersive MMORPGs out there. It's underrated maybe because of the lack of promotions for the game. The lack of players in the game also deteriorates the quality of the game itself. Maybe focusing on making the community bigger will make this game worthwhile. Despite the cons, it is still worth playing for.  Story - 6/10 (quite the average) Game Play - 9/10 (class and crafting skills) Audio - 7/10 (good ambience sound and background music) Graphics - 5/10 (not-so-great graphics especially the character appearance) Community - 3/10 (population is too low) "

												I just started the game and am enjoying it. This game is completely build as you go. There is no locked classes, however there are talent trees that go into class system. However your free to distribute the points into all the talent trees or just focus on a single one.   In addition there is a totally separate leveling system on the crafting/gathering professions.  The different gathering/crafting require grinding but that also means that crafters/gatherers are not a dime a dozen.  This makes the crafter/gatherers more unque rather then common.  Also there is no lock on amount of crafting/gathering so your free to make all your gear or just look for drops.  I enjoy this system because I am not required to have multiple characters to create gear for a single character.  Overall enjoying the thrill of creating a character rather then just grinding a character.  Majority of the quests are multi-path so a great bit of lore while also having small mini quests for additional coin.			"

												TL;DR: Recommended, still, because even with the devs out of the picture and the population somewhat...intimately small, the community is still good and the gameplay is too depending on what you like to do in a game like this and overall it would be insane to not recommend a game I enjoyed playing for thousands of hours...yes. ThousandS! I hope I´m wrong about the off Steam time...but I fear I am not :D____________________________________________________Depending on what class you spec into, your experience in-game will differ. Some classes can solo, some will have a really bad time without a party. That said, with the devs giving up on this game to pursue other projects, and the community being more based on nostalgia rather than new players, actually finding a party throughout the levels is going to be a challenge at this state. It was a challenge back at Steam release and that´s where the game reached some of its peak traffic. High levels can - and are sometimes even villing to help you, themselves or with their alow level chars, but if you don´t do the dungeons and quests with a party of your own levels, you will never learn how to play your role properly.  (Only dying a hundred times in Ohdar scar can really teach you a lesson in teamwork! :D)Overall, the best aspect of the game is the crafting/gathering system. That is the part of the game that has the very distinct Runescape feel to it, but alas only some items are even worth crafting and fishing for instance is a reason to become braindead in matter of hours. Whoever maxed fishing is a god damn machine! There is little PvP and since the classes are so poorly balanced for PvP, it sucks balls. Because some classes aren´t viable for PvP, people don´t play them. Because some classes level with more difficulty than others, people don´t play them. *cough* TANKS *cough* So yeah, unbalanced classes ruin this game a lot. Community had always been friendly - unless you are on TA in the middle of a PvP zone. You will die there. Don´t go there if you´re gonna be salty about it. PvE content is superb. I actually even paid attention to the story for once and I am a confirmed story-skipper. Quests/daily quests do offer some variety, but not TOO much. Dungeons are fun, because they are not easy and you can have high levels in your team and still get obliterated if you don´t know how to fight a particular boss or group of enemies. Instances/arenas are there...but meh. Nobody queues for them.Graphics are not everyone´s cup of tea, to me they always looked funny but I don´t really care about this aspect of a game. As long as it doesn´t make my eyes bleed - and it didn´t.The in-game shop is decent, not really P2W although some shady EXP pots and chests of gold are in there (ruining the eco with the currency a bit), but I like that they mostly decided to go with vanity items (basically fancy clothes), pets, mounts etc. that don´t affect gameplay. Compared to other, known P2W MMOs out there, Eldevin is just a couple items shy of being perfect in the F2P model. It didn´t bother me, at least. My advice is, try this for yourself. See if it´s your cup of tea. It would sure be nice to see more people around...might even make me go back to spend another thousand hours in this...oh god send help :D			"

Product received for free
												TLDR; Look past the dated graphics for a highly recommended game.A great game reminiscent of others like Fallen Earth and even perhaps Runescape, this rpg has a bit of everything with the great bonus of having a very friendly community. You'll see other comments stating the game has died, or that the player base is empty, but the few people around are the pinacle of a great MMO experience.Within the first few hours of playing, I stumbled upon a few other people, all who came up to me and donated gold and gifts without even knowing who I was. There are no bots, it is not pay to win and the story is enjoyable and reasonably unique.Definitely give this game a try (it's only a matter of MB to install!) if you are willing to look past some dated graphics and a small playerbase. Besides, each new player allows the game to grow, and the currently small online group means there is never any lag related to server-side issues.			"

												So, I originaly reviewed this product almost a year ago... after my 6 hours of playtime I decided that the controls were just a bit too rough around the edges (unable to disable click to move which messes up almost every action i try to take.. combat canceling when moving... I mean, who doesn't instinctively try to back away from something trying to kill them, lol)...Here we are, almost a year later, and every problem I had then, I have now.  I WANT so badly to love this game, but the disconnect I feel from the overall clunkyness of the controls is enough to turn me off.Very much a shame, it looks like it has so much to offer otherwise.  Maybe, if i remember the game exists in another year, i'll give it another look.			"

												I really like the concept of eldevin, the combat is nice, the skill tree is nice, the dungeons and raids are cool, and it feels a lot like runescape. I would reccomend trying it but to be honest I don't really play it. The two cons and reasons I don't play eldevin all that much are the playerbase which is very small and the skill system. Don't get me wrong the skill system is nice and has a decent classic mmo pacing from what I experienced but the problem is that all the skills feel the same. You gather resources for every skill, get the uncommon resources as well while gathering resources but not quite enough to process all your resources entirely, buy another resource from a vendor, and finally manufacture an item from the common, uncommon, and brought resource. This is literally the same for all of the skills except scribe I think and I don't know about scribe because it's not early game. This makes it feel repetitive doing any skill, smithing feels like cooking, jewelcraft feels like leather working, etc.The main story is ok but it also takes away from the sense of freedom and makes the game feel like it's putting you through grinding just to do the next story quest which I don't even want to do all that much. I don't care about the king, I don't care about the kingdom, I dont want to join the mages council crap, and I don't want to help the army. I know you could just ignore the main quest but quests are the only decent way to level up after level 9.It's worth a try but it has some shortcomings, it's free though so there's nothing to lose.

												A great game to play if you have friends to play it with. Maybe I'll write a better review later, but I just wanted to say that the only negative thing about Eldevin is the lack of players.

												Awesome game, with what feels like influences from early World of Warcraft, Darkfall, early 3D RuneScape and Guild Wars it would be impossible for any MMO fan not to enjoy! Strongly recommend to any one who was a fan of early MMOs, only downside might be lack of players - I'm not saying it's dead but I only saw a handfull of players but that doesn't mean it isn't busy, perhaps someone could shed some light on the active player base? 10/10 for sure!
