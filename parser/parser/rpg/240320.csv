												I Loved this game....  Up untill a week ago.  (No play time on steam, played through their client because steam was not working right.  You can download their client directly from www.panzar.us)The last patch made the game 100% pay to win.If you dont plan on shoveling out loads of cash to buy gear for each level range Im sorry to say, this game is not for you.Sure it needed some balance changes but overall the gameplay was very engaging and a lot of fun.  However, the crafting system needed a lot of work.  By level 15 it was taking me 50+ (5-20 minute games)  to get the components to craft the easiest pieces of my level tier gear.   The harder ones or ""epic"" items were clearly our of my range, needing almost 10x the ingrediants of their lesser version.  I didnt mind though.  I would just craft them as I played....However now.  If you want to craft an item you must collect almost 150% more materials and now have a 50% to successfully craft the item(which you can increase to 80% chance by sacraficing vital skill points better used elsewhere). Thats a 50% chance to destroy all the materials you spent days gathering (if you play a lot)Of course you could pay....  paying has 100% chance of success. I really hope they change this fatal error.			"

												The good : The gameplay is solid, the classes are all varied and each has their own weakness and strength.  Unlike many multiplayer games, this game is very reliant on team-work.  If your team isn't working together efficiently, you aren't going to win.  Plain and simple.  This is a game that I feel can truely be called a ""MOBA"" (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena), as opposed to games like League of Legends or Dota 2.  The variety of maps and gameplay modes put it into the higher tier of online gaming.  Something like 24 maps and 6 gameplay modes will give you hours of enjoyment.  While it might look hectic in videos and screenshots, after a few matches youll adjust and be able to spot enemies from allies easily.   The game runs smooth, and looks great in action at max settings.  There are some customization options with being able to paint all your gear different colors as well as some facials features like different hair styles, but that's where the downfall of the game begins.The bad :The way this game makes it's money feels very cheap.  Allow me to explain.  At the end of each match you are given X amount of materials like linen or gold nuggets or bark.  The amount you are given is based on your overall points in the match, which materials you are given is completely random.  As you level up, you are able to craft various sets of gear that add substantial stats to your character like + hp or +mastery (mastery being the attribute that increases the power your special abilities).  At first it seems great.  Level 4 opens up and it takes roughly a half hour to craft each of the handful of pieces available.  But that's where things start to suffer.  By the time you reach the max level (currently 20 on EU/NA servers) you are looking at spending, quite literally, WEEKS crafting the item sets.  The amount of materials it takes to create the top level gear is ridiculous.  So not only will you spend weeks grinding the materials, but you'll also wait additional days/weeks to actually craft the gear.  The ugly : In itself, this wouldn't be so bad.  Tweak a few numbers here and there and it would be no biggy.  But this is where the cash shop comes in.  You can flat out buy the same armor sets people will spend weeks grinding/crafting out in a matter of seconds.  While this game may not seem like it's pay to win at the early levels, once you hit the max level I assure you it comes down to two tiers of players.  Those that drop 40$ or so to get the best gear, and those that will spend weeks getting decimated while crafting it themselves.Many fans of the game will claim that ""skill owns gear"" in this game, and they are partially correct.  Skill plays a major role in this game.  If you cannot block properly or do not learn the telegraphs of specific moves, you are going to get creamed.  However, at a certain point skill becomes a moot point when you're attacking someone at the same level and same class yet he has 2x your health and does 2x your damage simply because he decided to outright buy the gear rather than grind and craft it.This is a very poorly thought out system and screams cash grab.  Combine this horrid use of a cash shop with the fact that the game (nearly a year after it's Russian release) is still riddled with game debilitating and breaking bugs and it quickly becomes a chore.  I have had sessions where within 2 hours of playing I crashed to the desktop nearly a dozen times.  Add to the fact that just recently it seems either their servers got hacked and it's simply a no go.Final thoughts :This game has amazing potential.  The actual gameplay is very fun, but everything else about it is bad.  Would I continue to play it if they hammered out all the major bugs and reworked the cash shop?  Absolutely.  But I cannot realistically see that happening anytime in the future.It's worth a try if you want to see what a real MOBA should play like, but not much more than that.  Gameplay I give it a 8/10.  Everything else I give it a 2/10.			"

												To be honest, this game looks and plays very well. It has some the most visualy impressive graphics i've probably ever seen in a free to play game. But while it looks pretty and all, the game's main issue is that it's a straight up money grubbing pay to win game. At first, the match ups are fair and, for the most part, well balanced. Everyone has an equel chance to kill and be killed. Sadly this can only be said about the early matches. After you get settled into the game and you think that things are going to be progressing at a fairly paced rate, like a good game should, you start getting matched up with people that are WAY stonger you simply because they invested some real money into their character. They get an enormous advantage over anyone who didn't pay for the in-game currency and ultimatly win. And when they win they win HARD! You'd initially think to yourself ""Eh, maybe it won't happen too often"" or ""its not that bad"" to try to make yourself feel better about your horible defeat. Then match after match, loss after loss you realize that it's a constant and reaccurring cycle that completely frustrates and irritates you to the point of hair loss. The only way to even have a remote chance to beat those players are if you happen to have one of those pay to win players on your team or you succumb to the pressure and cough up the dough. Either way you get screwed!Though this next problem might not seem very big, it actually is the very root of the pay to win problem. That honor goes undoubtedly to the dreaded item creation system. This game's creation system is one of the most sneaky and insulting kick to the groin! To create an item you must not only get a bunch of materials that are hard to come by,  you must also have a ton of money to then buy the item. In addition to having to buy the items at a ridiculously high price, you also gain a ridiculously low amount of money from battles which makes paying for items a really daunting task. And if you think that they could'nt possibly make it any worse you are sorely mistaken. It then gives you a wait period for your item to be made. And this could last for several hours to even days to recive the item you have worked tirelessly to get. The game's creators purposly designed it like this to push players to buy their in-game currency. Sure it rewards the ones that purchase the in-game currency, but they completly neglect and almost punish the players that didn't want to purchase anything and simply wanted to play a good free game. It can be argued that in a buisiness stand point a free to play game has to make some profit somehow. Which is very much true. But they fail to realize that it should be left as an option for the player to choose from without the fear of facing an unfair advantage. Many thriving free to play companies do this, and they have some of the most happy and loyal fanbases along with more than enough money to keep afloat (a good example of that is Team Fortress 2). This creation system takes away what makes the game fun for EVERYONE and just serves as something that stops it from reaching it's full potential.But of corse, credit has to be given to where credit is due. Despite it being a money grubbing machine, the combat is really well done and diverse (this is the potential i was talking about earlier). Each class has their own unique abilities and play styles. They all play smoothly when in combat and each of them have an important role to fill in the team. Wether you're the support or the tank, each one is equally just as vital to achieve victory. The character designs are very unique and interesting enough to keep you entertained for a while. The amount of attention put into the graphics is fenominal! The max graphics settings looks fantastic with the amount of detail put into the characters and battlegrounds. When it comes to gameplay and graphics this game passes with flying colors.Panzar is one of those games that i personally would not recommend, but if you think that you can get passed all of it's outragous problems or you plan to spend money on this game then go right ahead. play and enjoy this game as much as you possibly can. =)			"

												This game is one of the most fun games I have played. The game has balanced combat, good graphics, fun combat, and 17 maps.Sadly...The game is pay 2 win, and the developers try suck at pricing items. They ruined their own game with their terrible cash shop. They should have made the game buy to play, instead of some pay 2 win trash.			"

												This game is a massive money sink, it's 100% a pay to win game. You can buy levels, better items, more gold, basically anything and everything to increase the strength of your character can be purchased to give you clear advantages over players who have not spent any money on the game.Avoid at all costs.

												Prior to the latest update I used to love this game.  It has great graphics and is extremely engaging.  It used to have a good battle and loot system, and was reasonably fair in terms of the offered monetary VIP options.  However, the 08/11/14 latest update took all the fun out of this game.  Instead of the battle - get resources - craft items system it turned into an inbalanced roulette and an impossible grinder of a game, thus eliminating any incentive to play it.  The players are now very obviously squeezed for cash.  In my opinion this radical change will not only disappoint and drive away the dedicated players that have already put hours (and money) into this game, but will also scare off new potential players.Unless Panzar reverts back to its pre-update stage, it will not continue for long.

												This game has alot of potential and it's with a bit of hesitation I give this a negative review. It does fit into a category of ""pay to win"" because if you spend enough money on it, you will get a good character that runs over newer players.Pros;Good graphicsInteresting classes and abilitiesUpgrading Objects is a good ideaPurchasing Hairstyles/Facial Hair gets you more XP from battleCons;Mostly a Russian player population which can make them hard to understand or ask advice from.Half baked tutorial that could use alot of improvementMediocre sound qualityThis game probably caters to the Russian servers which is a shame, because there'd be alot more potential if they found a way to put a translator into the game, or found some other way to fix the language barrier. Interaction with some objects has to be a bit of guesswork at first until you find what combination of buttons works.Overall though it's still alot of fun and has lots of potential, but feels a bit exclusive to one Country.

												Re-installed to give it another chance and there literally is ZERO community left, so you will not find a game. I checked and there were a total of 11 people on. It's a shame because the art style and class mechanics make for some fun gameplay. There was some potential, but was completely ruined by aweful decisions by the devs and the servers were overrun by Russian players. Russian is fine, but it's pointless to allow the mixed regions. If they had properly supported the game for the NA region rather than dumping it with others, things could have been different. 0/10 Due to no chance at matchmaking, which means no games. Also DO NOT SPEND MONEY, it won't be refunded.			"

												The game is fun, a little difficult to get going and to really figure out what is going on.  Like most PVP games it really depends on the other people you are playing with.  One match may be a great experience while the next could be miserable.  If you like playing healing classes this game is quite enjoyable.  Healing is intense and very rewarding.  I recommend at least giving it a shot if you like PVP.  I have only just started with the crafting system but it seems pretty straight forward.  Could be a bit of a grind to get decent gear but being F2P that is what was expected.  I do though think that the paying players definitely have an edge as they can have the armor you are trying to aquire from the beginning.			"

												It's a Team Based PVP oriented game set up in a typical F2P format where players can grind to earn what they want or simply pay for it.  The cash shop sells a variety of items such as cosmetics, level ups, crafting materials & potions.  Currently the only game modes available are Capture Point, King of The Hill & Domination.  There is a lack of a server list & choice of game mode so you won't know what game mode or map you'll be getting into until you start playing.  Several different maps are available & range from small, medium & large & all hold up to 20 players or 10v10.There are 8 Classes Available Including: Warrior, Tank, Rogue, Healer, 2 Engineers, & 2 Mages.The warrior is just that.  A hard hitting force to be reckonded with.  While the tank hits almost as hard, he can also absorb a substantial amount of damage compared to his counterpart.  The Rogue (Or Inquisitor as this game calls it) is a stealthy assassin type of character that does bonus damage when behind his target.  The Healer is just that, & is almost required to win games. The engineers play both as support & damage roles by building useful tools for themselves & allies to use such as teleports, mortars & turrets.  The Ice mage is mostly a support role, freezing enemies so others can destroy them but can also do damage when she needs to.  The fire mage plays as the main ranged damage dealer, & is very weak at close range.Each class has their own variety of moves & gains more as they level up VIA the skill trees.  There are 30 levels total & 30 talents in each skill tree.There is also a crafting system, while it is fairly simple can be a tad frustrating if you don't plan on paying for bonuses.  Materials are given randomly after each game & getting what you need for a particular item can become time consuming.  You do gain additional materials based on your overall performance & if you win a game.  You can also trade materials you don't need for ones that you do.  After gaining enough items it's a simple process of clicking a few buttons & waiting for the item to be made.  Higher level items take longer to produce.  The items crafted go into a queue & you can play games or simply turn the game off while it's produced.  If you buy a booster you can craft more items at once & gain more materials from matches.  The crafting is set up to 3 catagories: Equipment, Support Items such as potions or gems & higher ranking materials.The graphics in the game range from down right beautiful, to slightly cartoony.  You may want to take a moment to admire the craftmanship that went into each level.  Some levels look better than others & range from a lush forest scenery to that of desert ruins & run down fortresses.  The character models can be compared to those in World of Warcraft as being fairly cartoony but enjoyable to watch.  Animations are a bit choppy at times but feel good overall when playing the game.The game feels unfinished, however.  There are bugs, balancing issues, & crashes.  There is also a cursor issue where it will stay on your screen even during combat.  While this is annoying, if you angle your camera properly it can be less so.  There are also some performance problems, long load times & occasional slowdown.  My machine isn't the most powerful, mind you.  As with any online game nowadays we can probably expect most of these issues to be resolved in future patches & updates.The sound in the game is... In progress.  You know how in other games when you slash your foe you hear some sort of impact sound?  Well this game doesn't have that.  At least, not yet.  It becomes difficult at first to know if your hits are even connecting to your target.  Some classes attacks have impact sounds, others do not.  I do not know if this is meant to be intentional or if it is simply unfinished in the sound department. The music is fairly generic as well & is forgettable.  Sound effects are also generic & not really satisfying but they get the job done. Overall the game is fun & is free so it's probably worth your time to at least try it out.A good game.			"

												Panzar is very sharp and detailed, above and beyond for a free to play game. This is what lured me into trying it in the first place, it looked so incredibly awesome I couldn't believe it.Easy to learn, giving you only several abilities to deal with at a time, while also being unique in its classes and fun to hop into. Being a PvP game, they have recently gone into the alpha for a PvE gametype where you need to race the clock and capture points and defeat bosses, while trying not to wipe the group. I recommend trying it out, allowing you to learn the class you wish to play and its abilities.Now, lets talk about the actual gameplay. Aside from the pay to win, the game features bland combat that is dominated primarily by two classes, the Gunner and the Tank. These two can pound out insane amounts of damage while easily avoiding death which makes life harder for everyone playing the other 5 or so classes. Matchmaking is also pretty slow, as it has a very small player base, mostly russian. On Steam, it seems to peak around 400-500 people. If you happen to get into a game, make sure you stay the whole time and immediately enter the queue for another game, as you will get in faster, likely with several of the people from the previous match.Unless you play as tank or berserker, you will die pretty quickly, so the game can be slow for new players trying to understand how the game works and can discourage people from bothering at all. The game is also pretty glitchy, sometimes trapping you in walls and other bulges or cliffs in the map. I have noticed it most when playing Gunner and trying to place turrets beside cliffs or rocks, making it collide with the environment.Last but certainly not least is the pay to win. People will argue and say its ""pay to progress"" and I am very well aware of this term and what it means, but this game forces you to grind so long for so little reward that to have the best armour in the game requires you to do two things, play either 200-300 hours or pay a simple 35$ (around that, its in euros) and have enough of the in game currency to buy you everything you need to destroy everything in sight.It's free and the graphics are nuts, if you have an hour or two and you're bored, give it a go.Personal Rating: 2.5/5			"

												A MOBA, somewhat Indie, and free to play. Sounds good, is good.Starting UpThe tutorial is ok, but a bit long for what it teaches you. Most is learning by doing. Important things like what's the HUD, how does the character screen work and such is a bit tricky to find out at first, but possible. Hints in loading screens give you well chosen information about the game and fills up the incomplete tutorial to a fullfilling knowledge about how things work.First Gameplays (Lvl <10)Well, talking about how people play in lowlevel, it's just like in a kindergarten, trying things out a bit. But that's ok, I mean you gotta see the arenas first, see other classes, maybe try out a skill - that's exactly what you need at that point. You'll learn how your skills work and what class does how much damage and so on. So feel free to be a kindergarten kid yourself ;)Later Gameplays (Lvl 10-30)Here things start to get a bit complicated. You'll be put into games against better geared players, or players with a higher level and therefore they have more skills available. Some of the players are leveling a twink, and actually know how to play and suceed by experience. And you are in the mid of this, neither having gear, nor skills, nor gameplay experience. This may seem frustrating. This may be one reason why lots of people give negative comments after 2-3 hours of gameplay. However, this is how you learn to play. One guy in the forum said it pretty well, although it's a bit mean: Put out your diapers, level up, make 2-3 new pieces of gear, and observe why you die and do next time better - then you are the one farming the others, instead of getting farmed. It's important just to give the game a chance here and not stop instantly. Even if you loose 5 games in a row, the next day you win 5 games in a row.Engame 1 (Lvl 30 but no gear yet)Here you'll probably gonna say, that you need freaking ages to get your best tier gear ready, and that they only want you to buy that gear. However, the match maker sees that you are not fully geared yet and puts you in corresponding games. So be happy to have something to achieve in the game: Get your gear ready. I mean Hearthstone all golden heros and all heros maxlevel take longer than this here. As you get your ressources together, you're continuing to learn how to play and will slowly notice, that there are nice combos within characters, you'll notice some kind of team work may be good... :O Endgame 2 (Lvl 30 full gear)Seems pretty balanced inbetween classes and stuff. The single problem is that the matchmaker may try to balance out the teams, but often it happens that you eithr farm the other team, or your team is getting farmed. And that kinda sucks. Tight matches aren't happening so often, but are exactly the most fun ones. Cool is though, that lots of people leave the match when you get farmed, and new ones join, and this repeats until both teams are plus minus equally strong.For the play itself, it's pretty awesome. You should find some friends, team up and play together. Said in last paragraph, teamplay is important and makes fun. For example, the fire witch shoots a freezing frost witch into the air, stopping her from her action, while the friendly frost witch can now easily freeze the enemy frost witch. Or a Dwarf puts bear traps on a spot, and a tank pulls an enemy onto those traps, killing him instantly. There are tons of combos like these, and I like the versatility given into the game by those combos.Another important point is that basically every skill can be countered by the enemy team. E.g. the freezing of a frost witch can be countered by: Fire witch shooting up, Inquisitor dusting you, Paladin unfreeze, Zerk 'sucker punches', Tank shield, Sapper steam hammer, and Gunner... guess he just kills the Witch. Poor Ice Witch...  I guess that's the reason they are always so mad ^^. However, so can the ice witch basically counter every class and every action by freezing them. The question will be, who does his job better? Who has the better team support? And it may be these questions, that are defining the gameplay. Anyway. I love the gameplay.GraphicsCry 3, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ awesome.SoundVery lovely made, orchestral epic style, some really nice tracks in there. Like it.Sound effectsSound pretty good, although Panzar probably didn't invest much in them (guess all computer generated). But quite ok for that.""Trivia"" / Things to knowA big aspect is the fun put into the game. E.g. there is an emote for the Orc, laughing like hell and falling on his back. You will laugh yourself when seeing this first time. Or the Golem, that repairs gunner's and sapper's structures, is made so stupidly, that it's simply pure fun to watch that guy. There are tons such little funny details, that are very cute.CommunityLots of kids in public chat, as usual. But it's ok. On the forums, it goes quite polite and more or less educated, the community holds together against stupid patches, and the devs listen normally. There is a weekly livestream by the community manager, where some news and stuff are told, pretty cool. Also if you put a question or a report onto the forum, they are usually quickly answered. Guys that are online on a daily basis will meet each other in the matches repeatedly and therefore know each other by time, getting easy friends this way.TournamentsAre weekly and very fun and the biggest part in the endgame. Very good concept. So find a clan, and participate ;)P2WAll you get by paying is either a time advantage, or you get pretty colors, emotes, and so on. But: Everything that is game relevant (gear, skills, useable items, and so on) are achieveable without money. Therefore it's theoretically not pay to win.The matchmaker defines a 'battle value' for you, and puts you in matches where people have more or less the same battle value. What gear you wear plays a significant role for the battle value. Therefore, all players in your game have around similar gear as you. So there is not even a need to buy gear, since if you do, your value increases, therefore your enemies will also be better. All you can do by money is just speeding up the whole process of reaching full gear.Of course in the endgame, you wanna keep up with your useable items, that run for a limited time. So you need to play quite a bit for that, so you can recreate your amulets every week. That works more or less well as long as you play regularly, but latest patches made it impossible to keep up with certain time-limited gear. P2W or F2P, as in any game that is announced as F2P, it's worth a discussion.Lot's of people write here in their reviews it's p2w. But sorry, it's not that simple. If you suck you suck, you suck with low gear (fighting against low gear due to battle value and matchmaker), and you'll still suck when you buy the best gear (fighting against the best gear).Overall:Very awesome game and recommended, at least give it a try. I mean it's f2p, so nothing to loose ;)			"

												A Very Good Game but you really need to have alot of time in your hands because of the Real Time Crafting and the other negative about this game is the real money currency (GEMS) that alow you to buy everything and to skip the crafting time of everything or you can level up your hero if you have the GEMS but still everything is possable even if you dont pay any money and it is 100 % enjoy one of the most awesome Action FREE TO PLAY games out there !

												The short amount of time I have been able to play this game, I would say it is ""OK.""I do enjoy the graphics and animations, but the game itself is the issue.Unfortunately, due to the limited number of players (possibly just in North America), you end up spending a large amount of time just waiting for a game to start.  The developers really should have come up with a way to mitigate this problem.  Possibly using a bot system based on real player characters?As it stands right now, I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone that wants to actually play a game.			"

												At first it was fun to play for a bit.the idea of cryengine3 was awsome so the graphics are finethen it seems more like forge later, pure pvp combat fighting for the midddleso basically it comes toif you got the cash you will rip everyone to shred, you can however earn everything through the shop without paying provided that you are willing to lose many matches to do so, if you want to be op and own up on the k/d pay and unlock everythingthough you'll lose tons of matches if your team doesn't have someone who isn't op out.+decent graphics Cryengine 3+the gameplay is fun, pvp and fighting for the middle, gets boring after a while.- Paying to unlock everything and being ahead is meh, should had been more on vanity than anything.

												Do you like theme park PvP? Good, this game is theme park PvP without the rest of the theme park. The game has a decent crafting system and for the most part a friendly community. It is 100% team work. If you are not doing your part you will lose.This is some of the most epic PvP I personally have ever done. I reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys hardcore pvp.The only thing i dislike is waiting times in que for matches.As the player base grows I'm sure that will change. I noticed a few people said this game is ""Pay to win"". I disagree, I have not put a dime into this game. I have only used the crafting and enhancement systems to upgrade. I have been extremely competitive. If this game is ""Pay to win"" then so is RIFT, LOTRO and other F2P models with cash shops. It offers very similar things that those games offer in their cash shops. Reviews are opinions. We know what opinions are like. We also know everybody has one. So, try it out and decide for yourself. Look for the clan Team USA. They are a friendly, English speaking clan that will help you to understand the game. This game is in development. It is not 100% polished but game devs are working on it. There are new patches with fixes and new content regularly. Oh and its FREE!!!			"

This game is not some unity school project like all the other f2p game on steam, this game delivers the beauty of unreal.-Lots of different maps and game modes, both PVP and PVE,-this is do not use the usual ""early access"" fake excuse, this is a complete game very well optimized, runs well.-you can earn every gear piece by not paying a single cent, crafting used to have a %chance for succes, but now its 100% and also they reduced the material requement for gear.

												This game seemed to have a lot going for it.  The combat and classes are interesting, the crafting system is a grind but manageable, and it is actually fun to play.  However, it has some keyboard smashing features that just aren't fixable:1.  Long queue times.  For a MOBA, you'd expect multiple games to be starting every minute for every level range.  That doesn't seem to be the case in this game, with queue times approaching 20 minutes or more for a single game sometimes.  And there is little transparency in the matchmaking process, no indication that games are forming, completing, or that players are even queued.  2. Everyone on your team is Russian.  They don't understand you, you don't understand them.  It makes a team based game very difficult.  You may as well remove voice chat, which doesn't really work anyway.3. Lack of new player information available.  The English wiki is unfinished, there is little information on the English forums, there is little information provided in the game, and the tutorial is so uninformative and restrictive that it's a chore just to finish it.4. Everyone seems to be terrible at this game.  I've played less than 10 hours and not past level 5 with a single class and I have topped the board with all of them at least once.  How hard is it to stand on the circle?  I chalk this one up to the previous two bullet points: lack of communication and in-game help.Overall, it's a fun game that seems to be failing simply due to a lack of interest from US players.  If there were language based games, that alone would solve 3 of the 4 problems I have with this game, but then I'd still be sitting in the queue, waiting to actually play it.			"

												We all know free to play games usually need to make money somewhere. In some games it's cosmetics, in others it's quick access to gear you would normally have to grind for...That's all well and good until it comes to PvP based games. Then you border on pay to win territory.Up until recently it wasn't too bad here but recent updates have put it into that territory a lot of us try and avoid.It used to be an okay game to kill a bit of time in, now it's worth avoiding at all costs.

I would say this game has the best graphics and pvp gameplay of any free game available. alot of people complain that it is pay to win which it kind of is but it doesn't take much of an investment to put yourself on a level playing field. just spend 10$ or so a month (you could get by with less than that) and make your account ""premium status"" you get double xp double crafting mats etc. if it didn't have an ingame market where you have to buy things occasionally i would have gladly paid up to 40 bucks for this game. so just take 40 bucks and buy some in game currency and you will have everything you need			"

												No, It's not a Warhammer game, surprisingly. This Russian made Online Battle game is pretty awesome. Going in, you need to know that the voice acting and tutorial level is painfully terrible. Try to suffer through it so that you get the free rewards from it and learn the basics of battle though. After that, a solid but rough game awaits you. It is very fun and has a robust action combat system with LMB attacks and RMB power attacks, as well as special attacks/abilities on the number keys. There's also a loot drop system after every fight that will give you resources to build more armor and weapons for your character, as well as get XP for unlocking new abilities. There is some extreme balancing and you might feel like the sneak attacks from the Stealth character are cheap... until the big 2-handed club wielding Orc rolls up and one shots that guy for you. Anyway, try it out, it's pretty fun, but keep in mind it's a Russian game that is rough around the edges and still getting updated regularly.			"

												I'll start with the only good aspect of the game, the graphics are nice.The game is Pay2Win, wasn't always pay2win, back in early beta is was quite a good, balanced game, with real money mostly used for just cosmetics like coloring your armor, now it's entirely pay2win with you able to buy overpowered characters with cash that are neigh-godlike to anyone not dropping money on the game.The game has no mouse sensitivity settings at all, with the game defaulting to a sickening turn speed of mach 5 for the camera, I felt sick turning the camera around after a while, not to mention it's awful for aiming.Game has lousy class balance, even before the pay2win comes into effect.Avoid this garbage like the plague.

												This game is the first game in awhile I could get addicted to, every bad review seems to be less than an hour of game play, with the exception of a few.  Which is disapointing, because I almost did not download this game because of the reviews. You quickly unlock skills and craft items, As you level up the crafting time increases. I do not see a need to pay to win, But i do not mind forking over a few bucks for a great game, because without profit, great games would not be made. I enjoy this game.My one major complaint is the wait time to get into action, can take up to 10 minutes to find a match, sometimes it times out because it can not find a match for you			"

												A nice game, fun combat and quality graphics but the few map varieties and repetitive combat make it boring after a while.PROS :  Very nice graphics, fun combat, nice audio. Playable. After reading the CONS keep in mind i like playing because of the powerfull modifiers u get with new skills and because i like grinding. CONS :  I understand the grinding for materials and curency but why in the hell do i have to wait an hour for an item to craft after i get all the stuff ?? There is a skill tree for crafting that reduces craft time but it's useless in my opinion, only makes me hate spending a perk on it.  Also i think there is a bug that makes u spend gold for upgrades but doesn't really add stats - when u try to add multiple upgrade levels at once.   Bad business model, makes u spend money for little content.  Word of Tanks model was better. The maps should be bigger and gameplay more organized, maybe clearer game modes because right now every match seems like a free for all.			"

												I just went through some of the reviews on the community page and noticed everyone who gave it a bad review played it for less than an hour.  Sure this game has a few hiccups now but I believe it could become a great game in the not too distant future.I'll start with what I don't like.  First bad thing I noticed was the game tends to crash.  However, after updating my graphics card, it started crashing much less frequently.  I also don't like that you can only form a group of three friends when joining a queue which makes it hard for me to invite more friends knowing i won't get to play with them all at once.  Even when I do have a full party (3 people) the matchmaking tends to be a little slow; especially when you're lvl 5 or higher.  Here's what I did like.  The graphics, first of all, are spectacular but that goes without saying since its cryengine.  When I played by myself i was a little lost but when I finally got some friends online I found it to be a very well put together team game.  Someone put it ealier it's kind of like Team Fortress and World of Warcraft had a baby.  A lot of people hail this as a pay to win but i see it more as a pay to progress faster game.  If anyone giving this a bad review would have played it longer than an hour they may have figured that out themselves.  I don't think i've ever run into an instance where I was fighting someone who out leveled or geared me to the point where they absolutely destroyed me.Like i said, it's without its issues now but I really do think this game could be fun if the community were to expand.

												This game is a RPG MOBA. Not like League of Legends or DotA2, because of no tower/nexus defense mode: Panzar has a different variety of maps and mode, more like Overwatch.From capture the zone to assault, you'll find yourself in an incredible fantasy battle, fighting against orcs, elves, dwarves, and humans.You can choose between 8 (and all avaiable) classes, all well defined by their own races. It's a very frenetic game, and each class has its weight on fighting.PROS:- Well made game, i found no bugs at all (until now).- Variety of classes, each one has its pros and cons. None is stronger than another.- You have room both for indivual and team skill in fighting. It depends on you character's class.- Not an heavy game.- Each game takes from 2 to 10 minsCONS:- Very few people palying it: all in PVP and none in PVE- Because of this, you are matched with and against people of a much higher level than you.- Controls are quite hard- Half of the people playing this game is russian, and as so they won't speak english.- A BIT p2w, but only a bit. You can still play and have a lot of fun, but don't expect that you can unlock everything instantly.WHAT I'D LIKE PROGRAMMERS TO CHANGE:- Sometimes cast time requires too long, even for basic skills- Make a shorter training- Create 2 more classes: an archer (a REAL archer) and a priest (a buffer, not a healing templar: you could give him spells to buff elemental damage, speed, attack speed, cast time, Will over time...)VOTE: 8/10			"

												Great game - probably the best MOBA/RPG I've ever seen. Visually it's just awesome, new step in the evolution of free-to-play games. Concerning gameplay - well, here we have some tried-and-true approaches: four standard (to be honest not completely standard - JUST LOOK AT THOSE SCARY ELVES!) fantasy races, eight typical classes, several also typical play modes and a really great amount of different (but always picturesque) maps.Is it entertaining? Oh yeah - especially after level 4 or 5 when a player actually gets enough abilities to choose between them and starts using some strategy thinking instead of constant clicking. Then it becomes just more and more interesting.Can't understand all the fuss around its monetization system. If you don't want to buy smth in the game you can always craft it. The crafting takes some time but it's fair and sensible. NO unique items or any advantages for donaters.			"

Lots of interesting things to upgrade your character, but players can purchase what you would grind up for for just a few dollars. Pay to succeed earlier. If it had more than just a lobby I would definatly give this a 8/10, but after a few hours of gameplay you figure out that they expect you to do the same thing for the next 10k hours of game play till you get to the end.  If you dont pay any money.  I will recommend but only on a casual level.  Play it a little bit every now and then, and you will stay happy with it.			"

												Well this game looks like fun i didnt play much but its hard not to notice how much money sucking this game is. Really shame tho if they could put more lore into it and make this game less pay to win game would be great. Atmosphere feels a bit like warhammer age of reckoning and thats good part. Combat for low levels is boring as ♥♥♥♥ and pve while standing in place and waiting for waves of mobs to come aint that fun also			"

												This game is getting a really bad rap at the moment and i believe unfairly so, the reason i write this review is because many current reviews just don't have the play time under their belts to make a judgement or at least an accurate one.Lets cover the elephant in the room first.Free to play in todays gamer community is usually a very dirty word, conveying low quality and high prices in the long run via microtransactions and despite the fact that Panzar's main menu has many microtransaction advertisements overall they are not that intrusive. I personally have not seen anything in the game yet that a little hardwork and elbow grease won't get you. The game is not entirely dependant on microtransactions as many seem to believe possibly due to the main menu advertisements mentioned earlier. The game itself has a rich and diverse trading community with public and clan trades happening often due to easy management of resources and clear menus and social chat boxes, also in-game ability to trade resources without other players when the trading front looks bleak for example, say i wish to trade iron for wood but none of my friends are online at the time so i go to my resources menu, from here i can use the static trading system to trade 2 iron for 1 wood with no real  cash involved. Very simple very effective.Many people claim the game is pay to win for those of you unfamiliar with this term it usuallys confers that the games microtransaction market will allow you to purchase items to make you better than everyone. I'd like to go into a little depth about this, all the items i have seen so far including cosmetics are easily obtainable through a little work usually on par with your skill and level bracket purchasing things such as levels will push you up a bracket (For example your level 9 and buy your way to level 10, all this does is put you in with people the same level as you.). Things such as items, weapons and armour can also be bought with microtransactions but once again these things are easily obtainable in-game and make no real diffrence in combat and gameplay if you are semi competent.I have encountered no pay to win so far.Now onto the graphics and gameplay.Graphically beautiful and exciting with a wide range of effects enhancing the action and gameplay with a feeling of rich immersion. All of this is on par with all of todays lastest games.This Free to play game easily nets half of a £40/$45 price tag through sheer detail and attention which have quite clearly been lovingly crafted by the development teams.Gameplay wise its highly entertaining for all types of gamers with options for brute force, team meat shield, stealth, magic and steampunk style engineers each with their own skill trees and all highly focused around team progresion. While early on in the game many battles may just feels like capture and hold the point to win around lvel 3-5 you start to join assault and defend matches with moving landscapes and defenses. With these new additions to the gameplay comes more in-depth tactics which affect the entire game.This is the more positive side of the game and summary i'd like to just point out the perks of this game.-Free to play.-Character development and building is fun rewarding and easy.-At certain times of day they have bonus experience points for everyone, along with competitions and free giveaways.-A live and active competitive community with tournaments.-The game is graphically beautiful with visually pleasing landscapes and backgrounds..-Easy social menus and chat menus, with an intuative interface.-Controls and gameplay mechanics are easy to learn falling into the nice category of a minute to learn a lifetime to master with a rewarding learning curve.-Classes are balanced and quite fair. (I find many disagree with this, however they have to realise that a turret building dwarf is not going to take down a ""squishy killer"" beserker, you are not a one man army and you never will be in this game, win as a team or lose as a team thats your options.)Now as they say there's no smoke without fire and as such we should also address the issues with this game. This list is a lot shorter and i feel i don't have to go into much detail here as most of it is self explanatory but i will add some details for clarity.-With the recent release on Steam Panzar has sadly gained a large chunk of new players and while a minority of these players are polite, kind and courteous, many of the new players are immature and childish spamming chat rooms and trying hard to ruin games however a bright light is on the horizon as the Panzar forum response seems very positive in fixing this. Intrestingly most of this stops around 10Pm at night, i'l leave this up to you to figure out.- I think this really goes without saying but with all games especially online games there are bugs, but once again the Panzar team on the forums seem to be active in dealing with these issues fortunatly they are not to noticeable in game. An extra plus note here for those of you who have played many online games is that i have yet to hear of hackers or see them.- Not really a negative but for those of you who prefer games with everything at your disposal from the start this game does take a little time to unlock things with the crafting sytem being in realtime, however this does not stop you playing matches with things you are upgrading or making. Its is a time sink but name me one game that you've enjoyed that has not been one?Hopefully this covers most of the basic aspects of the games and allows you to have a perspective from both sides of the fence on the game now.Yours hoping you're having a great time -CPW- "

												Panzar is really good game, it has 2 HUUUGE drawbacks though:-To long queue-Pay to WinAlso don't even think that you'll be able to communicate with team. That's not gonna happen unless you're russian. Despite these disadvantages, I think this game is masterpiece. Great combat system, one of the best i've ever seen in game like this.I wouldn't recomennd this game. mostly because of boring 30-minutes queues, but you know. Better rating -> more players. I'd appreciate if you persuade your friends to play Panzar. We can't really change the P2W thing, but long queues - we surely can.			"

												I've been playing Panzar for 8 months more or less. This F2P has great graphics, intense action, is fast paced (on high levels), well balanced, with already a growing community taking part in tournaments. You can craft all of the cash shop items with in game ressources, except colors for you gear and emotes. The waiting time to get in game can be quite long at late hours but the more people play the less you have to wait ;)There are a lot of mechanics to master and teamplay is essential.The gameplay may seem a bit slow at first but it's get faster and faster as the levels go up.There is already a weekly tournament with a crystal (the cash shop currency) prize pool to reward the 4 best teams involving many different clans. With the growing population, hopefully the devs will bring the game to it's full potential (unlocking level 30) to make the fights even greater !			"

												Lets get this outta the way. Yes it has microtansactions, as a free to play game it is unavoidable. But I am so very glad to say that the 'gems'  are used mostly on optional things, like speeding up crafting or cosmetics.  Speeking of crafting, panzar has quite the heavy focus on gear.  At the end of every match you are given materials such as leather and ore and from those materials you use the forge to construct your armor and equipment.  The crafting takes time, hours even at the higher teir, but it keeps going even when you are not in game so it is easy enough to que somthing up and let it build overnight. Do not come into this thinking it is an MMORPG. Panzar has persistant characters yes, but the gameplay is broken into matches. This is where the biggest issue is most clear. Waiting times for matches are far to long, but in truth that is not the games fault, it is simply a lack of players. Part of the reason i write this review is to actually encourage new players to check this game out. It has a fun feel, the matches adveraging around 20-30 min make great use of ones time, and the actual gameplay can become very intense.   Over all, 8/10			"

												pretty solid combat i wish there was more of a hit recognition other than just blood spray you dont really feel like you are hitting the target, the crafting system could use some work but with it being as monotized as heavily as it is i doubt that would happen, that being said the items all see achievable with just playing though the game and i didnt feel that anyone who had spent money seemed to have much of an advantage due to items being level resticted. it has alot of potential id like to see where they continue to go with it.

Easy difficulty games are difficult to finish(we finished 1 game out of 5 games with a premade of 5 and 1 random.For a fun couple games a day or so this game is good, for competetive solo (if you don't happen to know how to speak russian) its not ideal.

												Panzar is a free to play fantasy multiplayer third-person combat game from a Russian developer.  It worked, looked ok, played ok, sounded ok, was understandable.  Mostly PVP, some CoOp PVE.   CONS: it has hackers, pay to win elements and inflexible Devs. Mostly a non-English community. Try it, if you like PVP combat games.  But i suggest you don't spend real money on this game and leave it once you get steamrolled by hackers.For more info:

												I ♥♥♥♥ing love this game. The combat system and mechanics feel unique. I am not really into games like Dota or LoL. I do enjoy smite, but this game is not in the same category as those games even though when you look for similar games to Panzar those always come up. The main problem with this game is playerbase. I started playing as an East Coast player in the morning around 8am to 1pm. I had no issues getting into either OnE and PoP games. I do prefer the PvE aspect it has different unique scenarios based on the map. It does have a limited PvE playlist, but it provided me with hours of great gameplay and I still am not bored. During my playtime it was 90% Russian players, which means that teamwork it based on playing together each game and getting used to no vocal or type communication. I did not find this to be a problem as I prefer this to having 12 yr olds tell me how they have had sex with my mother.  Although it's possible buried in the Russian gibberish in the chat pane she was mentioned. This game is kind of like TF2 MvM game mode on extreme difficulty. It is like this in the sense that you are required to work together to defeat the PvE content. Going off on your own pretty much means you are going to die a lot and waste everyone's time.Each class has great abilities that contribute to the team. This game offers very little in way of tutorials. Each character goes through the same boring tutorial and after the first time it does suck. You can choose to skip it, but you lose valuable buff items and having a level up which unlocks a skill point which would greatly hinder you in your first encounter. The other non wave based PvE encounters resemble a nice sized dungeon like you would encounter in games like WoW.You move through a linear map and complete objectives while battling a large number of enemies. You face a couple of mini boss like minions in a few sections then at the end you have a boss battle.There is a steep learning curve in this game. There are many environmental hazards and boss mechanics that you must learn to counter and avoid. Most of the time you learn the hard way. At times I felt like What The ♥♥♥♥! As I get gang ♥♥♥♥♥ by about 20 some mobs who chain stun me. This is something you learn to work around. If your team is useful and you're a tank like class they know to widdle the mobs you have aggro on down. There is a lot of kiting in this game at times that can get old if your team is useless. Otherwise it's fun being the center of attention and plowing into a ♥♥♥♥ ton of mobs.Anyway, if you are on the fence just give it a shot up until around level 10 so you can unlock some of the better skills. The gunner is a wicked class and really dishes out some well needed DPS.I suggest you check out steam charts to ensure that you are joining when there are over 100 ppl playing. I know the player's is very low, but this game is just too much fun to not give a chance. When I played in the morning during the week I waited less than 3 minutes to get into a game. HTH,-pdTN "

												Russian. To start off with you need to know that this is a Russian made game with Russian servers and Russian player base. Kk , In this 3rd person melee/shooter you choose out of 8 classes/races to kill and kill and kill . Mainly for capture and hold objective games. The maps are small and incourage close up brawls with points to capture also small, in witch you have to stand in them to count to/as capture. Sometimes you play attacker or defender and sometimes there is multiple of these capture points.  Regardless it always turns into a chaotic kill kill kill game. Out of the classes there are orcs as tank or bezerker, dwarfs as gunner or sappers, humans as paladins or inquisititors and elfs as fire or ice witches. The genders are locked and even though gear changes appearence, you need to buy with real money skin or appearence changes. There is in game gold and shards for these things and lots and lots of resource items. Resource items is what you need specific amount of such and such to craft items. Kinda like recipes. Craft gear for your character. You can then upgrade the gear with gold . The resource items you earn after battle along with experiance . Experiance like usual levels up your character in with you can go to the alter to upgrade or gain that characters class albilities or skills. Some are moves some are passive. Choose what your favorite playing style for your character is and go along like wise in the alter. Each class has many ablilities and skills that leave alot to custimization for what you want to be doing in game. The controls are simple basic RPG style and wont be hard to master. Just get to what you like or HOW you like killing and get to it.  The graphics are great with such a interesting and fun art style. Its what caught me first. It was the character design and the little detail on them ( like the designs on the orks boxers/pants ) along wih the simple things of the class symbols and the maps waterfalls and  sharp clusterphobic designs. Its very pleasing and catching. The music was as so too, with folky fantasy theme to it. Full of humor, from just the cut scenes and the tuturial that definantly puts it out there. The tutorial does cover quite a bit but leaves a lot for you to trial and error in a good way. You play a few games with help, before they throw you out to the real game.The only bummer is there is little USA player base. Finding a game can be hard and then in one, everyone speaks russian. Games can be PVP or PVE.  So level up your character to get better abilities and collecting resources to build better armor and get better to do some more killing!			"

												This is the second review I have written for Panzar... originally I played through a few PVE matches then uninstalled and decided to warn others about what I thought was a pile of junk.  Later that night I found myself wanting to play Panzar, so I had to give it another try.  Im glad I did... below is a quick review then a short do's and dont's list so you can survive until things get a bit easier...Panzar is a third person, action MMORPG with a MAJOR focus on PVP and a simple lobby/crafting/clan/social system.  It is true action, meaning you aim your melee and ranged skills/abilities much like a first person shooter...no tab targeting. It has 8 gender/race locked classes to choose from, ranging from tank to stealther.Crafting is more happenstance in Panzar than something you 'try' to do, as both PVP and PVE award crafting materials and experience. You also do not need to have all of the materials in order to begin crafting an item and may stop and move to another at any time, then resume. Clans do not serve much function other than supplying you with a group of people with whom to form groups. HOWEVER, the server is dominated by Russian speaking people so you will wish to join an english speaking clan ... just ask in general chat and ye shall receive.PROS:1. FUN gameplay in pve and pvp2. simple system, easy to understand and use3. no grinding or farming 4. limited pay to win 5. heavily emphasized team play (great when people do their JOB)CONS:1. Mostly russian speaking community that is impossible to communicate with (google translate can be used as a one way means to talk AT them but you cant copy and paste from Panzar's chatbar. 2. If you elect to level up in PVE the first 5 levels will be VERY difficult due to lack of ranged abilities in the party to combat the archers, inexperienced players you are forced to PUG with , and language barrier.3. Somewhat lacking in content overall, particularly in PVE but they are adding new things very slowly4. no interplayer trading of any kind (money, items, cash currency, NOTHING)5. HEAVILY emphasized team play (nightmarish when people dont do their JOB) "

												In all my years of gaming I've never played this type of game. I'm really, really enjoying it. Typically play for 8 or more hours at a time.  Of course, did the same with War Thunder, Shattered Horizon, The Stanley Parable, etc. I'm a marathon player; I burn the camo at both ends! Sure, it needs improvements. The game requires a patch immediately after installing it, but it downloads at 56K modem speeds! This isn't the first game that relies on a launcher to update a game, but 100MB taking 30 minutes to download is appalling! And having never played this kind of game I could have used better tutorials on crafting and why I should craft some things over others. And speaking of tutorials, 9 classes equals 9 identical tutorials if you want to earn a class point for each one. And you are forced to watch the same badly done cut-scenes over and over with no option to skip them. Those voices! UGG! Better to just skip the tutorials altogether and earn your first rank by playing a round or two.The game has various classes and after you get past rank 5 there's supposed to be only 2 of each class on each team, greatly extending the matchmaking wait significantly. But if the devs want to make money (and they do) they will find a way to reduce the wait times. Speaking of which, the money you can spend on this game is for actual improvements to your skills and equipment vs just cosmetic stuff. This can lead to a P2W mentality, but a lot of games survive regardless if they're still fun to play. It's certainly easier to rank up in this game than others I've played. War Thunder would take years to rank up all of your crews if you simply ground your way vs paying to upgrade, for instance. I've spend $85 on that game already!I'm not very good at reviewing games, so that's all the ramblings of a Christmas Crack Monkey you're going have to put up with for now. Bottom line, I highly recommend this game if you're looking for casual and addictive fun.			"

												A fun game that requires teamwork. Some may say the game is P2W but I disagree. The statement (of P2W) is based soley on the ability that paying players can buy 'time.' Time that is required to level up and craft gear; gear that requires crafting time, and material (that is needed to craft) awarded by playing the game. Which will inevitabily set back a free player as they need to put a considerable amount of time for gear (comparable to World of Tanks). The statement is also really dependent on the extent of said advantage to a lesser geared player. It is obvious that better gear gives higher stats but the importance of gear comes into question. It is of my opinion that skill prevails overall with gear only being complementary. In fact, several players go naked into battle. (Some hoard their materials for higher level gear)Any other P2W argument couldn't fit in this game as anything achievable by a paying player (with exception of asethetics/animations that give no advantage) can be achieved by a free player; albeit slower as a free player. But as said in the previous paragraph, it could be seen as P2W since free players would have to essentially grind for their gear. Nevertheless, I still see skill prevailing overall; where teamwork is at the driving wheel as to which team will be victorious.Panzar's matchmaking generally takes the brunt of the criticism. There are many times where people would become frustrated with the matchmaking mechanic. Most of the frustration really comes to the wait times - but that cannot be helped because, sadly, Panzar doesn't have the population it deserves. The other is: some classes stacking on one team. Let's say, hypothetically, one team has more Orcs (Orcs are the frontline fighters) than the other team, and said team with more Orcs wins. People on the losing team would lay their lost solely because the winning team had more Orcs. This might seem correct but in another instance a team with more Orcs would lose. Having played many matches, I've seen many scenarios played out; and because of this, my perspective is strongly of the idea that the game is heavily dependent on the teamwork used via skill. Everything else jsut complements the players' abilities on either team; it really just comes down to the better team.Anyways! There are eight classes you can play which is a nice variety. Multiple unique maps, but the basis of every map is 'capture the point.' So far the maps can be classified as either 'stronghold: attack and defend' (which allow siege equipment to be used, cannons, ramps, shields); arena, where there is either 1 point where teams can fight over who holds the single point the most; and, attack defend (similar to stronghold, but with less points to cap, and less to no emphasis on siege equipment). The only con I see from this game is its low playerbase.			"

It's somewhat pay to win in that you can get the basic gear in a manner of seconds rather than the work of hours, however anything a paying user can get a free user can get with just playing a lot more.

												the game has amazing graphics and fun gameplay but you will soon find yourself at a loss, the game is pay to win, unless you pay subscription you will find it impossible to gather the resources to even try to craft your gear, at max level you would probably only have second tier gear (level 7-16 gear at level 30) you pay for subscription to get resources, you pay more for gear because it becomes impossible to balance at later levels, and unlike other games of its type, mistakes are payed in blood, miss a block? dead. you let an icemage near in the heat of it? dead. the classes are over powered in there retrospect, the game is poorly balanced and can be easy to lose your nerve when even less skilled enemies will oblivirate you with better gear. but if money is not a problem then you would end up having a ball crushing the poor and lame. side note.... the bazerkers will always kill you with a 2 hit combo...always, so blocks up at all times round them, but thats only if your tank, anyone else outmanuever or run. and the assassin that is geared can 1 hit KO any undergeared class tank or not CC is your only bet, and they have ways of always stricking your back so make sure your mouse sensitivity is up to make that 180 at a moments notice.

												The Games makes alot fun, it is a Side-Genre from classic RPG/MMO playing, like Arena-Mode in WoW. The GFX works well (i got no FPS Problems on Max.Settings). Cant say something about Balancing and Item-Crafting, cuz you got, like in every other f2p Game a Real-Money-Buy-System. The Classes are made a good Mix between usual Range/magic, Heal, Def. I realy like the way you need to aim, to make a sure hit. Teambased as well and the Game is medium played over all.There are two negative points i need to say:- at any place in the Game you enterd simple ""Water"" - you did die ... cmon, thats crap, a realy evil looking mad Hulk, with an sword bigger as himself, step into Water and die ???? it must be a joke. there are a sort of mobs, the Push and throw you around,...the most time they did that, you got fell off in Water and die ^^, naaaa, change that please!- omg the hell, implement Dedicated Servers or just an Server-Browser, all we dont need, is one more Game with Automatic Gamejoining -.-			"

												Good game if you are bored and want to play something quick and random; it has great graphics, responds okay, some variety of gameplay and an interesting forging sistem. But it lacks some basic aspects like the lobby (every game you get into will be random, the only thing you can choose is the character you are playing with), this can get very anoying, the game lags sometimes too much and loading screens take forever. Other aspects like character customisation are pay to play.			"

												Decent Arena style combat game where each class feels balanced in low levels. This is just a first impression of the game and to agree with other comments on this game it does have Pay to Win features, but over all from what i've experianced it is fun and worth trying out.The game has great characters that have their own skill sets that seprate them from all others. The combat is very enjoyable, and the graphics are pretty good compared to most games with a bit of humor to the animations. Character costomizing is not bad, with a few customizing cash shop items avalible to those that want to spend a dollar or two.Down side to this game sadly is that there is a very small player base at the moment, if the game catchs on and more people start playing que's to battles should improve, till then its a very very long wait till you get to do much of anything. Over all 7 out of 10, if battle que's get shorter 9-10 because nothings perfect lol.			"

												Simple design that is easy to play yet there is enough options with class selection and play style to make it fun. Its a micro transaction model but the cost, if you so choose, is not so much of a cash grab as other games. The game is third person perspective arena pvp in real time. You have goals such as hold points, or king of the hill. You generate victory points which are represented in various fashions. You can construct obstacles which add a strategic element to the map and diversity. Win or lose you get experience and items to ""level up"" your character to unlock more abilities that you choose so there is an element of character customization although due to balancing there are preferable tree paths to take than others. Taking less optimal paths does not seem to ""gimp"" your character terribly. Items gathered from matches have names that resemble raw material like ""bark"" or ""iron"" and such. These are used in a small crafting portion where you combine material and wait a set amount of time for the item to be made. Level 1 items take 6 minutes and change while level 4 took about an hour. As you get higher the time sink becomes greater. This is a way for the game to encourage you to purchase more gems to speed up the process. Don't want to craft at all? No problem. All gear that can be made can also be straight out purchased and forego the process all together. Bottom line? Its a fun game that is easy to get into and out of. Don't have much time? You can play a match for 20 minutes and log off. Its a lot of fun with friends. Also everything you can buy can also be crafted for free. The difference between buying and playing for free is simply time. If you don't care about getting less gold, less XP, less drops than someone who is paying then its no big deal. You can play for free and get everything the premium player who is paying except that it will simply take you longer. This is not a big deal because they make these games to make money. Its a business.			"

												Been only playing it for a fews hours, and so far, I really like it. Only reason I haven't played it more is because I'm still more interested in AC4 and Batman AO. But those are both $60 value games, so it's unfair to compare with a F2P. Nonetheless it is Pay-to-win.  Contrary to what... alot of the reviewers are saying.  I have yet to find a game dominated repeatedly by a pay to win fanbase.  There are people with less hours than me on here claiming the oppisite, how can they do that? Were they really that unlucky? In the end, this game is free. It only takes about 5 hours or less to download, so it's worth a try.  I like the combat, the art, the leveling system.  Yes, pay to winners can get a big boost but they all die the same if you get em outnumbered which outnumbering happens on a regular back and forth basis, I like it..  But I've actually won more than I've lost.  Now there are only two ways this can happen.  1) There aren't as many pay to win players as others claim or 2) pay to win people are equally put on sperate teams so there is no big domination factor.  At least not on a constant re-occuring basis.  Seeing as how I see alot of half naked people like me running around, I'll go with 1.  If you are half naked, you are just starting.  Its beautiful, fun and free, like I said, it's worth a try.  Just have fun and dont put on your try hard pants right out of tutorial. I mean, it's a free to play.			"

												I kind of adore this game, it has the battlefield feel to it in that you're taking over points and what-not. And it also has set races/classes, the customiation leaves something to be desired. If you can take all that though and are looking for quick LoL type matches with orcs and dwarves I think there are lots worse than this game. All it is, is the action pvp part, there is the concept of juggling resources and picking skills off of your classes tree which can change the game some for you or your class, in the end though it's a constant state of rpg fighting that I've found myself enjoying quite a bit. I haven't dropped money on the game either, sure I'm not at end game but as it's going they try to match you with people at your skill level (battle effectiveness I think they call it) so while I may one day go vip just for the crafting part that gimps out for free players, is a solid choice for some time killing imo.

												Worth a try at least for a few hours of a good casual fun. Hardcore gamers may have to put money down. What I liked: ----Combat:                      The combat is fluid and fast paced.   Every class seems to have a defined role that they are expected                                                 to play for the sake of synergy.   The teamplay doesn't look apparent at first, but after a few hours in you see how the better players coordinate. Tanks will shield allies behind them, Inquistors will assassinate the ranged targets etc.  It can feel a bit ""weightless"" at times however.---- Presentation and Graphics:                            Judging off the tutorial alone, you would assume that this game would actually be a competent single player. (Its not.) However it seems the groundwork has been set for it.  The lore is kinda interesting and all the characters seem quite interesting. (or at least interesting paradodies.)  Dwarves walk on stilts, elves are beauty queen models right up their grotesque faces. The arenas themselves are all gorgeous as well and invoke an interesting world. What I didn't like----- Repetitiveness                      Granted, because this is a multiplayer lobby shooter/fighter, you cannot expect too much variety. However it can begin to feel grindy quite quickly. A lot of the battles just begin to feel the same a few hours in, especially since most of the maps have the same objective. Grinding for levels and exp can be quite slow as well, so you may feel quite a drag unless you fork over some real money to expedite everything.Verdict: Give the game a try if you want some casual fun, but do not expect too much.  The game aspires to be an esport and the ground work is definately there, but will players stick around for everything else? I don't know.  "

												Ten hours into this game and level 6, All that can really be said is it's a pay2win specially at lower levels. This game tries to be a parody of fanatasy and it does well on that orcs leaping across the map elfs freezing entrie parties to change the course of the battle, and other fun moments.Trying not to take it self very serious the gameplay at first childish picks up on some maps and later levels to being pure fun while working as a team, although most maps are as simple as run to the middle hold it for as long as possible. Back to the childish feel of the gameplay even though you will have a few spells that can knock your enemy back or down your basic attacks will be about as fun to watch as swinging it at the air since they don't do anything, but lower the HP of said enemy not even stoping them from swinging.For a game that tries to parody the fantasy world your left feeling like the market place is taking it to serious I mean every thing in this game can be bought with RL cash even leveling. This can turn alot of people away, but all and all it's got plenty of fun for a weekend run maybe a little more if you can clan up and find some good people to play with. I don't really need to say much on the graphics since they speak for themself in the screen shots it's a pretty game even if moving around seems blocky at times.I'd give it a 6.5/10 it does have some redeeming aspects.

												Seemingly hidden among the more popular online games, Panzar with it's refreshing fantasy landscapes, solid combat and well-crafted classes remind me of a golden era when pc games were made by experienced developers, artisans of the industry. There are premium cash shop that offers items for slight stats boosts and faster leveling, but the gameplay is designed around actual experience in playing to be good at it. Knowing when to swing your club and when to block as a berserker matters more than having more regen or power. Just like knowing which skill to use on which teammate as the paladin matters more than having more energy. The many setbacks in the game's promotion, mainly the excessive negativity in the reviews do restrict the game's community to be mainly of Russian players, where the game is from. Which is unfortunate seeing as Panzar is a beautiful game that deserves more spotlight. I hope this game do well and the developer continues to build it's world. It might help the pc games industry return to it's glorious days.82/100			"

												It's a Team Based PVP oriented game set up in a typical F2P format where players can grind to earn what they want or simply pay for it. The cash shop sells a variety of items such as cosmetics, level ups, crafting materials & potions. Currently the only game modes available are Capture Point, King of The Hill & Domination. There is a lack of a server list & choice of game mode so you won't know what game mode or map you'll be getting into until you start playing. Several different maps are available & range from small, medium & large & all hold up to 20 players or 10v10.			"

												I had to change my review of this game.  I now recommend it however.1.  Learn your classes role. They are not exactly what they appear to be on the surface.  Read the forums and learn.  This game is easy to play, easy to learn, and very difficult to master.The crafting system needs some work imo, but it is not game breaking.The game will appear pay to win starting off, and until you learn your class it will be painfull.  Stick with it.  It gets so much better once you get your class down.Over all good game and I recommend giving it a go.			"

												I like the way the game puts you: inferior and badass, whatever class you take. I only tried Inquisitor yet, but all sound promising, and I think you have enough slots to try them all!As I mentioned in other analysis, I really like freestyle combat, and that's what you'll find in this game. Reasonable graphics, good scenarios, ok game progress.I recommend you to try, and see if it fits you. I know I will play it again.			"

On the other hand as far as I know, you can get all the needed equipment by playing the game.This is MOBA RPG based on team work + it's fantasy. IMO one of the best F2P games so far.

												This is NOT pay to win game... You can pay to get better gear and look stronger, {more handsom too} but your efficency will increase if you do so and you get matched VS similar efficency. You can see your efficency on the left top corner. People lose, people cry. get angry and say its pay to win because they get oneshooted by some guy that play well. You can block those atks easy and use ur powers upon him. there are clases that work better against  an other calss and so on.. that why stay close to those who can protect you against them.. best game ever played... I simply love it!I did play this game a lot and i stop! because i had to wait for a match pretty long time.. I wish this game was so huge as lol or dota because its lot more fun!If your new and cant decide to give it a try or not, TRUST ME, even 5 hours of this game will feel like worth it. The ammount of fun you get the first time you play it is insane. Enjoy!			"

												Started playing it about a week before it hit steam, was really in need of a pvp game, forums brought me here. Panzar did and is doing the job. Can't tell for how long but so far I'm enjoying it. You could see it as a mix of Team Fortress, Mediaval Warfare and Tera. You choose a class, lvl doing pvp, no pve at all, gain levels, put stat points in talent tree, craft gear, lvl some more, unlock more abilities, but all while pvping in.There is no pve in here so don't lose you time if its what you want, but if you want some solid fighting in a Warhammer atsmosphere, try this game.Finally, about pay 2 win, bof, more like pay to progress, a la LoL. Yes you can do everything faster if you pay, but whats the point really, unless you only care about reaching the cap asap. For casuals, even lvl 1ish will be fun.Enjoy.			"

Also, the game will not let me exit it, even with the Alt F4 trick and the Ctrl Alt Delete trick. I will try it out one more time to see if it will work after i just deleted it. But for now in a ranking from 1-10, it is a 4.5.			"

												This is a great team pvp game, where win or loss depends on how well your team does together on the battlefield and is a lot of fun. It has ingame tournaments supported by game designers with nice rewards system, where players can build their own team of people to compete against other balanced and organzided teams.It might be a bit frustraiting to get started and to become familiar with what to do, but once you get it - it's great!There is an option to invest real life money to progress your character faster, but this is totaly not required, as all items are aquirable through game experience, you just got to be patient, but what else would you expect from f2p game :)			"

 • candy eyesProcedure:The first step is to make the Blue Velvet cupcakes.Combine flour, salt, and cocoa powder in a small bowl.  Set aside for later.  In a stand mixer, combine the oil, sugar, vanilla, eggs, and gel paste.  Mix until combined.  Add half of your flour mixture into the oil mixture, stirring on low.  Add half of the buttermilk.  Repeat until all the flour and milk is gone and mixture is combined completely.  With mixer on low speed, in a small separate bowl, combine baking soda and vinegar, and quickly add to batter, allowing the mixer to mix for about 10 more seconds.  This will make the batter light and fluffy.   Using a cookie scoop, fill cupcake liners 2/3 full, and bake at 350F for 20 minutes.  Allow to cool to room temperature.Prepare buttercreams (white and blue).  Using an round open tip, pipe a blue swirl onto the top of the cupcake.  Then, using a round open tip, slowly build up the white buttercream to a point, shaping it like the Smurf hat.  Add a nose with the blue buttercream by squeezing a small dot onto the blue base of icing.  Add the candy eyes. Happy Baking 10/10 "

												Nice surprise, this title. Panzar is a very fun title right out of the box, the paid options basically seem to be 'shortcuts', which I've got no problem with. The progression, even without the paid options, is very satisfying and hasn't frustrated me just yet. The battles take place on some of the best multiplayer maps I've experienced, and while there are by my estimate, fewer than a dozen maps, the variables within each make each battle play out uniquely. The classes are varied, and they all have their place and fill their niche nicely. There's certainly something for everyone here, whatever your playstyle may be. While it does have its share of minor bugs, I've not encountered anything gamebreaking as of yet. The matchmaking during non-primetime hours can get very long and tiresome, leading to many players constantly re-rolling new characters to keep in the common levels 1-3 bracket. I sense that as this game has more time and exposure on steam, some of these matchmaking issues will clear up.Especially for the 'price', I highly recommend, one of the best F2P titles I've played.

It has a ""brilliant buisness model"", you can spend 1 Crystal everytime you get impatient on upgrades leveling and crafting... they will sell you 25 Crystals for $2.50. 2 free per level up. Some pretty cool skills with inquisitor and tank in my opinion.The 7 day premium membership is included inside rune/armor bundle for less than $1 nice!

												Best Looking Fantasy-F2P to date ""imo""  with high customization video options. It's Fun and  the Girl in the tutorial sounds cute! It has a ""brilliant buisness model"", you can spend 1 Crystal everytime you get impatient on upgrades leveling and crafting... they will sell you 25 Crystals for $2.50. 2 free per level up. Some pretty cool skills with inquisitor and tank in my opinion.The 7 day premium membership is included inside rune/armor bundle for less than $1 nice! OVerall with it being a new title with smart dev's behind it, it looks really promising. IF YOU LIKE FANTASY! LOL			"

												Great game,its similar to league of legends with its small number of skills.Its also like world of warcraft in the battlegrounds fighting.The team play is very similar to TF2 but feels new and fresh,you can easily kill people if you know your class.Its cool for me cause I can kill so many people and dominate so easily since im filmilar with the game style.

I will also warn you that there is a lot of new people QQn cause its not the standard blow it up make it dead PVP game tanks can be squishy and can also kill you.			"

												Visually - stunning. Idea - nice MOBA like game. Execution - bad. Matchmaking system put players of different levels in same match where new player has one role - to die often. I really didn't like the fact some of the players are OP in comparison to others. Playing mage class is terrible - mage has no chance vs player who spent money in. When mage has spell ready moves soooo slow and when it cast it - as if nothing happen. If you plan to have this slow movement mechanics - then make spell devastating. Almost no damage vs OP players while they can catch a mage in a blink of an eye. Mana is drained in no time!

												I have played a few hrs and so far I am having fun.Main char just hit lvl 7 and I am having a blast (literally lol).Its an interresting game, graphics are quite nice. Purely PvP game, beside the 2m Tutorial. Combat is fast paced, and there is now customization for your char gear.As most F2P games this one is definitively P2W, meaning you can skip right to the top is you invest enough $$$ into the game.Something I find annoying is that in order to Rename your char, Respec your skills and Dye your armor you need to pay $$$ :(I would give 3/5 overall (would be a 3.5 in my book if I could Dye my Armor for free lol). Worth spending 2-3hrs to play to make your own opinion.To those of you that yould like to try the game, feel free to use the Refferal Link below.http://panzar.com/?srv=auto&♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥d0693cd778bc4d932aa7bb41c2ddc0484a932ae8fbc3bd87fd43b5470f9e8d99 "

												Panzar, a beautiful game with a few interesting characters the choose from. This game in sadly unfinished and has a long way to go in order to bring the community they are looking for. The decent controls allows for a fun but repetitive gameplay which can turn away potential gamers from playing something so mind numbing. For a free-to-play game Panzar needs improvements and variety. There are character upgrades available which can be achieved through tedious grinding or with a credit card. If you are looking to play this game and enjoy repetitiveness to achieve goals well look no further this game is for you.Gameplay: 4/10Graphics: 7/10Story: No story.Overall: 5.5/10If you are interested in more information this video will help:

												2 hours in, and I already feel like I'm in for a SUPER LONG grind if I want to get anything just by playing. Even with supporting my char with real cash. Good graphics is the only good thing here. Animations are strange, sluggish, slow [just jump, you will see lol], combat has ZERO impact to it, weak and boring sound effects make it even worse. Managed to get to lvl 3 before I had enought mats to craft single lvl 1 item for my char. And crafting takes 30 minutes, so I can only imagine how long it takes for higher lvl items. I don't even feel like writing more about this game, coz it's just a waste of time. Well, at least it works and looks good.Finally - imo World of Warcraft battlegrounds deserve 8/10, so this game if compared to them is like 3/10. Maybe 4/10 if you'r willing to spend some money on it. Grind / waiting game is HUGE here. Unless you are ready to pay extra for every single action/option/item/gold... you name it. Good Luck and have fun if that's your thing, I'm uninstalling now.			"

												I find it funny that the majority of people not recommending this game played less than 1 hour. Obviously they spent a lot of time in game checking out the full crafting system and playing multiple games and leveling up their characters. The game gets deeper as you go (much like MMORPGs but without the open world).  If you haven't made it to the 6-10 bracket then you're only playing the small maps and not any of the interesting maps that come after that. The first couple of levels are ""boring"" because its giving you the ground work so you dont get smoked later. Listen... you can call the game P2W... while there is a grind everything in the game can be earned as apposed to paid for. Then again the western market for F2P is horrible with the screaming of P2W..:EDIT:.additionally... i dont believe they've put up any North America servers yet. so some of the ""issues"" are due to NA players playing on Europe servers			"

												The first thing that came to my mind was, “OH this game is going to suck how could it possibly succeed and be any fun?  The characters are horrendous; there are no words that I can use to describe how the Elf Witches look like.   Once you get past this than you move on to the tutorial which is one of the worst tutorials however, Fallen Earth still holds the reign for that one.  However, combat is a good mix between Team Fortress 2, Mount and Blade with War hammer lore.  In other words, if Warhammer online had played the way Panzer Online does.   War hammer online would not of been cancelled.   What I prefer most is the Attack and Defend style maps with buildable contraptions.			"

												It's not the best game out there, but in general the simplicity of the game makes it easy to learn and it is fast-paced enough that it remains interesting for a decent period of time. Admittedly there are inherent flaws in the design and it does favor players who are willing to contribute to the game monetarily but that's to be expected from any free game -- after all, designers and programmers and customer support etc., etc. have to earn their keep too.There are some solid ideas behind the gameplay despite the problems Panzar has with balancing, and so on and so forth, that provide a good foundation. Most of the other issues are smaller fixes that could, with time and effort, be adjusted and ""fixed."" If they aren't, then the game isn't worth any serious commitment, but if their staff decides to amp up their game, no pun intended, then maybe playing wouldn't feel like such a waste of time.			"

												Albeit not as great as other MOBA or Battle-Arena style games, I have to say I'm in two minds about this game.For one, it is a little pay-to-win with the things you get in the cash-shop and does do a ""Look at what you could get after your match if you paid!"", but other than that the game plays pretty well and the graphics aren't bad for a F2P experience.Try it out yourself, it's free to play.

												I'm a veteran of this game from before it was released on Steam. Most of the negative reviews for this game are coming from people who have only played the game on steam and have under an hour on record, not exactly people who's opinion I would trust.Now for the actual review: The good;+The game looks visually stunning, it's running on the Cryengine and is one of the most graphically pleasing and atmospheric games available. The terrain and characters are flawlessly animated, the models are excellently rendered and the particle effects are magnificent. However the more technologically minded among you may be wondering ""if it looks so good it must have hardware limitations and optimisation issues"". Well, not that I can tell. The graphic scaling options allow the game to run on my current PC (I5+HD7950) as well as it does on my five year old PC, just not at the same quality. As for optimisation I can say that, even with the fact that Troxit (the developer, I believe) are a reasonably small operation, they have pulled out all the stops for optimisation, even big budget games like (Battlefield 4 for example) would be envious of the optimisation work that has gone into this game, it runs flawlessly on all of my rigs.+Variety of game modes. The amount of game modes available and the objectives range from the obvious capture and hold game mode to the simple capture point gauntlet and the simple closed in arena archetype. However there are several truly intriguing game modes along the lines of castle defence and siege game-play. One map involves a team attacking the gate of a castle, breaking in, opening the gates for your allies, securing a safe foothold and then making a stab at the centre of the castle after using a mechanism to raise the final capture point. The variety of game modes here really adds to the flavour of the game and the map designs clearly show an attention to detail on the part of the artistic team.+Each map has several of its own context sensitive items and mechanics. From slingshots to launch you onto an objective to a siege ramp that allows you to lay siege to a castle. I thoroughly enjoy messing around with these mechanics and finding a way to use them to the best effect. My current favourite trick is to run towards a group of enemies on my dwarf with an explosive barrel in hand and then laugh as the enemy players scurry for dear life. This may not seem like much to some but for me it adds a much needed feeling to the game that other multiplayer games lack.-----------+Classes are so diverse that there is enough here for everyone. Tanks, I have a question for you. Do you like playing a tank? Great, a position just opened up, have fun getting in the enemies face and showing them the value of orcish durability. You may need someone to support you, to pick you up when you're feeling down, to protect you with nothing more than pure faith (and magic). These men are known only as... PALADINS! Do you have a fascination with incense burners and helping incredibly reckless allies to not die within seconds of making contact with the enemy? Great, we could use someone like you. Just avoid huffing too much incense during battle, it's bad for your health kind of like.... A sister of fire! Are you someone who wants to watch the world burn? Do you find yourself wishing you could cause large fireballs to land on small people? This role is for you! Please just watch where you aim, fire isn't the most precise weapon in existence, no that would be... The blades of an INQUISITOR! Hide in the shadows, watch and wait in silence as your enemies health dwindles and then ATTACK while yelling ""Nobody expects the inquisition!""(Optional but satisfying). Yes the inquisitor is everything you want in a bloodthirsty, puritanical murderer. Your enemies will not see you coming as they feel your blades plunge into their back.  Sapper: ""Great, you died! Well don't just stand there!"" Get on the sappers teleporter and go back to the fight! Yes, the sapper. A devious creature so well equipped for battle that having one of them at your back is enough to give you the support you need to win any battle. Place traps, build energy replenishing totems and then your greatest creation, a high powered mortar launcher that can turn an invading force into nothing but a charred hole in the battlefield.  Maybe you like the idea of being a sapper but want to play a more active role? Well the GUNNER class may have what you need. Lay down heavy support fire with your portable heavy machine gun station and let the enemy know that your name is the lord as they're ripped to shreds in a volly of high calibre rounds. All these explosions and fire may sound fun but don't you wish you could cool things down some times? Like...right down...to freezing? The ICE WITCH can do just that for you, the ability to freeze an entire enemy force solid for several seconds leaving them at the mercy of the TRUE lord of the battlefield...THE BERSERKER! No. Nobody is bigger, nobody is stronger, and you can be sure that nobody is DUMB ENOUGH to stand head to head with this barbarous monster. Where the others such as the inquisitor find refuge in the shadows and the gunner depends on range to protect him the BERSERKER! only knows one thing. A dead enemy is not a threat. Smash the stupidity out of any enemy that dares to stand in your way. The berserker waits club in hand for a day when he meets an enemy will be able to withstand his  sheer might. That day is not coming soon.-----------+An actual progression system! This game comes with a progression system that some may not like, but for the most part it functions as it should. You can get better gear, skills and abilities while levelling up and feel like you're working towards something. There's nothing that you can get with money that you cannot get with some effort and in game currencies.ALRIGHT! That's what's great about the game. I know there's a lot to digest, the game IS free so you should try it if nothing else. But let's get our books in order and we can do that by talking about the bad. No game is perfect...Maybe Tropico 4 (check it out, shameless plug).-The business model. It's a game, games are there to make money. It is perfectly possible, but costly, that you can buy your way to max level with the in game ""level up for money"" feature. While this does NOT convey a direct game play advantage you cannot deny that leveling with real world currency is tempting for those that enjoy the game (I know some reviewers just like to poke holes in games without being constructive but eff all that, I like to help so I'm going to make some suggestions!) I think that the leveling system should be altered somewhat. First of all reduce the leveling threshold. It's kind of frustrating to win a battle only see your progress bar go up 1/15th of a level. Secondly change the level purchasing system. Make it so you can only buy a level after you have at least filled your bar half way or more, to reduce the effectiveness of just buying levels.-Crafting. Right now crafting is annoying. But you new players...you have NO IDEA. A few months ago, even, the crafting system was much worse. just get rid of it and let us buy armour and weapons with IN GAME CURRENCY!-Balance. It's kind of difficult to enjoy the Berserker double tap of doom, speed up Control Recovery after stuns and knockdowns and freeze abilities. I would cut loss of control abilities effects by a big amount.Well it seems that the character limit has caught up with me. I could go on for several pages but here's the point I want to make:Don't let these naysayers put you off of the game, just give it a try, it's free after all.			"

												This game is a lot of fun however is not necisarily a pay to win game. You could eventually unlock everything over time just like League of Legends but the money helps you recive what you want quicker. I recomend this game to people who like to strategically play with friends, by yourself this is pain in the butt. This game is 110% teamwork and if one of your teematees is afk or f-ing around they impact the game severaly. This game is for advanced and serious gamers. Requires fast thinking and strategic combat. Even the weakest healer could take out a beserker it's just a matter of skill.			"

												Pretty fun game. I like the free to play aspect of it and the only thing thats a real pain is leveling up which I see they say you can pay currency to level your character up instantly. I think they did the slow leveling on purpose. The gameplay on the other hand is still very very good. I would say maybe a little tune up on hit box's and a proper aim for the engineer gunner skill.			"

But i love the action combat mixed with rpg elements where you lvl your character learning new skills crafting new more powerful and better looking gear, and upgrading it making you stronger. some of the things the characters say and do are pretty hilarious to, game has pve mode as well as pvp mode. theres a class tailored to every playstyle which is great. download and play it, it's not going to hurt to try and its definetly got decent graphics compared to alot of games on here and its a completed game not another early access game that stays unfinished for years.

												This a wonderful game being buried by idiots. You get 5 gems every time you level in this game and by level 5 you can get the recruit pack which gives you premium for 7 days and a bunch of runes. Which is all you need to put yourself on a level playing field. After that if you are still playing the game after that maybe you should cough up some money? Most of the people disliking the game haven't even played an hour. With all that said the game matches you with people who are relatively near you in levels and power. So if you just buy a bunch of levels and gear you aren't going to be just beating up level 1 people for fun. Really you will be up against better people then you because they will know how to actually play. ANYWAY. The game basically plays like a mix of WoW and TF 2, the classes are all useful and fairly interesting. Though some are abit better then others. The game is just gorgeous and it runs well on high end systems which is more then I could say for crysis 3. The castle siege maps in particular are quite epic with devasting cannons and catapaults that can launch you over the defenders walls. Think objective mode in chivalry, or the assault maps from UT. If you ever wanted a good fantasy pvp action game this is most certainly it.			"

												I think 'Panzar' is a nice game for a few matches whenever you got some free time to spare.It has quite an interesting lvl mechanic, the maps are pretty well made, every character-class is unique in abilities.As it is a free-to-play title you will have quite an advatage as a pay-gamer as you get early access to equip, which allows you to be a little stronger than your enemies. BUT the advantage isn't as big as in other free-to-play games and still 'balanced' as you could say.So if you want to have a little fun with smashing and wrecking, freezing and burning, shooting and slicing your opponents apart, and don't want to pay anything for it, 'Panzar' is your game to check out then.Your DtDPS: Really, give it a try and check it out.PPS: If that didn't convince you, then check out that elven buttocks ;)			"

												So far so good, you really need to get some better teamwork to get the full feel of how good this game can actually be, so play with a group of friends. Mainly comedic in gamestyle and lore, has a few issues like how 2 berzerkers can wipe half your team if nobody on your team is a tank. Berserkers a bit overpowered, Tank a bit underpowered, the long range classes are basically useless if the enemy has 2 tanks, same goes for melee, my team had to have 4 berserkers to bring down 2 tanks, albiet new and buggy great game nonetheless.But dont take my word for it try it out yourself!

												This game is incredibly fun. The entire concept is based around teamwork and how well you and your teammates can effectively plan or work together. The best games are when both sides do this effectively, leading to huge brawls over a control point that can last for minutes.General Gameplay: ( 9/10 ) Some classes could use a bit of tweaking in terms of fairness, but the overall class balance is nice.Graphics: ( 10/10) Beautiful graphics and a gorgeous arena on every map, not to mention certain maps have awesome features. One example is a wintery map has a blizzard every so often and makes visibility practically 0, making it hard for both teams to fight coherently.Fighting Mechanics: ( 7/10) Could use some improvement, but it includes a working block system, power attack/regular attack combo and every class has atleast 2 ways to attack, one from melee and one from range.Map Mechanics: ( 10/10 ) I have not found a game that has unique map interfaces like this one. If you're sieging a castle, you can work with your team to build siege ladders to get to the control point and defenders can destroy them. Or you can put up gates and barricades to slow attackers down for a while and give yourself not only a bit of breathing room, but a more manageable way to fight the enemy and maintain control.Multiplayer: ( 5/10 ) The reason this score is low is solely because the game is -entirely- PvP. There is no such thing as PvE for joking around with friends - only the cold, harsh battleground. Another deduction is from the game's seeming 'pay to win' at later levels - instead of having to farm gear, players could simply buy the highest tier gear. Even if it is availible to everyone, it would certainly give them a bit of advantage.			"

												It seems launcher wont start if you have a bittorent client running, which i only learned through reading log files. The game itself looks really nice, but i have no way of knowing how it plays, as the matchmaking seems to be non-functional. It doesnt even say ""finding game"", insted theres a ""waiting"" screen which throws you back to main menu after some time, except when youre trying as a group, in which case it throws you back instantly. Im looking forward to playing this when its playable			"

												So let me sum this game up.  This will be comming from someone who likes playing MOBAS regularly. 1. Moba with only a few maps giving you lanes, not the same kind of lanes in a traditional MOBA since, but lanes none the less that allows you to flank and take objectives through an ambush type of take over. 2. Most, if not all other Mobas give you a plethora to chose from of many different character types, set with there own powers and themes. This game gives you the bare bones to which you build off of allowing you to create your own champion, tailored to you and your play style. 3. No item store like DOTA2 or LOL. You literaly build your character through time and progression.4. You gain materials to build things after each match regardless if you win or lose. The more you win, the more bonuses are gained hence, the faster you can get your items built for your character. 5. 8 classes, many different ways to level each one giving you technically more then just 8 classes. Tank, Paladin, Sapper, Sister Of fire, Inquisitor, Berserker, Ice Witch, Gunner. 6. The games currency, is a pink gem that you can get through progression and time played along with getting a total of 5 after each time you level. Almost everything is reliant on this, respec, crafting and upgrading. You can literally earn everything honestly without ever going to the item mall. Over all thoughts thus farI honestly believe we have something great here. The game is well made on a nice engine and runs very nicely. There are a few graphical gripes, but nothing that completely ruins the game for me or my experience from the over all presentation. This game has a long ways to go before it can hit that sweet spot where DOTA and LOL currently sit at, but this game has the potential of being a staple in the MOBA market, maybe one that can make other DEV teams strive to become or even surpass. Thus far, I am having a blast and I already started to make friends on here and the community over all has been really nice to play with. There are a few toxic members, but thats in every gaming community no matter what you do. Now to the one spot where everyone wants to know about. ""Item mall is it buy to win""  Buy to win for me is, you can buy all the best weapons in the game and armor at a premium cost and absolutely tank everything and not be effected by early adopters of the game. It's safe to say or atleast from what I have looked at, you CANT do that here. I was reading in the community hub that it was and had to look myself. There are boosts that are offered to get you more of those pink gems, but that was really all the differences they offer, not the crazy armor and weapon buying that people were claiming in the forums. The boost is pretty much you get additional gems with the completion of certain aspects of the game.  Not really game breaking considering half the people that do this wont be around very long or just don't have the time to keep up on the boosts themselves and let it expire. oh and one more thing, the crafting system is pretty nice and offers a similar experience to that of Warframe. Really nice idea to have something that allows us to make our own armors and weapons. ""Now off to work I go, thank you for reading""  Devs, more game types and a server browser please.			"

												From what I've experienced so far, it's a simple arena style game. Dump the players into a map and fight various modes I assume, as I've only seen Domination so far(Simple king of the hill style of match). The classes have some nice variation, none of which I've seen are very overpowered or game unbalancing. The game has a nifty Crafting feature, which you use to make EVERYTHING; weapons, potions, equipment, etc. You randomly get materials by playing matches, and you can even trade for more somehow I've seen if you don't have enough materials. The only thing I've seen that I don't like so far is that it seems to take an oddly long amount of time to load, both starting up and when loading a match. Everytime the launcher is started, it re-scans the files before you can play, which for me takes 5 minutes. This is the first time I've seen anything use that method of file verification, and it's by no means a pleasant one. I wish they'll fix these sort of things soon, since it seems I personally have to wait 10 minutes or more before I can get into a match from the moment I launch the game.			"

												This game is pretty sweet so far. Especially if you like the way CryEngine 3 sends bodies flying! Sounds aren't bad or annoying and the lighting and textures are very nice. Gameplay wise it plays like a basic light/heavy attack fighting game with block thrown in there to counter the big hits, light to counter block, heavy to counter light. The unlock system reminds me of League of Legends from what I've seen, cash shop items are either *Equipment upgrade items you can learn to craft with in-game currency or all customization. Basically build your own custom looking hero for cash... not too bad, and if I decide to play it for awhile I may look into it.Until you realize that blocking the berzerker is how you kill one, it may frusterate you a bit haha!

												Even if the game isn't the most popular of all, there is still plenty of people to enjoy it. You start your first character: You choose 1 of the 6 available classes at the beginning (2 more classes unlock as you level a character) and then choose your name and you're good to go. You can either choose to do the tutorial (which I think is basic but might help a bit) or start playing for real either in PvP or PvE. If you complete the tutorial, you get some potions and you automatically level up to level 2, which grants you access to a new skill (you can get a new skill every level for free).Now, for the gameplay, I think this game is original. Some might say it's repetitive, but you can always change tactics and team-play with your mates, which is the key to victory as Panzar is a team-based game. Each class has the same base mechanic: left-click for a basic melee attack and right-click for a powerful melee attack, which consumes energy (that replenish by itself or when you attack enemies with a normal attack and blocking, with CTRL. Then, as you level up, you get skills. Every class has really different skills that are useful in different situations. Those skills are placed on one or two skills bar in the bottom of the screen, using the F* keys or the numbers 0 to 9 on the keyboard. You can craft equipment from the materials you gain every time you finish a level, which are used to get more HP and Mastery. Mastery affects every attack and every skill by increasing their power, so they deal more damage. The thing is, even if you got equipment, your skills (real life skills, not the skills/powers in game) will really affect you in a good or bad way. There is no automatic aim and you need to aim your attacks and powers on your enemies by yourself if you want to deal damages.Graphics: Just, WOW. Probably the best graphics ever in a free to play game. Just to give you an idea, Panzar uses the CryEngine 3. Folliage, vegetation, lightning effects and effects in general are stunning. The textures are really good and all of that, maxed out, will require you to have a really good computer. However, I found that very intelligent, I got two computers: A really crappy one and a really good one, but both computers can actually play the game with decent FPS! One one the lowest settings and one on the highest... but, hey, I can still play on a crappy computer! That's an example of what I call a greatly optimized game.Cons: Crafting can be a pain as it requires a lot of time and a lot of ressources after a certain level, but it is still achievable. Another con is that half the players on this game won't really play as a team and mostly result in multiple defeats.Verdict: I really recommend this game and if you're not so sure about it, just try it! It's free after all. I almost have 350 hours on record and I don't even reached max level on any of my characters (max level is 30, which is plenty).I'd give this game a nice 8/10.			"

												The premise of Panzar seemed like it could be a blast to play as I love RPG PvP games. However, after spending some time getting the game installed, updated as well as the times that I could actually finish a match without the game just randomly closing, it became apparent that this game is very shallow in the game-play department and is monetized very heavily.I encountered some problems with installation as well as this game didn't like my anti-virus solution requiring me to disable it during the installation of the game which shouldn't be necessary and is the first time I have had to do so in a very long time.The micro-transactions present in this game make it very much a pay to win game. They allow you to purchase hero levels, gear, consumables, etc which gives those who spend a good amount of money a significant advantage early on and a continued advantage later in the game.The tutorial was very short and is the same for each class save for the 30 seconds where the game allows you to use your class specific ability. For completing the tutorial you get enough experience to level up your character and some potions.The game-play itself felt very unrefined and balanced heavily around melee combat. Attacking felt very inconsistent as to if your strike would actually hit the enemy and blocking seemed very sluggish an unreliable. most class abilities are limited to a few uses before you are out of mana and then have to chug a potion to continue, engage in melee combat regardless if you are playing a melee class or not, or block and hope your team-mates are around to kill them while you recharge your primary resource. Death can take but a few seconds and then you must wait up to 20 to re-spawn.Pros: - It is free to play. - The game looks fantastic. - UI is clean and intuitive. - Shows promise if they can clean up combat and remove micro-transactions that grant characters power. Cons: - Combat felt very wonky. - Perceived low player amount as games I played were frequently not full and teams were lopsided. - I personally encountered installation problems as well as stability issues throughout my play time. - Heavily monetized to the point of Pay to Win.   -- Can purchase hero levels with real money to make character more powerful.   -- Can purchase gear with real money as an alternative to earning and crafting it.   -- Potion (Heath, Mana, and Energy) use is mandatory and you mush craft or purchase them.

												You know, at first I was really not considering downloading this f2p game.  It, to me, was similar to ArcheBlade - which is also f2p and I heartily recommend that.  Sure, there are things to purchase to speed up the time it takes to craft items, you can purchase items for crafting, purchase items outright, purchase 'premium' account time, etc.. but honestly I think they did this right.  The game is quite enjoyable, and some might call it a 'MOBA' game - don't know anything about it, can't compare them.  To me it's like a straight-on PvP (teams) deathmatch with arcane magic, orcs, dwarves, 'steampunkish' weapons, and no lag or stutter or frame rate issues.  Graphics are quite good, and overall it's an enjoyable game, and less demanding on reflexes than ArcheBlade is.  I recommend it.			"

												Feels too clunky, the only damage feedback you have when you hit someone is text based and appears behind your character. When getting hit you almost have no feedback but a bar decreasing on top of the screen. It also felt like it had some lag issues. The only thing it does well is in the graphics department, but graphics only invite testers, you need good gameplay for people to stay hooked.			"

												Well what can I say about another MOBA style game with a pay to play front? The same as any other game. Dont take it serious, this game is all about brute force and how fast to can Power Shot your opponent. First things first: Play with friends. Trust me pre mades and Group fights are quickly a drawn back. Solo is not so great since the game rewards team work.The crafting system reeks of pay to win aspect, with a hint at ""hey if you play long enough you might get that item you want."" Which is ok for my self I dont mind. I dont like the fact that most items during the building/Crafting process take real time to make. Kind of lame and again very pay to win. you can spend money to speed up the process. crafting items are giving by winning and losing matchs. with varying amounts each time. Multiple play thrus will get you closer to that item you want. Skill Tree: muiltple skills with varying abilitys. My healing spells were very good for a rank 2 chacter. Points= EXP: Sadly no real large amounts of points where giving for healing. I healed about 17K one round and only got around 345 points. where as the lead team had about 1200 points. Game seems eager to give more points for Objective and Kills, rather then Support. Sucks but what ev. Graphics: looks very nice but unless you got the RAM to back it up some video LAG and Frame Rate drop because of muitlple players can get u killed. The maps seem repetative but still fun. Why I play it: meh it seemed nice and fun. Laughed alot due to the Ragdoll phys. again dont go with it being any different then other MOBA's. play with friends trust me.			"

												steer clear from this crap. Don't be fooled by cool trailers or screenshots. It looks fine and animations are well above average for a free game (cryengine 3 does some good). That's it. It is clearly made by people who have never played a competitive game in their life. The fights are pure zerg, there's no environment or team awareness whatsoever... plus there's a leveling system, so it looks like you have to farm levels to improve your character, I also heard it's a pay to win. So, looks like all possible flaws are in there. Could there be something good to uncover if you go on playing? I guess I'll never know.			"

												Very Fun times ive had in this game. Let me explain why. The first reason i like this game is the combat system. Who does not like a bash and hit kind of game? There are lots of clases to be and a nice fighting type. It has a nice pvp and players can be nice or downright mean..... But overall i recommend this game!. Its fun and enjoyable. I hope you guys will love the game :)9000/10 IT'S OVER 9000 I hope you like dis game			"

												ММО-боевик — жанр популярный, но несколько однообразный. Какую игру ни возьми, везде перестрелки, пулемёты, гранаты и прочие атрибуты современного треша.Странно, что онлайн игра Panzar — явилась чуть ли не первой удачной попыткой сделать настоящий командный экшен в стиле фэнтези. Хотя идея очень долго витала в воздухе.Панзар - игра бесплатная и от русских разработчиков, что радует, так как проект сделан на мировом уровне, благодаря передовому движку Cry Engin 3 Конечно, это не Crysis с точки зрения физики.Зато всю мощь знаменитого немецкого движка вы можете оценить по графике игры, которая на голову превосходит всё, что я когда-либо видел в онлайне. С первых же минут вы сразу же убедитесь, что Панзар — это удивительно красивая ММО-игра.Рисовка уровней поднята на беспрецедентную высоту. Все текстуры проработаны очень качественно. Подобную графику не часто встретишь даже в современных офлайн-играх, чего уж говорить об онлайне, где модельки из десяти полигонов и локации, от которых вытекают глаза, вполне привычное явление.В Панзаре же мы видим совершенно иную картину - если это снег, то виден каждый сугроб, если это луга, то видно, как переливается на солнце буквально каждая травинка, если вода — то живая, журчащая, бегущая меж камней, скалы так и хочется пощупать, а уж какие здесь деревья! Прорисован каждый листочек, каждая иголочка на сосне. Причём пропорции персонажей и окружающего мира абсолютно реалистичны.Но графика — это ещё не вся игра, скажете вы, и будете правы. "

												panzar is a tipe of game where its really hard to get a kill on youre own, the swordsman doesnt give a lot of damage, the orc is really slow, the mage is weak af, and the trol is weak and doesnt make a lot of damage. The developers worked more over the crafting then the gameplay.....which sucks. But the game maps are actually not bad and it does get fun a lot of times so i give it a 9/11			"

												Panzar is a truly unique game in its genre.You get to choose to play from 8 different classes unique in their own way to fit your playstyle. There are over 10 maps to play on which will give you alot of different positions and strategies to maximize your characters potential.Quick and responsive fighting.If you are looking for a epic fantasy adventure then i'd say panzar is definetely worth trying out. I would recommend panzar to any multiplayer action game fan! "

												If you are looking to play without paying, this game is probably not for you. While the gameplay itself is fine, the crafting system turned me off immediately. It toes the line of pay-to-win as close as possible, sometimes crossing it. You can buy gear with Crystals (premium currency). Or you can play a bunch of matches in hopes for the materials you need to craft a single piece. the act of crafting a single piece of level 1 gear (not counting farming the materials) is between 10 minutes to 1 hour. You can also circumvent the crafting time by paying Crystals as well. Need potions? Hope you have materials and time because you are crafting them. It preys hard on the player's patience.Gameplay, graphics, and map design are all rather good for a free to play. The mechanics of earning class points to cast powerful abilities is rewarding. The first time standing on the capture point as it rises up while the arena falls into lava was memorable. I was prepared to grit my teeth and bear the terrible crafting system until I imagined further down the line where a single piece of equipment could potentially take weeks to aquire. By the time I would aquire a SINGLE piece of level 1 gear, I would hit level 4 and a whole new set of materials and gear becomes available for crafting (or purchasing). I uninstalled shortly afterwards.			"

												This game SUCKS alot of microtransactions because of the random crafting system, only players are russian, the amount of lag this game gives is so unreal it puts some of the worst games to shame. So with that siad it does have potential but the devs need to make mroe servers, fix the lag, make the game less pay to win, and just give more content overall. If you do have some good stuff and find a match without lag with people you can actually talk to then it can be fun and that is the most dissapionting thing is just how much fun you COULD have. Until the game gets better just leave it to rot.			"

												The game itself is great and worth a try specialy being free to play. However I agree it is pay to win. At first I was in denial about it being pay to win but after spending countless hours on the crafting I can tell you confidently it is pay to win and it for some reason the creators feel different regions should have access to different content and pay discrimination. With a little elbow grease the game can be great.EDIT: NO GAMES FOUND/NOBODY ON GLOBAL CHAT/ UNINSTALL GARBAGE			"

												Just a few thoughts on the game after the inital 30 minutes.- Just downloaded this game. It's riddled with display bugs - I set my resolution to 1920x1080 and I was unable to remove my cursor from the screen while in game. I set the resolution to 1600x900 - windowed mode, and the same issue persisted. - The combat is very clunky, and blood flys from your SWORD rather than the ENEMY you attack, very weird.- Some of the UI is cut off on the bottom, you can only see half of your icons on the hot bar which makes it frustrating to see which hotbar icons you are clicking or pressing via keyboard. - The game itself is visually appealing, and very pretty. Models are great, and the character design is very intuitive. Character creation is similar to WoW/MMO-like.Overall, very good visual state, just some lacking issues with the video displays, UI, and mouse overlay.			"

												The game really needs more doing. Visual side is beautiful but the gameplay is hell. Starting with 10min queue and ending with absence of minimap which can be realy anoying in the not so straightforward maps. Also I dont see the reason for showing how much dmg you are doing if there is no lifebars. Also if you spend several games gathering random resources, trading them for the ones you need (with painful exchange rate) and the loose it all in 70ish% chande for success can be really anoying. It also seems to me that the frost mage class is a lot imbalaced.I played the game for some 5-6 hours (most time waiting for the matches) and I am not impressed. Seems like the developers put incedible amount of effort to grafics which is just great, but in the expanse of gameplay. And in my oppinion  gameplay matters the most in MOBA style games.Maybe I'll come back when they improve it more.			"

												This game is a load of fun and when you actually get into a match it's amazing. It does have some pay to win features but I never paid for it and easily led teams all the time. One major thing you have to be concerned about is that either 1. The matchmaking system is way too specific. Or 2. There is nobody playing it. Either way getting into matches usually takes me at least 20 minutes, and that's at what I consider peak hours. If matches took 5 minutes or less I wouldnt have much negative things to say about this game.			"

												The game is decent, but because there are potions, you can face opponents that just spam potions. Matchmaking is horrible, you can be level 1 facing level 10, with no way to do anything to them. The crafting is real time based, and you can spend real money to skip the timer. All the items that impact gameplay can be crafted, as well as purchased with real money. The opponents can block frontal attacks, but turning is faster than running behind, so they in 1v1 they can pretty much block you and wait for help to arrive. The game focused more on zerging than individual play. It's free so feel free to try it yourself. I quit after 3 games.			"

												Bland and dull. It's simply a constant deathmatch, with some classic handheld ""f2p""-elements chucked in. To make matters worse, it took me an hour to get it to install and properly (SLI rig). It also has a habit of just acting wierdly, such as displaying the mouse cursor at random times. Tutorial is a three minute runthrough that apparently explains some lore. Besides the standard ""use WSAD"" to move, there's not much else being explained, such as class or game mechanics. I really tried giving the benefit of doubt, but after the fifth crash and tenth ""failed to install third party component"" I just gave up.All in all, 2/5. Could have been good, but in the end fails to deliver anything but a badly implemented CryEngine.			"

												After booting the game up I met my first problem: the game wasn't scaling correctly for my ordinary monitor (BenQ G2450HM) so I had these black bars that covered my bottom abilities bar. So I changed to resolution to 1920x1080 and that didn't help at all. The game still has these weird black bars on every side and it looks cramped. Sure, I could see my abilities bar again but why can't the game be put on full screen? Why does it have to make it smaller and screw up my firefox on my second monitor? (BenQ GW2450HM) Christ almighty what a bad start.Ignoring those issues I thought that perhaps the game would be better. OH BOY WAS I MISTAKEN.The first 10 seconds into my game, it just stopped completely. It just shut down and Steam syncronized as it does when you close a game. Fine. I boot it up again. This time I got to do my character but then it crashed immediately. Great. So I go into the forums and apparently, I'm not the only one who gets constant crashing. So I do what they say: validate files on Steam. Sure enough the game has to download 54 missing files! Uuuh? What? Then my launcher tells me I have to download an additional 100mb of update. The game has been out since the 12th of April 2013. Perhaps time to step up your game development team?So after all that baloney I finally make my Dwarf Cannoner. I enter the the tutorial AAAND it crashes. WHOPPIE. What a fantastically optimized game. I launch it again and this time, I am able to play through the tutorial and get to the end. By the way, perhaps you should nerf the guards who defend the gate? Since they one hit the zombies and you can barely get a swing at the zombies before they die, I don't see why there is such a rush to help them defend. They could exterminate the entire tutorial island without an issue and still be back for tea time.After that god awful tutorial I click the big red button that says PLAY!My first map is the one with the lava that comes up from time to time. I rush out with my team and set up a machinegun so I can blast away the enemies. Except the gun does pretty much zero damage and I overheat my gun and get killed. My camera goes absolutely bananas when the lava starts coming up and then the game crashes! Majestical performance.I boot up the game and immediately press play and jump into a game. Before I go any further, is there some secret that I don't understand about respawning? I got into a fight and killed some mentalist guy and he respawned before I could set up my turret as a Dwarf cannoner. As I was building it, the same guy ""bootlord"" or something, came running up to me and bashed my head in. While my respawn timer was nearly 19 seconds long. He on the other hand had plenty of time running around, slaughtering my team. I saw no way of respawning faster or anything! I played the entire round but we got steam rolled since ""Bootlord"" or whatever his name was constantly ran out from spawn after he died and pretty much handed our poor, uncoordinated butts to us.Con's:-Can't handle 1920x1080 for some reason, ugly black bars and messes up my second monitor-Crashes if I try to play it-Energy bar is wack, drains if you jump while running at the exact same speed as running(!)-Who thought that having a fixed camera angle to your corpse on a moving platform was a good idea?-You need to update it several times before you can get it working for less then 20 minutes-Pay 2 win-Really glitchy hitboxes, Oh Mr. Orc, your swing hit my despite the fact that I was behind another character? GreatPro's:Easy to uninstall and especially easy to exit since the game does it for youAvoid at all costs. The grinding isn't even fun.			"

												For as long as i've played the game continued to die, little by little, soon, it took 30 minutes just to get 1 match. Not only that but the crafting system became worse and worse, making grinding almost worthless because the better gear you wanted to try and craft, the more the game would ♥♥♥♥ on your dream because chances are you're going to get nothing at higher levels, not only that but the armor and weapons themselves hardly got upgrades, just almost negligable increases in health, mana and damage.

												This game pits you in PvP combat with mediocre gameplay. The weak gameplay wouldn't be too bad on its own since the teamwork part of gameplay isn't all that bad. Where the game really fails is its leveling and gear mechanic. You start at level 1 and are pit against players of all different levels. You have to level to gain power in a vertical climb which is made even worse by the gear which enhances everything about your character. To make matters worse, gear is crafted using random drops from PvP matches (the game ONLY has PvP). It'smuch simpler to buy the game's cash shop currency and get an entire set of gear for your level, however, leaving new players at the mercy of those who are willing to shell out cash. It's very unlikely you'll manage to get the materials you need to get gear at your level to survive in combat, so you'll spend hours getting one shot and bashed in the face by players who are higher level and have better gear. The game is a practice in masochism in both its leveling, gear crafting, and weak gameplay. I do not recommend that anyone play this unless they're willing to shell out cash to stay on an even battlefield with other players.This review was made at the behest of a player who countered my argument of, ""If a player doesn't enjoy the game from the beginning, why would they suffer it until it stopped being terrible?"" with, ""You're an idiot.""

Getting into a game with several classes is practicly impossible - 30 minute waiting for a game is not that everyone can handle. 2 minutes just to check for updates, so when i tried to just get it running, it took 2 hours from my life, and half of that was just because of the scanning that must be done EVERY SINGLE TIME, nevermind that you just checked 5 secs ago. OK, got it running (atlast), created a character, tried to play a tutorial, crashes again (after 30 minutes of searching for cure, found out that the game doesnt support certain properties of nvidia, fixed it no prob), i get into a game again, and to get you guys understand what i'm talking about is 5 minutes loading screen on my powerful PC. SO after 2 hours i run the game, create a character with a class i dont admire, quite an unpopular one, and i start searching for a MATCH. And i'm stuck on loading time once more, now 15 minutes of loading have passed already and there is no response what so ever in that regard.

Controls feel responsive, although if not for the hit marker you wouldn't be even able to tell whether you hit somebody or not, becouse it feels like you are swinging in the air. Gameplay is fun, although most of the time it's steamrolling becouse everyone either uses tanks to spam and blitz win, or they spam with turrets which is no fun for the most part. The game itself however does offer many customization options in the means of armor, character looks and powers. It has a forging system which is tedious becouse it requires you to farm materials, and that takes time. And of course you can pay real money and level and equip your character fully as it is in the most games, which makes the game kinda P2 win. But for a F2P game it has a lot of potential and is at times extremely fun to play.			"

												Mixed feelings about this one. I liked the class selection and found that each class was reasonably balanced, but the game does a lot of F2P elements that I dislike. Crafting is done via real time, so it can take hours (maybe days) to craft new equipment for your character. There are a number of other things that give off the feeling of pay2win. To be fair, I didn't spend a whole lot of time with the game, so I could be mistaken on that. The gameplay is basically King of the Hill with some variation depending on the map you are on. Hit detection is pretty weak (making it hard to determine if you're actually hitting your targets) and the animations are poor. The player-to-player collision is frequently obnoxious, because it allows you to push your allies around (or be pushed) and allies are often in the way. The game also follows the unfortunate trope of half-naked female characters.Overall, I had some fun playing it, but I can't really see myself going back for more.			"

												Lovely idea, good looking. The transition between animations feels really unpleasant, as does the lack of impact. With more responsivle controls and a greater feeling of ""oomph"" in combat, would be really good fun to grind up your character. The fact you have to go through all the text in each cutscene is indicative of the lack of polish.			"

												I gave it the length of a regular feature film, about 90 minutes, before I decided it was a terrible waste of time.Starting with the Pay to Win features... from level 1-4 took those 90 minutes. You are able to craft gear, or buy it with real money. The crafting requires loot given at the end of matches, as well as a time restriction. By the time I had reached level 4 I was only able to craft 2/6 level 1 pieces of gear. Level 4 is the next tier for equipment, and I had reached it before having even HALF of the level 1 equipment crafted. Whereas if I spent real money, everything would just be mine... and I could go on to melt faces with my wallet protected character.Now the classes... I enjoy healing so I normally play support. In Panzar the healer is the Paladin... very low damage and very low survivability (As he can't heal himself unless healing others, and the self-heal is maybe 10% of what others are healed for). So basically any opponent who is paying attention can kill you fairly quickly. Gameplay is basically horribly imbalanced.Now for the player base. Many players just seem to ignore objectives and run into the closest fight. Players with experience never share it, they simply call everyone noobs when the team starts to lose. No advice or direction, no leadership... just insults.  It's basically like any online PvP oriented game.I would give this game a 3/10. Good ideas but a horrible execution.And my absolute least favourite thing is jumping. The jumping animation for character is terrible. Worst jumping I have ever seen.			"

												Panzar is a chaotic world where four ""Ancient Races"" are caught in eternal combat for no reason. Mankind, Orcs, Dwarves, and, the most Ancient Race of all,Womankind,Have all joined forces to immediately divide themselves into the juvenile dichotomy of Red Team and Blue Team. The freakish similarity between every character coupled with their indispensibility leads me to believe that both teams are comprised solely of clones.			"

												Beautiful game, but the combat is horribly dry. It utilizes simple attacks and 'power' attacks, alongside several class-specific abilities that grow in number and power as your character progresses in levels. Unfortunately, the attack have very little 'weight' behind them, and typically one on one combat is devolved to strafing while tossing out little and big hits and the occasional burp of an ability. The fact there are currently no North American servers in operation is also a deterrant to American, Canadian and so on players that seek a PvP experience with a PING level promoting completely even playing grounds. Also refer to that fact that equipment can be outright bought with real life money, thus possibly leading you to combat peers with armor leagues ahead of what you could have possibly acquired without paying. This game is a neat concept with outstanding visuals, but the gameplay falls just short of being worth an extended commitment of time for your typical PvP-game hungry gamer.			"

												Absolute pay to win garbage.  In most MOBAs you get a hero with abilities that you level up throughout a match. In this one you level up by playing matches and gain permanent abilities on your account.  It's a grind fest which starts off insanely inequal with matches being decided almost entirely by who has more newer players on it.Feels a lot like Warhammer Online: Wrath of Heroes... and that's not a good thing.  Hit detection is just really off.Do not waste your time with this guy.  It won't take you too long to realize it just wasn't worth installing.			"

												One match is all it took to crush any fun I may have had with this game, the UI is atrocious and the mouse is quite aggravatingly in the way, the movement is near crawling and sprint lasts only for the briefest of moments. There are no protected spawns, You can easily be base ♥♥♥♥♥ and not have any hope of stopping it. The classes are also quite unclear, as the Paladin/Healer gets the unlockable skill for a bow, The bow is also very annoying, it does very little damage and has no visible marking to where it will land unlike any other weapon you possess, The bow is the only thing I've seen without a reticule that needs it.The pace of the game was sluggish and quite a drag, though the artstyle is fine.Oh, and it's Pay to Win as well.

												The concept isn't bad, but the game needs a lot of work. The characters seem to move in slow motion, so there is really no way to attack someone without getting hit in return, which means whoever has more hitpoints when the fight starts pretty much wins by default. The animations are a joke, your character can't really jump without looking like he's trying to fake a moon landing, but for some reason he sniffs his pits every 5 seconds, then wretches at the stench. I guess pit sniffing took priority over smooth combat animations.The class balance is completely worthless, the tank class is essentially immune to ranged attacks, so since every single match is won by controlling a wide open control point whichever team has more tanks has an absurdly huge advantage. You simply can't win if your team consists of a majority of ranged characters, the win condition is controlling a point, and the enemy unit that does it can't be hurt from a distance. Healers can't heal themselves, so they are completely worthless unless your team has 2 of them that can heal each other, as the enemy will single out and kill a lone healer in seconds every time. Frost mages can freeze you solid, then kill you before you have any real chance to react. The slow animations really rear their ugly head when an enemy is using a highly telegraphed PbAoE spell that you absolutely need to avoid and you're simply unable to waddle out of its range or interrupt it before it hits you.One look at the team compositions will tell you who wins the match every single time. Since the reward for winning is twice what you get for losing it's extremely frustrating to rarely ever have a close match.This game is also the worst kind of Free to Play there is. From the moment you start the game it's clear that it is built to frustrate you unless you pay. Everything worthwhile is purchased with their premium resource. Whether or not you can get items without paying for premium is pure luck, as you have to construct them from resources that randomly drop from matches. The only upside is that the premium services are cheap, but the game itself simply isn't good enough to bother with.			"

The female character doesnt wear any protective clothes , shes basically in a bikini and her butt is way out of proportion. Animations of other players always seemed to jump and the combat is very dull at the start since your limited to 2 abilities. This is not a good free to play action game, Look for others , like Vindictus ( which is PvE but its combat is still a thousand times better.).			"

												The game should really have been a Diablo 2 style co-op adventure with a similar FTP model to path of exile, that would have been considerably better than this. It's a great looking game, The design behind the characters is slightly odd, but beautifully rendered none the less. However the PVP combat is the focus and its unfortunately terrible.Feel free to download if you really enjoy tight messy battles where all you do is left or right click.Just bear in mind this is just another fancy looking money sponge.2/10 "

												Do you like to wait upwards of 20 minutes for a match to play for less than 10?Do you like players not doing the objective but playing team deathmatch every game?Do you like matches being horribly one sided due to the ♥♥♥♥ matchmaking?Do you like waiting half a day to upgrade armour like some mobile game?Do you like waisting your time playing an unfinished game?If you answered yes to all of the above then this game is for you.If you answered no to any of these i recommend avoiding it by all costs.

												Its not my type of game but i know some people who would enjoy stratigic games like this, in my opinion if it didnt have mages or spells or whatever itd be fun.

												Poor optimization, poor controls, gender locked classes, no customization.

												I do not recommend this game.Much has been said and shown about the excellent character designs... there are four of them. The art direction itself isn't bad at all, and the animations are really really nice! But that's the only good part of the game.The gameplay itself is messy at best. Very short tutorial that explains the obvious, nearly no ingame feedback, high delay between action and effect (because, u no... animations!!). It is NOT a funny multiplayer game to handle. War of the roses has a far tighter multiplayer experience.And as any ""good"" free to play, expect nice pay to win! Yay...			"

Been in the chat these past few days and seems that from lvl 8 on you could be waiting for a game to pop, could take 10-20 mins or even longer if your around lvl 20.

												Played for about 2 hours and could not keep me self from uninstalling. Looks good, but combat is clunky and floaty. Has some bad glitches for a 3rd person combat system. Balance is a big issue. The business model is a pay to win style with being able to pay money to ""finish"" your characters levels, and pay money for a full item set. Item crafting is bad, takes a long time to get items you need to craft and if you don't find them on the battlefield, from what i saw, u can't craft.			"

												The Simple way to sum up Panzar is Arena Combat.Anyone who has played games will know what the main flaw of most arena combat style games is: Repetitiveness!!!!Even with the multiple classes and Rpg leveling elements after a few dozen matches of Panzar you will have seen and done everything there is to do in the game.On a positive note the combat is fluid and has its intense moments. The graphics are colorful with the animations and sound being sufficient.However there just isn't enough game here even for a free-to-play.Long before you win your 50th match and slay opponent 300 you will be wishing for something more to do and sadly will find little.

												While I am aware that this game has recently been released to steam I must confess that it is among the poorer quality of free games available. My experience was unfortunately buggy, laggy and generally un-fulfilling in most general regards. There are some positive aspects to this game, unique mechanics that I've not seen before. But until the gameplay errors and general bugginess of the game are improved, I'll be shelving it.			"

After 3 games I hadnt got enough materials to make 1 potion but I slightly use between 5-10 potions per game. Buying 1 potion costs 1 diamond (roughly 150 gold) and I made 12 gold in total for those 3 games.So in 60 games I can buy 1 potion, unless I dont get the right material to craft one.

Game is incomplete with high amounts of lag in-game and super long load times. Playing this makes me yawn and fall asleep. Gameplay is boring at best with little to no skill involved. Lacks a polished feel with many animations lacking a sound effect. Fullscreen is flawed and does not fit the size of your screen, resolution problems. Has a pay-to-win system inside.Let me reiterate, A COMPLETE WASTE OF 5 HOURS.			"

												Holy ♥♥♥♥ this game is terrible. The animation quality ingame is horrendous, and you can actually count the pixels on the models. The balance isnt any better either, with the frost witch having the ability to do an aoe freeze that slows you by a ridiculous amount, then stuns you for about 6 seconds, then slowing you again for about 10 seconds when you thaw. The only objective is king of the hill, which consists of just a bunch of tanks and healers squatting on the point with shields up, stopping all the projectiles, and then massacreing whoever gets close. Meanwhile, any ranged combat outside of a stationary turret frm the basically engineer deals 0 damage essentially. Don't play this game, it's a waste of harddrive space.			"

												Please dont bother trying this. A complete waste of time. Takes forever to download the game from steam, and still has to install alot of additional patches. Game is incomplete with high amounts of lag in-game and super long load times. Playing this makes me yawn and fall asleep. Gameplay is boring at best with little to no skill involved. Lacks a polished feel with many animations lacking a sound effect. Fullscreen is flawed and does not fit the size of your screen, resolution problems. Has a pay-to-win system inside.Let me reiterate, A COMPLETE WASTE OF 5 HOURS.			"

												Bad voice acting, I dislike the combat system. Same combat system as every other Multiplayer Fantasy-type game. Use 1,2,3,4 etc. to use abilities, blah blah blah. The graphics are great if you have a medium-high end PC and you can play it even with a really low-end PC. There's a setting called ""Back to the 90s"" and it makes the quality so bad, that you can pretty much play it on anything as long as it has a graphics card. The name also bugs me, Panzar? It even SOUNDS like a horrible game.Sadly, I wouldn't try this game, it's just another one of those really bad free steam games.			"

												A lot of potential - but for now... SloppyInitial Thoughts:This game look great, interface is clean and easy to navigate. Queues are way to long with no real indication that the game is doing anything. I thought my system was slow loading at first but then I realized it was just the game rounding up players. PvP gameplay leaves a lot to be desired. Enemy tags sometimes show up late and since you are playing folks from all around the world there is latency issues. It is kind of chaotic at times. Doesnt feel as if you are doing any damage because there is no significant reaction to a successful hit, a small combat text is shown but it feels soft. A bunch of orcs swinging away on a capture point feels sloppy. If the devs went and played SMITE - copied their queue system and took notice to their combat - this game would be gold. Otherwise, I feel it will just fade away into nothingness.			"

												Can't even say I got a good chance to play this game enough. First game I glitched out, and second game froze up and game crashed. Ok so 3rd time, 3rd party (where no healers actually help you, lucky you get potions) I win and get some exp, oh wait 50% reduction in exp because ""I quit 2 times"" but really it wasn't my fault.Graphics are good, game mechanics seems interesting. I like the idea of team based games but... the match making is random (like COD BO2 team death match). Havent seen a healer actually heal, instead run into mobs and die. That and constant confusion and dazed skills the monsters have. It makes the game very frustrating and very time consuming.I'd consider playing more if there was North american server with people who read and write english. If I give this game another chance ( 5 games all frustrating and annoying), it will be healer class since it seems most healers can solo the map and not help the team? Uninstall final answer.

												It just feels weird, silly animations along with some very strange character design. And no people are not wrong when they say that it, like many games these days, although being free-to-play is pay-to-win. You can craft items, and wait real time for them to finish crafting OR you can instantly buy them with crystal-looking things that you can, of course, purchase with real money. I'm not really sure what this game is trying to be, but as an amalgum of it's part as a whole, it is just a weird experience and not one i'll be going back to.			"

												I played this game for a few hours under advices of friends who were really excited about it. Well, i tried it on the European server and i was immediately alerted by the limitations it has compared to the russian and american server (like 10 level minus, but the shop is updated with the american and russian ones, so there's this discrepancy). The game has also an high CPU/Ram requirement despite the description, causing crashes without alerts if the game exceed the pc limitations. I played a class a bit, then tried to delete the character and... 3 days of waiting to re-use the same name (maybe for the character spam). I created another character and i wrongly skipped the tutorial, which has no replayability and if you don't play it for the first time you have a good disadvantage on level and starting consumables. The game has also an high Pay to win dependency, having a 2€ cost if you want to respec (you can choose max 20 skill points over 30 because of the limitations, and if you fail you absolutely need to respec), amulets so difficult to craft and so important for the battle that should be bought and huge crafting times that can be reduced by, even here, paying. Last but not least, as every game born outside of steam and then re-adapted to it, it has account problems; you can't link your steam account with the official panzar site one, and vice versa, causing you to obviously use the steam system to buy those crystals and cannot use the official site to administrate your steam account.Classes, skill points and statistics are done well, but you can't create a game only using new abilities, classes and maps not caring about the rest of the game.Sadly i do not recommend this game. It could have so much potential if fixed well			"

												After 5 hours of playing it I am unsure how I feel about Panzar. I tried PVE from start as I thought it would ease me into the game but I found it so damn difficult, that was PVE on easy mode, die respawn die reaspawn like a really bad raid in WOW. PVP was too chaotic. Did I mention that 80% of players are Russian so you won't be able to communicate with them. No idea why they did not make European severs for the West.Also the queue takes forever, can't go in it for PVP and PVE one or the other and whilst waiting you cannot use the foge, check character items skills etc to pass the time, you have to wait and look at the screen.I will give it a few more goes and if no satidaction it will get uninstalled.

												This game has the potential to be pretty fun. Its a free game so I shouldnt complain BUT, there seem to be more annoying things about this game than is worth ones time. I've crashed 5 or 6 times inexplicably (i just reached lvl 2), the voice acting is just absolutely GOD awful (once again, i know..free game, but better nothing than what rubbish they've done). I feel I spent more time at a loading screen than playing the game and lastly but not leastly, the combat feels very insubstantial. It doesnt feel like im doing much to someone when I power attack them and smash them right across the face, despite all the blood it -feels- as if I barely tickled my opponent.A lovely -looking- game, but running locked at 24fps and feeling as tinny as it does, ehhhh might just give it a miss.

												i can't reccommend the game only because there are some pretty long wait times, 2-3 and upwards minutes a battle. i spent at least 40% of my time in game in front of a load screen. it does seem p2w, you craft ur armor and such, in order to do so you need to upgrade it with materials for the gems or what have you. pve is not pve, it's like scenario's in wow. pvp is pvp. i liked the graphics though, it may just be my card but the graphics weren't as high resolution as those images in steam either, but not bad. could be more tolerable if the load times were less, then you might enjoy a whole night of pvp or check out more pve, but that factor alone discourages trying to get further into the game.

												Played it for like 50 mins the graphics are really nice & the idea like crafting gear in a arena fighter and spell tree.Thats really about it i found the game hugely boring slow paced no skills really you have 1 attack so most of the time you are holding lmb and pressing block when ever needed and ocasionally pressing the rmb when you get a power up. The maps i played in the time where simply awful also, no hiding spots or anything really two spawns each corners of the map and very little inbetween. The tutorial was laughable basically nothing happened it wasn't very informative of anything like the crafting system. At the start you are not able to craft anything like a starter set of armour so you are basically running around in nothing at all especially if you are the spell slingers what by the way if you are trying to make them look attractive change the face because they just look strange. Another thing in the main menu there was like 5 advertisements to buy their currency and you could actually level up ingame using this currency what's simply stupid in a game. The game also what i've heard and what i can now tell as you can also buy ingame gear what's also very silly as the main purpose of the game is to get gear? Also i found that 90% of the games i joined 12 year old kids where spamming their microphones giving me a headache mite of just been the 3 games that i played.Avoid this game maybe try it just for a laugh. I don't even know why this has been brought to steam.Also one bug that was REALLY annoying what i encountered was there was my mouse constantly on my screen but i sorted it by pressing T then esc.

												Its pay to win.. but 'eventualy' you could earn the top end gear.  But that would take months for a single character,  and then it would be a full time job playing the game just to keep your consumables stocked.   It suffers from several classes being easily 1hit ko'ed which is frustrating.  In addition some classes such as the gunner can be shut down completly in such a way that you will not actualy earn any points for having played a 15 min match.After adding in a que time from anywhere between 30 seconds to 30 minutes when just starting out, this game really is just ridiculous			"

												At first, the gameplay is pretty fun with a nice difficulty and the graphics are nice, but it became obvious really fast that it's just a bunch of pay to win garbage. A person who doesn't want to spend a ton on micro-transactions is put at a severe disadvantage. You can pay to do literally everything - not just cosmetic stuff, but items that boost your performance, and even just straight up paying for levels. On any given screen outside the arena, there are a dozen prompts to spend money via micro-transactions.			"

												Panzar's gameplay is Basically Stock MMORPG PVP Que's Wrapped up in the gorgeous Cry Engine 3 and for everything it does right it falls flat on something else.The Art style and theme bring enough to a simple game to feel as if it was a part of something bigger... But seemingly everything is ripped straight out of Warhammer it's comepletely amazing that this even got on steam with this much stuff completely ripped off.the Animations are well made. but there is a complete lack of feedback in mellee and ranged combats.The free to play model is fair, but you will quickly hit a point where sinking money into ""premium time"" is clearly the only way the games progression is balanced.There is plenty of gear slots and assorted things to slot into your gear. but there are only really 2 primary Stats to increaseThere are time sinks scattered through the crafting and upgrade systems that feel straight out of an iphone game and seem to only be in place to bait out the inevitible ""ah ♥♥♥♥ it ill spend real money to skip this"" you are also at the complete mercy of RNG with crafting mats rewarded after each match for......something.. there are no side objectives or anything to really influence how you get these.. just keep playing and hope.The Maps are really nice, most of them have moving components and other little quicks that bring some variety in how they are played out.. if only half of the modes where put together correctly. Maps like the Siege of ♥♥♥♥ing orc monkey village is backwards... and has the attacking team already in the castle and pushing out for what will always end up as a 45 minute meat grinder as there is no real way for defencive teams to win on any siege mode maps unless your teams composition completely ♥♥♥♥♥ on the attackers.i dont reccomend this one. At its core, this is a 5th of your typical mmorpg with an emphisis on milking fans of the genre for as long as they are oblivious to the massive flaws in the overall experience. 10/10goty's "

												I try to look past the over-the-top graphical glitches and I see a game with potential, but all I felt during my time with this game was pain. The easy difficulty in PvE was obscenely powerful. I found myself dying incredibly often without so much as five or more kills. The first wave wasn't so bad, but every wave afterward bombards you with stun-locking enemies, suicidal enemies, quick and cowardly ranged enemies, and unexpectadly weak bullet-sponge ""boss"" enemies.I'd like to make a more thorough review of this game, but my screen was being taken up by a stretched texture so large that everything in front of my character was an alternating two-tone grey screen.

												This game has potential. The gameplay is fun and active. The character development is interesting and I look forward to playing with friends. Here is the kicker, It wont let me play with my friends, we have checked setting after setting. If it's a server thing, the game will not let you change it, let alone give you an option. After giving up trying to play with friends, it takes forever to get into a game. My average wait time is 25 minutes. There are problems with how it all works but your gameplay will be fun and challenging. In its current state, and I can't stress that statement enough, I would pass on this game. The constant reminder of playing with frineds and not be able to find them and the wait time, were I can play another game while waiting for this one, make this just about unbearable to play. In the future with a couple more patches this may be a great game for some casual gaming and I will be watching this just to have that moment.			"

												The game has all the makings of a top contender how ever it has one fatal flaw. The game is majorly underpopulated and there is no ability to play PVE on your own. This will often mean you can be waiting HOURS to play one game. No thats not a mistake my first game took me waiting 55 minutes to join a single game that ended up finishing about 30 seconds later.Do not waste your time downloading atm as the current server system is poorly maintained and the matchmaking system in place does not work for such a game when it has only a hand full of active players. The best thing this game could do is bring in a proper PC server list rather than a poorly created matchmaking console system			"

												I gave this game a try due to some positive reviews of other players, however I was disappointed. I tried the beserker class (damage dealer, melee)The graphic is okay, but not awesome.The controls are sluggish. It takes some practice to anticipate the enemies hit boxes correctly and fight effectively.You have two main currencies: rubies in exchange for real money, and gold which is earned with each match you play.I say ""main currencies"" because there is something else which the game calls ""ingredients"" or ""crafting material"" which is also earned with each match you play. If you are on ""VIP""-mode (costs real life money) you get more. These materials are used for crafting new equipment. Since the material you get is generated randomly after each match this is rather useless. They could have left out this kind of ""currency"" and replace it simply with the gold as well. It's just something which I would call a ""fake-feature"".Crafting new equipment takes a lot of material. You get the possibility to craft new equipment by increasing your char level (done by experience gain through playing). While ""light"" and ""medium"" equipment seems achieveable in a reasonable amount of time, the best quality level ""unique"" takes material for which you can farm easily 50-100 matches (each match takes between 5 and 20 minutes). Then you have hopefully gathered enough material for one (1) crafting attempt. Yes, right, an ""attempt""! For the ""fun"" of it you only have a -chance- of succeeding the crafting attempt. 70% for ""light"" gear, 50% for ""medium"" gear and 20% for ""unique"" gear, which only translates into even longer material gathering. If course you can increase the crafting chance, if you are willing to invest some rubies (money).Now comes the real absurd part: You can as well buy any equipment for a relatively small amount of rubies (real life money) instant.That is my major problem: Your choice is to spend hours over hours farming for materials for an item or you give in to the temptation and just buy the wanted item. The problem is the comparativeness. The pricing always suggest to just buy what you want, but why playing this game at all if I just by anything I could achieve? For me the game makes itself obsolete in this way.Add other factors like character designs which you can buy only for rubies (money) and which add ""+xx.x% experience"".Add other equipment which you can only buy for rubies (not craftable) and in addition have their lifetime limited to 3, 7 or 30 days, which means if you want a top equipped character, you *will* have to invest in the game regularly.Add consumables like heal potions which are also available for rubies (money) and if you don't have them, you can imagine the disadvantage on the battlefield.So at the bottom note let me say: This game leaves you no chance to make up a missing investment by very good or very extensive playing. Forget it! Since this is a PvP game (with some PvE side-content) you need to be top equipped to have a fair chance against others and this requires you to invest money - regularly!If you want to play to achieve access to better equipment and enjoy character progression, you will be frustrated and I suggest you stay away.If you just play for fun (PvP) without extras and you have no problem investing money regularly in order to keep your character in top shape, you can give this game a try.

												I can truly say this game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, i mean, aren't you just tired of these ice witches using an unstoppable spell that freezes everyone around her and you can NOT run away from it even if you are 2 meters from her... even a strong attack can't do anything. When you chase an opponent there is no way to take him down by melee even if you're obviously faster than him. Yeah, one time a guy runs away, okay, fine i ♥♥♥♥ed up, the second time he runs away, just because when someone is attacked, there is ZERO speed penalty...Plus, it's pay to win, just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, pretty much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.The game could be a fine piece of work, but the lack of balance and very, very vile matchmaking (You win two or one match,  the matchmaking starts giving you potato-head allies, and you lose 5 matches one after another) really pisses me off.The worst thing is, the game is too fun to just walk away from it like that. But you can't really have fun, when you see your team RUN INTO ♥♥♥♥ING MIDDLE OF THE BATTLE EVEN IF THEY ARE NOT A TANK OR STURM CLASS!♥♥♥♥ING RAGEQUIT.I JUST ♥♥♥♥ING RAGEQUITTED IT AND UNINSTALLED.Please, don't waste your time on it.

												This game looks great, but it plays like garbage. The controls are oversimplified, with nothing beyond a few class-based abilities as well as the standard hit/heavy/block. Despite this being a game about combat, there is no kill counter, or clear way of knowing how effective you are actually being. To add to this game's problems, the crafting system is needlessly draconian, and, though I only played a dozen matches or so, it SEEMS that there is heavy P2W at work. Its free, so I wont tell you not to buy it, but if you've got limited bandwidth, you're better off just watching Netflix.			"

												After being forced to play tutorial which should have been optional this game forced me into spending attribute point on first skill then forces you to join a pvp match. You cannot click on any other tab or even the settings menu. You can't even return to character select and the only way to quit was to ctrl+alt+del and end process. Problem is once joining the pvp load screen it just sits there waiting. I couldn't find a single match so I don't reccomend it baed on the fact only the tutorial seems to work. Either that or everyone who plays is passed the first lv bracket therefore matchmaking can't find you a match. I never even got a chance to play. BROKEN ♥♥♥♥ING DESIGN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!			"

												Let's start off with that this game has huge potential and is incredibely fun to play. I love the mechanics of how certain classes can counter other classes which balances it just fine, unless your team doesn't cooperate, but otherwise it's a lot of fun.Really sadly the only and seriously only bad thing about this game is that it's PAY2WIN all the way which means you can pretty much complete the game using real money, you can get max level, you can get best gear in the game, you can get enough potions to make you immortal for the entire game, you can buy amulets which boost your stats and also you can buy a 'bot' of some sort so when you are not playing then he will 'play' for you resulting in you getting sweet loot without moving a finger, have I mentioned you can buy VIP which almost more than doubles the loot you get?Example:Once I went into a game withm my level 11 tank with decent gear for which i didn't pay and then further into the game i realised there is a guy on the enemy team who had all the available gear for that level, he even painted it which requires money like the game was so unbalanced because our team couldn't even kill him because he had enough health potions to keep him going for the entire game, he died like only once when our entire team ganged up on him, but that was it he just kept on killing everyone with two blows after that. This experience really proved to me how unbalanced the game gets when someone pays 2 win. This game has amazing potential, but the developers just ruined it with the cash shop.			"

												This is a compleatly unbalenced hard game for people starting out or creating a new character, yeah i know its a team based game i played mostly as a paladin and what i find is someone going running at new waves of enemies thinking (Dont worrie guys i got this) before every respawned or healed up. The easy mode of pve is a joke everyone dies thats how it always going to be and will stay untill the game developer's get there heads out of the clouds and do something about it so all i would hafto say for this game. 10/10~Would Uninstall Again			"

												I really enjoyed playing this game in its beginning launch and the next 200+ hours of gameplay over the year. The graphics and battle dynamics are outstanding, and initially it had a good crafting system. The resources you earned verses the cost of crafting higher end armor and weapons was scaled against you steeply but was acceptable. Sometime between 8/10/2014 and 8/11/2014 an update removed the ability to craft entirely, replaced with shop function only. Resources earned now, go towards a roulette game that doesn't nearly adheer to the probability statistics advertised. What was a great game for computer players has been reduced to a cell phone game in leage with ""Kim Kardashian : Hollywood"", you meerly pour money in for gear necessary for playing at high level. If they reverse the update launched on above dates I will probably continue playing, otherwise I just cant.			"

												The positive outlook of the game is the concept is very good, maps are neat, graphics are very cool.  However, due to the fact the game is over seas, there is a red alert problem with lag for all of america.  The grouping system mixing lowbies with fully geared and max lvl players is rediculously terrible idea.  The Mastery system is overpowered to the people who buy more of it, but i guess thats the name of the game right?  The blocking mechanics is wrong, blocking should be 90% damage reduction across the board for ALL players at ALL times and should ignore any amount of mastery an enemy has.  Cheers :)			"

After 15 mins I still didnt get a game.Now dont get me wrong, This game is solid, I was in the beta and it was fun, but now that no people play this, makes  me sad :(.

												Graphics - 6.5/10 - Average - Some reason the goofyness feel and the cluster ♥♥♥♥ of idiocracy overdid it for me... I know plenty who like it however, it just didn't pull it off in my taste ;'/.Gameplay - 6.75/10* - Spectacular~! Note*: The game's build system is extremely crucial, unfortunately it feels like some skills can truly screw you up if you build improperly which makes me feel as if I'm too powerful, and other's are ♥♥♥♥. I presume that ruins gameplay for others which I took into rating.Community - 5.5/10 - The community is pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but if I was comparing to other MOBA's it'd be average 6.5/8.Customization - 4/10 - Growth is extremely unique to each and every character due to the large skills to pick from and limited points. I disliked one big thing was the equipment, there's only one way- Gearing upwards. Now the game is pretty screwed due to the fact people can now buy levels makes it feel.. Cheap.Replayability 6.5/10 - The game's different classes vary so much that everytime it's something different, each person brings a different build to the table. However, it is still a forward MOBA; Fight over and over except you can carry on some RPG-Elements such as leveling. Fun to try and gain, but I left primarily cause there's just better MOBAs out there, and the new ""Buy levels"" Option sort've killed it for me.Overall - Below Average (*5.15*); If the game didn't have the option to buy levels, and since they went with RPG-Elements why not more cosmetic options? It's a core thing, some people play RPG's, and one of the most rewarding thing is seeing the armor you got on you- And changing, evolving, and feeling more and more powerful.Unfortunately this game took on RPG-Elements, but didn't give something incentive to play for it - So people buy it, Over and out,-V.

												Gave the game 2nd try affter a year. Game mechanics are basic and easy to understand. Ques are a bit too long, but I read somewhere that it's because there are few low level people to que with.To be honest, there are too few classes and there is one class (the name I don't know) is so overpowered that literaly in 5 maps i took us 3 people to kill 1 guy with aroudn half HP.

												Horrid Game filled with microtransaction and time based crafting. Runs poorly even on the lowest setting (using a GTX 570 with i7 3.5 GHz). The Character design is not much better ie. one of the classes ""The Sister of Flame"" has a walk animation that one would only find at a strip club.Gameplay consists of 5 to 10 min. King of the Hill, where spawn camping the only spawn point is a regular thing. After battle you get XP and a random bunch of crafting material.The only redeeming point of this game is that matches only last 10 mins.3/10 Avoid.			"

												I haven't been able to play this game ATALL because of the amount of lag,glitches and some bugs that appear throught the game. At the start you get to pick a character off of a list and it is not laggy but when you go onto a multiplayer game you will instantly just press exit game and uninstall this game.			"

												Can't get past the tutorial. Played through the first intro level, then it FORCES you to join a PvP match. Wouldn't be a problem if it could actually find said match so I can do something aside from stare at a screen that simply says 'waiting'. Player base must be practically non-existant, because after waiting for 10-15 minutes, it never loaded past that screen and actually found a match, so can't really say much about actual game play. A way to turn off the tutorial so I can play PvE or the ability to click on ANYTHING other what the little thing is pointing to would be great. Can't even hit the 'x' to return to the main menu because its not being fingered.			"

												As the game stands at this moment its not a bad game just the flaws are sometimes just to much to deal with. The game play itself is fun yet the loading time keeps you from having a good experience, waiting 30+mins in waiting time just kills it. Also finding your friends doesnt seem as easy as they promote it to be, I spent 40 mins trying to add my friend from steam. I couldnt even find him through the search, it almost seemed like we have 2 different games. We ended up just giving up and playing 2 different games instead while just talking to eachother.... All in all this game can be great but now in its current state is mediocre at best.        (5 out of 10)			"

												It was a decent game with good graphics and a good combat system. Unfortunately the pay 2 win mechanics appear in great glorious fashion here which completely destroy any appreciative value that is available here. If balanced properly and correctly formatted to a fair F2P System this game has the potential to shine as an entertaining arena deathmatch style game akin to Smite's arena mode. As it stands now it simply is too unbalanced to be anything other than a frustrating mess.			"

												First time, i got in touch with this game, was before it was on Steam, i played it a lot there.Game was really fun to play, very fun with friends.Later, when leveling, i was finding out that this game is going #SELLOUT mode...and it didn't change...I do not recommend this game, just because it's Pay2Win.(Pay2Win = Pay money to be better than other)You may see it by yourself - almost everywhere you can see some Pay2Win possibilities.Either you buy stuff with real money, so you craft gear at low lvl and own people...Or just simply boost yourself up to max(?) level paying 200€ (including gear).If you don't believe me - download this game, look for feature it offers, level a bit and you will see it.Enough about it's Pay2Win, which destroys this game completely, let's go to other stuff.This game is all about fight - you pick a class, make tutorial and just go fight.You earn score by doing what your class is supposed to do - either help your team by buffing or healing or fight enemies and kill them. Score also is obtained by capturing stuff, depending on map.Bigger score = a bit bigger in-game currency.You level your guy up, from in-game currency make gear (or just buy it by real money).___This game would get really big  rating from me, but since it's Pay2Win which destroys it completely, i give it low rating.My PERSONAL rating: 5/10			"

												The game only was able to run for about 1 hr, but in the hr I was shown a good IN GAME totorial but after that I was given the worlds WORST OUT OF GAME TOTROIAL, the way it runs is that the totorial takes entire comtrull of what you do. So if you want to say play the PvE to lurn the macanics of the game or even just play the game to ajust your video setting so you get a higher frame rate then 10. The game is FAR from playable.All of the other people who have revewed the game have said the game is pay to win (wich I havent been able to play enough to see) but I can say through studies and classes that I have taken to safely say that the FTP modle more often works if they have a well balenced game and the transactions are primaroly estedic with a few exclusive items or abilitys that are not any more effective on a statistical level then anything elce in the game.On top of all of this the options are almost impossible to use because the diffrence between all the settings is so insecnifogent that it makes no diffrence in profomince what so ever. This isen't even accounting for the pre alfa testing optomisation rounding the game off to an ungodly illprepropared game that should not have been released this soon.I will be updating this revew to its finle within the next year, but if I see no improvments or updates all will be left as is.

I met 2 dwarfs.After a while, when we were walking in the forest, we step into a trap.I kicked marauders asses with my fireballs, I left those lovely dwarfs and went little further I met there orc which I met at the beginning of the tutorial. He nominated me as defender of something.Everything in 5 minutes. Next step in the tutorial was about joining to pvp match against other players, so I pressed join pvp,excited. I was like: Ok lets kick some real asses not bots only.The loading screen has showed there was spinning blue circle in the right top corner.I have read exciting tip: Block!

The match making was poor, low lvl or clearly out geared characters running together. Worse of all pay to win game and you can go online to learn hacks or down load software to get gems and use to upgrade characters lvls gear so you dont even have to play the game to be good.			"

												The women are to over sexualized and there isn't any customization to be a male or a female for these classes or what race you are. it just picks everything for you in correspondence to the class.			"

												-Wait times for matches are atrocious.-Horrible respawn rate (PvE).-Clunky combat controls.-Nearly non-existant community.-Unbalanced classes.-Pay-to-Win-Too much ""purchase-from-store"" banter.No point in typing the good things, as this game isn't even worth it with all of the downside. Don't waste your time; there's plenty of other much better free MOBAs out there.			"

												This game is not worth your time because in the game without donat you are not literally nothing can do in the game obsolete graphics gameplay you are playing for the character that you chose and your task is to wave a baton or sword or let the fireballs score my game 3\10			"

												Gameplay-wise the game is great. Starting out when there are still an abundant amount of F2P in queue you can get in a lot of good matches. Towards early mid-game however all of that changes. The game becomes heavily P2W with players easily beating F2P players in a 6 vs. 1 match up using simple auto-attack spam. This isn't an exaggeration; the raw stats on the gear people pay to acquire allows them to one shot most F2P classes. End game is just what you'd expect. The only players up there are the ones competing with other players to out-P2W the competition. Skill becomes irrelevant. Save your time, play something else... unless you're dual wielding credit cards.			"

												Super ♥♥♥♥ tier.It has all the pieces to be good but it's got some fatal flaws to work out.Matchmaking always teams you with russians who can't play.Getting a single piece of gear takes FOREVER.Get ready to be thrown out of games at the drop of a hat and gain nothing for the 35+ minutes you put in!Pay to win. ♥♥♥♥ is like mechwarrior. Which is awful.			"

												I did't bother to play this game....it looked cool and interesting until I loaded it and got a look at the throw-up in your mouth character design.  Wow! Just some of the ugliest characters I've ever seen.  They should have you shooting those things instead of being one of them.  The female characters are only half way visually acceptable but the costumes look like a make-your-own-character someone did who had cerebral palsy.  Wish I could tell you if the game played well but I just couldn't get over those ugly creatures they want me to us as an avatar in the game.  Just couldn't do it...			"

												Panzar has changed the last time i played, They made crafting more easier as well as a new pve modeand the queues don't take as long as they used to. I feel a balance was made in Pvp because i rarely found a high gear lvl guy,  Though the game is mostly populated by russian players making communication imposssible the game is still worth a try.
