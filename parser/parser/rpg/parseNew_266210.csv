												It is hard to sum up One Way Heroics into just a few words, so let me give you a couple paragraphs. (If you're the sort that likes to go ""tl;dr"" then just scroll to the bottom, but I mean, then why are you even reading reviews to begin with?)I picked this game up for <$0.60 when it was sale during the summer. I have to say, those were the best $0.60 I have ever spent. One Way Heroics doesn't appeal to you with stunning graphics, rich storytelling, or intricate gameplay. Instead, it is more retro gaming, silly short tales, and an easy to pick-up set of controls. Now you might be wondering, why would I want something like that? Arguably everything but simplicity of the controls could be considered negative or at least niche.  One Way Heroics doesn't offer high spec gaming while emptying your wallet - what you're buying is meaningless fun and entertainment.When I first opened this game and started an adventure, I found myself with my silly little 2D character talking to a ""Naughty King Victor"" about the darkness at the left of my screen that would attempt to eat me until I killed the Demon Lord. Yes, clearly the storyline could use some work, but as I struggled to kill weak mobs and then stronger demons I found myself falling for this game. Everything was fairly straightforward and the desire to complete achievements, ""save the world,"" and become a true hero compels you to play over and over again. It doesn't take several hours to do a run through like a quest in some RPG, just 30 minutes or so if you're short on time. Yet, you can play longer sessions that go for tens of hours depending completely on what you want to do and how much time you have - and those hours? They were some fun hours.I won't try to tell you that you'll be so entranced with One Way Heroics that you'll spend thousands of hours playing it - you probably won't. But it's easy to lose 10, 20, maybe even 100 hours of your life having fun by sending your hero towards the right of your screen. Was that worth my 60 cents while it was on sale? Definitely. Is it worth the full $3.49? Absolutely. Most of us play games to have fun - and One Way Heroics delivers.tl;dr?If you're a hardcore gamer looking for a game with brilliant graphics and intricate/competitive gameplay to drop thousands of hours on, I think you're better off somewhere else.If you're someone looking to spend 10-100 hours having fun in your spare time? Buy One Way Heroics.			"

												One Way Heroics is like potato chips: you eat one, and you can't help but go for another.For those moments where a player wants to pop open an RPG, but doesn't quite want to start a 40 hour time investment, OWH is perfect; simple combat, roguelike gameplay, and varied challenge levels depending on one's mood. Whether for a 20 minute stroll or an epic 2-hour odyssey with perma-death waiting around every corner, this game aims to suit itself to multiple tastes.Finishing a game, whether winning or losing, awards points used to boost one's future playthroughs (with wins awarding more). Whether it be unlocking new perks or opening new slots in the Dimensional Vault to transfer items from one playthrough to the next, every run feels like it progresses the player. That being said, while there are technically save areas, losing concludes the run and records the player's performance right there - no going back to try and get more points, but it will allow you to conclude a run 'just for funsies'. Maniac Mode, the game's 'hardcore' setting also prevents players from importing items from previous games, though depositing new items is still possible. Save points and dimensional vaults make the game friendly for casual runs, but the true hero wins on Maniac Mode with no takesies backsies (the greatest scores are only counted upon no deaths).More than that, the game is also surprisingly colorful. Dialogue and narrative is sparse, but sweet and entertaining. Furthermore, there are hidden secrets everywhere: the various characters you meet may have hidden dialogue, items may have unexpected purposes, and the non-restrictive nature of weapons gives a lot of freedom in designing 'builds'. There are even secret ways to win - it is recommended you do not go in with a guide, and simple explore yourself, as reading the wiki ruins a lot of the surprises this game has to offer (don't even look up those secret ways to win).This reviewer's only criticism is that, after clocking a couple dozen hours, I'm ready for more! The weapons do resemble each other a bit too much, there's a hard limit on the available spells/abilities, dungeons resemble each other, and the charming character dialogues do eventually run dry.For $3.50, this game was absolutely and totally worth it. It's creative, it's original, it's got high replayability, it suits people looking for various challenge levels, and it deserves to be recognized for what it is: a small but great roguelike RPG.A minor edit to this review, a newer 'edition' has come out called Mystery Chronicles: One Way Heroics; however, despite slightly higher quality sprites, it manages to be inferior to One Way Heroics and One Way Heroics+. If you want the proper experience, it's here.			"

												I had already logged in about 70 hours before the Steam release, so let me say that, for a price this small, this is definitely a game worth checking out. The game's big gimmick is that the world's slowly getting gobbled up from the left side, which means you gotta keep on going to the right, which adds an element of urgency since you gotta plan your moves ahead of time or you're getting screwed over. And with eight different classes to choose from, each actually requiring you to play differently (like, you wouldn't head in solo with a bard or keep your backside exposed with a hero) and a whole bunch of perks to apply and combine in whoknowshowmany ways, in addition with too many possible worlds to traverse and daily campaigns AND a bit of writing here and there that, while often rather generic, still has a couple bits that might make you go ""oh, I didn't expect that"" the first time you encounter them, you'll more likely than not spend a lot of time on this, provided you're into games experimenting with the roguelike concept.Presentation wise, it's a bit eh, though that's more of a personal issue. The music got annoying very quickly, so I turned it off. And the character portraits look rather amateurish and sketchy, but you don't see them too much, so they're easy to skim over.Still, if you got the cash to spare, give it a shot.			"

												One of the more overlooked games on Steam (probably because it was made in Wolf RPG Editor), this game was actually made by the creator of Wolf RPG Editor. In this game, you have to battle against the screen scrolling basically. If you get scrolled off the screen, you die. There are lots of interesting RPG elements at play here, such as different classes, leveling, skills, weapons, partners, and more. You can also save some items from your failed runs to use for the next run. The game is procedurally generated, and you can play worlds other people played by entering their world's seed. The game will also show you who was/is online on the same map you are. There are daily maps to explore and this game has a ton of depth you might not expect just looking at it. The expanded version is out on Playism and coming to Steam in the near future, but this version is well worth playing on its own.			"

YouTube™ Video: One Way Heroics Review 

			Views: 7,982		

			I do a video game review of One Way Heroics by Smoking Wolf Get it on Steam: http://store.steampowered.com/app/266210 It's worth mentioning that the playable area of the game is locked to an aspect...		

I put quite a few hours in on the game before it released on steam.The game feels quite smooth so it took my brain some time to process the fact that this is a turn based game and play accordingly.  Once I figured it out though, I really enjoyed myself.  There are lots of unlockable classes, map modes, and difficulty levels.  Plus the world is randomly generated so the game can be different every time.  Since character stats and a limited number of items/weapons carry over between play throughs the game has good replay value and individual save slots add even more.  Initially I didn't like the darkness/forced scrolling mechanic but it grew on me as I played.  With the darkness quickly following you, every action matters in combat and dungeon exploration so even though the game won’t move without you, there isn't much chance to catch your breath in these situations.  There is a genuine fear of trying to open a chest only to get trapped by the darkness that nicely complements the regular fear of death by monster.  The game is fun so despite bland visuals, if you watch game play with this information and it seems interesting or you enjoy rouge like games, then for well under $5 I can recommend Once Way Heroics.

												Being a big fan of Anime, turn based RPG's and rogue-like games, I was very curious with One Way Heroics, having an accessible price, I decided to risk buying it and check it out, truth be told I would never thought I'd love this game so much as I do, it completely caught me by surprise.The mechanics are quite simple, you're forced to go eastwards in an 8 character string world (that is randomly generated each play-through) in order to avoid a mysterious mist that is covering the planet. Each decision you take being a dialogue option, attacking, defending, healing, equipping and so on, will be counted as a turn, each turn you do the mist will also do his in parallel so you'll have to make sure to not fall behind or your play-through will be over, so you'll have to have special attention to which decisions or paths you should take, sometimes you'll feel compelled to explore a dungeon and find new items but the mist can prove to be too risky since you'll always have that constant threat looming next to you. You have different ways of ending one play-through depending of the difficulty and the game mode you're playing, you can achieve victory by killing the demon king, by reaching the end of the world, by killing a secret boss and so on, in order to spice it up the developers decided to make some random events, cities and quests to make the game more interesting and more unique in each play-through.The game UI is quite simple and it does well its job, the game soundtracks are fun and memorable but they can get a bit repetitive after a while, the art style ain't phenomenal by any means but overall it has an interesting and unique presentation to it.The game is very affordable and full of content, it has great replay value, so I'd like to recommend to all of you who is thinking about getting this underrated gem, you'll love it!

												So, after finally clearing the game and seeing 95% of what it has to offer, I figured I could give my two cents to people considering wether to buy this game. Simple version? Buy it. Longer version:PlotThe setting itself is quite simple. You are the hero, saving the world from darkness that's devouring everything. And to do that you have to kill Demon Lord, who's somewhere over there ------>  That's basically it, but there is so much more, if you care to search for it. Game is filled with alternative endings, hidden classes, party members... Well, you get the point. It actually makes me really sad that only 4,6% of players have invested time to complete the game in some other way, than beating the Demon Lord, as they are missing out on great plot, that's just hidden within seemingly generic RPG storyline.GameplayAs you embark to find the Demon Lord somewhere over that ------> way in randomly generated world, the said darkness is chasing you, destroying villages, killing the monsters and, most important of all, keeping you from stopping.  On your way you'll encounter multitude of different terrain types, villages, dungeons, enemies, merchants, friends, (friendly) ghosts of other players and so on. The further you go, the harder game becomes.Combat is very much in retro RPG style. You act ---> your party members act ----> enemies act. Extra agility can get you (or enemies) multiple moves in a row. There are status ailments, buffs, critical hits and plenty other things involved as well.DifficultyThe game lets you pick the difficulty setting from Walk in a park, Afternoon Stroll, Grueling Campaign or Inhumane odysseu, but even the Walk in a park isn't exactly a cakewalk for newcomer, while Inhumane Odysseu often catches even experienced players by surprise. You also choose your class, perks, and wether you'd like to start with some items from your previous misadventures, so game lets you have very much control over the level of difficulty.OverallI enjoyed this game immensely. When i got it for around 0,60€, I felt like I was robbing the developer, because this game is a rare gem that has great potential. So I was just happy to pay the 5-ish € for the new DLC, as I felt I had finally paid him back.The game is addictive (albeit a bit repetitive), and easily triggers the ""ONE MORE RUN"" -feeling, that made me waste many evenings while trying to overcome hardest ordeals the game had to throw at me.

												A Rogue-like with old school Japanese style. Despite it's cheap price there's a lot of replay value with its unlockable classes and ""Dimension"" (randomly generated worlds from their online server) select which you choose before setting off on your adventure. Gather equipment, healing items, upgrade items and even party members to become strong enough to defeat the Demon Lord.Time is limited however, the screen will continuously scroll to the right and if you are caught in this ""Darkness"" you will die. This is not an open world RPG where you can take things slowly and explore, your destination is eastward and the game will happily remind you of that.At the end of the Dimension (win or lose) you are graded and given Hero Points. Points can be spent to unlock additional classes or skills, called Perks, but also to expand your Vault. Your Vault allows you to transfer over items you have collected to a bank so that any new characters you make will have access to these items before beginning their level. The game also comes with achievements and cards. For the asking price I couldn't recommend it enough!			"

												Just started playing it not too long ago, but so far, you can't argue with the quality of the game for the price.It's obscenely replayable, a lot of fun, and a great coffee break roguelike, especially with mid play saves available.  There seem to be absolute tons of classes and perks, with a lot of strategy being offered after runs with ""Hero Points"" which allow you to expand your Dimensional Vault (to transfer powerful items between characters), unlock perks, and unlock classes.It's certainly worth its price, almost no question about it.  There are a few small problems with the game, such as there being no mouse support whatsoever.  You can't click on anything, so you have to scroll using the keyboard.It plays much more fluidly with a controller, so do yourself a favor and hook one up before starting the game.  I guarantee you you'll have more fun that way.It's only 3 bucks right now and 3.50 at full price!  Go pick it up!  Play it!  Defeat the Demon Lord, hero!UPDATE:  Lately, I've been having a lot of crashing issues with the game, which is frustrating.  I'm not sure if it's a change in my system or just a bug that presents itself a couple hours into the game.  I'd likely say it's due to changes in my system, since I've seen no similar complaints in other reviews.  However, I just want to mention it just in case.			"

												Sold everything I had to a poor merchant for silvers, made him get mauled by a bear, took the stuff he dropped, walked away with 50,000 silvers and all my stuff and extra, rinsed and repeated with every town I come upon. Got 999.999 silvers and became the richest man in the world where money doesn't matter anymore because everyone is dying. put on a bracelet that bloody merchant lying on the ground had, sacrificing half my stats but getting 3x experience, after 10 days I rose to level 649 and became an all powerful God. One-hit killed everyone I came across by punching it in the face. True story.Actual Review of the Game:Totally worth the price when it goes on sale like the Steam Summer Sale and the Winter Exploration Sale where it gets to less than a buck. There's 8 classes (only a couple in the beginning), but 24 sprites to choose fun. The worlds are randomly generated and filled with a lot of content that take a long time to go through, finding almost a new thing everytime. After a long time, my brother and I went through every NPC, companion, items, and weapons you could go through, but it never got boring because it's so different (yet the same) every time! I just recently got the DLC One Way Heroics Plus and it has about 3x the content now comparing it to the original, much more aesthetics and features that got me into it again. The music that is seen throughout the different biomes, towns, and bosses is also really good enough that I put them on my phone because you can find them online for free. Its just awesome overall.I r8 8/8 m8 no h8, it gr8			"

""A unique and comedic take on the JRPG/RPGMaker Genre that is so satisfying that even if you die for the first few runs in the game, you'll be sure to come back for more""Game DetailsGameplay: The game is pretty much immersive to the point that it could even lead to addiction. With a total of 8 classes (3 initial classes if my memory serves me right), it adds variety and replay value. Though some might see themselves inclined to a certain class since it is kind of OP. There are dirty humors within the dialogues too, though it's mild enough (unless you understand the references or the language).The maps are limited, in which you will notice after a few hours. Though their sequences and contents may change depending on the dimension/campaign you will play through. Graphics: You'll mostly see pixel graphics in this game except when character dialogues pop up. Nothing more, nothing less.Audio: The game showcases good, quality music. The tracks change depending on the area you are currently at which creates the mood of the setting.Even though I already have played the game repeatedly, the charm of it still lingers fresh to my ears. Sometimes, I find myself opening up the game and idling on the menu screen while listening to the opening/menu soundtrack.The VerdictFor a game that packs a lot of replay value, comedic references, good RPG transition and a unique side-scrolling mechanic, it is already a great deal by itself even without discount. A must-buy for JRPG fans.If you are asking if this game is worth its value, my answer is ""Yes, it is worth it"".If you would like to see more recommended games that is worth the value you are paying, please visit my other reviews, or follow our curator group at Good Games Giveaways & Reviews.

												To be perfectly honest, I didn't expect that much for the $3.50 full price of the game.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The number of hours of gameplay to price has proven to be a solid purchase.I do not wish to oversell.  This is a solid game.  It has both pros and cons.  However, at this price point, it's a very high return on price.The Pros are that it's a 2d sidescrolling, roguelike, fantasy style game that contains elements of progression post rogue-like death.  The unique aspect of the game is that the world is constantly scrolling to the right, and that if the hero is trapped on the far left of the screen, it's game over.  The game offers a few classes, with more unlocked as you continue to play through, and the ability to carry forward items (how many items can be expanded as well).  It's a typical 2d fantasy style throwback game.The Cons of this game is the seemingly random difficulty at times.  Experiencing impossible creatures right outside the starting castle, and random event demons that you can't avoid.  This can be painful if you're trying to clear with a particular class and have dedicated some game clearing items towards your hero!  As mentioned in other reviews, there's also random map loading, which can hurt continuity of the game, but is overall relatively minor.With all of this in mind, I believe buyers will experience a good playtime/cost ratio with this game.

It's like a mix of old final fantasy games and a little bit of half minute hero. There is limited time to be in one place, because the darkness is moving from the left side. It's funny because you need to slowly move to the right. There are many perks to unlock, new classes and other things. Gameplay is not that bad and the further you get the more exciting it is. The worlds are random generated so don't need to worry if you forget where have you been last time. This game is good for one or two shots from time to time otherwise it may be boring. "

												By this point, we all know what a roguelike is, even if the exact distinctions have become muddled. Perhaps many of you play roguelikes fanatically. I am not talking games like Binding of Isaac or FTL. I am talking ADOM, Nethack, Dungeon Crawl, those sorts.Those of you who do play those games may feel at times that their greatest strengths, their vast complexity and length, can often become overbearing and intimidating. By the end of any roguelike, the game becomes exhaustive. You've been at that game for days just for that one playthrough. And how many times did you have to die just to learn every special situation, and figure out every monster along the way to victory? These games require a lot of cognitive overhead and rote memorization.Doesn't it seem counterintuitive that I write a gripe about roguelikes in a recommendation for a roguelike? Yes, sure, but this is exactly what One Way Heroics tries to shy away from. It is a true roguelike, but it shies away from the issues I stated before. It plays fast and simple. You could expect to complete a full game within a few hours, and it provides enough of a challenge that it isn't a pushover for it. The wall of death to your left also rids you of the tedium of stashes and grinding.Your perspective of the game may be different from mine, but this is the most important aspect to me. This is how I sum up the game and why I play it.I play roguelikes for their nuanced and complex gameplay.I play One Way Heroics for its simplicity and short length per playthrough.			"

												Roguelikes are my favorite type of game. Since the old days of Rogue and Hack, indie developers from all over have taken the basic ideas of roguelike games (procedurally developed worlds, blistering difficulty and permadeath, for example) and ran with it. One Way Heroics literally ""runs with it"" by providing a game that forces you to keep running forward until you reach your destination: your final battle with the Demon Lord threatening the world. The parts of the world you leave behind are gradually consumed by a darkness that will devour you, too, if you wait too long or try to backtrack. So, in order to survive your encounter with the Demon Lord, you have to prepare yourself by gathering items and equipment and gaining levels on the way.Replayability is high due to the fact you can use Hero Points gained from a previous playthrough to help your next incarnation succeed better or faster than before. There's the Dimensional Vault, where you can leave your best items behind for the next play-through. You can also unlock new advantages or even new classes, for greater variety and strategy. You may also choose to run through the same world next time, rather than generating a new one, meaning that you can remember where towns, dungeons, merchants and particularly dangerous enemies are on the map, and approach or flee from them accordingly.The game itself is a short one, which is good for those of us busy folks who want gaming in small bites. You can sit and finish a play-through in less than an hour. But there are multiple worlds (including multiplayer ones hosted online) and modes if you get bored of the standard game. I suspect there is more depth and content in this game than I have begun to scratch the surface of, because it requires many playthroughs to get to.Would definitely play again (and again)!			"

												Alright listen closely. This game is really, REALLY good. Especially for it's price! It's literally a steal! You may be thinking from the screenshots ""Oh no. Another RPG Maker game."" It isn't! This guy used his own engine that was sorta inspired off of RPG maker I believe. So lets get down to what the game actually is.You are the hero. Or at least lets hope so! You can choose your class and perks and your gender. There are over 5 classes with their own set of weapons and skills and passive ability and you will be playing the game differently with each one. The game has an online element per sey. You can see in your top left corner who has died in the world you are in. As in players. So if you tell a friend the world you generated, the name of then they can play in the same world and you can see when they die or stuff.You cannot see them in your game. Just see their status and their stats at the top left appearing every now and then.In the game you will be running to the right a lot of the time from darkness. If it gets too close to you then you get swallowed by it and killed! Game over! You need to keep running in this randomly generated world to meet and defeat the demon lord! Get as good equipment as possible! Befriend everyone you can!I personally think this game is 100% worth it's money. It's a great rogue-lite and if you are fond of those then you will love this.			"

												I bought One Way Heroics due to the plethora of positive reviews I saw...and because it was .69 cents in the steam summer sale. ;D However, I must say it has been the BEST .69 cents I have ever spent. I have put in over 10 hours of addictive gameplay, wondrous music, and hilarious and/or close-call moments in less than a week; all of which is wrapped up into one simple--but nothing less than amazing--game. I can not emphasize enough how much I recommend that others get this game. It is not difficult to play, but can be hard to master, especially on harder difficulties. Finally, it is user-friendly and truly allows the player to challenge themselves or take it easy (whatever they feel like at the time they play). Great for all ages as long as they like the genres and style of gameplay this game has to offer.			"

												I use Zenura Weave, sacrificing my clothing for power.I go into a town and people judged me, the one that's saving them all, for not wearing anything.I run into the Demon Lord, who is a lonely reject hellbent on killing everyone in the world.Since we both weren't accepted, we ultimately joined forces and ran across the entire world together, allowing everyone of those townsfolk to suffer from the darkness.All in all, this game is a beautiful story about discrimination, friendship, streaking, punching cute animals, and acceptance.

												Great little game.  I have no idea what I am doing, and I suck at it, but I keep playing.  Really nice.  It's a fast paced RPG type game.  You have to keep traveling to the right because ""Darkness"" is moving in that direction.  If the darkness catches up to you, the game is over.  You have to keep building up your character by leveling up and gaining better equipment.  This is complicated by having to face enemies and fighting.  All the while the ""Darkness"" keeps approaching.  This is all leading up to the battle with the final boss.  You gain points that you can use to unlock more classes and perks.  The game is quick and you can play several times within an hour.  Great little time killer and really well done.			"

												This game. This game has a lot of fun things to do. It's a simplistic but still very hard game. YOU WILL DIE! But it won't be that bad since you can keep the stuff you like and then go on and use it on the next character...or not. You could keep leveling that piece of equipment to the best there is so that you can beat the big bad dude. This game also has an interesting plot that isn't shoehorned in your face. You have to find it, and to do some you must* Goes on to ramble about how long it might take one to find and also why* But after that it's smooth sailing.The classes are very varied. I mean yeah you could change them to your will sure but their core mechanics is one thing you can't remove thus it (The game) reccomends you to play with that class strengths.It's a simplistic yet very fun game.

												Rating 9/10What is it?This is a turn based rogue game that has an isometric perspective. You have to constantly keep moving to the right because a darkness keeps creeping in from the left. The Good+ 8 Classes to fit your play style. Knight, sword master, hunter etc.  Obviously each one has their own unique strengths and weakness  along with their own stat growth rate. + Different modes offer players interesting new dynamics to the world. I.e Better weapons but harder enemies+Different levels of difficulty. The easiest difficulty level stops at a certain distance, however the later difficulties can be much longer. + Lots of secrets to find out, giving the game a lot more depth than it appears to+ Randomized Levels The Bad- The game can be frustrating, especially if you get a bad world generated.  ConclusionThis game is surprisingly addicting. At first it doesn't look like much but the more you play it the more it grows on you. You quickly realize that strategy is involved depending on the class your playing. The fact that you are forced to keep moving means you are going to have to make some tough decisions. Given the price point, this is probably one of the better deals you will find.  "

												This game....oh God this game is so addictive.The rule of a lot of RPGs is ""The enjoyment curve doesn't get high enough on the graph until it's at around the middle part of the game's plot."" A reason why a lot of RPGs are long and tedious. Most people who has a lot of stuff going on with their life doesn't have time to play RPGs straight in one sitting. Even though their playtime only consists of a few hours, it'll still take them days to weeks before they finish it. That's because they can't play in long durations.One Way Heroics ignores this rule. It's a straightforward RPG with rouge-like elements. You don't need to explore hours in a dungeon. Here it'll only take you seconds. You don't need to grind. As levels are really not much of an importance later on. You don't need to get money, as you won't be spending a lot anyways. You don't need to look for secrets, as with each step you take the every growing darkness will engulf you if you don't keep moving forward(right).The game is not real-time, not fast-paced, it is turn-based. Which means you have time to pause and think the actions you will make. And that is not noticeable until you play it. With each step you take at every turn, the whole world will move after you do. Enemies, allies, npcs, everything moves as you move. It uses a World Generator. Which means you can have different maps in every game you start. It generates random seeds at every reload of your save, with still keeping the same world and same map, but with different outcomes of enemies, treasures and such. It is not repetitive as one might think. As with each new game, there will always be new stuff to unlock, and these stuff will make the game more enjoyable with each run.The game is made from Wolf RPG Editor. The same game engine used on games like Mad Father and Densha. Which would explain the graphics. Not much of a complaint there since I am rather retro, I don't know about modern gamers though.Update: The developer(s) of this game was also the creator(s) of the game engine. No wonder he/she/they used it instead of other ones like RPG Maker or etc. Quite fascinating.Very recommended to people who likes old-school RPGs and/or doesn't have a lot of time to play lengthy RPGs.A very simple RPG that will only take you minutes to finish. And with each new game, it gets more exciting and enjoyable.			"

My favorite Rogue-Like of 2014The game is very simple but very fun. You play an adventurer because excuse plot and you need to save the world, just like in Half-Life 3.Darkness is coming from the left and so the only thing you can do is go right. It's a 2D Final Fantasy 13 in that sense but the graphics and plot development here is waaay better. Square Enix really needs to take lessons from Sony and make another Final Fantasy X Sonic game.Pick up loot, kill wild monsters, avoid getting trapped against walls or else it will be game over. If you don't play rogue games often however expect to die, a lot! Hunger will cripple you, monsters will one shot kill you, walls and other obstacles will always seem to get in the way at the worst possible time, and thieves will spawn while you are already holding on for dear life.Despite the above however the game is not about cheap deaths! This is refreshing because Rogue like games usually go the 'uber hard' route by killing you for trivial stuff. You know the kind, you didn't drink enough water so died. You didn't see the hidden pit of instant death so you fell in it and died. This game has none of those, if you died, it was your fault and you can learn something from every death. This means the game is more about learning than it is about gruelling difficulty which is what makes it so much fun.Enjoy the game and watch out for those treasure chests in dungeons, they'll get you killed.Join Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews "

												One Way Heroics is a decidedly different and refreshing take on the rogue genre. Simply put, every decision you make causes the world to end just a little bit more. An existence-destroying void is following you, and the only solution is to constantly push to the right. You'll have to make detours, whether it's shopping for supplies, exploring for dungeons, or going after some great treasure. As with most other Rogue titles, death is permanent...and expected. Your first game might last several minutes, your second might last a few seconds. Dying tends to result in rewards such as new perks, classes, and the ability to store useful items in a vault for future games. This is all dependent on your hero points, a score received at the end of the game. Surviving as long as possible is just one of many ways to accrue points. The character classes and perks offer a good bit of variety in how you approach the game. There are other awards depending on your in-game actions, so it's always worth trying new things and exploring as much as that rapidly expanding void will allow. Adding to the replay value is the infinite number of randomly-generated worlds. One Way Heroics has numerous online functions, so it's possible for multiple players to explore the same world. While playing, you'll see the status of other heroes and get a sense of their trials and tribulations. When they die, their cause of death will be displayed. You might even happen upon their remains, and score a nice item for yourself. Despite the game's cheap price, it's still receiving great support by the developer. In fact as of this writing there was an update issued just yesterday. Multiple difficulty settings further add to the replay value.Really though, the main reason I recommend this game is because staying from the void is such a valuable design-decision. Typical rogue games, with their insistence on dark dungeons, tend to bore me. One Way Heroics is very focused, it's linear, but it retains all of the depth that is consistent with the genre. Every decision in the game carries weight, since the void is never far behind. I never get the sense that I'm just meandering around a dungeon looking for a key or a sword or a set of stairs. Every step is essentially proof of life, and it feels like very real progress(though death remains a very real setback).All in all, One Way Heroics is an unexpected surprise. I look forward to putting more time into it.			"

												One Way Heroics is a AMAZING RPG!While theres not much o a story, One Way Heroics still is great in another aspects, from the fact that each level is randomly generated which gives you hard deciscions you have to make  in a way of a Telltale game. You start off talking to the Queen after creating your character, now first off playing it, there are instructions on how to control, but theres still no sense of starting & learning to make your way, it just drops you in without much to know, which is quite a minus for starting out. But prior to my last sentence, once you learn, it gets better, a lot better. After you learning the controls, first thing i did was die, why was that? i pondered for the few seconds til i made another game, then i understood, the game keeps scrolling to the right, everytime you do something, & it only stops when you use an ability which makes it stop for 3 turns, which unless you are fighting, or as it suggest when to use it, breaking through walls for which i will cover later, its not always that useful, less a emergency. (it also increases damage during this period)As i said before, it scrolls constantly every turn, & thus this is were the hard choices come in. Your inventory weight is limited, meaning you can only carry so much, & at the start its not that big of an inventory, its allright, but you need to increase it early on by giving up your Levels at a goddess statue in a dungeon, there are several statues, but not in all dungeons, this idea right here is also very interesting, also at the statue you can increase specific skills (Strength, Intelligence, Agility Etc.), which once again, is very interesting & cool. But then theres ""Where to go"", as you roam there are towns you can pass by which of course you can buy equipment at, & at the same time, in towns (where scrolling does not stop, still gotta keep moving) & outside of towns, there a items you can find, there are a lotta good items you can get, but the problem where in lies with inventory space, if you don't have enough, then ya can't carry, or ya gotta trade it for something else. With limited amount of moves it can be hard to get through, or get to towns & dungeons, which can have major items, but depending on your previous moves, you may not be able to get through, but alas, there is hope. Breaking walls, literally you can beak through while hopped on coolade & 'splore dem dungeons or to get through the towns. (sorry you can't actually be hopped up on coolade) the last thing to mention, past all the things i said, this game can be long, & i mean long, do not expect a short game, the goal is to get to a certain distance & fight a appearing boss, but the distance to get to the boss, can be long, because it is randomized, & even if its at like, 250 distance, getting through 200 is long enough, & it doesn't end there, everytime you start a new quest is randomized, making it different everytime, thus far longer! You either have the decision to play a random generated world, on normal, or hard (Normals hard & long enough) or there are also different modes to playthrough, which i haven't even covered cause of the main game, damn its long!One Way Heroics, is a constantly moving, tough decision making, level sacraficing, long tough RPG, & if you like those kind of games, its the right kind for you.But alas here are the plus & minuses of it.PLUSES+Long, with several different modes & the normal game is randomly generated.+Challenging, its really tough with the screen scrolling, & random hard enemys can pop up to kill ya instantly if your not prepared.+Its an RPG, cmon, whoz dusn' like rpgs.+Classes & traits, several different classes & traits to choose from & unlock as you slowly play through.+Randomly Generated Worlds+Several other different modes besides the story to play through+Records Your Run, after making a run, it records the entire thing, which you can save & show others.+A Universal Inventory, basically if yur current character dies, but you found such a cool item & ya wanna keep it, you can unlock universal inventory spaces, which can hold items for your next character.MINUS-Really doesn't teach you how to play, or whats happening so much at the beggining-Customization, while its not a big deal, there would be a bit more if you could customize your character besides there being just a gender & class choice.

 About One Way Heroics	One-Way Heroics combines turn-based combat, side scrolling arcade style gameplay, limited saves, and a hearty dose of classic RPG nostalgia. It also ranks in difficulty with the likes of Mega-Man, Ninja Gaiden, and Castlevania. The foundation of Heroics would make it seem like two things that should never go together. On the left side of the screen, the world fades into a Darkness that consumes men, women, children, small animals, dungeon bosses, buildings, eveything. It is your job to find out what is causing the darkness by travelling to the ends of the earth and defeating the source (oh, and the final boss has finally attained some common sense, and will randomly spawn in an effort to kill you before you get enough power and equipment to wreck his world.) It would start to sound as if it's an infinite runner (akin to Temple Run and Flappy Bird).And then there are the RPG elements.Randomly generated worlds, item upgrades, exploration, looting, unlockable perks and classes, the element of permadeath between save points (random enemy drops and treasures will not be the same after continuing from a save file), and the random enemy attributes lead one to question their sanity. Each playthrough is different. You have the option to create a new random world every time that you start a new game, but you can also play through the same world as different classes.There are 8 different classes in total, (Only the Knight and Swordmaster are available at the start, but with additional playthroughs, the roster expands with Hunter, Pirate, Bard, Adventurer, Force User, and Hero) with very different play styles. Swordmasters are tough, but it comes at a cost to stamina and carrying capacity. Hunters, however, are better suited to stealth, ranged weapons, and have a special ability that allows them to see off-screen enemies before they encounter them.All in all, it's got great addictive gameplay, the sprite animations are charming, the music is fantastic.8/10 From Me Sweep	 "

												I'm no expert on roguelikes. But this game at base price costs about as much as a cup of coffee from a mid-market coffee chain. I've played it for twenty hours, and it still feels like I'm scratching the surface; after each run, I feel like I learned something about how the game works, about what it wants from me and how to succeed. It's a good feeling. The game is fair but challenging, and for those of us for whom that isn't enough, offers a highly modular difficulty system (base difficulty plus class plus perks, all of different usefulness) to challenge yourself with. There's incremental progress and upgrades to unlock if you'd rather have a barometer of progress other than your own growing skill at the game, which is difficult to quantify, but grinding for these things isn't really an issue -- classes and perks are pretty cheap, at least for the useful ones, and everything else is bonus stuff.If you buy the expansion, you're basically getting a game that has double or triple the content of the base game, and also includes a whole bunch of quality of life UI upgrades and balance changes. A lot of the things added are very simple and unobtrusive but satisfying -- things like turning to face the enemies automatically, a little screen to track all of the things you've achieved as each class, more dimensions to facilitate the psuedo-multiplayer. Other additions are bigger -- new classes, new allies, new npcs, new bosses and objectives and missions. While the price of the dlc is triple that of the base game, it's absolutely worth it -- even more so if you can get it on sale. The hours of gameplay/$ ratio is excellent.It's also in the class of games that are easy to play while doing something else, like holding a skype conversation or queuing for a match in some other game. It takes very little processor power, deals with tab switching quite agreeably, and time stops while you aren't moving.All in all, I think it's a great way to spend an hour or two between doing other things, and ends up being quite moreish once you've wrapped your head around the basic steps to survival. Then, it's all about the rng and your own wits. Recommended.			"

												So, I bought this game a long time ago thinking it was going to be a game where I ran in one direction trying to stay alive.I was not disappointed in the slightest.One-way Heroics offers some of the dumbest, funniest, and rediculous gameplay I have ever seen from a rouge-like game. *Slight spoilers below, you have been warned*-Hey, I know you're new, but you're supposed to save the world from the left side of the screen since this is sidescrolling and all, and for some reason the left side of the screen is eating everything. GOOD LUCK!So begins your slow and painful descent into hell. At the 1st gate of hell you pick your class, name, and perks (assuming you even have any). At first you'll wonder why you only get two classes, and thats because without any foundation the others will either be♥♥♥♥♥♥easy to play (IM LOOKING AT YOU PIRATE <3) or even harder to get going than your beginner classes (coughForceUsercough).At the 2nd circle of hell you wander around on ""Walk in the Park"" mode (easy mode) and you get the gist of the game....while simultaneously wondering why the fabled final boss meets you at a predetermined point or why they even want to kill you (I still dont remember signing up for this ***....Was I Voluntold?). You also realize multiplayer is a lie, as ghosts of people who may have died in that world you signed up to plop into dont seriously help when you're being swarmed by Zubats when night falls on the open plains.At the 3rd circle of hell you die because an imp threw a rock too hard at your skull....or a skeleton was spawned in and one shot you with its nifty sword....or you got trapped in the damn DESERT and harpies ended up swarming your soon-to-be carcass. You die, get a crappy score, get some really lame advice and useless critiques from Navi the Fairy, maybe even some halfway tips, and you start over because you refuse to take your beating lying down.At the 4th circle of hell you beat the game once and get an ending that leaves too many things open. So you start again, probably on a higher difficulty because you havent learned your lesson from being nearly incinerated and eaten by wild dingos. This was a mistake, as now you have to deal with your old AND new♥♥♥♥♥♥being torn asunder because enemies are hitting like speeding bullet trains and you just left the Shire. At the 5th circle of hell you start getting more endings because you keep beating the game, but now with some of those elusive bonus companions at your side. You meet Elodie after you beat Long Live the Queen (she clearly took nothing but combat classes this time), Azir-Finally here-Emperor Pigeon, Alphonse Elric, an edgy Male Gunner from DFO, a defenseless Loli, a nurse that's crying because you chewed her out for being a dog girl instead of a cat girl, and money grubbing panty mercenary who doesnt actually care about panties. Their endings flesh out their characters, but you still dont know what the hell is going on (or why the left side of the screen continues to devour the game like its stocking up for hibernation every time you start the game again).At the 6th circle of hell you decide to just ignore the final boss and journey until the game makes you stop. This results in many a death and many late nights wondering why the ♥♥♥♥ you bought this game. Eventually you reach the end of the world (cause the world really is flat guys, school lied to you) and you finally understand that this game is just dicking with you over and over until you get it right.At the 7th circle of hell you attempt to fix the left side of the screen, only to be eaten and or incinerated by it......now everything becomes clear to you and you know what you need to do.At the 8th circle of hell you get some Cheesy Puffs, some Dew, and prepare your quad-anuses (btw you should have a minimum of 4 now) for tons of save scumming because of all of the save crystals you hoarded in your Dimensional Vault between worlds; clears or deaths. You finally beat the game and you throw yourself into the next circle of hell because nothing matters anymore.At the 9th circle of hell you melt your computer because now you have to buy the DLC and experiance being Anakin Skywalker, Naruto, and some random tourist to Disney World to get all the achievements in the game.Time and time again you are going to want to chuck your keyboard/laptop wondering what new ways the game can come up with to cheapshot you and why you just took 600 damage because a bear decided to ♥♥♥♥ your♥♥♥♥♥♥up. This game (on higher difficulties) will tear you a new one and laugh as you try to tape your♥♥♥♥♥♥back together. On lower difficulties.....itll only happen 1 or 2 times because you'll pick up enough situational awareness to not get your eyes torn out of their sockets while you were exploring or trying to reach that one item tucked inbetween 30 tiles of mountain when all you know how to do is dash around like Sanic the ♥♥♥♥ing Hedgehog, trying to figure out how many items you can get before the left side of the screen eats you again.. Eventually you realize that you spent over 60 hours on a game where all you do is go right and try to survive when you suddenly dont get any food for 700 kms, or you get 4 consecutive corrupted lands and the ♥♥♥♥ing wolfmen and dragonkin swarm your position after all your weapons snap in half from all the fighting, or you blow up because you got set on fire and forgot to chuck that Elzite bomb you got 2 minutes into a run.As you enter the Nth Circle of hell you realize that this was all only worth it if you can somehow make and achieve some sort of goal. You didnt, and you laugh as you realize this game has seared your soul and you will never be the same again.10/10 would auto-pilot into a lava tile again.			"

												Even though One Way Heroics is kind of cheaply made in a sense -- being coded in Wolf RPG and somewhat unfortunately prone to crashing now and then -- I find it hard not to recommend. The best description I could give it is that it's a JRPG roguelike that's evocative of ""The Neverending Story"", a brilliant but bizarre fantasy movie from the 80's. Namely that One Way Heroics is about a hero trying outrun something like the Nothing from said movie -- a darkness slowly creeping and devouring the world -- and confronting evil while also deconstructing certain narrative tropes. I'm not going to spoil anything but while One Way Heroics has a simple story, it's not as simple as it may look and it hints at some deeper and admittedly stirring themes. Again, given all that, it's almost required for Generation Y gamers to occasionally put on the Neverending Story soundtrack esp. if they're playing a Hunter. I consider it pretty much a must-play for anyone genuinely interested in eventually ""getting into"" roguelikes, as well for anyone who is interested in designing them. Like any other roguelike, you will die many times and rarely get to keep anything of substance from one run to another. Unlike most of them, One Way Heroics offers detailed feedback about how to improve your future runs and the game over screen NPCs are kind, sympathetic and encouraging. It also strikes a very tight balance between what choices a player has at any given time (especially in character creation) without compromising the unforgiving nature of the roguelike genre. It's also really neat to be playing one that takes place primarily in the great outdoors. On top of all that, the way seeds work lets you share worlds with other players and the game even tracks who is playing what world and when. Defeated players who were playing at the same time as you will even show up in your game to give you random items from their inventory. As I said, it's very novel.Yeah, this isn't a $3.50 you need to second guess for even a moment if you're in the mood for something different or enjoy (or wish you could enjoy) roguelikes. I salute you, Smoking Wolf!By the way, while the game does a great job of pretty much giving you all the advice you'll need to optimally play it (which I've never seen a roguelike EVER successfully do before now) I strongly recommend using the numpad to move instead of the arrow keys. Holding shift to change direction without moving is very useful too. Also it's not required, but if you see Queen Frieda please give her a hug for me.			"

												You start out in a castle. The darkness is to the left of the castle. Every time you move, the darkness engulfs more of the screen, forcing you to move right. The people in the castle do not move right. Their screams will spur you onward as you look for a way to end the destruction of the world, and will remind you of the price of failure. (They respawn when you do, of course, so don't mourn them too long. The darkness waits for no one!)As you move further and further right, you collect items, kill enemies, gain levels, and fight evil wizards by pelting them with rocks. You die a lot--sometimes from enemies, and sometimes because you landed on the wrong side of a wall or a mountain range while out of time stops. You have to start over each time, but you get to carry over some of your best items to your next life, so it's not that annoying. It's not earth-shattering, but it's a fun little roguelike for only $3.50. If you like the genre, you won't feel like you wasted your money.			"

												This game is fantastic.  both the basic version and the plus version are amazing.I got this game for 99 cents when it was on sale and subsequently forgot to play it.  A few months later I opened up the game and was absoluted infuriated by it at first.  On your first run its pretty easy to mess up and die.  Now I have over 100 hours on this game and I've done many heroic deeds.  I have also done many very questionable deeds as well.I have1. beat the game by playing a nude character that ran around an punching things to death.  2. dragged royalty along as I massacred bears by throwing armor at them3. accidentally♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off PETA by killing defensless animals4. accidentally♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off the world cause I killed the revenge soldiers PETA sent after me5. purposfully let a young girl's father die so i could have her as a follower instead of earning money for returning her safe and sound6. threw a pill at the demon lord and somehow made her nice for a bit 7. walked to the end of the world (yeah school was wrong and so was columbus)8. accidentally made the previosly mentioned royalty fall for the previously mentioned nude berserker9. accused a girl on the brink of death of making suspicious drugs10. created a team consisting of a sword wielding undead queen, a loli who makes brain washing drugs that I dont find suspicious, a merc who named himself Panty just to mess with his enemies, and a bard that did not really do anything (me).11. got seduced by a succubus so badly I couldnt walk straight12. killed a polar bear by throwing the dead carcass of another polar bear at it.13. put the one punch man theme on in the back ground while i ran around punching everything that moved.and a hell of a lot morePersonnally I would advise buying the normal version first and the plus afterwards if you like it and only after getting the hang of the game.  while it is not needed, i spent my first 50 some odd hours soley playing the normal mode and if I had gotten plus off the start I would have missed out on alot of fun that can only be done in basic.  then again there is alot more fun that can only be done in plus.  Anyway buys this game! its good!basic game: 10/10 would get such a high bounty that even the dark brotherhood does not want to let me in again.plus version: 20/10 would spend 10 hours making an arsenal of ultimate confusion weapons just to watch my enemies attack eachother again.

												Bought this game on a whim when it costed less than a euro during a steam sale. Had I known it was this good, I'd have bought the game at full price on release. One Way Heroics is a roguelike in a more traditional sense of the phrase, while taking massive hints from FTL's style of one-way travel and resource managment.What's especially surprising is how addictive and fun the online elements of this game are, as there is an option to join a world with multiple people already in it. The special seeded levels that rotate on a daily basis add some serious life to the game as well.			"

 A Great Time killing game, hold on Solitare, Chip's Challenge, or whatever you play to kill time, here's ONE WAY HEROICSSo after playing this game for a good little bit, I have found that this game could easily be one of those games that you could play to kill time, ALOT of time. One of my friends sent me the game and expansion as a gift through Steam, and I tell you what, It's quite an amazing game especially for use old heads that like our RPGs and video games in general with a more retro feel to them. The graphics, by today's standards, aren't the super realistic HD sculptures that a lot of people have come to expect from video games. Instead, the graphics are more of a 16-bit sprites with beautiful choices of color palettes throughout the game. It is very easy to tell when you traverse through different environments, desolate deserts, cold artic tundra, lush beautiful forests and plains. The guards, townsfolk, and inhabitants of the world are just as carefully designed and all look unique. Probably one of the biggest things that makes this game so great is the gameplay. Imagine a Japanese Style Action RPG with a lot of Rogue like aspects that do nothing, but add to replay value of the game. Everything can be randomized, and like most Rogue Likes perma death is a real thing. About the only thing that you can save, aside from the game, is your character's inventory, or rather a select few items to continue playing with. You get a super awesome sword that when roots your enemies and burns them to death, and you don't really want to let it go? Well there's something called a deminisonal vault that you can use to keep that sword through multiple playthroughs. Speaking of that deminisonal vault, the way you get it, and use it is through things called Hero Points. You acquire Hero Points by either completing a full run of the game, or dying. If you die, by some random Dragon Knight in a structure you were checking for loot, drowning in water, or trying to climb to the point of exhaustion and just collapsing. There's also one other very unique way of dying. In this game, you visit a town and you can't revist it, you can't go back the way you came at all. This is because the Dark Lord (boss of the game) is spreading darkness throughout the realm, you touch the darkness and you die. Well the screen scrolls to the right, just like an old school platformer, but instead of being able to go back you can't because of the darkness, if you try, you die. This adds for a significant amount of challenge, you can easily get stuck in areas of the game because of mountains, walls, or whatever other obstacle that impedes your travel, and the darkness catches up and you die. Actually, every action you take, wether it's attacking an enemy, moving, using an item, casting a spell, or whatever moves the darkness closer towards you. The Plot is a throw a way plot you are X hero out to slay the Dark Lord and stop the spread of the darkness throughout the world. There's other campaigns that you can do that are fixed maps that have their own story as well, but it follows the same formula. Probably one of the coolest things about the game is Character Creation. At the beginning of the game you start with two classes, a Swordmaster Class and a Knight Class. You can chose what your sprite looks like, and also give your character perks to help with his stats, or whatever skills you have for the class. You start with three perk slots, but as you play you can unlock up to five perks. This alone gives the game that massive replay value, just to see how every other class works, in a completely different world every single time.As you play through the game, and earn Hero Points,  you also gain new classes to run through the game with, each class, plays very differently from the other. You unlock these classes by either spending those Hero Points you've been hoarding, or by completing specific tasks in game. Aside from the Deminsional Vault, and new Classes, the Hero Points also unlock new perks for character creation.For us retro gaming fans, especially those who are fans of RPGs that came out before everything looked ""pretty"" and realistic, this game is a must own. This will probably end up replacing solitare for those people.			"

One way to get the most out of life is to look upon it as an adventure. -William Feather*I would like to give a special thanks to Earl[33rd] for proof-reading this review and for initially presenting this title to me.Developed by Indie studio Smoking WOLF and released on February 28, 2014, One Way Heroics (OWH) is a two-dimensional procedurally-generated roguelike in which an increasing threat of dark essence jeopardizes every individual in the expanse. You play as a custom character on a trek to defeat the Demon Lord, a powerful entity that imperils the world with the motivation toward total destruction. Before meeting the tendrils of corruption, the player must endure a certain distance-decided when choosing the various game settings-while destroying hostile creatures.Here are a few items of interest within OWH:Gameplay - Aside from other roguelikes, this title’s complexity is derived from its tactical display rather than gameplay, as One Way Heroics utilizes a turn-based approach to combat and item usage. Each in-game action made by the hero utilizes said turns, which advances the daunting foe. The term ‘turn-based strategy’ does not entirely cover this game’s spectrum, however, as every action, whether it be equipping a new weapon or item, or consuming a potion to gain back energy, summons evil one turn closer to the player’s character. Adding to the ominous theme, the darkness swallows the lands you have passed through, and the notification of non-player character deaths can be heard as they disappear into mist. Controls are rather simple on both keyboard and controller, but can be adjusted in the case that they feel awkward. Equipment can be modified within the menus to alter the method of play by adding boons to weapons and armor, but, as stated, this increases danger; these items are gained either as loot from defeated enemies or may be distributed throughout the map. With a high enough Charisma score, the player may also gain discounts from various shops and recruit non-player individuals to the party that will assist in combatting foes and leveling up. Character Creation & Upgrades - Characters comprise of several customizable components, such as name, class, avatar, and perk and statistical preferences chosen by the player; perks may also grant players companions or other game modifications such as quicker swimming or improved unarmed damage. These adjustments allow the player to modify how they would like to play according to the class. Additional equipment may alter damage totals to enemies or reduce them toward the player’s character. Levelling up in OWH operates in a similar way to other titles, as it improves the character’s base statistics depending on which class was chosen.Unlockables - Depending on how far the player’s character progresses in the campaign, a number of Hero Points are rewarded to the player to purchase game augments. These modifications increase the amount of content usable by the player, such as said hero classes, perks-with selections for both combat and other skills-, and expanding what’s known as the Dimensional Vault: an item-storage system in which adventurers may donate a number of items from preceding generations to the next living hero. This expands play so that the entire game is not just an uphill battle with no reward when so close to the resolve, but rather contains encouragement toward progression.TL:DR - One Way Heroics is a fun, simple, and rewarding title with incentive to advance toward the Demon Lord time and time again. There is a great amount of challenge involved in this title, but does not evoke frustration due to its Hero Point system. Though the accolade of defeating the ultimate evil may not be reached every time, the journey is a fantastic ride filled with choice, vicious battle, and sacrifice. I highly recommend this title to anyone who enjoys roguelikes and simple roleplaying mechanics. This game has a great deal of replayability, and I hope you enjoy upon purchase. Thanks for reading.Do you enjoy these reviews? Please visit my Curator Page at  Spearpoint Reviews.			"

												An excellent game indeed. It was definitely that what i expected for a rpg game, but it is still very good. Every time you move, the shadow behind you moves, if you touch the shadow you die. Seems simple nuff. well while you are trying to run away from a shadow, you must also kills enemies, find loot bags and dungeons/villages. Overall i would give the game 9/10 for its simplicity, easy controls and fun game. Altho i do not recomend this game for people who cant beat a challenge.Enjoy ^-^			"

												This game is actually much better than I thought it would be, I thought ""wow okay just another cheap rpg maker game"", then after buying and playing it for a while, I realized it's a little deeper than I originally imagined.I've honestly have never seen a type of Rogue like RPG game like this, it's interesting, and the whole ""Online"" aspect gives it an interesting twist, so you feel like you're playing with a bunch of other people, also it's kinda like Dark Souls where you can see how far they went, or gauge how hard the are will be based on how many people died, also it's pretty neat that you get HP and I think their items if you touch their ghost.I feel like most of the replayability comes from being able to see how far, and how strong you can get, as well as being able to unlock new classe, perks, and grades, which gives you a reason to strive harder, plus the nice music and the pretty good writing helps alot.

												Walk in a straight line, attack what-ever you want, die. Wash, rinse repeat. That is how the general gist of this game progresses. There isn't a whole lot of depth to the game, there aren't many weapons, aren't many variations of enemies, no characters you really connect with, the map areas are general generic type fanatasy locales, and no real story line (other than to stop The Darkness) which is stated in the opening 3 seconds of the game. However this game has something going for it... charm.If that sounds silly just run with it for a moment. There is very little to do, or really unlock that can't be done easily. Unlike the game that drew me to this (Faster Than Light) you can unlock everything in nearly 5 hours, the remainder of the time will be playing with these unlocks. However the goofy commentary from the few NPC's you do find are enough to distract momentarily from the humdrum of walking to your right. That is where this game gets its charm from. The constant breaks in the basic mechanics of the game for a fun, light hearted gab between pixelated characters.Finding all the secret endings and characters endings will be what make you come back to this. The small morsels of charm that you get are what will make you enjoy coming back to it. However, don't expect to be able to play this for long periods of time. I found that the game is best when played a few run throughs at a time. Any longer than that and the charm kinda wears off and the simplistic nature of the game robs from its potential.Additional peripheries were pretty decent as well. The music is fun to listen to but after prolonged time periods begins to grate at your ears. The graphics are simple enough and give it a classic RPG feel that allows me to relive the days of early Final Fantasy's. Mechanics are simple and will be picked up with one minute of playing.Feeling in a good mood today so let's give this game an eeked out 7/10			"

												Ive sunk many hours into this game when i grabbed it off Playism a few months ago. At first it seems like the mechanics are rather simple, but you will find a surprising amount of depth and strategy will go into completing your longer journeys. Between balancing your health, stamina, and always being wary of the black creeping death behind you. If you are a fan of random generation or a fan of RPGs I highly recommend this game. With unlockable classes to keep you coming back for more, and an online leaderboard of sorts (you can play a mode where it tracks your distance traveled along with everyone else playing that mode in realtime) theres a lot of reasons to put a good amount of time into this title.

												One Way Heroics is a series of infinite rougelike adventures. In the game you play as various classes and as you get farther in randomized worlds you can unlock new classes to play in future runs. The screen constantly scrolls to the left and if you do not move to the right you are killed instantly. As you run to the right you kill enemies to level up while picking up better gear. Once in a while you encounter a town where you can spend money on new items or food, and sometimes you encounter dungeons with great loot.An interesting mechanic that helps the game last longer are the perks you can unlock with points you get after an adventure is complete. Before you start a game you can select up to 5 perks (after you unlock the 5 slots) that can help you on your run and you can even carry over items you've obtained to use later.Overall One Way Heroics is worth the $2.00 asking price and is deserving of any casual-hardcore gamer.

												I find that the game is worth far more than what I paid for it, AND NOT BECAUSE IT WAS ON SALE. I've already put in 20 hours and it does not seem like that will be the end of it. It is a fun rogue-like (not too sure what that means) and I'm glad that a friend of mine showed it to me one day. It takes a few trys to catch on and you'll find that you will still be learning more and more each time you play. For the most part the game tells you the essentials and then respects your intelegence as to how to aproach problems presented to you. Tips: diagonal movement > horizontal and vertical movement, play on easy for however long you wish, be mindful of the terain.			"

												This game is simply amazing.You start by choosing a class and up to 5 perks, but you will have to unlock most of these first.It's fun trying different combinations and seeing how they play out.The map is determined by the seed you choose, you can pick a random one, enter one yourself or choose one of a few daily dimensions that are altered in a special way.The game is rogue-like and turn-based, dying means perma-death.During your run you will explore the map, find loot, kill monsters and other enemies, level up, talk to several NPCs who offer various services, recruit NPCs to help you fight and finish your main quest (which is usually killing a boss).Every turn the darkness behind you consumes a little bit more of the map, so you have to keep progressing forward and think carefully about if you'll have enough time to explore a dungeon or visit a town. Normally this isn't really a problem, you can easily outrun the slowly-progressing darkness.In case of emergency you can use your Awakening ability up to 5 times, which stops the time for 3 turns so you can get yourself out of trouble.Usually whenever you die, it is because you weren't careful, you will learn from most deaths.Most of the time there are ways to save yourself, but you just didn't try or think of everything or were too cocky, though of course there are also times when the game really seems to hate you.There are multiple endings depending on how you beat the game and which NPC you have with you.Moreover when you beat the game you can store some items in your vault, which you can choose to use at the beginning of each run.Lastly, it's a single-player game, but while playing the game online it will show you details about other players who are in the same dimension and occasionally you will meet ghosts of other fallen players who will drop one of their items and give you experience.Furthermore after clearing a dimension it will show you the characters of everyone who completed it as well.For the price, especially when it's on sale, it's a steal.I definitely also recommend buying OWH+ if you already enjoyed the base game, it adds a lot of new content.

												Do I recommend this game? Yes. Do I want more people to buy it both before and after the sale, which by the way is a ridiculously small price to pay for such a deep and interesting game? Absolutely 100% yes. I first saw this game on Greenlight a few months back, and I honestly thought it looked like crap. Seeing that it went on sale for eighty-seven cents, I figured I'd sell a few cards off and buy it, which turned out to be probably the best idea I've had throughout the whole summer sale. I really honestly love roguelikes, and this is about as good as it gets for me. Tough enemies? Check. General time constraints? You bet. Omnipresent instant-death wall that constantly follows you and kills the NPCs you pass by? Oh, yes. There's so much to love about this game, and that's just with the gameplay. The story is honestly one of the best I've seen in a game so seemingly small and shallow (though, that was only on the surface). What starts as a quest to kill a Demon Lord over and over turns into so much more, but I won't spoil anything here. There's so much rich backstory to get around to, and close to (or I think exactly?) a dozen endings to unlock. The endings may be short, but they're very, very sweet. The wordplay is a bit awkward, at times, but most of the endings managed to evoke the emotions I feel they were meant to. This game caught me so far off-guard, that I ended up 100%ing it, getting every epilogue, and every achievement, in just twenty-two hours of gameplay. That may not seem like much, but I went super hard and no-life'd it. Not because I wanted to get it done as quickly as possible, but because I wanted to challenge myself to completely finishing it in as little time as I could. Would I do it all again, casually? Yes, and I plan to play it now and then when I get bored, trying new character builds and strategies, and getting the highest heroics scores I can manage.I'd absolutely recommend this game, again. Buy it. It's cheap (as of writing this review) AND it's cheap in general, at only $3.50. Buy it. You (probably) won't regret it. If you like roguelikes, that is. If you don't care for dying lots and in lots of sometimes funny or dumb ways, then don't buy it. I love this game.			"

												This game has to rank amongst one of my top most favorite rogue-like RPGS. With the first difficulty already being hard and the other difficulties and scenarios much harder than the previous one, this game makes you carefully plan your decisions (through movements, skills, choosing appropiate stats, and watching your three bars closely) in order to even get close to killing the final boss. All of the classes have a completely different playstyle (besides that most of them require you to use basic attacks to damage) to even get past the 100m mark. And although you start fresh everytime you begin a new character, the game rewards you by allowing you to keep a limit of items from past runs to aid your next. All of these elements combine to create a satisfacting experience that can be enjoyed by any RPG player and can consume time faster than you consume a bucket of KFC chicken. The soundtrack is worth a mention as well, fitting and worthy of rocking your head to the beat at the speed of the tempo. I would highly recommend this game to all RPG fans looking for a fair amount of difficulty, and recommend all casual players to give it a go as well. It's more than well worth its price of $3.49, so try this amazing masterpiece of a turn-based slightly pixelated RPG.			"

I could still eke out more if i wanted to with the daily high score trials and online campaigns and trying to clear Inhuman Maniac mode with all the other classes i love. It's a value proposition that can't be beat even if you ignore the constantly-unfolding story of the world and the genuinely touching endings and if you have the slightest interest in roguelikes, JRPGs, indie games, genre experimentation or honestly anything but CoD and you spend all summer playing Titanfall or something instead of picking this up then you're seriously part of the problem with gaming in A.D. 2014.

From its layers of intricate design to its insane replayability that keeps you coming back for more, not to mention the beautiful BGM soundtrack that easily rivals many of the best video game music out there.One Way Heroics cater to a very niche audience, if you're a fan of roguelike and old school RPG games I fully recommend this.

												This game is great on all fronts. Gameplay mechanics are great, keeping things moving quickly while requiring serious tactical decisions. The creators clearly recognized their key gameplay factors and designed all the game features around them.The story is surprisingly deep and well-written (with party member plotlines and NPC dialog helping reinforce the overall theme).Replay value is almost infinite, with many classes and party members, lots of endings (with different victory conditions), daily worlds with special rules, and varied environments. Oh, and difficulty settings of course.Only potential drawback is runs can get quite long for some endings, with permadeath, and death can come quickly even late in the game (for some classes/difficulty settings at least). But you'll get your money's worth even if you don't do the longest quests.I highly recommend this for anyone who's ever enjoyed a roguelike.			"

												Pretty damn epic... I've beat it with every class on easy and I intend to beat it with every class on higher difficulties. It's immensly fun. After each playthrough you earn points which you can use to expand a cross playthrough bank, the possibilites for your characters get amazing. It's great. I haven't had this much fun with a low budget game since ""Tales of Maj'Eyal"". I'd reccomend it to anyone and if they said they didn't like it I'd think they were on crack...			"

												Elona: Prepare to die edition.It's a refreshing as ♥♥♥♥ game, looks and plays better than the screenshots. (I almost passed it by because I thought it was an RPG maker title...) and challenging without being unfairly so. The ""small"" class list works to it's favor as you can mix and match stats, perks and traits to make them into other specialties. IE: Swordmaster with all wrestler perks will do fist of the north star style combo punching. You can turn a adventurer into other things besides a rogue-ish class. Etc.			"

												One Way Heroics plays like your typical mystery dungeon game, but this time, it's a bit different. Your dungeon is a randomly generated overworld that scrolls in one direction, dotted with enemies, dungeons, towns, and treasure. What I love most about the game is that at the conclusion of a runthrough, you're rated based on your actions and progress which in turn rewards you with points used to unlock new classes, new perks, or expand our dimensional vault(a storage that allows you to bring over items from a previous gameplay).The game is a great price, only three dollars and it has alot of replay value. Even if you beat normal and hard modes, there are other modes that are updated and added into the mix every so often that challenges you with a new way to play. If you enjoy Japanese RPG, or mystery dungeons(Shiren the Wanderer, Izuna: The Unemployed Ninja, Pokemon Mystery Dungeon) you have got to get this game, especially since it's super cheap! No reason why anyone shouldn't have it!			"

												I paid 86 cents for this on sale, and it's one of the best damn games I've played all year. The concept is clever, and the execution is basically flawless. OWH has more polish and apparent effort put in than a lot of games from big studios. You can pick it up and play without too much investment, but there's more depth than is initially obvious. Repeat plays are encouraged with daily worlds, higher unlockable difficulties, new classes/perks, and lots of secrets and extra endgame content. The graphics, music and translation/humor are also spot on. UUUUUUGH JUST BUY IT			"

One Way Heroics looks really simple and shallow on the surface but it is a gem that wont break the bank! Why should you buy this game?*Multiple classes, fully customizable with feats and items from your vault and shops. *Near infinite amount of randomized worlds to explore and attempt to beat.*Swaths of items and other hidden content some of which can only be found by exploring new worlds.*Various difficulty levels which impact the way items, enemies, and events unfold within each world.*Cute graphical art style, soundtrack, and writing with no filler.**One Way Heroics Plus should be released soon on steam and it further expands upon the game. It is definitely worth the price of admission.			"

												In all honesty, this game is just outright fun, and an absolute steal for the price, fairly fun rogue-like with some nice, calming music, and enough depth that you can plan out your character build, and if you liked a procedurely generated world, you can just revisit it with the Dimension Code they give you. This game also made me feel...things man. Some of the endings you can get are outright depressing and sad, others are heartwarming to see, and once you get the hang of the game, clearing it on the daily challenge variety maps is a cakewalk. Get this game if ya like yourself some good 'ol JRPG rougelike action.Oh, and don't ever go left. Left is bad.			"

												Rogue-like slasher with rpg elements. Nice quick convenient ""die and build up"" your character aspect. Essentially every time you die in trying to beat the game, you get better and better equips you can store in your ""dimensional"" storage which allows you to use it for the next play-through. The catch is that every time you replace previous items you can only use items from that particular play-through. This in turn gets you to use unique classes specifically to collect up amazing gear way later and then die off, use that gear from the beginning and in turn collect up better gear. Eventually you'll get so epic with unlocked perks and such that the game will be a breeze. It's a fun challenge. 5 hour marker beat it but there is harder modes to play and some replay value involved with different classes and whatnot. :)Update:I have played it a good bit more and there is in total, three ways to beat the game. The first is the most obvious, the other two.. quite a bit of a challenge. More game-play to it than I thought. more than 15 hours in, and still not quite to those other two endings yet :P			"

												This game is such a nice refreshing take on the roguelike formula. The extra dimensions added to the game of having to avoid being gobbled up by the sweeping darkness that is constantly moving closer and closer makes for an exciting and (at times) extremely tense run. Add onto that the ""dark lord"" timer that's perpetually ticking away, which will launch you into a boss battle well before you're prepared, forcing some incredibly tense moments which make the escape and later victory that much more satisfying. Besides those unique twists, the rest of the game is pretty standard and is what you'd expect from a graphical roguelike such as this one. There's a really nifty multiplayer-like integration into the game, wherein the progress, accomplishments and eventual downfalls of the people playing on the same seed as you are periodically popping up as you play, and you can even run into the ghosts of dead players, receiving some minor benefit. The soundtrack for the game is great, really good old school rpg nostalgia quality to it. I have some small gripes about the interface and the way the menus are done, but it doesn't detract from the game in any major way. Overall, I think this is a fun game that's well worth picking up, especially on sale as it's already pretty cheap.			"

												This game absolutley took my breath away. Easy to learn, but hard to master this game can be a fantastic two-hour romp for the casual or a twenty hour treck for the completionist. A throwback to old-school dungeon crawlers execpt each dungeon-world is randomly generated.    The objective of this game is simply to go on a sidescrolling adventure without being caught by the ""darkness"" (which you will always have to out-run.) and defeat the ""demon lord"", a powerful foe who will infrequently visit you for short periods of time where you can either attempt to run away from him defeat him. And as you make your way through this world, you will encounter grottos, towns, and all sorts of surprises. You may even find an extra party member or two, who each have thier own side story and indivdual abilities.  You first start a game with only two classes, which grasually expands to a nice collection. The music that plays along your Journey is also cathey, and never gets all.   All in all - espicially considering its price - I would not hesitate to give this game a 10 out of 10.			"

												25 hours on this game, is a very long time. You can get through sooo many runs with in this game, and expierence soo much, And once you start really getting indepth, you will be surprised just how intense and interesting, And just compelling this game is,    I am 22 male gaming since i was 3, Usually serious about everything, This game makes me fangirl so hard, More than i have over any game,""UPDATE!""  I have been playing this for a total of 91 hours now, no idea how, it feels like so much longer.  Thanks to one way heroics plus, even though i have completed a ton of quests. i still have more to do, still finding new things sometimes.  and still loving this game so much ^_^ DOSEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Another update. 99 hours in total now.  Just beat the main boss of the expansion, And If you are thinking about the dlc being higher cost than the game. Don't think of it as Dlc. It is a huge expansion and well worth any extra money.  Holy christ just getting set up to face the end is difficult enough "" trying to avoid spoilers"" once you become dedicated to trying to make something happen. Every step makes your heart race. as usually "" in my case"" a pack of 5 ultimate dragon knights come around the corner,  And then demon lord spawns and then i get ambushed by bandits.   A single unintresting easily beaten increased difficulty quest run, turned in to an epic quest, gaining allies. Finding Sacred weapons. fighting hordes of demons, because the spawn rate hated me. and eventually truly once and for all saving the world. My last play through has left me wanting soo much more one way heroics			"

You are a random hero tasked with destroying the evil Demon Lord and to stop the spread of Darkness. The key mechanic is that the Darkness comes from the left and you can only venture right ( One Way Heroics ,duh! ) .  It can create some funny scenarios, trust me. So , if you are able to pick this one up , do it. Its a good, little rogue-like,well worth your time.			"

												Easily one of the best roguelikes out there. I'd put it at number 2 in my book.The companions are terrific; each have their own stories and quests. I don't think I've ever seen a roguelike with a story that was actually compelling. The spell casting is phenomenal, something I could never enjoy in Nethack, Slash'em, and other turnbased roguelikes.Terrific soundtracks, another thing that many roguelikes lack. I'd say on-par, maybe better, than FTL soundtracks.IMO, this game has an excellent balance of luck vs tactical sense (Its not a total crapshoot but there is enough randomness to make repeat playthroughs rewarding and fun.Incredible sense of adventure as you flee the oncoming doom from the west; different biomes offer unique challenges and enemies.Most people don't realize there are actually THREE ways to win. If you think you da man just because you stomped the demon lord, think again. You ain't done yet, lil ♥♥♥♥♥.And... its 87 cents during sales. You could buy a soda... or you could save half that money and buy a game with at least 20 hours of content. What a time to be alive.			"

												I spent a whopping 3 dollars on this game a few days ago and I've had more fun with it than most 60$ triple-A studio titles. It seems like more and more roguelikes are hitting the market these days and while some of them are 'meh', this one most certainly isn't. Not only does it provide a very nice retro console-RPG feel, it has enough content and trophies to go after to keep anyone busy. At first I thought I was getting my hands on something that would be fun for an afternoon and little else... less than a week later and more than thirty hours in and I can't put the friggin thing down. HIGHLY recommended to anyone who likes roguelikes, RPGs or games that will steal your life in general. :)			"

												Though the idea of a ""time-limited RPG"" threw me off at first, I quickly realized that this game has such huge potential, and is a very fun game. If you can get past the first few playthroughs without wanting to hit a cheatcode button for every monster that chases you, then you have a very playable and fun game. The game is set in the style of an old Japanese RPG but with the twist of the Darkness coming from the left side of the screen, essentially moving roughly 1/3 - 5/12 of a block every turn. You have to continue running to the right and beating off monsters that hunt you down like a wild animal. There are multiple difficulty levels in this game, starting with a Walk in the Park difficulty, which is where the End-Boss appears at 400 km and you get npcs to help you when he appears (basically easy mode). There are multiple choices of class in this game, each with it's own Steam achievement, and each with it's own unique skill set/passive stats. The 8 different classes are Swordmaster, Knight, Hunter, Pirate, Bard, Adventurer, Force User (Mage), and Hero. Some of the classes are rather overpowered, where they can one hit anything with a sword or axe that has at least 10-15 Attack power, and some of them are very weak, requiring you to play like a coward and run until you can get a Holy item or find equipment that makes you super powered. Although there is a lack of creativity in the active skills of each class (basically just Awakening, and some skill you learn at level 1), the uniques are nice to play around with. For example, the pirate has a maxed out Swimming unique, where he uses only 1 turn to swim instead of 5. In terms of playability with the classes, you essentially master one, usually the Hero class, and run through the whole thing playing strategically.There is an element of playability where you can transfer over items that you really like or want to use on a different playthrough called the Dimensional Vault. After you die or beat the game, you can place items, up to a limit, in the Vault and access it through your next character. This was a nice idea, but I feel like instead of having a NPC that you have to talk to in order to access it, there should be an option to ask you if you want to access your vault at the very beginning of the game, after you've already started. Another thing the developers added were perks. There is a very limited number of perks, and it's a nice addition. Lastly, there is the Heroics leve ratings, where you get rated from F - SS on how well you did in the criteria of Levels, Battles, Chests looted, and Distance. This was really sweet, and there is also the bonus points that you get for certain actions, like killing no friendly characters. This portion makes you want to play again until you get it right, and I loved it. It could definitely be expanded upon.I really enjoyed the dimensions, but it feels very plain when using ""Create random dimension"". When you create a random dimension, it's just a normal dimension with everything placed around differently, no bonuses to equipment, unique NPCs that can join you, or any of that sort. It's just a map with the areas randomized. However, every day, the game updates a few special campaign dimension, about 3-4, and they have unique differences. Some have stronger monsters for more experience, others have a special NPC that you can recruit. Those are nice, but they only change once a day, and though it's a nice catch to get people to play every day, when you beat the game a couple times, it gets very boring and you lose interest of even looking at the list.That being said, the time you do spend playing this game would be worth it, especially for a low price. It's super cheap, fun for a good amount of time, and you can replay through the campaigns as much as you want. The perks are very limited however, and I do hope they update it to have a comprehensive list of unique skills, and possibly vary the classes more to feel more balanced.			"

												An excellent game, able to be played in short bursts or over long periods it offers a good mix of challenge and ease of entry. It has several classes most of which play differently enough to feel like you are actually playing different classes rather than just the same class reskinned twenty times. A surprising variety of enemy types also help to keep the combat fresh and the looming threat of both the demon lord and the darkness keeps things tense as you try to make the best use of what resources and time you have.To top it off the random maps mean that while you can have the same adventure over and over if you want to there's always something fresh to do.

												Worth noting:+It's only like £2, and for that price you get a pretty expansive rouge like.+Randomly generated areas combined with ticking down clock for boss appearences makes it fun to replay after a while away+It's got a good gimmick - you have to keep moving right or die, which means movements should be careful.+Can grab a dimension name from a friend in order to play their experiences, so you can organize group races easily+Really nice looking GUI, so you don't need a tileset unless you want to mix it up or hate 2d for some reason-As of right now, there's only like 7 or so classes in the game and about as many perks (excluding stat upgrades), so-Monster appearence, even on afternoon stroll (normal difficulty) is kinda limited, but I've only just started...-Offer small dungeons and towns, but the constant eating of the left side of the screen offers little time to reap their benefitsI've not logged as many hours as I'd like into this game, so I may put up a second critique later. But if you've got £2 to spare and want to get started in the rougelike genre, this game is practically a steal. I'd really recommend getting it.			"

												I really like this game it's a lot more fun that I was expecting and for the price it was most definately worth it. Also apperently you can buy it for $2 on http://playism-games.com but I don't know much about that.Just adding to this review because looking back on it, it's not very informative and probably still isn't going to be. The gameplay itself is interesting. The part that got me liking the game so much is that it feels like it keeps expanding. Alternate endings and alternate worlds the game can be simple but really fun at the same time. Just getting better at the game feels good. You can repeat the worlds you have been on and see if you can get extremely far or just keep shifting though worlds and explore what the game has to offer.			"

												This is a fantastic game that's got a lot of replayability, once you get the hang of how basic exploring and decision making needs to be made, it becomes addicting.  This 3 dollar game is going to consume a lot of my time.  I like how each class isn't limited to weapons and armor, and how you can carry over items with the Dimensional Vault.  The items losing durability over time without a solid avenue to keep them repaired just makes you push harder to find new weapons and armor to slay the Demon Lord! A++++ For a unique well put together game.			"

												One Way Heroics is a lot of fun.  It has four difficulties (plus an added setting to make things even harder,) three main endings, as well as several epilogues based on the allies that you manage to recruit along the way, and limitless replay value, thanks to short playtimes, unlockables, and the ability to transfer a limited number of items from one playthrough to the next.  The world is ending, and unlike every other rpg ever made, the threat is very obvious and imminent.  As you run, behind you the world is being devoured by the darkness, and you along with it if you dally.  You have to find the best equipment you can, upgrade it, level up, and recruit any allies that might be willing to help, and stop the Darkness from destroying the world by any means necessary.Edit:  One Way Heroics Plus only adds even more reason to play.

												Fun game, I really recommend it for it's price. Basically, you're just running right in an 8-bit, procedurally-generated world, trying to become as strong as you can by fighting enemies and picking up a ton of different pieces of equipment and items before the final boss of the world comes to ♥♥♥♥ your♥♥♥♥♥♥up. There's an interesting gimmick involved though, you can't just stop and grind on enemies or bother trying to crack open a chest because darkness is forever swallowing the world from the left. This makes things incredibly interesting, because every step you take is another few pixels or so that the darkness is moving towards you. Every ""turn"" you take to attack, every person you talk to, every shop you enter, every enemy you kill is another chance for the darkness to eat your world. It's really a fun game, and it's a great price, so if this looks interesting to you, go ahead and get it!			"

												This game is really nice, even if you have to do the same thing over and over the fact that you can generate random maps and that you have to flee the dark wall it make it nice each time, I had a great time trying to unlock everything, and trying to get the best weapon i could save in chest.  I Would defenetly would reccomend this game to all those you doesn't care about graphic and care about the fun time you can have playing a game. This is one of those time i can say i got my money well-spent.			"

												By far this game is one of my most favorite  indie games ever. I've played quite a few inclusing Bastion and things like Trine but this is on a different level. Its simple, combat is flawless  and easy to work with. You can survive sometimes by just spamming  'z' on monsters and get away with like 2hp.But the game is not about surving. You need to build up your character, make decisions on whether to give up 5 lvls to increase stats such as strength. There are so many different variations it's nearly endless fun. There are different gamemodes , many classes with their unique skill set and many types of weapons. Also one of the key things i love about the game is the amount of save files, when they were making this game i'm certai nthey wanted to let ur imagination go wild so they gave u tons X_XIn conclusion, this game will rekindle that feeling you ever had when u played games like Pokemon Mystery Dungeon. Along the way you gain new allies, and based on your choices they might leave as quickly as they go.BTW THE SOUNDTRACK IS ONE OF THE BEST EVER !My rate-4.5/5 starsHave Fun :D			"

												One Way Heroics surprised me immensely. First time in appeared on Steam it caught my attention because Roguelikes and Roguelites are my passion, but even though the price tag was very tempting I decided to let it go for now.It wasn't until my friend recommended the game to me that I have decided to try it.And I was immediately left with good first impression. I always thought sprite graphics looked cute, so regarding this it was great choice by the developers. As it often goes with roguelites, as you progress in the game, either die over and over, or beat the final villain over and over, you unlock more classes, more perks and so, which means that the replay value is quite high.There are plenty of things to unlock, plenty things to see and I bet you won't see them all even after you invested several hours in the game, I mean, it was just now that I found one recruitable companion who made me appreciate the game even more.All in all it's and amazing game that is a must buy. For 3 dollars you are getting a real gem. "

												I'd like to start by saying that I bought this game on a whim (mostly persuaded by the $3 price-tag).  I rarely spend less than a week considering whether to by a game or not.I've only just scratched the surface of this game (3 runs so far), and yet I'm already so happy with it.  There's a large variance of items, the character types and skills feel unique from one another, and even though the game is constantly pushing you forwards (it's quite literally ""One Way""), I don't feel rushed at all while playing.  It's an excellent game to play for a short break or a long session of multiple games, and the RPG & Rouge-Like elements blend seamlessly.  On top of that, it has a top-notch soundtrack and intuitive scoring system.I can't even say all of these things about some AAA titles.  This is a small Indie game.  If there's one Indie game under $5 that's worth your time, it's this one.  I would go as far as to recommend it to people who have never even glanced at a Rouge-Like before.			"

												One Way Heroics has a straightforward but great concept. I was just about to overlook this game and not buy it but brought myself to anyway. Did I regret it? Definitely not. Why? A small price to pay for several hours of game gameplay and replayability. Was it worth it? I don't know about you but if I followed the concept of ""$1 = 1 hour gameplay"" then this is definitely worth lots more than what it's priced at. -Overviews and stuff- (if you just want the opinion go straight to it)You play as the ""almighty"" hero and continue travelling right to take down the demon lord who is slowly consuming the world in darkness. This darkness will continue following you throughout your travels. The game will also happily remind you that the very left side of your screen is death and despair and you don't want to be caught in it otherwise it'll eviscerate you......or something along those lines. There are several dimensions and special ones every now and then. This means you may share a dimension with friends (though you won't see them, you'll see how they did).In case you don't know what rogue-likes are, they are basically games that start you at level 1 and if you end up at the game over screen you have to start the game all over again, at level 1. Games like these however will allow you to carry certain 'things' over to your next playthrough. In this case, you'll be allowed to carry a limited amount of items you found across your previous travels (the limit of items can be increased as well).With One Way Heroics, you'll want to explore as much of an area as you can because you cannot stick around for long, and this is the part I liked best about this game. Exploring dungeons is risky because walls end up being an obstacle (and possibly sandwich you with the darkness if you can't get out). Don't stick around towns for too long as you'll want to do what you need to do then get out so then they can die and you'll continue on your journey.There's quite a number of items you can obtain in-game, dungeons to explore and as you finish your playthrough, you'll see your ""Heroic rating"". Depending on your rating, you'll earn certain amounts of Heroic points to use to unlock perks, classes and the cap limit of your dimensional vault. What you do affects your rating (challenging yourself can be rewarding as well). Perks are upgrades to your hero and you may change them to however you like. Extra perks are unlockable if you earn enough points for them. As for classes, you may either use your points on buying them OR you can unlock them for free by doing the objective for them. Dimensional vaults can be used to carry items from your last playthroughs and into your new game. The cap limit can be increased with heroic points and become more costly the more space you have.-Opinion(s)-There's a lot to why I find this game enjoyable but I'll tell you the main ones.1. The concept is pretty simple, and when it comes to concepts, I usually prefer simple ones. It's how you execute the concept is what appeals to me the most. This game actually did a great job at it and you'll be reminded very 'clearly' as well. I personally liked it and of course, this is basically my opinion of it. It'll either be a hit or a miss. Definitely a hit for me.2. Usually when it comes to RPG, I tend to think that there will be a lot of items that aren't neccessary but are there anyway for the quanitity. Most cases I prefer quality over quantity and in this case, it was the right amount for either two. You won't find many things necessary but they are useful items so it is completely up to you how you want to play and you'll have a variety of items to venture with.3. The gameplay mechanics are simple but for this top-down it also features diagonals (yes, very strange for a top-down to certain people but this added more of a challenge and I enjoyed it). I enjoy playing with a controller and I'm glad I don't have to actually use my mouse or keyboard at all to play this game.4. Music. Why? It was great to listen to when I played the game and never thought about turning it off.5. After you die or finish the game, you get to choose a variety of messages to tell others how you died or survived the struggle in dimensions. Even if the game ends, I'll be left satisfied with these messages (and unlocking more stuff).6. Bread crusts. You'll understand once you play the game and meet the chefs.Overall, I was very close to missing out this amazing game. I usually don't play top-downs, rogue-likes and what not but this game, whether you play games like this or not, I recommend you at least give it a go. It's not a grindfest and it's not too hard to pick up as well. It's also a cheap game, whether you get it on sale or not. This game was worth buying for just a few bucks.			"

												Such a simple but fun game. The controls took a little bit getting used to but other than that it's been a lot of fun. The constant creep of the Darkness from the leftside of the screen keeps you constantly glancing at the mini-map and wondering if you can risk delving in to that dungeon real quick - will you be able to find an exit? If not, will you be able to hack your way out in time?  I't definitely worth the 3 bucks I threw at this game.			"

												Put simply, One Way Heroics is the Heroes of Might and Magic III of turn-based rogue-likes. You should expect to lose several hours at a time with each session. Unlike classic Rogue-Likes (Dungeon Crawl/Elona) I've found that every time I play this, I feel like I discover new ways to play the game. When I lose, rather than becoming discouraged, I find myself eager to try out new builds or adjusting my strategy and seeing how far it will take me.If you're even considering trying it out, you won't be disappointed.

												A game that some would consider simplistic, I consider it the best investment I have ever made in a game. One Way Heroics will require you to learn a lot on your own, as well as experiment with different classes. Like a true rogue-like, things can go very well or very poorly. Skill and experience will carry you through clutch moments. You will appreciate the chance to befriend any companion on a journey. And, at the end, you can actually reflect on memorable moments in your run. One Way Heroics gives you ample scenarios to do this with, and nearly endless generation to go the extra mile in. tl;dr worth every penny			"

												Game presents itself as a cheap trash casual game without any story or even decent mechanics but with a single fun idea. I played it expecting to find just that. It lied to me. Though not perfect, there are many good mechanics with great replayability. After a few runs, you find secrets. They hid the plot! They even hid the boss! And when you figure out that a huge chunk of the game is hidden, you'll start digging like I did.It's not an amazing 60 dollar game but it's worth at least around 10 dollars. It's a great game and for 3 dollars, it's beyond perfect.			"

The unique scrolling aspect simulates time in an immersive way without becoming  too stresfull or frustrating. Also the hints and advice are costomized to each playthrough answering all of my questions just before i've asked them (very cool feature.) And finally as the never-ending-gobstopper of a cherry on top, each playthrough earns points allowing permanent character progression upgrades, and unlockable classes so no playthrough feels like a waste of time.

												Take (a kinder version of) Rogue Legacy's ""death gains you currency to improve all future runs"" mechanic, put it in a more traditional turn-based, top-down roguelike format, and remove the ability to head left without risking death massively. Congratulations: you've got One-Way Heroics down relatively well. Add in the concept of daily challenge worlds a la Spelunky HD, and you have a killer combo - every day, random custom worlds show up for everyone to play in, and the deaths of others can benefit you directly. Find someone's corpse and gain XP/items from it... but be careful, god only knows if what killed them is going to come out for you as a result.It's a solid roguelike with interesting mechanics and ""permadeath"" that still gains you progress. Plus it is CHEAP AS HELL. If you aren't interested by this description, dodge it, but I really can't add more to this without going stupidly in-depth on mechanics and I think you should be able to pick out your choice from here.

												Oh look, it's another RPGm-No. I know that most of you out there hate the ""usual"" RPGmaker games, but i'd just like to say that this game is not a RPGmaker game, and yet - some of you just don't appreciate the hard work and decide to judge the game based on store page screenshots. That only begs for a more important question -  Why can't you love One Way Heroics?Library, New start, gameplay and the end. The cycle of a steam game and the end of playtime. Though we mostly have unplayed games in our library, we want to give each and every one of them at least a try. It is in such desperate times we find ourselves caught between playing League of Legends or playing a few minutes on Steam, as we don't have enough time for all the games we own. However, this one is a very important game you must try.Although One Way Heroics is like a piece of artwork, even the most popular one might not be suited for everyone. It's for that I spend so much time writing these great reviews.  Despite how much we bare ourselves, no matter the cost, no matter the repercussions, there is always something more to say about a good game... but sometimes it is best to not say anything and just let the game communicate it's strengths and weaknesses, and take the gameplay over reviews.This is one of those unique games. I highly recommend it even if it is sometimes very unforgiving (example: playing force user and not finding a single energy item for 800 turns).9.5/10			"

												A modern side-scroller roguelike with anime-style graphics. It has most of the hallmark features of the roguelike genre -- procedurally generated world, tactical turn-based gameplay, interesting items (although much simpler than in big roguelikes such as ADOM or DCSS), multiple classes to choose from. The main thing which set its apart than other roguelikes is the side-scroller aspect -- the world is constantly moving to the right, and you lose if you don't move along. There are also some important aspects which are a bit anti-roguelike. One is that there are ""save crystals"" which can be used to save your game, but they felt more like an option for casual players -- the game seems balanced for permadeath play. Another aspect is that, after your game ends, you can store some of your items in the ""dimensional vault"", and use them in your next games -- this goes a bit against the traditional roguelike style, where your every game starts exactly the same as your first -- and when you win, you know that you won because you have learned the skills, not because the game became easier. However, I don't see it as a problem in the case of this game.One problem I have with this game is that it does not run in Linux -- I run it via Wine, but this is inconvenient, and I lose music, which is apparently good.In my opinion, it is far from the best games in the roguelike genre, but I still recommend playing it.

												Taking One Way Heroics to a new level, Plus adds almost double the content with new classes, enemies, features and more. Defeat the Demon Lord in a whole different dimension with this unmissable addition. Literlly the DLC and the Whole entire game in a nutshellIf you are a fan of Rouge like Dungeons / Openworlds like Minecraft - Binding Of Issac series, and Cyrpt of the Necrodancer. Then this game is also a must in your inventory of wonderous games.I personally would like to say I spent countless hours offline and online on this game. Trust me, it may look low now. But I spent 100+ of hours playing this... Why? I had worlds to explore. I maybe explored over 1000+ worlds and yet have to save not even 40% of them yet. You get to choose your class and you are already set to go on a journey of a everlasting battle of darkness. Not only that,  the darkness is actually a dragon!  is also a very impending doom of your very world you travel and  saving!Fear not, you have time on your hand. No joke, time is of the essance and so is key placement, fighting, item usage and your weapon durability. May I also say you have a day/night cycle? Vision ? More over that you have Bonuses and debuffs? Even more so you can find allies! Even if you're willing to sacrifice some of your levels,  A bard and hero is more sufficient in creating a co-op NPC!  you can obtain some Cooperating Enemies or other misc!. The content of the first game is already a great stand alone game. But the expansion far over gives it more power and bang for your buck. Even at a sale price, the game is fantastic. The updates are nearly weekly and they are on the clock * LOL PUNS* constantly checking for bugs and patching new campaigns.The classes are easy to understand, the game mechanics simply easy to use, and if delt well , very useful to master. As time, placements, and generally the whole landscape. You too can already learn the many ways of becoming heroic.There is also a _Afterdeath_ Screen where you can save, trade, expend, repair, and increase your items you collected in your traveling of the worlds. Hell you can even gain items you can't get in certain campaings. But if you complete it , you gain special other perks, even endings you can get if you finally get them! Game has perks in it... PERKS! Even Debuffs that make your heroic level skyrocket, but not for the faint of heart. As the Debuffs increase levels, yes, but make your game FAR more Harder and more time pinching then the other easy pickings. Even if you think you got a nice going class you like and you unlock another and gain them the right set for them. You want to try to get more classes. The DLC does that for you, it adds 4 more classes, ON TOP with more perks, settings, increase in more items, drops, enemies. Even more campaigns you can do in your  Castle Renavations and also other main / side quests!  More toys to find. Even going beyond the limit. The world never ends. The Pros  Rouge Like - Infinite Possiblities  Low Price   Trading Cards  Retro Gameplay with innovative tactics.  Weekly Updates / New Campaigns   Great for Game Stuffers and Collectors!  Great storyline - Mini Campaigns with Plots and Events  Great Quick Game for short players - Walk in the Park if you have a break in your schedule!The Cons  Time Waster - Somewhat good too.   Slightly challenging to a new RPG Player if not prepared -  Be Fairly Warned - If going for harder campaigns and doing it for cheevies, I suggest trying to use Hero / Knight Classes to survive if not, Bet your heroic tush goodbye! [spoiler/]  No Multiplayer Base - But What you expect? I said *Co-op* but it's your Allies you make in game.  Options and HUD UI a bit ... Cluttered but I let it slide as it trying to keep all your info in the game as you travel without the need of constant back tracking.All in All A very great game, I love it, I play it, I am Addictted to it.In my score I give it 9.2 / 10 Review9.5/10 - Gameplay9.0/10 - Music / OST9.0/10 - Graphics8.5/10 - Storyline10/10  - Creativity and Originality			"

												As I've mentioned before and is somewhat common knowledge about a niche genre, every rogue-like is a balancing act between luck and skill to varying degrees. One Way Heroics, to its credit, trends more toward skill from my play time so far. There are moments of failure, but they are logical moments. ""Whoops. Forgot about the scrolling screen of doom.""""Whoops. Ignored the icon above an enemy showing it's a miniboss.""""Whoops. Forgot about my potions.""That's what is refreshing about the game; every failure makes sense. Often, that isn't the case in other examples of the genre. Each game has its own unique learning curve and priorities, of course. But this isn't the kind of game where you decide to drink a potion and roll the dice on it being poison or acid. It's far more structured than that, with information clearly presented to the player. This ensures that any difficulty is genuine, and not just a random number generator. I can appreciate that.Aside from that noteworthy benefit, One Way Heroics is pretty cool on its own merits. Classic pixellated graphics aren't rare, but the game uses them in a charming way rather than seeming budget-minded. The scrolling mechanic is fairly unique, and adds elements of point-focused gaming such as Cannabalt. It's a simple thing, but executed just right to encourage that ""one more run"" mindset. In short: I got this game less than a day ago, and I already feel like I've got my money's worth and then some. Give it a shot. "

												Great game for a low price! We've all spent a good deal of money on the latest game only to be disappointed by the results. One Way Heroics take the approach where they sell their product cheap so that gamers will not feel cheated in the unlikely event that they do not like it. The formula is ridiculously simple. Think of one of the old school Final Fantasy games where you walk from town to town facing random enemies. This basically sums up a good deal of this game. Sure there is a demon lord and classes, but it is very simplistic in nature. My old gripe with the game is that you basically start off from scratch every time you play it. To me this says that your last question meant nothing, start over. The good thing about it is that there are literally infinite possibilities as the universe randomly generates names, creatures, treasures, etc. Easy to lose yourself in it.			"

(Also mountains are evil)One of the things i did like is the music, reminds me of the good ol days of jrpgs in the 90's, which is also a plus.Overall id give this game a 9/10and for $3 its a damn good deal too.

												Great game for a low price! We've all spent a good deal of money on the latest game only to be disappointed by the results. One Way Heroics take the approach where they sell their product cheap so that gamers will not feel cheated in the unlikely event that they do not like it. The formula is ridiculously simple. Think of one of the old school Final Fantasy games where you walk from town to town facing random enemies. This basically sums up a good deal of this game. Sure there is a demon lord and classes, but it is very simplistic in nature. My old gripe with the game is that you basically start off from scratch every time you play it. To me this says that your last question meant nothing, start over. The good thing about it is that there are literally infinite possibilities as the universe randomly generates names, creatures, treasures, etc. Easy to lose yourself in it.			"

It's simple and games are short, with LOTS of replay value, as is with many modern roguelike games.Despite it's appearance, not a common JRPG, but features styles and themes from JRPG games. The gameplay is more of a traditional roguelike game.Only downside to the game is slightly suffering visuals. It's an indie game and the quality shows in terms of art sadly.			"

												This is a pretty good turn-based RPG for $3. It's short (less than an hour to reach the end) but the replay value is mostly what keeps the game interesting.You start out with 2 classes and unlock several more as you play through the game's randomly-generated worlds. You can also carry items from game to game, and they'll be available from the start. As you're forced to keep moving to the right, you have to plan your actions more than you would in something like early Final Fantasy games. You can take things at your own pace for the most part and One Way Heroics isn't too difficult. If you mess up, the game will give you hints, and you have a couple of abilities to make things go easier. If you want a more difficult game you don't have to use them, and there are multiple difficulty settings. Save points can be easy or hard to find, depending on your luck and where you go.I don't like that weapons and armor have a limited number of uses, but since you can upgrade stuff it would probably be game-breaking to have unlimited uses on things. A couple of playthroughs would give you way-too-powerful weapons.Overall this is a decent game to get, and the price is adequately low. If you see it on sale for less than $1 you can't go wrong buying One Way Heroics.			"

												One Way Heroics is not your typical rpg game. You are constantly pursued with darkness making you go only one way, east. There is lots of customization for your character, such as class, perks, stats, and looks. Although this game is perma death, you will acquire hero points based on how well you did your previous run, these points can be used for customizations for your character. I highly recommend this game. Also has a online feature where you can see what others players are doing in the same dimension as you. Has good humor and comedy in it to ^^.			"

With each playthrough the game becomes more and more interesting with several classes and perks to unlock. Also the ability to save with multiple save files for different characters is nice. The dimensional vault feature of this game allows you to put in items after you are killed or are victorious and use them on a new character to make your adventure a bit easier. For the negligible price that you could probably find in your couch you can acquire a game that will you keep you occupied for at least a couple of hours. If you are looking for some good ol' rogue-like rpg style gaming then this might be right up your alley.			"

												""One Way Heroics"" is a great roguelike where you play as a hero who tries to stop the darkness from swallowing the world - literally. You are forced to travel to the right in your quest as the darkness destroys everything from the left. Each world you save unlocks more classes, perks and other bonuses that bring you closer to solving the mystery behind the threat that engulfs endless worlds.The gameplay is quite well balanced, allowing for different playstyles. The variety of difficulties, campaign types and options encourage players of all skill levels to continue moving forward. While the art could use some improvement, the music is decent and the story is quite interesting and well-written.""One Way Heroics"" brings the excitement of permanent death while giving players many reasons to keep trying again. I highly recommend the game to both roguelike veterans and those new to the genre. Do consider buying the DLC - ""One Way Heroic Plus"", as it adds even more content, features and replay value			"

												Saw a friend of mine got this game, and I noticed it was on sale for $1...  So, I thought I'd grab myself a copy; I was very much satisfied. :owforce:One Way Heroics, being a rogue-like on the run, is quite a fun experience.  I was afraid it would be extremely time limit based, which I despise, but I was thankfully proven wrong.  While you do always have to be on the run from the shadowy darkness from the left, you can play a pretty much infinite game...  Just, be aware things will get stronger, and that the Demon Lord will continuously hunt your butt down.While I extremely enjoy this game, the friend I saw buy this, did not.  This game is not for everyone, but to give you an idea of the games I like, you could say this game is similar, but on a certain degree, to...  FTL: Faster Than Light and Dungeons of Dredmor.If you're still not quite sure, and if $3.49 is still a bit much for you, I highly suggest picking up a copy when it goes on sale, even one as low as 25% off. :3			"

Being in that cross-categorical genre does require a certain amount of luck with each playthrough, but with this title a level of strategic thinking is also necessary. The ever present ""Darkness"" coming at your character from the lefthand side of the screen forces you to make difficult decisions - should I visit that town in the North or the dungeon in the South? There isn't time to do both.With a multitude of unlockables (character classes, starting perks, slots in the ""shared stash""), there is a tremendous amount of replayability here.I highly recommend this title.

												Despite its ridiculously tiny native resolution (which you can scale up) and its random crashes, OWH is a fantastic take on the roguelike, boiled down to its most simplest form - keep moving, and hack at everything.  Well, that's kind of trivializing it a bit as there are a bunch of abilities, weapons, and generally oodles of lootles to find and methods of keeping them from game to game.  There's also a save system, so it's not entirely roguelike at all, but close to a J-ARPG from the dayes of Yore.Ahem... the main mechanic of the game is that the world is constantly scrolling into oblivion (the game is turn-based so as long as you stand still, nothing happens) and you need to keep moving right until you meet the boss.  If you make it that far.  If you can survive.  If you brought/found the right gear.Regardless, success or fail, once you've concluded a run, you earn Hero Points in order to unlock character classes, abilities, perks, and most importantly, slots for your DImensional Vault.  Whazzat?  Easy - it's a safe to store items you've found so you can give it to the next hero you roll.  Pretty simple stuff.Presentation is great, sounds are perfectly retrofit, and the only hit against it (considering this thing is priced less than a hamburger) is that it's a bit unstable.  Good thing there's a save system.Anyways, if you have money in your pocket, you could spend it on stupider things than One Way Heroics; don't.  This game will satisfy you more than glitter putty ever could.			"

												One Way Heroics is a fine example of a miniature Roguelike done right. Character building isn't tremendously deep, and the randomly-generated environments are never fiercely different from one another, but the constant pressure from its unique side-scrolling progression affords precious little time to test the boundaries as you press on, resulting in an experience that always feels satisfyingly complex despite its lighthearted presentation.The premise and gameplay are dually summed up with this statement: The world is being swallowed up by a deadly shadow ever creeping from the west, and your only means of surviving long enough to undo this cataclysm is to travel east with the shadow ever at your heels. You pick your character's name, class, gender, a handful of flavorful perk, and prepare to go right a whole lot.One Way Heroics likes to keep things light. Classes are differentiated by variations in starting stats, plus one or two spells to break out when the going gets rough. Maps are relatively linear, with occasional obstacle mazes to keep players light on their feet and miniature dungeons and towns to venture into when there are a few extra turns to burn. Not that there often are, of course, as every turn scrolls the screen a bit more to the left, and getting swallowed up by the left side of the screen is fatal. The decision to enter a stone dungeon isn't one to be taken lightly, though neither is anything else. Using an item, equipping a weapon, or speaking to an NPC is just as dangerous as any other action that isn't stepping to the right, but as the monsters grow fiercer the further east you go, deviating from the main path to grab extra equipment or visit a merchant is often prudent.One would think laying this mechanic on top of an otherwise traditional roguelike would make the experience drastically more difficult, yet surprisingly, One Way Heroics is not that bloodthirsty a game. Actual victory is a completely attainable goal, and not neccesarily all that challenging a task (unless you want it to be). Your character will only last the length of one run, but ""horrible, horrible death"" isn't necessarily going to be the reason for their retirement. It's a nice feeling.With comparatively few options for character development, streamlined combat, and limited variety to be found even in the mix-and-match biomes of the extremely linear maps, One Way Heroics doesn't run quite as deep as the games it seeks to emulate, yet unlike many mass-production Roguelikes it still manages to capture pretty much all of the fundamental qualities that make the genre great, all while introducing unique and memorable mechanics to set itself apart from the crowd.Whether you're a newcomer to the genre seeking something unintimidating but satisfying or a long-time Roguelike fan looking for something simple and unique, One Way Heroics is worth a fortune more than its humble price tag, and should be investigated as soon as possible.

												Warning: Not to be underestimated.One-Way Heroics combines turn-based combat, side scrolling arcade style gameplay, limited saves, and a hearty dose of classic RPG nostalgia. It also ranks in difficulty with the likes of Mega-Man, Ninja Gaiden, and Castlevania. The foundation of Heroics would make it seem like two things that should never go together. On the left side of the screen, the world fades into a Darkness that consumes men, women,  children, small animals, dungeon bosses, buildings, eveything. It is your job to find out what is causing the darkness by travelling to the ends of the earth and defeating the source (oh, and the final boss has finally attained some common sense, and will randomly spawn in an effort to kill you before you get enough power and equipment to wreck his world.)  It would start to sound as if it's an infinite runner (akin to Temple Run and Flappy Bird).And then there are the RPG elements.Randomly generated worlds, item upgrades, exploration, looting, unlockable perks and classes, the element of permadeath between save points (random enemy drops and treasures will not be the same after continuing from a save file), and the random enemy attributes lead one to question their sanity. Each playthrough is different. You have the option to create a new random world every time that you start a new game, but you can also play through the same world as different classes.There are 8 different classes in total, (Only the Knight and Swordmaster are available at the start, but with additional playthroughs, the roster expands with Hunter, Pirate, Bard, Adventurer, Force User, and Hero) with very different play styles. Swordmasters are tough, but it comes at a cost to stamina and carrying capacity. Hunters, however, are better suited to stealth, ranged weapons, and have a special ability that allows them to see off-screen enemies before they encounter them.All in all, it's got great addictive gameplay, the sprite animations are charming, the music is fantastic , and I would give this an 8-8.5			"

												Lots of value here for the price. Great way to waste a weekend, and it has a wide variety of good music reminescent of the 16-bit era. (it's not often that I'm reminded of Lagoon)The game presents itself as simple, but conceals a great deal of depth. There are two ways to beat the game other than the one you're presented with, and there are some sharp story twists if you're willing to dig for them.			"

												A fun game that is definitely worth it's price tag. (Currently £2.29) I picked this up on sale for less than a pound and have since put just shy of 30 hours into it, completing all of the achievements in the process.It manages to be different to more traditional rogue-likes and has a real quaint feel to both the art and music. The gameplay is rather simplistic but it manages to be enjoyable. I'd say towards the end of my play-time as i aimed to finish the last of the achievements things began to get a little repetitive, as you'll be encountering the same layouts and enemies routinely, but for the first handful of playthroughs i definitely discovered something completely new each time.If you enjoy rogue-likes or story-light RPGs, pick this one up. It's definitely worth it.			"

												Saw a friend of mine got this game, and I noticed it was on sale for $1...  So, I thought I'd grab myself a copy; I was very much satisfied. :owforce:One Way Heroics, being a rogue-like on the run, is quite a fun experience.  I was afraid it would be extremely time limit based, which I despise, but I was thankfully proven wrong.  While you do always have to be on the run from the shadowy darkness from the left, you can play a pretty much infinite game...  Just, be aware things will get stronger, and that the Demon Lord will continuously hunt your butt down.While I extremely enjoy this game, the friend I saw buy this, did not.  This game is not for everyone, but to give you an idea of the games I like, you could say this game is similar, but on a certain degree, to...  FTL: Faster Than Light and Dungeons of Dredmor.If you're still not quite sure, and if $3.49 is still a bit much for you, I highly suggest picking up a copy when it goes on sale, even one as low as 25% off. :3			"

												So no bulls-hit, One Way Heroics is possibly my favorite game of the year so far. It's neck and neck with Banner Saga, and though Banner Saga definitely has a greater immersion factor, the pick-up-and-play roguelike aspects and the replayability of OWH put it over the top.What you have here is a game with the energy and fun of a classic Japanese RPG on the Super Nintendo, but with the ruthless difficulty and randomness of a roguelike. However, the developer very wisely simplifies the roguelike formula, so that you are not playing an overly complicated survival simulation; you are playing a game that feels both fun and intense; it is demanding of your judgment without being a drain on the limits of your attention span.It's not perfect; once you've seen the 3 or 4 variations of ""towns"" and ""dungeons"" in the game they'll get stale quick. Enemy and landscape variety becomes a little threadbare after a few (successful) playthroughs as well. Also, even in full screen mode, the characters are ridiculously small. Don't even bother trying to play in windowed mode. You might as well go outside and stare at ants.The achievements are very good as well; they're almost all challenge-oriented, encouraging you to push your skills to their limit, rather than go out of your way to fulfill random garbage achievements (I'm looking at you, Rogue's Tale).One Way Heroics is a badass game, especially for the price.

												""One Way Heroics"" is a great roguelike where you play as a hero who tries to stop the darkness from swallowing the world - literally. You are forced to travel to the right in your quest as the darkness destroys everything from the left. Each world you save unlocks more classes, perks and other bonuses that bring you closer to solving the mystery behind the threat that engulfs endless worlds.The gameplay is quite well balanced, allowing for different playstyles. The variety of difficulties, campaign types and options encourage players of all skill levels to continue moving forward. While the art could use some improvement, the music is decent and the story is quite interesting and well-written.""One Way Heroics"" brings the excitement of permanent death while giving players many reasons to keep trying again. I highly recommend the game to both roguelike veterans and those new to the genre. Do consider buying the DLC - ""One Way Heroic Plus"", as it adds even more content, features and replay value			"

 A Great Little Game The game is short so I will keep the review equally so. Putting long windedness aside, this game is just simple fun to give you a fix for a while, nothing hardcore or intense. Just a fun little game, I picked it up for less than a buck, you could probably pick it up for the same price if you wait. On a sale this game is a steal, but I would only really recommend it on a sale because of a distinct lack of content and playtime. Still was enjoyable for how long it lasted. I would say it's worth a low sale price.			"

												*tl;dr:This game is basically walking to the right side, while avoiding the darkness that keeps eating everything from the left side, with RPG elements and randomized world.*-The game has different classes.-Each world is different (randomized).-The game has good difficulty modes (They are not too easy and not inhumanly hard)-You level up your character, by gaining exp from creatures that spawn around the world or in dungeons.-The game has multiple classes that you need to unlock. Each class has different strenghts and weaknesses.-Each class levels different stats up faster. For example the sorcerer levels inteligents faster than the knight class.-Story is scattered. You need to beat the game multiple times on different difficulties and with different characters, to find out more about the story.-Great replay value if you like walking east every time.Overall I'd say this is a good game for the completionists, who dont mind doing the same thing in a randomized world over and over again.I wouldn't recommend buying this if you're not planning on spending hours unlocking the characters and the different endings or difficulties.DLC EDIT:-Monster spawn more and items spawn randomly, so no more waiting or sitting around-More items have been added and the spawn rate has been reworked so powerfull items are more rare-More story has been added and the main story has been completed.-Mini bosses have been added-Random events have been added-More terrain has been added-More NPC's and shops/dungeons have been addedThe DLC is a great addition to the game, the events, mini bosses and random loot will keep you busy during your runs, while the extra quests and companions will keep you coming back for more.(I apologise for my bad english)			"

												TLDR:  Only buy this game if you get it WITH the expansion, and preferably on sale.  The reason I don't recommend it is because One Way Heroics is still an incomplete game, with the expansion and all.The review:After 70 hours playtime, I can't recommend One Way Heroics.  Without the expansion (One Way Heroics Plus, $6.49), this game is borderline unplayable.  The expansion brings in much needed UI updates, gameplay tweaks, more items and more characters.  And a ton of bug fixes.Problem is, most of that stuff should have been patched in to the base game.  Or, more realistically, put in to the game before it ever released.  Especially since, even with all that, it still feels like a beta version.  Very late in the beta process, but still not quite ready for release.  Somewhere in the polishing phase.  Bugs are still being squashed to this day, and I experienced plenty in my time with the game. Once you take all the things from OWH+, and subtract them out since they should have been included in the main game prior to release, you're left with just the new classes and the castle expansions.  And they aren't worth $6.49 by themselves.  The classes are easy to gloss over, and none of the castle expansions have a huge impact on your game.  You can easily do without both.With a bit of a shallow story, one that was also poorly translated, the gameplay is what keeps you coming back.  And it's (almost) all there... so long as you make sure to pick up OWH+ as well.			"

I've thoroughly enjoyed my introduction to this game - took me a bit to get a feel for what was happening, and dealing with being keyboard heavy, but I've loved the challenge of the game. Very good premise, done very well, and has me tense with making decisions. I fully plan on putting a lot more time into it over the next couple weeks when I have time free. I've also do a ""Let's Blindly Try"" video showing my initial pay of this, which  was quite fun. Link below:

												Fun game. It's like a RPG combined with a roguelike. It made me think of a mystery dungeon game I used to love called Shiren The Wanderer.The music is great. The online component is pretty interesting aswell. It reminds me a bit of Dark Souls. There is no direct multiplayer component but there are ghosts and you can leave messages and such.The thing I like less, is not being able to save when you want to. You need to find a certain NPC or have a certain event occur to be able to. It's a gameplay mechanic and games probably don't take super long so I can understand it but eh, I'd like to turn off the game and return from where I left off. EDIT: After playing some more, you're also able to buy consumable items that allow you to save at any point. Good enough for me.			"

												A+ game, well worth the small price. It's got endless replay value thanks to the randomly-generated terrain, and it can be extremely challenging, especially on Afternoon Stroll and higher. There's also an enormous amount of lore contained within the game if you play enough (surprising, considering it's a new game every time you start). All the various classes have different ways to play, and both the skills you learn and the items you find can make or break your playthrough (especially against the Demon Lord; many times have I gone up against him and lost because my weapons were crap).

												It's a Rogue-Like JRPG with a Retro art style.You unlock new classes by either acomplishing certain goals, or by spending points you earn by playing. You can also use these points to unlock new perks for your character, or to upgrade your storage. This storage can be used to save items from previous adventures, and use them in new adventures.It's a great game which I hapily recommend to others who like any of these genres :D			"

												Retro gaming at its finest, screw the classical plot of a hero trying to save the world (with a minor twist if you do something on your run), the gameplay is a blast! you can play a lot in the easiest difficulty, but in harder difficulty EVERY step mattersits like i'm playing a lv 130 Bard with +9 Plate Mail full of legendary suffixes to it (+10eva +5armor) and  I was walking at night suddenly an Ultimate (highest class monster) Dragon came and burn my♥♥♥♥♥to crisp in 1 blow, the catch if i walk more carefully i can see the dragon and use any strategy in the book to 1 hit it rather get my♥♥♥♥♥handed down10/10 must have for retro gaming lovers with a dungeon crawler in field genre!

												This game is amazing. It has a combat system similar to what you would find on one of the Pokemon Dungeon games, which is one of my favorites.You don't have a whole lot of classes to choose from, but you wouldn't expect to at the price. You still have enough to keep you busy for hours on end.Each run scores you based off your treasure looted compared to treasure possible to loot, monsters killed without being hit, distance traveled, and your overall level. There are some other minor point contributors, but with those four main ones, it means getting to a high score means you have to be focused and make good use of everything you see.I would recomend this game to anyone who has free time, because it will eat up a whole lot of yours.

												It's really fun. You'll stumble around for hours until you start to figure out the little secrets to winning. By no means easy, but despite the simple nature of the game it completely hooks you and you lose about 20 hours in a week to it.If you want to know what it plays like, imagine how Binding of Issac uses seeds to determine items and layout (only you're not punished for using them), then imagine you play bumper cars (ie ram them) with enemies to damage them and finally  add some ""multiplayer"" where you can see progress of other adventures in the same seed. If they die, you can find their ghosts and get free stuff. Then imagine all this on a auto scroller.Talking about it really isn't the same as playing it. It's really robust, despite the simplicity. There's like 8 classes, and you can fully customize your starting stats and abilities, which really changes everything. Great game, and it's dirt cheap. Have about 22 hours, and I spent less than a dollar on it. Give a try, you might just love it.			"

												This is the sort of game that feels really well realized.The gimmick of One Way Heroics is the constant movement of the screen to the right. This may seem like a simple mechanic, or maybe something that would limit the fun you could have, but it's honestly what makes this game so addicting.You have to plan ahead. If you blindly rush into any dungeon you see you'll likely find yourself stuck behind a wall, frantically trying to break it down as the darkness creeps up from behind. You have to consider whether you can clear it before the darkness catches up, whether you have the HP and gear required to take on the monsters inside, and whether to advance into a room or wait and let the mobs come at you one by one.It encourages you to pack all those items that you'd discard without a second thought in other games. Scroll of Confusion? Use it on the Demon Lord so you can run away while he flails randomly. Teleportation Pill? Use it when caught behind a mountain range and pray it drops you on the other side. (Seriously, watch the map. Mountains are just as dangerous as monsters.) Nayuta Fruit? Use it when in a snow area to replenish your energy. Big stone? . . . Leave it, this one is actually useless.The character classes are reasonably varied. Each class starts with different stats and abilities depending on what their purpose is. For instance, the Knight has the Great Wall ability, which lets him regen health every turn. While the Bard has the Song of Heroism, which increases party members damage and defence. There's also an adventurer class, with stats that make him perfect for stashing as much loot as possible.The world generation is simple, but effective. You'll be seeing the same tiles over and over again, with few real differences between the biomes. Thing is, it's the layout that matters, not the scenery. It's the generation of Alters of the Goddess, towns, Dark Brotherhood hidouts, and Golems (Be very prepared before you try to take these things on) that make each new world interesting.After each run you'll be awarded Hero Points which you can spend to unlock new perks, classes, and expand your Vault. (In which you can store items from your previous run, in order to use them in the next.)The last feature, and judging from the other reviews here also the most unappreciated, are the story missions. These change every day, one day you'll be accompanied by the healer Dosey, the next you'll be tasked with rescuing the Queen. Each of these NPCs have different stories which you'll learn more about as you fight with them. These really make adventuring more interesting, and are a nice addition to the game. They didn't have to be there, but it's nice that they are.One Way Heroics is, in my opinion, criminally underpriced. I fully recommend picking this up.			"

												I've never posted a review of this game until now only because it's hard to find words to sum up how great it is without dragging the review on and on.Here's what you need to know.One Way Heroics is a relatively simple take on a lot of RPG elements woven into a roguelike fantasy. The system for gear statistics is pretty straightforward, as is the story-telling, as is leveling up. There are no skill trees or any choice of what stat you level up, but I promise you it won't matter.That being said, the simplicity is nice. It allows you to play the game casually without taking away that constant strive some players have for better gear or ""the perfect run"".The combat is also quite simple. You have a basic attack you will use most of the time, as well as a few abilities learned from leveling or NPC's. It's quick, with you likely not spending more than 5 seconds on most enemies besides bosses. It keeps the game moving, which is nice because in a roguelike its important not to drag things out. This also allows you to keep the game short if that's what you want. Personally my average session is maybe 2 hours long, but if you insist on going as far as 2000km (which isn't neccessary to win), it's a bit closer to 4 or 5 hours. Optional saves make those long games far less daunting.As I said, this game can work for casual players, but it does not leave the more dedicated players with nothing to do. 170 hours as I'm writing this review and there is still more to do. The game has a few interesting objectives woven into it to DRASTICALLY increase replay value, such as daily campaigns that change up the rules of the procedurally generated worlds you play in, multiple bosses to defeat, 4-5 different difficulties and 4 different ways to ""win"" a playthrough. Also it has one particular aspect I love to see in roguelikes; you can transfer a limited amount of gear from one playthrough to another. This helps you to continue your quest for the absolute best gear by allowing you to keep enchanting gear instead of losing everything at the end of a playthrough. But it's not at all essential for beating the game if that's too easy for you ;)As for the ""One Way Heroics Plus"" expansion (without going into detail), it's not neccessary for enjoying the game. It's the icing on top of the cake, and the odds are you will want it at some point or another, so I suggest buying it right off the bat to really enhance the game.Whether you are looking for a game to waste a few hours on, or one to get really sucked into, you just can't go wrong with One Way Heroics.

												Quite honestly one of the best roguelike RPG's i've played.There's a character creation system with a variety of classes, perks and appearances. Most need to be unlocked but there's quite a lot to get.The movement and battles are turn-based and the unique flavor to this particular game is a encroaching wall of darkness from the left that closes in each time you do something.(Move, attack, etc) This means you have to keep a eye on the darkness and consider wether to go on or maybe try to clear that one dungeon or pick up that one item in time.This creates a sense of pressure that makes for a fun atmosphere.There is a online aspect to the game in the form of death/milestone messages from other players in the same world that show up in the upper left of the screen.The worlds are randomly generated but there are specific types that have special quests or certain restrictions. There is also the ability to share world ID's with others so they can play the same world.For a fairly cheap price this is a great game to pick up.			"

												I had about a dollar and fifteen cents on my steam wallet and thought that I was only going to be able to get a garbage game when the steam sale came. I was so wrong this game is rather confusing at first, but once you get the hang of it, it's rather interesting. I have almost unlocked all the classes except for the hero class and have barely touched the perks. I know there are people you can get to follow you which I haven't encountered yet not for lack of looking that is. It is a great game and I would say it's worth the price.			"

												I bought this on a whim due to the low price. Have to say it's worth far more. I've already spent more time on this game then Dungeons of Dredmor, and can imagine playing it even more. Unlike most roguelikes, it's fast paced and easy to get into, but becomes complex once you know the basics. I beat easy difficulty on only my second playthrough, which took around 30 minutes. Normal difficulty adds recruitable party members, new items, and removes the fixed end point in easy mode. My longest run lasted 3 hours. I have yet to beat hardThere are very un-roguelike save points and 'Dimensional Vault' to carry over items from old characters. Your end game rewards are reduced for using them though. If you are good enough at roguelikes to do without them, it's worth trying as there is a lot of stuff to unlock.			"

												From the looks of the old style 16 bit graphcs, many might be suprised that this one eaisly becomes engaging and addicting.  The stroy line and game mechanics is what seems to draw one in.  The Music also adds to the quality of game play.I have yet to finish with the Knight class, which is a good first choice, and I can already see myself replaying the game to experience each additional class choice.  It does bring back memories of playing some of the classic rpg's on the old C64 back in the 80's, such as Ultima, Questron, Demon's Winter, Shard of Spring, Pool of Radiance and of course the classic, Hack/NetHackA great choice for the price.

												So for those who don't know what this game is, let me first explain what my impression (and the tldr) of the game is:One Way Heroics is a new twist on (somewhat) rogue-like RPG's, bearing similarities to Shiren the Wanderer (the non-Atlus-screwed-up one) but with an urgency placed on time and what you do with it.Understandably, some people wouldn't call it a roguelike because of the save/load feature or the dimensional vault, but since you do not accumulate hero points after resuming a loaded game (after death), my interpretation has been that saving/loading is only a feature for those who are in it for the story content.  A good compromise imo.What I likedA creative take on this style of game.  I haven't seen anything like it -- the closest comparison would be Shiren the Wanderer.An objective (the demon lord) that plagues you from the start, but not impossible to vanquish once you have progressed enough.Party members that serve a purpose, but also have depth.  Like everything else in the game, they are not permanent.The music is fantastic.What I didn't like that others might likeI'm not a fan of visual novels (?), so the abundance of text serving as the beginning and end of your adventure is not something that is fulfilling for me.  It's very well written, imo, so I imagine JRPG / Story-reading fans will like this.No cursed items.  Unidentified items you can wear, but none of them cursed. :\  The only undiscovered attribute on an item that poses any uncertainty is the durability.The price is so low, it feels like I robbed some poor hard-working developer that just loves making games like this.  Playism's site says something about letting you pay what you want (donation-based I guess?), so hopefully some people have been more charitable towards this game.What I don't likeThere is no way to isolate the leaderboards to personal social groups - as a result, it's all meaningless information, sadly. :\  It would be great if I could see where I rate among my friends list.There's no underground -- Yah, it's a pretty big game already, sure.  But fantasy games need dungeons.  An intricate right-way-progressing dungeon would've made the screen edge much more intimidating.Those are my impressions of this game. :)			"

												Absolutely great game with great replayabilitya) do quick runs when you don't have enought timeb) use your ""dimensional vault"" to carry over your favorite itemsc) gain points to get new perks and classes which you can use in future runsI have so far passed the 400km runs with Swordsman, Knight, Hunter and Adventurer. I have started to search for some info on the net and it looks like you can go up to 2000km with some skill and good gear. I need to test that.Also competing on the same maps against other players to see who can get the most out of it and regular ""quest"" runs make this game even more awesome. I still have a lot to learn about this game, but I already like it a lot.The only thing I don't like so far is the fact your gear depreciates and breaks and it is not so easy to repair it. I bond with my gear emotionally :-) and it hurts when I loose it :-)			"

												Very interesting little roguelike with some very interesting mechanics, you're forced to constantly be on the move because you are chased by creeping darkness, keeping you on your toes at all times and making you think about where you move to in some situations. The difficulty can be quite unforgiving at times but it gets easier as you get more powerful.The online features work a little like dark souls, you can see the ghosts of other players and get items from them, you can see where other players have got to in the world (if you are playing the online world) or you can generate a completely random world from scratch!

												Very fun twist on roguelikes, with streamlined and fast-paced gameplay, pleasant music and a highly addictive concept and progression format.Basically, this is like a roguelike game (such as Nethack or TOME4: Tales of Maj-Eyal), mixed with one of those old school platformer ""scroller"" stages where a wall of death is coming towards you. The combination and design makes progression interesting, as gameplay never really stagnates because of the wall keeping you moving forward and requiring you to make decisions. ""Is it worth it to enter this dungeon? Will I have a way to get out in time? Can I reach the shopkeeper before the appraiser gets eaten by the darkness?"". At the end, you have to battle the boss, the Demon Lord who summoned the wall of death, which packs quite a punch compared to everything else you fight. To aid you, you can find loot, money...all your traditional JRPG elements, but streamlined to be as fast-paced as possible.The presentation is a mixed bag. Sprites are tiny but appropriate, and look very much like what you'd expect in a Super NES RPG. Music is not the best ever, but makes itself noticeable when needed, and stays out of the way during the less exciting parts. Controls are very simple and consoley, but doesn't really need a pad to be enjoyed, as it controls with mostly 3 keys and directions. The interface is however quite confusing, with vital stats near the middle of the screen, with other stats at the bottom, buffs at the right...it's a bit all over the place and takes a bit to get used to, but at least you can get used to it after a couple rounds.Larger character artwork is also a mixed bag, with some portraits looking good, others looking kinda bland. Character design is very old-school JRPG medieval fantasy, a bit retro while at it, looks more 90s than 2010s if you get what I mean. I guess it is a good effort at looking old-school.As for gameplay decisions, it's all quite slick. Weapons have durability, but are usually easy enough to replace, and repairing is possible, while not straightforward. To compensate, the limit on enchantments, buffs and powerups for each individual weapon or armor is quite big, allowing to kind of craft superweapons with a bit of luck or planning, not too much. Dungeons, terrain and towns are terribly simplistic, but then again, you can't really stay more than a dozen turns in most places, so it works out for the best. There's plenty of decent loot lying around as well, although deciding what stuff to keep and what to drop to satisfy your weight limits can bring the action to a temporary halt as you ponder advantages and disadvantages, or wondering if that unidentified item is crap or highly enchanted.An average game from start to finish can take like 40 minutes. Since it's designed to be played over and over, difficulty is high, and you can store lucky drops for your characters, replay value is pretty good. Specially if you are into beating high scores, a bit of an outdated concept in general, but works pretty well here. Different classes, builds and worlds play quite differently, so there's noticeable variety. Special and shared worlds also have leaderboards, for a slight competitive vibe if you are into it. Could be a good choice for a let's play or speedrunning.Extra features are quite convenient and welcomed. You don't get a tutorial, but ""advice"" based on your actions, reminding you of basic tactics and features if you don't use them. Likewise, you have Iris, a little fairy companion, that will give you general advice and specific details of some aspects of the game (such as terrain penalties) on request. At the end of your quest you get rated on a number of aspects, such as looting and combat, and gives you extra advice or praise if it's bad or good. Your general score awards you ""hero points"", which you can use to make any new playthrough stronger by unlocking perks, player classes or item storages.This game features a peculiar version of ""permadeath"", a common roguelike trope, where your character is completely gone after death. You can save your game, but the default would be to start over once you die. However, you can continue a saved game after death, but you aren't awarded hero points if you continue after dying. The game encourages permadeath but doesn't mind very much if you go for the opposite, basically.You can't play together with other players, however, it has a fairly interesting approach similar to shared Nethack servers of old, where a single-player game gets peppered with messages and other bonuses caused by other players being in the same ""Dimension"" (a fancy name for random seeds). As well, special events updated daily give special challenges, such as more experience gain in a harder setting; replacing all item drops for money and so on. Or quests with special NPCs, some fairly funny or endearing. 6 months after the latest update, special events are still getting rotated daily, which is a good sign.A great plus is that, while the game isn't available for Linux, it runs flawlessly on WINE, only having a minimal sound glitch with the conversation sound effect (which echoes a tiny bit), but all online features, replays, input, video, music, all other sound effects and such, works perfectly.

												This game made me cry myself to sleep. Duke Galtz is a true man. Except when he blushes at your SSS ratings. Then he's the strongest fangirl there is. Also I got this for $0.87. My only complaint is that my vision is currently blurred from the INTENSE EMOTIONS exploding from my heart. This game make you cry not because of its difficulty, but because of your quest against an inevitable wall of darkness devouring your home, a futile quest against fate itself where your closest friends could turn on you and even your most despised enemies, in a time of need, can turn to fight against the chains of destiny one last time alongside you.This game teaches you to be a hero. Never show them your back.+INFINITY out of 10			"

												It's not often I find myself looking at a movie just beginning on Netflix(Get Shorty) in one minute and then before I can even say ""Look at me"" the film's done and I'm still being chased by that pompous♥♥♥♥♥flying Demon Lord. He shall be mine, he doesn't know it yet because he's killed me too many times but I will climb that pile of corpses of my past failures and claim his life! Really though, this game is quite a bit of fun for the light gamer and just as easily a time-consumer for the numbers obsessed(which most of us RPG fans really are deep at heart, and we have the achievements to prove it). Great price for an amazing game and you'd be foolish not to get it.			"

												This game has brought me back to a genre of cutthroat, 'save/load', challenges that I truly miss in most of my modern day RPG's. Difficulty has become such a turn-style feature that when you choose to baby yourself, you limit your enjoyment and the unique experience each games environment can provide. This game provides one of the best examples of 'bang-for-your-buck' by all the challenges you can face and all of the strategies you can employ through a side-scrolling adventure/RPG.Be prepared to die, sometimes ridiculously.Be creative with exploration, the game rewards you by traversing the generated world; but with that said the more curious you become, the more difficult the challenges you may face.Enjoy!

												Interesting? Yes. Entertaining? Yes. Cutesy? Yes. Frustrating? Perhaps. Addictive? Most definitely.One Way Heroics is a nice little game created in Wolf RPG Editor. When I first played it, I was excited. Games like this always caught my eye and the dialogue the characters/NPC's have only made it more fun. A tad bit silly, but nonetheless still great. So, I started it up and was ready to play. I thought it would be rather simple. It looked easy enough to do; Avoid the darkness consuming the world. In other words, avoid getting scrolled off the screen. I fought monsters along the way. It was very tedious, sure, but entertaining. Then, finally, I encountered the boss, the Demon Lord. I swear, I have never been defeated so quickly by a boss in my entire lifetime. Eager to defeat him, I retried. And thus started the endless cycle of trying to successfully defeat the Demon Lord.This game is a bundle of joy, frustration, and addiction. You are provided with numerous classes to choose from and to defeat the Demon Lord with. Each world is randomly generated so there are always new surprises to look forward to. You are also given opportunities to save here and there, so if you are absolutely certain this particular world is suitable for you to achieve your goals, then save at a save point and viola! No need to worry about losing your progress. There are also a number of skills you can obtain, as well as weapons, armor, items, partners - you name it. In addition to the gameplay, the soundtrack is beautiful, enjoyable, and is certainly enough to keep you motivated. Obviously, the graphics are pixelated (with the exception of when character dialogue pops up), but the art is nice and I will admit that I find some of the monsters rather cutesy.I somehow managed to hop off this game for a while (which was good because if I hadn't, it would've been an unhealthy addiction for me), but I have taken note that the One Way Heroics Plus DLC is coming around Steam sometime soon, so I'll definitely be playing soon again. Do I recommend this game? Of course I do! If you choose to purchase this game, I now wish you all the good luck on your journey to defeat the Demon Lord!			"

												I'm having a surprising amount of fun in One Way Heroics. It's a rogue-like, think Net-Hack with Nintendo style graphics. Start with 3 classes and a few perks and unlock more as you do certain things in the game. Every world is randomly generated so different adventures happen each. Yes, you die... a lot! But it's all part of the game and you earn hero points to buy things to assist you in your next play through each time. Get it if you like turn-based role-playing games and are up for a challenge. You won't be disappointed.			"

The options are limited at first, but as you progress further into the land (and die) and kill enemies (and die) you will earn points that allow you to save weapons and armor for your new characters (from the old, dead ones) Try it now it's like Less than a dollar and you'll play at least an hour, easy.

												Being my entry into the Rogue-like genre, I've fallen in love! 8-bit graphics, procedurally generated world, greatly addictive! While combat being rather simplistic, it all works well. The soundtrack has by far become one of my favourites in any game I've played thus far. Forget ya Skyrim, play something with a real challenge and rewarding for your efforts.

												If you are looking for a game that'll test your limits the way old rogue likes work, similar to the games Splunky, or Azure Dreams. This one will be a nice throw back with what it has to offer. Don't let the seemingly simple and small looking content fool you, more often then not, you'll find yourself in a refreshingly new problem with each playthrough, and the game supports a special system that gives special events to occur within each of the worlds should you choose them.

												It's basically a JRPG combined with a roguelike. There's a big amount of content for the price (which is even cheaper if you buy it off of Playism), including varied classes, daily challenges/runs, hidden endings, and more. It's not too difficult for beginners to get into, but hardcore roguelike fans will still find challenge in the harder difficulty modes. It's really addicting to see how far you can get in a few hours, and you can compare how well you're doing against other players on the same seed in real-time (you can even post your wins/losses on Twitter #OneWayHeroics). Some people might complain about its lack of depth; don't expect a complex turn-based combat system like in Final Fantasy or a deeply complicated and engaging story. The real fun in this game is in how easy it is to pick up and play. It's definitely worth the price, and it has way more replay value than most of the games priced at $5 - $10 here.TL;DR - Probably the most fun, easily accessible Roguelike you'll find on Steam that's under $5. :)			"

												You see, this game is like this...You're an adventurer who managed to get past all of the horrible monsters in the beginning, and now you've gotten pretty strong and used to travelling.  Most monsters are a breeze and nothing seems challenging at all.One day, you casually walk up to a dragon... just another day... and you notice too late that it's actually a red star boss dragon.  After one or two casual swings, you realized you carelessly placed yourself in a situation that you cannot escape.  Death is inevitable... All of those hours you spent arduously preparing materials, training your blade, and gathering new OP weapons along the way... all gone... in all but a blink of an eye.That's this game.			"

												This game, despite being a little difficult to get the hang of, is good fun. I is a combination between Rouge Legacy, Finaly Fantasy, and Mario (the fact being you can only go forward, never back). The procedurally generated worlds adds to the complexity of the game. If found myself making character sheets of past characters so should i find a weapon that suits them in a run through in which the weapon is useless, i can stick it in the storage and make them the header for the next run. I've also found myself becoming addicted to the worlds i create, wanting to defeat them before I create a new one. To paraphrase, this game is a refreshing bundle of originality, ingenuity, whilst also winking at the games from the Ninetys. In a way, this is a less masochistic 16-bit version of Dark Souls.			"

												Don't listen to any of the negative reviews. They're all either people complaining about it being ""too hard and frustrating"" or complaining that it crashes and is buggy. I haven't had this game crash on me once, and it's not frustrating. This is one of the funnest games I've played.Like most rouge-likes, once your character dies he/she stays dead. Depending on how good your run is, you can use points to unlock more classes, perks, and slots in your Dimensional Vault, which is where you can store items from your previous run to use in your next run.But of course, the games main attraction is the darkness that is constantly following you. Every action you do such as move, attack and use an item inches the darkness closer to you. If it engulfs you, you die. This makes going into dungeons tricky. You need to stop and think ""Will I be able to kill all the monsters in there, loot the chests, and get out?""Amazing game. Great soundtrack. Overall fun as hell. For $3.49 you can't go wrong, buy it.			"

												Wanted to post a quick review with my (Very) initial impressions. I've thoroughly enjoyed my introduction to this game - took me a bit to get a feel for what was happening, and dealing with being keyboard heavy, but I've loved the challenge of the game. Very good premise, done very well, and has me tense with making decisions. I fully plan on putting a lot more time into it over the next couple weeks when I have time free. I've also do a ""Let's Blindly Try"" video showing my initial pay of this, which  was quite fun. Link below:

												Holy CRAP! well well I bought this game based only on a whim, and Man! you pay pennies for a great game here. Am no reviewer Heaven Forbid, but when i see something great I must do somethin to show how good this thing really IS. Well first of all its not a great Graphical looking game it looks like one of those Early SNES kind of game like Mystic Quest but don't let the graphics fool you or some other guys who have given this game bad reviews with no reason whatsoever. The claim the game is tough I finish it on my 6 try with the Knight class. SO its not hard really just dont start with the Swordmaster class. Well this is the thing the game is really interesting you start with only two unlocked classes the swordmaster and the Knight. The knight its worth saying its for beginners start with that ONE, and you will see the greatness of this game. Its all about gameplay in this game and a turn based game but you wont really see the turn and stuff in this game its like a really fast flow to the right all the time but even when your only moving to the right all the time (because of a dark screen corner on the left who is eating the whole world) you will still find NPCS selling you stuff and giving you advice, save shrines and rest stops. the climax of the game is this (at least on the normal difficulty) after you walk 400km or 12 days in real time about 10-20 minutes of real time gameplay you encounter this Demon Lord Guy who by then you will be lvl 17-25 and depending on your luck and starting strategy (mostly strategy) you will be able to defeat because of the items and weapons you have encountered and saved during your game. There is also alot of Replay Value on this title because there are alot of unlocked classes here to discover which will present their unique challenge to get to the Demon Lord. This Game  is for those looking for plenty of gameplay on a small price fee.			"

												Quite honestly one of the best roguelike RPG's i've played.There's a character creation system with a variety of classes, perks and appearances. Most need to be unlocked but there's quite a lot to get.The movement and battles are turn-based and the unique flavor to this particular game is a encroaching wall of darkness from the left that closes in each time you do something.(Move, attack, etc) This means you have to keep a eye on the darkness and consider wether to go on or maybe try to clear that one dungeon or pick up that one item in time.This creates a sense of pressure that makes for a fun atmosphere.There is a online aspect to the game in the form of death/milestone messages from other players in the same world that show up in the upper left of the screen.The worlds are randomly generated but there are specific types that have special quests or certain restrictions. There is also the ability to share world ID's with others so they can play the same world.For a fairly cheap price this is a great game to pick up.			"

												One Way Heroics is great. It's a randomly generated game with a ton of replay value. You choose a class, name your character and embark on an adventure to stop the Demon Lord from destroying the world.  The left side of the screen is constantly being consumed by darkness, and you must keep moving ahead to avoid succumbing to the dark death mist thing.It's really cool. There are different generated dimensions for you to explore, some will have criteria that you might find fun or challenging. Though there are some that are just ridiculously difficult. I can't recommend this game enough for fans of JRPGs or Roguelikes.			"

The imperative of moving forward constantly creates an engaging pressure and forces you to make some interesting choices.

												I've never posted a review of this game until now only because it's hard to find words to sum up how great it is without dragging the review on and on.Here's what you need to know.One Way Heroics is a relatively simple take on a lot of RPG elements woven into a roguelike fantasy. The system for gear statistics is pretty straightforward, as is the story-telling, as is leveling up. There are no skill trees or any choice of what stat you level up, but I promise you it won't matter.That being said, the simplicity is nice. It allows you to play the game casually without taking away that constant strive some players have for better gear or ""the perfect run"".The combat is also quite simple. You have a basic attack you will use most of the time, as well as a few abilities learned from leveling or NPC's. It's quick, with you likely not spending more than 5 seconds on most enemies besides bosses. It keeps the game moving, which is nice because in a roguelike its important not to drag things out. This also allows you to keep the game short if that's what you want. Personally my average session is maybe 2 hours long, but if you insist on going as far as 2000km (which isn't neccessary to win), it's a bit closer to 4 or 5 hours. Optional saves make those long games far less daunting.As I said, this game can work for casual players, but it does not leave the more dedicated players with nothing to do. 170 hours as I'm writing this review and there is still more to do. The game has a few interesting objectives woven into it to DRASTICALLY increase replay value, such as daily campaigns that change up the rules of the procedurally generated worlds you play in, multiple bosses to defeat, 4-5 different difficulties and 4 different ways to ""win"" a playthrough. Also it has one particular aspect I love to see in roguelikes; you can transfer a limited amount of gear from one playthrough to another. This helps you to continue your quest for the absolute best gear by allowing you to keep enchanting gear instead of losing everything at the end of a playthrough. But it's not at all essential for beating the game if that's too easy for you ;)As for the ""One Way Heroics Plus"" expansion (without going into detail), it's not neccessary for enjoying the game. It's the icing on top of the cake, and the odds are you will want it at some point or another, so I suggest buying it right off the bat to really enhance the game.Whether you are looking for a game to waste a few hours on, or one to get really sucked into, you just can't go wrong with One Way Heroics.

												It's a Rogue-Like JRPG with a Retro art style.You unlock new classes by either acomplishing certain goals, or by spending points you earn by playing. You can also use these points to unlock new perks for your character, or to upgrade your storage. This storage can be used to save items from previous adventures, and use them in new adventures.It's a great game which I hapily recommend to others who like any of these genres :D			"

												I bought this on a whim due to the low price. Have to say it's worth far more. I've already spent more time on this game then Dungeons of Dredmor, and can imagine playing it even more. Unlike most roguelikes, it's fast paced and easy to get into, but becomes complex once you know the basics. I beat easy difficulty on only my second playthrough, which took around 30 minutes. Normal difficulty adds recruitable party members, new items, and removes the fixed end point in easy mode. My longest run lasted 3 hours. I have yet to beat hardThere are very un-roguelike save points and 'Dimensional Vault' to carry over items from old characters. Your end game rewards are reduced for using them though. If you are good enough at roguelikes to do without them, it's worth trying as there is a lot of stuff to unlock.			"

												From the looks of the old style 16 bit graphcs, many might be suprised that this one eaisly becomes engaging and addicting.  The stroy line and game mechanics is what seems to draw one in.  The Music also adds to the quality of game play.I have yet to finish with the Knight class, which is a good first choice, and I can already see myself replaying the game to experience each additional class choice.  It does bring back memories of playing some of the classic rpg's on the old C64 back in the 80's, such as Ultima, Questron, Demon's Winter, Shard of Spring, Pool of Radiance and of course the classic, Hack/NetHackA great choice for the price.

												So for those who don't know what this game is, let me first explain what my impression (and the tldr) of the game is:One Way Heroics is a new twist on (somewhat) rogue-like RPG's, bearing similarities to Shiren the Wanderer (the non-Atlus-screwed-up one) but with an urgency placed on time and what you do with it.Understandably, some people wouldn't call it a roguelike because of the save/load feature or the dimensional vault, but since you do not accumulate hero points after resuming a loaded game (after death), my interpretation has been that saving/loading is only a feature for those who are in it for the story content.  A good compromise imo.What I likedA creative take on this style of game.  I haven't seen anything like it -- the closest comparison would be Shiren the Wanderer.An objective (the demon lord) that plagues you from the start, but not impossible to vanquish once you have progressed enough.Party members that serve a purpose, but also have depth.  Like everything else in the game, they are not permanent.The music is fantastic.What I didn't like that others might likeI'm not a fan of visual novels (?), so the abundance of text serving as the beginning and end of your adventure is not something that is fulfilling for me.  It's very well written, imo, so I imagine JRPG / Story-reading fans will like this.No cursed items.  Unidentified items you can wear, but none of them cursed. :\  The only undiscovered attribute on an item that poses any uncertainty is the durability.The price is so low, it feels like I robbed some poor hard-working developer that just loves making games like this.  Playism's site says something about letting you pay what you want (donation-based I guess?), so hopefully some people have been more charitable towards this game.What I don't likeThere is no way to isolate the leaderboards to personal social groups - as a result, it's all meaningless information, sadly. :\  It would be great if I could see where I rate among my friends list.There's no underground -- Yah, it's a pretty big game already, sure.  But fantasy games need dungeons.  An intricate right-way-progressing dungeon would've made the screen edge much more intimidating.Those are my impressions of this game. :)			"

												(Note: low playtime on Steam due to buying this before it was successfully Greenlit)An engaging little roguelike with some unique mechanics. Complex enough for experts to have fun with, but simple enough for anyone to get into. Tons of stuff to unlock, questions about the ""dimensions"" to answer through different approaches to different playthroughs, and at three bucks? You need to hammer the ""buy now"" button.			"

												It's a Rogue-Like JRPG with a Retro art style.You unlock new classes by either acomplishing certain goals, or by spending points you earn by playing. You can also use these points to unlock new perks for your character, or to upgrade your storage. This storage can be used to save items from previous adventures, and use them in new adventures.It's a great game which I hapily recommend to others who like any of these genres :D			"

												The best roguelike on SteamBold statement, but it truly is. The game forces you to constantly advance and that really gives the game a very good pacing; the interface isn't clunky which often is the case with more traditional roguelikes, but the game doesn't dumb down anything either.The game got an amazing attention to details, and lots of effort has clearly been put into things that most will never notice, but that really makes the game worth replaying over and over against, because you always find new things every time. Clearing the game first looks very simplistic, but once you defeat the demon lord you'll realize that there's far more to the game than you thought.The graphics aren't impressive, but they work well for the game, and the artwork can be quite charming at times.

												Quite honestly one of the best roguelike RPG's i've played.There's a character creation system with a variety of classes, perks and appearances. Most need to be unlocked but there's quite a lot to get.The movement and battles are turn-based and the unique flavor to this particular game is a encroaching wall of darkness from the left that closes in each time you do something.(Move, attack, etc) This means you have to keep a eye on the darkness and consider wether to go on or maybe try to clear that one dungeon or pick up that one item in time.This creates a sense of pressure that makes for a fun atmosphere.There is a online aspect to the game in the form of death/milestone messages from other players in the same world that show up in the upper left of the screen.The worlds are randomly generated but there are specific types that have special quests or certain restrictions. There is also the ability to share world ID's with others so they can play the same world.For a fairly cheap price this is a great game to pick up.			"

I was so wrong this game is rather confusing at first, but once you get the hang of it, it's rather interesting. I have almost unlocked all the classes except for the hero class and have barely touched the perks. I know there are people you can get to follow you which I haven't encountered yet not for lack of looking that is. It is a great game and I would say it's worth the price.			"

												You are a hero.  There's a darkness steadily advancing from the left.  If you get caught in it, it kills you, so you'll be steadily advancing to the right.  There's a demon lord that'll show up at some point to try to kill you.  It's your job to kill him first.  That's pretty much the story.This is essentially a turn based RPG.  Every step you take, action you make, etc. is matched by both the encroaching darkness and all other creatures/NPCs in the game.  As you progress right, you'll run into friendly NPCs that can sell/buy/give items, enemies that want to end your quest, random items strewn across the landscape...pretty much everything you'd expect from an RPG.The worlds you'll play on are randomly generated, so you have the option of a new map each time you play, although you also have the option of playing a world you or someone else has already played by inputting a code.  So, if you find a world you like, you can keep returning to it, or you can keep exploring new layouts...although if you return to a dimension already visited, there will still be some things that change, as shops will have different stocks and random item drops will be different.You start out with two classes available(and a male and female skin for each one), and as you either perform tasks during your attempts(killing an enemy with a bow, for example, unlocks the Hunter class) or spend the points you accumulate at the end of each run, you will unlock more classes and various boosts for your characters, known as perks.There's something about this game that keeps managing to pull me back in, even after it humiliates me.  This game is not much in the way of being forgiving.  Your character is pretty weak to start out each run, and there's always a good chance that a fairly strong monster will be hanging around a few meters from the start to make you notice just how weak you are, and there are always chances you'll take the wrong path through some terrain and get pinned behind a wall of mountains that you won't be able to cross before the darkness catches you.  But, even with that, there's always a chance the next run will drop off an awesome weapon early on, or the planets will align perfectly and you'll take a golden path through the land and take down the Demon Lord with ease...only to never be able to recreate that run again.So yes.  I highly recommend this game.			"

												This game is decievingly good!  If you're a fan of the roguelike genre you've probably seen a lot worse in terms of presentation.  But it'd be a real shame if you passed this up because of generic looking graphics.  This game is hugely underselling itself at its price point.The game features very modular gameplay, easy to pick up in small intervals.  But the depth is real.  Be prepared to get in all kinds of difficult situations and play them differently based on your class.The real strong suit of the game however, is it's gimmick.  The encroaching darkness seems simple enough, but wait till you try to get a treasure chest underwater, and then swim out in time.  It requires you to think ahead in a way other than ""how do I get this baddie out of my face""  which is refreshing in a roguelike.If you're still reading this review, go ahead and pick it up.  This will cost you less than a fastfood combo even at full price.  Seriously, you can't go wrong here.			"

												Fun game. It's like a RPG combined with a roguelike. It made me think of a mystery dungeon game I used to love called Shiren The Wanderer.The music is great. The online component is pretty interesting aswell. It reminds me a bit of Dark Souls. There is no direct multiplayer component but there are ghosts and you can leave messages and such.The thing I like less, is not being able to save when you want to. You need to find a certain NPC or have a certain event occur to be able to. It's a gameplay mechanic and games probably don't take super long so I can understand it but eh, I'd like to turn off the game and return from where I left off. EDIT: After playing some more, you're also able to buy consumable items that allow you to save at any point. Good enough for me.			"

												This game is amazing. It has a combat system similar to what you would find on one of the Pokemon Dungeon games, which is one of my favorites.You don't have a whole lot of classes to choose from, but you wouldn't expect to at the price. You still have enough to keep you busy for hours on end.Each run scores you based off your treasure looted compared to treasure possible to loot, monsters killed without being hit, distance traveled, and your overall level. There are some other minor point contributors, but with those four main ones, it means getting to a high score means you have to be focused and make good use of everything you see.I would recomend this game to anyone who has free time, because it will eat up a whole lot of yours.

												Very fun twist on roguelikes, with streamlined and fast-paced gameplay, pleasant music and a highly addictive concept and progression format.Basically, this is like a roguelike game (such as Nethack or TOME4: Tales of Maj-Eyal), mixed with one of those old school platformer ""scroller"" stages where a wall of death is coming towards you. The combination and design makes progression interesting, as gameplay never really stagnates because of the wall keeping you moving forward and requiring you to make decisions. ""Is it worth it to enter this dungeon? Will I have a way to get out in time? Can I reach the shopkeeper before the appraiser gets eaten by the darkness?"". At the end, you have to battle the boss, the Demon Lord who summoned the wall of death, which packs quite a punch compared to everything else you fight. To aid you, you can find loot, money...all your traditional JRPG elements, but streamlined to be as fast-paced as possible.The presentation is a mixed bag. Sprites are tiny but appropriate, and look very much like what you'd expect in a Super NES RPG. Music is not the best ever, but makes itself noticeable when needed, and stays out of the way during the less exciting parts. Controls are very simple and consoley, but doesn't really need a pad to be enjoyed, as it controls with mostly 3 keys and directions. The interface is however quite confusing, with vital stats near the middle of the screen, with other stats at the bottom, buffs at the right...it's a bit all over the place and takes a bit to get used to, but at least you can get used to it after a couple rounds.Larger character artwork is also a mixed bag, with some portraits looking good, others looking kinda bland. Character design is very old-school JRPG medieval fantasy, a bit retro while at it, looks more 90s than 2010s if you get what I mean. I guess it is a good effort at looking old-school.As for gameplay decisions, it's all quite slick. Weapons have durability, but are usually easy enough to replace, and repairing is possible, while not straightforward. To compensate, the limit on enchantments, buffs and powerups for each individual weapon or armor is quite big, allowing to kind of craft superweapons with a bit of luck or planning, not too much. Dungeons, terrain and towns are terribly simplistic, but then again, you can't really stay more than a dozen turns in most places, so it works out for the best. There's plenty of decent loot lying around as well, although deciding what stuff to keep and what to drop to satisfy your weight limits can bring the action to a temporary halt as you ponder advantages and disadvantages, or wondering if that unidentified item is crap or highly enchanted.An average game from start to finish can take like 40 minutes. Since it's designed to be played over and over, difficulty is high, and you can store lucky drops for your characters, replay value is pretty good. Specially if you are into beating high scores, a bit of an outdated concept in general, but works pretty well here. Different classes, builds and worlds play quite differently, so there's noticeable variety. Special and shared worlds also have leaderboards, for a slight competitive vibe if you are into it. Could be a good choice for a let's play or speedrunning.Extra features are quite convenient and welcomed. You don't get a tutorial, but ""advice"" based on your actions, reminding you of basic tactics and features if you don't use them. Likewise, you have Iris, a little fairy companion, that will give you general advice and specific details of some aspects of the game (such as terrain penalties) on request. At the end of your quest you get rated on a number of aspects, such as looting and combat, and gives you extra advice or praise if it's bad or good. Your general score awards you ""hero points"", which you can use to make any new playthrough stronger by unlocking perks, player classes or item storages.This game features a peculiar version of ""permadeath"", a common roguelike trope, where your character is completely gone after death. You can save your game, but the default would be to start over once you die. However, you can continue a saved game after death, but you aren't awarded hero points if you continue after dying. The game encourages permadeath but doesn't mind very much if you go for the opposite, basically.You can't play together with other players, however, it has a fairly interesting approach similar to shared Nethack servers of old, where a single-player game gets peppered with messages and other bonuses caused by other players being in the same ""Dimension"" (a fancy name for random seeds). As well, special events updated daily give special challenges, such as more experience gain in a harder setting; replacing all item drops for money and so on. Or quests with special NPCs, some fairly funny or endearing. 6 months after the latest update, special events are still getting rotated daily, which is a good sign.A great plus is that, while the game isn't available for Linux, it runs flawlessly on WINE, only having a minimal sound glitch with the conversation sound effect (which echoes a tiny bit), but all online features, replays, input, video, music, all other sound effects and such, works perfectly.

												Getting brutally beaten to death while climbing some mountains is my jam! No, seriously, I'm all for permadeath but I lost many promising runs in a fashion similar to that.Woes of stupidity aside, this game is great, and much more deep than the interface and graphics might suggest.

												This game is very innovative, and whilst playing I can't help but bring to mind Half Minute Hero as well. If you've played that and enjoyed it, you'll love this. This game is very fast paced, and if somehow you manage to plow your way through it immediately (good luck) you will have only spent 30 minutes on it. However, the game's replay-ability is it's biggest feature. Each victory ends with more loot, more rewards, more knowledge, and more challenging modes to continue playing with. The game is endless hours of fun, and I must say it is well worth the small amount of money it costs. ($3.00 For anything that lasts for hours and hours is a good deal, regardless of what your interests are.)			"

												Don't mind the 4hrs played, this is like my third account that I have the game on.Now shut the ♥♥♥♥ up, this is my review.Have you ever played a game so good that you always wanted to come back to it and play it again, even after years, and it's just as good as you remembered?Maybe, back in the day with games like Zelda and Mario64, or whatever you played. Whatever, it's not important.This game, One Way Heroics, is exactly that. I play it on and off, and every time I play it, it's just as good as the last. It's fun, it's lighthearted, it's frustrating, and it's a game that's worth every penny that I paid for. Hell, I've paid for it multiple times, like I said, this is my third account with the game. Not to mention every time I've bought it for my friends. It generates the world as you go along, so even though there are similarities, no two playthroughs are the same, unless you play on the same seed as your friend, or you retry a seed.It's challenging. I had to grind up a lot of gear to be able to beat the boss, it took me a while to be able to do that, but in the end it was satisfying. Then, when I finished that, I went ahead and beat the boss on the harder difficulties. Then when I finished that, I played the second campaign.WAIT, YOU SAID THERE'S A SECOND CAMPAIGN???Damn right I did. It's in the DLC.WTF DLC THIS IS 2016 I DONT WANT MICROTRANSACTIONS!!1!I will break your ♥♥♥♥ing jaw if you open your mouth again.The DLC is 7.79CDN and that's more expensive than the base game. You know why? Because the DLC has more content than the base game, imo. It has a new class, you can customize your castle, there is the new campaing, new biomes and dungeons, etc. It's just incredible how much content there is in it, and it's safe to say that the DLC kept me even more busy, figuring out everything.But that's not all, at least like four times a ear, the game goes on sale, along with the DLC for like 75-80% off. At a dollar, you really can't go wrong.Honestly, this game is the game you're looking for. It has your oldschool JRPG graphics, a unique take on the sidescroller, amazing soundtrack, a kinda generic and dull story, but it gets made up by the sheer amount of gameplay in this game.So shut up and buy the game already. Or wait til it goes on sale, you poor ♥♥♥♥.			"

												So, I bought this game because it was cheap.Was it worth it?Of course it was. Why not check it out for a dirt cheap price?It has a feel like The Binding of Isaac to me, without the random item rooms. Instead, you get sacks on floors.While I experienced a crash after creating a character, I figured out that you can just go to options and disable online settings.(crash fix right there for you folks.)After a while, it felt like a clash of genres of games that I loved;Perma death, (you can have a vault in which you put items from your last run in)On my third or fourth run, I got the hang of it.It felt a bit bland, but online might seem like fun.The jist of the game is that you can only continue to go right, and after 400km you have to fight the final boss, who is obviously quite difficult.Each time you die, you get Hero Points, which you can use to unlock classes, perks, and expand your vault to store items in in order to pass it on to your new character, like Rogue Legacy.It seems like it'll hold me over for a good week in single player, but I can't wait for multiplayer to work for me.

												An incredible game for its price. Developed by a one man team, the game is very simple: Walk right, train your character, defeat the demon lord, and save the world. You have to avoid the forever approaching darkness so you'll have to plan each and every move you take. Simple, right? Except that the world of One Way Heroics contains much more. Endless adventures in endless worlds and the hilariously ridiculous interactions with the characters present in the game makes it much more enjoyable. However, as you start to encounter more of these characters and start to learn more about this world you'll be trying to save endless times, things are not as simple as they may seem. What exactly is the darkness? Is the demon lord really the source of all the disasters happening to this world? And why is Panty named Panty?This game is definitely worth playing if you are a fan of RPGs and are looking for a game under $5. Also, to spice things up, sometimes the characters you meet may be a little ""different"" than they usually would.  cough Perverted Queen Frieda cough  "

												Great little Rogue RPG game. I enjoy the one way, pushing you forward and making it more difficult at times than many RPG's where you can easily rank against low level enemies etc. Reasonable range of weapons and enemies, nice music, and the world generation makes the gameplay much less tedious than it would be without. Alot of great features. Sometimes you can come across a Golem or ambush at a low level and get wrecked by it, and a little more customisation wouldn't go amiss, but for £2.29 who can complain! Well worth the money and well worth a try!  8/10 for a low price Rogue style game.			"

												On my first round I tried to talk to the people in the house you spawn in and my screen kept moving. At first I thought it was a bug I was like uh okay I'll just restart my game later, but nope it kept moving. As I saw my character die while walking towards it I was regretting my purchase. I watched the replay of my death and it was the lamest thing I've ever seen.I restarted and the screen was moving again. Suddenly, I realized that this is ONE way heroics which means you either stick to the right or you die. The game just got a whole lot more interesting and I've been enjoying it a lot. A lot of surprises and you can unlock more perks/characters. Best 87 cents you can spend.			"

												Forced-Sidescroller meets RPG in a game where the world can be generated a hundred different ways.Good notes: High customization options, good feedback system to help you out, unlockable content makes each run feel like a step forward, replay data is semi-entertaing to watch, and a system with depth to items/combat.Neutral notes: Well executed 8 bit stlying, faux-multiplayer in which you interact with the dead and recieve semi-selective notes from other players (only available in that day's multiverse world).Bad notes:  Even on full screen the text may still seem a bit small and some world combinations (I've only found 2 and have entered no less than 25 worlds) are less than enjoyable due to constant mountains or being nearly devoid of interactable content(villages/dungeons/chests)With all of that said, I give this a full recomendation if you enjoy a rogue-like.

												tl;dr- Seriously. You like JRPGs? Buy this game. You like persistant unlockables? Buy this game. You like random levels? Buy this game. This is one of my favorite games out there. Its fun to sit and play for 15 mins - or 4 hours straight.Also - be happy knowing you're supporting 16-bit style WITHOUT USING RPGMaker. This game runs its own engine.That in and of itself its worth it.___________________________________________At first glance, One Way Heroics looks like it was made on RPGMaker. It wasn't. Its a completely custom engine, from someone in Japan.And, boy is it unique. Seriously. Yes, its an RPG. Yes, it is done in 16 bit style. But that is about the only thing that makes it anything like the RPGs back then.The description on the store page really doesn't do it justice. It explains the base game. But it doesn't explain how incredibly addicting it is to go just ""one more run"". See, there's a bunch of dimensions - and they are slowly being swallowed up by the darkness. Meaning you can't go left for too long, as the darkness slowly advances from left to right across the screen every step you take. You are slightly faster than it, though. The game is turn based, so like Rogue, everything only moves when you do. Its like Rogue too, in that all you have to do is hit the attack key near an enemy  You are trying to defeat the Demon Lord who's causing the darkness, but its going to be quite a few playthroughs even on the easiest mode to beat him for the first time.You will die. A lot. No biggie though as it has permanent unlockables. A ""vault"" which you can upgrade to store items in. Perks to make your char stronger. And you can either choose to adventure in a completely randomly generated realm, or you can choose one of the ""online"" realms, 1 of which is random, and the others of which have ""specials"" (a certain character is there, darkness, better items, more XP etc). The online realms change every 24 hours. There isnt multiplayer as such, however in the online realms, theres a constant scroll of a pic and brief info about each other person playing. You can also set 1 of about 20 ""online messages"". One of the nicest features of online is you can also encounter the ""ghost"" of another player in your game at the spot where they died. They help you by giving you an item they were carrying and some of their XP.Theres also 5 game modes, eacxh slightly harder than the last, but with better items and more story. Oh did I mention that? Theres a story too. Each companion which you can find (and theres quite a few) has a story associated with them you can learn by talking to them. Oh, and both enemies and companions can have ""prefixes"". Some make them stronger, both enemies and companions. Some change dialogue with companions. (Really, EVERYONE needs to see Naughty Queen Frieda)...The base game is I think around $4. Its totally worth it. There's also DLC, which is totally worth it as well, if you like the base game. It adds even more awesomeness.			"

												Let me start by saying that I cannot give this game enough praise.One Way Heroics is a game that initially came off as a game that was inexpensive and potentially should have had a short lifespand on my ever growing list of titles I've played...But not only did it stick out from other games, I still can go back and play it today with the same enthusiasm I had when I compleated my first run. I was blown away by the in depth story and the diffrent charecters that you could encounter, and did I mention the soundtrack? They would make a fortune off that alone if AGM Playism put it up for sale (I don't know if they are selling it on like I-tunes or something of the like. I'm mainly refering to a steam realease). This game will surprise you in how much charecter it has, but I must recomend you play on AT LEAST afternoon stroll to get the full experience. Party members are mvery importent, and each have there own story to learn, but are mostly locked on walk in the park. And the multiplayer feature can be interesting for long runs. But to shorten up the message in a recomendation:Should you buy the game? Yes. Its very cheap for the ammount of good content you are getting.Should you buy the + DLC?Yes. It not only improves the orriginal gameplay, it also adds in one of my favorite Party members that you can gain.Should you buy the Sequal!?Woah, don't get ahead of yourself. I just found out about it today and haven't gotten to play it yet! So I have no idea yet! But other reveiws I read said new players should at least play the original first, so thats all I have on that topic right now.But as I said before, I am but a lowly gamer on this wide earth. I can never give this game the justice it deserves in just a few words, But I do want people to know that this game has more to see then the surface. I won't spoil anything, but this game is special and is worth the price of admission and so much more.By the way, Pirates can be surprisingly Charismatic.			"

												First off, you start off as a hero and you're trying to defeat the demon lord in order to stop the darkness that is following you and eating up the world. It's a very generic premise, but the thing is: There is no turning back. If you miss a shop keeper, you have to restart the world, or keep on going. You're hungry? You just missed the last piece of food for a while? Well too bad. This game has tons of replayability in it, and really is just one way. The levels are randomly generated and there are daily quests every day. Of course you don't get anything out of the daily quests, but they're still fun to adventure through when you really have nothing much to do.Each run can last more than 45 minutes if you're lucky, but they can also last less than 5 minutes. This game has tons of decision making and luck based things, but it feels perfectly balanced to me. There's a pixie in your inventory to help you with tips so that might help as well.

												This game is THE RPG for those that want a faster paced RPG, while being turn-based, but don't want to invest too many hours going through lengthy cutscenes and dialogue, and be able to enjoy its various challenges. The roguelike nature of this game provides many hours of adventures with the many randomly generated worlds that you can play through (and go back to if you want) and the 4 difficulty settings that allows new players and veterans at the game to enjoy at various levels.Each run is quick, simple, and fun, being able to quickly go from a fresh, level 1 character to an unstoppable hero with hundreds of levels, provided you can survive long enough. The world is being consumed in darkness, and you must run from left to right and outrun the darkness while going on your journey. There are several win-state goals in the game, each of which with varying difficulty. In other words, just because you've defeated the Dark Lord doesn't mean you've finished the game. There is more to the game than simply defeating the Dark Lord. With the different classes with different play styles, the potential allies that you can recruit, the different worlds and encounters, there are many unique adventures to be had in your quest to save the world. The amount of content and hours of gameplay you will get out of this is well worth the very cheap price of this game. I also highly recommend getting the One Way Heroics + DLC as well as it adds more classes, content, and functionality.			"

												So close to being a perfect game.The only painfully glaring development flaws are that potential party members (and other frendly NPCs) often get killed by monsters before even appearing on the screen (the game loads a ways ahead of what is accessible), and that several of your own abilities will kill or harm cooperative NPCs that are following you, i.e. mercenaries, cows, packhorses, etc.All that aside it's an amazingly addictive and satisfying game, one which hopefully inspires future developers to do it right.

												60% of the people who played this game probably hated it, but that's only because they didnt pay attention to what was happening. It's not frustating or boring, you just didnt pay attention. You're dropped in a world  with no tutorial and no context, but once you do understand what you're supposed to do and how the game works, you'll se yourself playing a very VERY fun and interesting game.There are lots of classes, lots of ways to play it, lots of bosses (!), there's even a way to befriend the boss and get him into your party, like what the hell that is amazing. I still didnt beat the game because ♥♥♥♥ this♥♥♥♥♥♥is hard, but its so fun i cant stop playing it.Great game, great music, _GREAT_ price, HELLA ADDICTIVE, and the best thing, in my opinion, its a totally different game when you actually understand what is going on and what you're supposed to do. Also a gigantic plot twist in the end. Look foward to that.			"

												A cute JRPG with a roguelike twist. Plays quickly and satisfyingly and gives a new random dimension every day to challenge a leaderboard for, as well as other challenge modes and random modes to do for fun. Combat is simple but there's a decent amount of classes, perks, gear, and items to find, as well a sparty members to recruit that come with mini storylines to complete. You can also save items from previous runs to hand them forward down the line.The game forces you to continually press ahead or die to ""the Darkness"", so exploring and fighting is balanced with continuing onward, ever onward. Everything you do takes up a turn, so exploring a dungeon and hacking down chests takes time, and you need to make sure you've got time to get out of the dungeon you went into! Or break a hole in the wall.At under 5 bucks, the game is a steal if you're looking for a small, simple game to play bits at a time. You can get in a game before work, or at lunchtime, or etc. You can play for a lot, lot longer at a time if you want to! But the game's strength is its ability to deliver a full package run in about a half hour.			"

												If you like rogue-likes then you'll love this game. You start off with a few classes of characters and can choose a few perks to augment stats or gain abilities, and your goal is to defeat the demon lord who appears to be the cause of a darkness swallowing up the lands. Literally. The game has you constantly running to the right as the darkness behind you swallows up everything. Time only moves when you're moving or performing an action however, so don't be worried about being idle. This provides an interesting mechanic and a rather unique gimmick to this game similar to what Half Minute Hero does with having a time limit to defeat stuff. This game is also highly replayable; With each death you gain hero points and can use a thing called the dimensional vault to store some of your fallen hero's goods for the next hero. You can use hero points to expand said vault or unlock more classes or perks.  Each day there are new ""dimensions"" basically randomly generated worlds that are downloaded each day, for you to explore and play with others, well, not with others like a party of folks to fight, but you can go through the same dimension as everyone else and see their current progress in the dimension, which is pretty neat. The music is great, and surprisingly enough is all public domain music you can use if you want, and while the art might not be the absolute best, it has an endearing charm to it that is only enhanced with the characters themselves. For so cheap, this game offers a lot of hours of fun times for anyone wanting a rogue-like with a lot of content.			"

												when i first saw this game i thought that it was just a normal rpg with the twist of time preassure, and though this didn not seem so appealing i thought i might as well give it a try. This game is such an inspiration for the rougelike genre.for those who haven't looked up a review or anything about the game, the game has something called a dimensional vault where you can store a number of items whenever you die with a charachter. After your first attempt and death you are awarded with hero point and you can use these to buy mor dimensional vault slots and perks that you can use for the next attempt. Becuase of this every playthrough becomes valuable as you have to try you best every time to get good stuff and even though you may fail at beating the boss at that atempt the stuff you gathered can be stored in the dimensional vault and be withrawn at the start of the next game.The game itself can be a little bit disappointing when you walk around and see a house or dungeon way too many steps away and you see it disappearing in the shadow every step you take, but be sure that there's going to be way more epic loot ahead. And if you are really obssesed with entering precisly that house you can reload the same world with the next charachter if you want to do so.Personally i find the Pirate class to be the best one. Yeah he may have negative charisma making the villagers hate his face, but after adding 2 charisma+ perks everything is fine. Be aware that you have to unlock him though but it is way worth it.anyway a great game and seems like something i will come back to now and then whenever i have hard time finding a game to play in my steam library containing 74 games....

												The game is amazing. I'll elabore below.I'll start with the bad things i saw on my first minutes. Negative  -   UI : At first you will be overwhelmed by the UI, lots of stuff you don't know of, and weird position (I'm still not used to having a map in middle of the screen). -   Everything looks so small : The graphics are distant, but you'll accustom to it pretty easily. F4 (window size) will be your friend here. -   ""Chatbox* : System info can be hard to see (the thing that looks like a chatbox) and you can't (or i haven't seen/found such feature) really scroll it up in case you missed something.After my first few minutes, i was able to withstand the things i was concerned from. All thanks to these pros. Positive  +   Soundtrack : The music is amazing. Each area has its own music and you'll be used to hear them pretty often, but the thing that i enjoyed the most, was event music.Each event has a different soundtrack, and that adds a nice variety to your ears.I'm just talking about design here, but the quality of the soundtrack is also amazing.Area music matches pretty well with the environment.Event music matches with the element of surprice and the feelings you may have while thinking your next move.Lore (game over / special characters / victory / etc) music is nice, you won't feel that it's out of place or that it affects negatively to what's going on. +   Story : This one can be subjective. I love with all my heart the genre of medieval fantasy. You'll find a few clichés, but there is also room for nice plot in between. I won't say which kind of plot, but it was worth it, even tho i kinda like all medieval fantasy plots. +   Replayability : I'm pretty serious with this one. I make sure to not buy any game that can't offer a good replayability. Please understand that after this point, i'll tell some stuff that even tho it's not a spoiler, it counts as stuff that is nice to see for yourself. You don't have to see all the game features in order to see if you'll enjoy it.After this point i suggest you to try a demo or buy it and play it for as long as you can refund it in case you don't like it. Following the replayability...You have different classes, each with unique skills, strenghts and weaknesses. At easy difficulties it isn't that big of a deal, but if you want to beat the game on the harder difficulties, you'll have to make good use of each class' strenghts.After beating the game, next time you pick a class, you'll see a medal based on the difficulty on the class that you beated the game with.A nice replayability factor is to complete the game on every difficulty with each class. And... +   Randomness :As long as you keep playing on different realms, you won't have the same experience.In case you are not that hardcore of a player, you can still repeat the last realm you played, and thus, having another try on the same encounter/environment.Still, some stuff will be randomized, like items, monsters, treasure and such, so it won't be that boring, you almost won't feel like doing exactly the same.This is getting too long, and i can't leave my games waiting for too long. So i'll jump to something i found average. Bipolar  +/-   Save system :You'll either love it or hate it. But you'll have options either way, remember that.There are three ways to save your adventure (which can turn out to be some pretty long and hardcore expeditions).1. Find a save attendant.A young elf will offer a save feature when you find her. I won't say much more, that's up to you. But you'll be able to find her pretty often.2. Save stone.A crystal used to save the game. Save attendants sell it, but you can find one in your adventures if you are lucky.3. Goddess gift.Once in a while, a goddess will offer a save option at the cost of 5 levels.Did you see what's so different here?All saving methods include finding something. This is not a game you can start and leave every 8 minutes. So no gaming at work i guess.Personally, i love this feature. I like to have to save some money for save crystals and use them wisely. As i said, you'll either love or hate this. +/-   Load system :The game allows you to save > try > fail > load > try again. It's kinda expensive to do it often, but you can.I don't like this, and i'm not the kind of person that can avoid to use an advantage when i see it. That's why i like unfair traps and the lack of Easy/Normal difficulties.Even tho i never play on Easy... If i struggle a lot on normal, i'll consider it.However, this system is also good in case you are not a hardcore player and you get too frustrated by dying because of a single mistake. (Like unequipping a shield and forgetting to equip it for the tough encounter.)That's all, i need to go back and play more games. Have fun!			"

												Fun and unique interpretation of the Japanese RPG game type. On paper, the concept sounds forced and confusing, but the game plays intuitively after only a few lives. Most importantly, there is a great design sense that unifies the game as a whole. Each class encourages its own gameplay style, and character customization, through an unlock system, is flexible without being overwhelming. An inter-game treasure chest, like that in Shiren / Mystery Dungeon, allows players not used to roguelikes accumulate treasure without being able to horde it. Well worth the price: a game that is rewarding whether you invest hours into it or simply play it as a coffee-break roguelike.			"

												What a cute little game. So far the fun I have had in it has been well worth the small price tag. It is a fun and very replayable rogue like with forced side scrolling of the map. Let the darkness touch you and you will be consumed. Aside from the adorable classic rpg graphicsThere are really nice features like:-exchange levels of experience to gain main attribute boosts.-Classes with more to unlock either by points or meeting the small requirement.-Many weapons and armors to pick up or buy from vendors in game. -Fun and yet very simple combat that should be pretty much common for most rpg/action rpg players.-Perks that you can assign to you character to give them a little more oomph out the gate. -Good soundtrack.-Accessable gameplay that also really plays well on a x-box/ps3 controller.-A vault you can expand to hold a few items from previous adventures that are made available to all your future runs.-Random generated worlds The game is great fun and easy to pick up for a short time and put down if need be. I do reccomend!			"

												One Way Heroics is a simple, yet unique and addicting RPG with an interesting spin on a common video game trope. I honestly didn't expect much, but it provides a lot of replayibility for its price; you can beat the game very quickly if you want, but you have to put quite a bit of effort to see everything.			"

This game has countless hours of playtime and hardly any diminishing returns over time. The gameplay is technically turn based, but as long as you are moving it doesn't feel that way. Several classes and perks as well as the ability to slowly upgrade each consecutive character provides for a really unique, enjoyable experience. At $3.49, this game is a steal!

												Good challenging game, best one I've ever played. And I hate challenging games, but this one is great! 9.5/10.  Here are pros and cons.Pros:- Great game, great balancing.- Level system is nice.- The stamina and stuff gives is a nice addition.- I've never seen another RPG game like this, so thats great! Making a new idea is always nice!- Whatever else I think is nice.Cons:- Lack of multiplayer, it would make the game a bit better in my option, give it that and you get my 10/10.- Co-op would be cool too.- Lack of classes, so far i've only found 5. I dont know how many there are, but still- It should be completely new. They should make new classes that no one has ever seen, that'd be nice. There are the basics like Archer, Swordfighter/Warrior. Sure, all RPGs have that, but this one would be better without, because this game is a one of a kind, I dont think any other RPG game like this could top it. I have a few new class ideas in mind, like the Warage. It'd use a combination of wands, spellbooks and swords and shields. I think that'd be nice. This game should have stuff like that. Also, you can use my idea if you want.- Finally, not much in the game itself. It gets repeatitive and boring really fast. Adding like Daily Challenges, Missions you could do like ""Go 500 meters in 20 seconds"" or something would be great. Also adding something like a Christmas mode at the appropriate time each year, it'd bring in the holiday cheer! :D-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Overall, One Way Heroics is a great buy. It could use some more updates and things, but its good. "

												Extremely well paced rogue-like. Has all the trappings to make it enjoyable without being overly difficult. Lacks some of the more interesting feature depth of games like Nethack but puts the general gameplay into something that you can go through extremely quickly. The classes have actual interesting twists to them instead of just minor stat point adjustments.			"

												I really believe in this game's concept. Incredibly addictive. Forget all the flashy FPS games out there. Forget all the epic post apoc zombie hipster nonsense. Get One Way Heroics. A STEAL AT SUMMER SALE PRICE OF $0.87!!!!!! A STEAL AT REGULAR PRICE OF $3.49!!!!! The world is depending on you to side scroll away from the darknessStarts out with only 2 available classes. More classes are unlockable. Basic Strength Agility Vitality Intellect Willpower Charisma type stat set up. You can choose up to 3 perks and they are stackable. With more perks being unlockable. Basic life bars are Health Stamina and Energy. As you perform certain actions, your Stamina decreases. If your Stamina decreases below zero you begin to lose Health. Just living makes your Energy decrease so I look at it as a Hunger bar. There is food you can eat to keep these numbers to an acceptable level. You apparently always start with a plant that constantly grows Healing Herbs so don't forget to pick them. After a playthrough you get Hero Points and you can spend those on unlocking perks, classes, or slots in a Dimensional Vault that will allow you to keep items after you die, so you may use them in other playthroughs.The Darkness never stops. If you get consumed by it, you die. Game over, man. Luckily for you, this is a Turn- Based game. So you'll have plenty of time to see what's in front of you, check your inventory, and plan your moves. It's funny because you might see a merchant NPC and you'll do some trading and then continue to run from the darkness and the NPC will scream as he gets swallowed up. Get. This. Game.			"

												After seeing the reviews and noticing that the price was an absolute steal, I decided to try the game. I only have a few minutes on it (ah, the life of a college student), but what I have seen so far is very inventive and fun. The game play itself feels like scrolling platformer jrpg, and it mixes all of these quite nicely. I also don't want to forget the whole ""dimension gimmick;"" it's pretty genius.

												I went into One Way Heroics...not expecting too much. Rogue-likes were always difficult for me to grasp. And I am always weak at taking on the difficulty curve, however those expectations were quickly turned around though. It was great, not only that there's something about the...feel? of the game that really struck a chord with me, the...melancholic, joking, and sometimes self-sacrificing manner the chat, dialogue and text went about.One of the best things I can say about One Way Heroics though, is the relative simplicity of it compared to other Roguelikes. Personally, I always loved Roguelikes, but I could never really enjoy them due to the aforementioned rather crazy steep learning curve which I always had issues handling. However, One Way Heroics was easy, Simple goal, Simple controls. A truly magnificent experience. I am sorely tempted to rate it among the top of the games I played ^_^			"

												First of all, this game is unforgiving. If this statment puts a bad taste in your mouth, then this game is not for you. However, if what I just said doesn't bother you at all, then you just might have found a gem worth keeping. This game is a rougelike, so don't expect to have all the pieces of the puzzle when you first begin. (Google ""Rougelike"" if you don't know what that term means, trust me it helps.) Your first dozen (or few dozen, depending on your luck) playthroughs are more than likely going to end in failure, and the world will be doomed without you. However, as you discover strategies that work (and ones that don't) things will start to turn around. Still, odds are you will die more times than you will reach that happy ending. But that's the thing, the game doesn't stop at the ending. Multiple endings add to replay value, as do multiple objectives that you don't even know exist when the game begins. Add in the fact that worlds are randomly generated, and you will never have two playthroughs that are quite the same (aside from multiple deaths, as that is always a possibility).In short, this game will give you back everything that you put into it. If you don't give it a chance, you will have wasted your money. Fight through the first dozen deaths and learn from your mistakes, and this game will leave you addicted like it has done for me.			"

												Having beaten this game once, I feel as if I definitely got my money's worth.  One Way Heroes takes the concept of a roguelike, and twists it here and to create an enjoyable end product that reminded me of 30 Second Hero and Desktop Dungeons.  In the beginning, the jrpg graphics threw me off slightly, as did the premise of a scrolling field of darkness.  The text-based screams of people being enveloped was a nice touch that may both cause cringing as well as a chuckle. After my first death, having made a decent run, I was suprised to see an entire system in which I could not only store items I had acquired, but also purchase new ablities for the next run, as well as extra storage space for my 'dimensional chest'.  Although the procedurally generated structures becoming familiar after a time, the randomness of both the wares of merchants and the contents of containers keeps things fresh, not to mention the occasional mob with a modifier on them, from cheap merchants that can rip you off, to ancient monsters that drop a rare item.  The prices for many items may be steep at times, but a trick I've found is to bring high-priced items like the fox tail into your next playthrough with the dimensional chest, making your next endeavor a bit more comfortable upon reaching a merchant.  Perhaps you might want to bring in a favored weapon, perhaps one with multiple upgrades?  With the scrolls of swordplay and armoring, you can upgrade equipment, and although they have durability, with luck you can grab a repair item to keep that overpowered sword nice and sharp.  The mechanics are complex, but simple enough to pick up on.  You have an hp bar, energy bar, and hunger bar.  The hunger bar continuosly goes down, and you use energy for many of the special abilities.  With hunger being directly tied to your ability to regenerate, similar to minecraft, food becomes a valuable resource, and since potions don't fill hunger, even the slightest morsel becomes important.  Luckily, food is still not incredibly hard to find, and you even recieve some at the beginning, so although you may be led by your stomach, you won't always feel compelled to make mad dashes for food.  A weight limit means you need to make tough choices between grabbing a strong armor or weapon (which by rule of thumb weigh more the better they are) or carrying more of the much needed potions.  If you feel a huge need for a higher weight limit, simply change your character's starting buffs and abilities.  Energy is used for swimming, climbing mountains, and using abilities, paricularly as the force user, who spams the one damage spell in the game with imputiny.  You will often find yourself conserving this, as without energy, ever expidenture eats your own health.  In terms of climbing and swimming, these are desprate measures taken when there is nowhere else to go, and if possible, always find another way.With a rolling screen at your back, this sidescroller of a rpg may make you cry with frustration as you fail to escape due to a wall. Luckily, the developers added a skill to help you called awakening.  With a cry of ""Time, Stop!"" you can stop the movement ofeverything for three turns, plus an attack boost.  Although you have limited uses, this can be used to survive almost any encounter, from freezing bandits in place so you can thin numbers without fear of being triple-teamed, or gaining enough time to destroy the afformented wall with your sword and escape the dungeon.  Besides this, each class is varied and unlockable modifiers and classes are accessible, and in terms of classes, unlockable even if you don't fufill their requirement if you use the points gained on your runs.  Of all the things this game reminds me of, the frantic escape reminds me of cutesy 30 second hero, where you get limited time to defeat a level, causing a similar amount of frantic despair as the end of your attempt approaches and Desktop Dungeons, which also can drive you crazy when a forgotten option causes death, although the forgiving mechanics make this game far more accesible, even with both running off a mechanic of unlocking.This and many more intricities await in this game, and I only have two cons.1: There could be more force abilities and weapons(especially force abilites), hopefully coming later2: More randomized structures and new mechanics would be cool, but not a huge deal for a game of this size and priceOverall, I'd say this fun, fast-paced experience was worth playing.

It's a game that's ment to be played in short sessions, sessions where you earn one extra thing a time . So, if you're intendin' to buy this game, I suggest you do so! But , even thought there's an unlimited amount of worlds, I would recommend you play in sessions and not for hours like I did! Anyway, over all one of my favorite games! A must have and a cheapy!

												One Way Heroics is a rogue-type constantly moving rpg. In short, it's a brilliant game for a lover of rpgs who also happens to be incredibly ADHD. I picked it up for in incredibly low price (less than a dollar!) and got way more than my money's worth. I would pay more for this game, if only I wasn't a cheap sonofagun.The game starts with a basic intro, then throws you right into character making. Not many choices for now, but after the first run (and death) it becomes obvious that there are many more classes, perks, and items to unlock.My first few runs were less than perfect. I found one chest out of thirty and didn't even make it 100km. I tried to esacpe from monsters by going into the mountains. HINT: Don't do that.But I was immediately hooked. I loved the looks, the AMAZING music, and I really wanted to beat the hell out of the enemies that were doing the same to me.I'll be playing this game very often. I give it a 9/10. "

												This is an extremely engaging game with simple mechanics that work well for it. If you are a fan of JRPGs or loot snagging in general, you'll have a great time.Despite this being a procedurally generated roguelike game, it does manage to squeeze in some story and interesting characters. The unique bit is that, the generation is based off of whatever you want to type in. If you die in the dimension you entered if you want to revisit that dimension, the map generated will be the same (from what I've seen). This means that you can try to learn aspects of a specific dimension and plan around it. Don't worry about the random generation screwing you over too hard either. On each character run you are always given 15 free turns that you can use in bundles of 3 whenever you want. So if you see a long stretch of unavoidable mountains, you could in theory use all 15 turns to pass them if it was really that bad/unavoidable. The combat is simplistic, but deep enough that strategy actually matters since your positioning will often determine the outcome of a fight if more than one opponent is present. The game has a fair number of weapons and weapon types, some of which offer longer ranges and others which are really great at busting down terrain (Yes, you can break down walls of a house to talk to the people inside).If you love optimization, NPC party building, pretending you actually have friends or are just looking for a fun game with a wonderful soundtrack, I'd spend the 83 cents to play this. I believe the regular asking price is $3, which is more than fair. Had I not only found this thanks to the steam sale, I would have gladly paid the $3.			"

												My review for this game is very simple, its fantastic. The game is very clever in both its execution of gameplay and art style and here he is what i love about the game:- Many demensions (worlds) as they are randomly generated- Tried and tested RPG methods that work, sometimes better than other games- Easy to pick up, hard to master- Soundtrack is off the scale (and is free with the game!)However this game wont certainly be for everyone. If you hate turn based RPGs then you wont like this one bit, as it does rely heavily on this feature. Here are a few nags i have about the game:- Can become to easy once your gear is insane - No enough end game for me (except setting my own personal goals)- Classes dont feel different enough (however there is a very wide choice)Also please note, while this game has no direct multiplayer, it does have community demensions in which heroes can compare how they have faired against eachother e.g how far they go in KM.MY RATING: 8/10 - Worth everyone penny!

												I really believe in this game's concept. Incredibly addictive. Forget all the flashy FPS games out there. Forget all the epic post apoc zombie hipster nonsense. Get One Way Heroics. A STEAL AT SUMMER SALE PRICE OF $0.87!!!!!! A STEAL AT REGULAR PRICE OF $3.49!!!!! The world is depending on you to side scroll away from the darknessStarts out with only 2 available classes. More classes are unlockable. Basic Strength Agility Vitality Intellect Willpower Charisma type stat set up. You can choose up to 3 perks and they are stackable. With more perks being unlockable. Basic life bars are Health Stamina and Energy. As you perform certain actions, your Stamina decreases. If your Stamina decreases below zero you begin to lose Health. Just living makes your Energy decrease so I look at it as a Hunger bar. There is food you can eat to keep these numbers to an acceptable level. You apparently always start with a plant that constantly grows Healing Herbs so don't forget to pick them. After a playthrough you get Hero Points and you can spend those on unlocking perks, classes, or slots in a Dimensional Vault that will allow you to keep items after you die, so you may use them in other playthroughs.The Darkness never stops. If you get consumed by it, you die. Game over, man. Luckily for you, this is a Turn- Based game. So you'll have plenty of time to see what's in front of you, check your inventory, and plan your moves. It's funny because you might see a merchant NPC and you'll do some trading and then continue to run from the darkness and the NPC will scream as he gets swallowed up. Get. This. Game.			"

												It's really interesting how a very simple concept can make something highly engrossing, and One Way Heroics is a good example of this in play. Take a very basic turn based movement and combat system, simplified stats and gear usage, and rather basic 'save the world' story as their parts, and this isn't anything new nor special by any degree, yet once you add in the ever moving 'Darkness', a mass of black that's always moving ahead, with or without you activly running away from it, and it suddenly becomes this odd pressured race of time and land management. The main key point is whever you take an actions, yet it be attack or talking or even moving, the darkness moves a bit as well, devouring that part of the map with it making it no longger accessible. Suddenly you might be trying to rush towards a small city outpost hoping to sell your overload of loot, only to get there to watch the vender NPC's parish in that very second, having to now make a rush forward hoping another isn't too far off. It suddenly makes every little action you do feel 'importent' in the grand scale of things, and it really forces you to learn to look out for selective map alterations, or carry around Map Scrolls to ensure you don't miss anything vital. The NPC's you can recrute as well also have  rather small, but kinda interesting storylines, each one giving a bit more clear overarching idea of just what's going on, and perhaps a way to really 'save the world'. Not to ruin anything, but those who explore and read up will chances are find far more then this game first lets on.On top of all of this, is a small, but nifty option of online interactions. It's nothing Dark Souls worthy of jolly co-op and the like, but it's more say little snapshots into other's current playing situations as they trek on the same world, able to share a small snipit of text, and be shown how they are status wise. Of course, on death, you can also share something much the same, and depending on where you died, your ghost might help someone else's journey along, dropping a random peice of loot you had at the moment. Beyond all of that, it's a nice, addicting, and simple game you can pick up for an hour or two, feel like you've made some progress, and seems to always have just ONE more little thing to show you even many hours after the fact.

												This game is well work the money. you will get a large amount of game play out of it and even when you get tired of it, it will only be for a few days. the only bad thing i have to say is that it does not explain things as well as it should it kind of just points you in a direction (the direction being left) and says kill the demon king. Even with the game doing this once you get used to it, it will be well worth your money.			"

This game has that certain appeal that just got inside my head, I love the simplicity/challenge of it (I know what I said)!Whether choosing to play it safe, or going for that new Force Power, One Way Heroics has become a game that I can't imagine not playing. With a price tag of under $5, and with the definite replayable factor, RPG fans of all types will enjoy this one!			"

												One of the most innovative RPG games I have ever played. When I saw the trailer I was worried that this was going to be another RPG maker game, but it is much more. A lot of love and care went into this game and it shows with the gameplay. This is one of those games that doesn't have a lot of mechanics, but it does what it does, and it does it very well. I don't reccomend playing with a controller, since the default controls are using the control stick to move. And since your character moves in four directions, it's quite difficult to position yourself. The gameplay is a sort of turn-based. The only way I can describe it is if you played games like Dungeons of Dreadmor where each time you move, the enemies (and darkness) move after you move. The graphics are also pretty good. I'm not sure if this game is made in RPG maker, but it does have similar graphics, like the mountains. I got this game as a part of the humble indie Japan bundle, and I've never been happier with my $15 I spent on it.			"

												First things first, do you like Roguelikes? If so then this game is a very prospective find for your collection! It's a very perma death and turn based unforgiving type game but of course it has features that work around that kind of system, being able to bring items over from previous gameplays and also unlocking new classes and perks to make yourself stronger at the beginning. The pace it sets with the darkness constantly chasing you is very fresh as well because not only is it a roguelike game but it also has aspects of time management almost like Half Minute Hero, making gameplay have a much more frantic pace even though it's still turn based. Another thing that makes the game fun to play is the online features, it's always fun playing a game and knowing others are doing the same, the little pop in messages aren't disruptive at all and seeing how far other people are reaching and how many other people are failing is fun in it's own rights. Of course, it's got the sharing aspect from games like Minecraft and Starbound, you can share any of the worlds that have been generated by simply giving the world's code to friends and other people. All the worlds have their own little leaderboards too, with rankings and other things, you can even see how people went about their adventure. Also, you can actually get better at a world/dimension since it's layout never changes aside from random loot drops and events. Overall, while simplistic and a bit more on the hectic/rushed side, it's still pretty in depth, especially with the carryovers and whatnot, you can even grind items out to twink yourself up for the next run. As an ending note, don't expect to win early on unless you play on the easiest difficulty, losses are inevitable on this game as they are a part of it, take it in as it comes and build yourself up to become stronger to finally defeat the Demon Lord!

There are several difficulties, a handful of classes, and countless worlds to choose from, each with their own challenges, features, and obstacles to overcome. This adds up to a lot of content to play through, should you feel so inclined.With the price it's at, there's really no reason not to buy it.There's only one way this can go - will you do the right thing?

Third of all, this game was actaully entertaining and challenging.  I played through a good 6 or 7 times before I was able to beat the game.  It is a short game, but the challenges it posseses are pretty hard espeically if you change the difficulty.  The dimensional vault was a cool device and the random world generator made it less repeititve as it gave you a new world every single time.

												Pure genius.  One Way Heroics is probably one of the better indie games this year that you won't hear about.If you enjoy generated games or the old school sprite RPG's, get this, get it now.The game-play is pseudo-turn-based where every time the player performs an action, the game world will iterate as well.Pros: Excellent replay value. Nice sprite visuals Fun, Simple gameplay: Run right, adventure, fight or flee from a large variety of monsters, search for supplies. Visit towns and talk to NPCS. Do all of the above while impending doom is always advancing towards you. Due to generated content, you never know what you'll encounter.  Each new adventure has its surprises. Lots of secrets to uncover. Works with gamepads other than the Xbox360 Controller. Able to carry some equipment over to a new adventure.Cons: None.  Although you need to come into this game expecting to replay it repeatedly to really get anything out of it.  Not a traditional linear RPG at all.One of my favorite indie games for 2014. "

												First of all, this game is unforgiving. If this statment puts a bad taste in your mouth, then this game is not for you. However, if what I just said doesn't bother you at all, then you just might have found a gem worth keeping. This game is a rougelike, so don't expect to have all the pieces of the puzzle when you first begin. (Google ""Rougelike"" if you don't know what that term means, trust me it helps.) Your first dozen (or few dozen, depending on your luck) playthroughs are more than likely going to end in failure, and the world will be doomed without you. However, as you discover strategies that work (and ones that don't) things will start to turn around. Still, odds are you will die more times than you will reach that happy ending. But that's the thing, the game doesn't stop at the ending. Multiple endings add to replay value, as do multiple objectives that you don't even know exist when the game begins. Add in the fact that worlds are randomly generated, and you will never have two playthroughs that are quite the same (aside from multiple deaths, as that is always a possibility).In short, this game will give you back everything that you put into it. If you don't give it a chance, you will have wasted your money. Fight through the first dozen deaths and learn from your mistakes, and this game will leave you addicted like it has done for me.			"

												This is one of the many extremely cheap games I got during the Summer Sales (2014).  I got it simply because I knew the trading cards would make up or at least almost make up for the 74 cents I spent.  I launched it, and was ready to let it sit and run for cards, but then, the music started.  The music was wonderful to listen to.  After sitting on the menu just listening to the music for about 30-/+ minutes, I decided I'd actually give the game a try.  I see a menu allowing me to choose my name, class, and additional perks.  Each of the characters has different standard perks, abilities, and gear.  Though it looks like you're going in extremely weak, you get random perks for leveling up and for exchanging levels with the Goddess statues that you find throughout the worlds.  If you choose the right combination of perks for a class, you can be very well set late-game.The mechanics are simple; Z to attack, X to open the inventory menu, and C to open the grid view so you can aim without moving your character.  You progress to the right of the screen to escape the darkness that's consuming the land.  If you touch the left end of the screen, you die.  There's a boss to fight, and if you kill him, you win (though you will not kill him without leveled gear and good stats).  You can climb mountains and swim in water in exchange for turns and stamina.  You find items scattered about, there are merchants, dungeons, and random villages (of which usually have a person that allows you to save your progress).  It's pretty much a standard turn-based exploration RPG, but is very clever in which they execute certain aspects.The first game I thought of while playing this game was one of my favorites for the GBA- Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team.  The moving mechanics, the menus, the navigation, and the soundtrack all are similar, and very well executed.  This game renewed the genre for me.Why I Recommend It: -The game has a very high replay value due to the randomly generated worlds and limitless perk combinations.-The game is very cheap, and is well worth the money.-The soundtrack alone is worth the cost of the game.  The game is almost just a bonus.-It's very well set up, with little to no bugs (I have yet to find one)Who I Recommend It To: -People wanting to experience another classic RPG with a twist.-People that enjoyed the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon series and games similar to it.-People with limited funds.-People that just want a game to play that is unlike many of the games here on Steam.Who Should Avoid It?:-People unwilling to pay the minute price.-Idiots.Final Thoughts:I didn't think I'd invest as much time in it as I have.  This isn't one of those games you usually invest a lot of time in for straight playthrough (say, 5 hour+ sessions), though you can.  This is one of those games you would play for thirty minutes a day everyday.  Personally speaking, I'll certainly be coming back to it.			"

												Very hard to get used to the controls for some reason, but once you do the game is amazing, i suggest playing it while watching a walk-through for it so that you can better understand the world you've entered. The game itself isn't inherently hard, but you have so little to work with that it takes getting used to. Warning to new players to stay away from Golems, they have set spawn locations per world and they are nasty with or without an axe (which does more damage to them).Characters can be unlocked with points rewarded for your progress after each death or by completeing a certain feat. You can use these points to get a vault and add space to said vault. The Vault NPC is in the set spawn for each character. I recommend always keeping a Key of Seals in the Vault if you manage to come across one. Keys of Seals are used on Temples and can give you Holy Artifacts. My first holy artifact was an Axe that crushed everything before me. By the time it had worn down i found another temple and another key of seals, and got a Holy Spear and Holy Chest Armor. Made it the last 80 km to the Demon Loard and killed him with no struggle. I've only gotten 2.8 hrs of playtime in the time of this review, but i could easily put 200 hours into it. It's cheap for it's value of entertainment, and if you end up in a poor spawn you can always just continue again. More tips-Always buy from a Chef When/If you reach a town. They seem pricey but in actuality they are cheap and extremely valuable.-This game is about Trade-offs, you may end up choosing things that are detrimental to the world you spawn on.-More expensive is not always better, especially when you do not have a high enough Item-Appraisal to know what you are buying.-Randomly Generated worlds always have their problems, the largest map wrecker in this game is large mountain walls that you have to climb. They take a great deal of turns to climb and eat your stamina, if you find yourself having to climb mountains frequently you will die, and you may want to explore a different route or a new world entirely.-Chests in the water are also death-traps but if you can manage it, they may offer useful loot.-Teleportation Pills will save you from Bandits, Bears, or Golems.-Axes will destroy walls and chests with ease for better dungeon navigation.-Bows and Lances will help you kill your enemies from a distance, very beginner friendly weapons, unless you have no arrows. Negatives about this game - The loss of your character after completeing the game is without a doubt a loss, but the ability to save his gear makes up for it, despite the fact it is battered and will probably have to be repaired despite my deep loathing of the brittle debuff.

												One Way Heroics (OWH), is a Quick paced Rogue-like RPG made from the RPG maker Series. Sounds simple, and is easily hidden amongst the other ""Maker Games"" on Steam. But this is one RPG that you should not miss. It's Challenging, Fast-Paced, and Addicting. As the name implies you will be going one way with your ""heroics"" as you battle the Darkness that is plaguing the world you inhabit (as the different world are classified as alternate dimensions in-game)Pros- A Decent array of Classes, 2 to begin 8 overall (3 more if you get the expansion).- No two world are the same allowing for a new exciting experience each time, and if you liked a world you played before you have access to that in your logs.- Simple yet thrilling combat: with the unique ""one way"" mechanic, the combat does not allow you to dawdle and grind. You will have to defeat enemies Quickly.Con (As the only one i can really think of as of writing this review)- Slow Start: the Game is tough, While it's nice that the first two classes you start with are easy to play, the Classes you unlock will take a bit of practice to get used to making it a tad difficult to unlock early achievements.Otherwise One Way Heroics is a fast paced RPG that looks generic but should Not be Overlooekd just becasue of that. IF you like Simple yet thrilling RPGs then One Way Heroics is a Game for you!			"

												It's a nice little roguelike with a twist. Said twist works out surprisingly well. It's not very expensive and it's pretty enjoyable. The one real downside is the balance seems to be a bit wonky, with holy weapons being perhaps too crucial to victory. The Dimensional Vault is a nice concept, which definitely helps some of the problems stemming from the randomness. The soundtrack is also a nice touch. All in all, it's worth the low cost, but bear in mind that it can be a bit repetitive after awhile.Have not tried the new expansion yet.			"

The only way I can describe it is if you played games like Dungeons of Dreadmor where each time you move, the enemies (and darkness) move after you move. The graphics are also pretty good. I'm not sure if this game is made in RPG maker, but it does have similar graphics, like the mountains. I got this game as a part of the humble indie Japan bundle, and I've never been happier with my $15 I spent on it.			"

												There's not much I can add that isn't on a dozen reviews already.  I got this game with a Humble Bundle, but it's easily worth the asking price and more.    You move through procedurally generated  worlds while trying not to get swallowed by the darkness (the left edge of the screen), picking up treasure and fighting monsters along the way.  With luck you will be strong enough to take on the demon lord.   But..there's more.  The demon lord can be a friend.  There are other people you can recruit, a number of unlockable classes, and a host of perks.  The real enemy is the darkness itself....I'm averaging about half an hour per playthrough so far.  There's enough here to keep your mind busy - thinking up strategies, and running around looting things without running out of time - but the game's not going to bog down either.As for replayability:  New dimensions, different classes, different endings?  This game has you covered.			"

												This is a good little Semi/Rogue like RPG it's doesn't cost a lot and despite being a small game there is actually a lot of stuff to do like unlock the many different classes, perks and find all the hidden endings and find all the possible special partners the thing than surprise me the most of how deep the story of the game is. (I mean for such a little game anyway)You can play on many different kind of world you can even input your own code to create a random world for yourself or enter one of your friend or other people codes to get certain partners easier there is also a *Multiverse* world where you can see what the other people playing the game right now are doing top left corner even if you cannot actually see them. (It actually add a lot of fun to know that ROXXOR just died killed by a small harmless puppy...)I'll give it a 7/10 (7 Because there is no real co-op online play right now and I hope they're going to add it someday)			"

												When I first saw this on the store, my immediate reaction was ""Oh look some crappy RPG maker game. This is gonna suck"" and my second reaction was ""BUT IT'S ONLY $0.87 AND WITH A 96% POSITIVE RATING WHY NOT?!""This game is great. Incredibly addicting, very strategic, and insanely replayable. Easily my new favorite game. Belongs right up there with classics like Terraria, Binding of Isaac, and FTL. Definitely get this game. Buy a 20 pack.			"

												This is truly wonderful game, easily better than some Triple A titles(in my opinion), and it is filled with many feels. It is generally simple, and at times it can be tense. The story itself is simple, as well with its gameplay and mechanics, but it is incredibly well done and thought out. At times it can be pretty easy, but can be extremely difficult. A great game for both; ones who want something simple and ones who look for a challenge. The generated worlds and rogue-like elements really add to it. Worth far more than it's standard price, and I bought it on the summer sale deal for $0.87.			"

												So the game hits on a lot of nostalgia for me.  With the very retro RPG look, and the handling of an old school adventure RPG, it's already got a lot going for it.The game play is basically a ""Run from the wall of death"" style game reminicent of old side scrollers, where if the Death Wall (the Darkness in this case) gets you, you die, while at the same time, all of your resources are limited and nothing is infinite.  This makes the game heavy on the two major elements of game play:  Risk/Reward and Resourse Management.  Do I want to venture into that dungeon?  Will I get more out of it then I use to go in?  Will I die?The other big element of gameplay is multiple play throughs.  You do a dimention, and either win or die.  All characters are ""one and done.""  On each subsequent play through, you make new characters, allowing you knowledge of what your characters are good and bad at, and giving you control over HOW you'll play each adventure.  After each adventure, you get points that you can use to unlock stronger abilities (perks), new classes, and expand the ""Dimentional Box"" which allows you to carry a limited number of items over to new adventures, or to merely store them for future difficult adventures.The final big element of the game is the randomly genereated dimentions.  Each play through you can go to a new random dimention (with differing base parameters), replay old dimentions (same base parameters but different world layout), or do any of the current special dimentions with descriptions of what's special about them.  Alternately, you can input dimention codes manually to have a similar experience as friends, to find dimentions that spawn things you might want (finding codes online), or just to do your own variety of random.Pros:- That price!- Lots of replay value- Enough customization options- Very rewarding gameplayCons:- Some dimentions can be surprisingly difficult even on the easiest mode- Can be grind intensiveTips:- I have a coveted ""Lumberjack Battleaxe"" which is just the best at breaking walls.- Nice easy dimention:  RVOFGTKI			"

												After quite a number of playthroughs, shoot, even before most of these playthroughs, I must say, this game is marvelous. So far the challenge is nice, it was pretty challenging up until I got to a certain point Potential spoilers ahead when I unlocked the Hero class, I just slapped all but one perks with pro wrestling and one with loyal pet, and just punch to win basically with some strategy. This game is SO WORTH THE PRICE, I honestly feel like it's a steal, I know it's under rpg maker and honestly.. I was not expecting this, it's simply amazing, at first few playthroughs the game is simply fun but there is more... much more inside this game, such as seeing the Demon Lord's true purpose, obtaining quirky teammates (I even at one point recruited a... Naughty Frieda, and she has some interesting things to say, not to mention I had a female character at the time), I just love how well this game was put together and all the neat little (not so little actually) things you can discover in this game that isn't.. well, swords, well, other than swords, engaging plot/characters in a roguelike? I haven't seen many, aside from Pokemon Mystery Dungeon (if you can call it a Roguelike, it retains some elements)I love roguelike games, and this is no exception, this went well above and beyond my expectations, and with a  $3.49 price tag? Dude it's a steal, I enjoy this more than Rogue Legacy, if you haven't even tried a roguelike before, just try this, it's amazing when you dig deeper into it.			"

												I went into One Way Heroics...not expecting too much. Rogue-likes were always difficult for me to grasp. And I am always weak at taking on the difficulty curve, however those expectations were quickly turned around though. It was great, not only that there's something about the...feel? of the game that really struck a chord with me, the...melancholic, joking, and sometimes self-sacrificing manner the chat, dialogue and text went about.One of the best things I can say about One Way Heroics though, is the relative simplicity of it compared to other Roguelikes. Personally, I always loved Roguelikes, but I could never really enjoy them due to the aforementioned rather crazy steep learning curve which I always had issues handling. However, One Way Heroics was easy, Simple goal, Simple controls. A truly magnificent experience. I am sorely tempted to rate it among the top of the games I played ^_^			"

												One Way Heroics satirizes the classic RPG genre with its 8-bit graphics and generic storyline. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to slay the evil Demon Lord and save King Viktor's kingdom from certain destruction. There are different modes/difficulties to choose from; from starting a quick adventure that lasts 400km to an epic adventure to the end of time and space. Gather allies, fight evil, kill innocent animals or fight the very people you sought to protect - nothing is impossible, besides maybe turning youself into a fish. With full steam achievement and trading card support there are plenty of reasons to play and have tons of fun while doing it. Happy Questing.			"

												To the team who made this game: I wish I could shake your hands. This is just great. Just great.Now, to the rest of the people, who want to know if they should buy the game. YES. DEFINITELY YES!The price is ridiculously low. I got this game by selling trading cards.The graphics are ""fine"". I don't know the engine this game was made on, but if I had to guess, I would say RPG Maker VX Ace (I use that engine for my works, and the graphics are pretty close) with a loooooot of custom scripting. Another reason this game is so good. A lot of work has been put on it, and I can see it.So yeah, the graphics. They match the gameplay perfectly and they don't ""try too hard"" to impress. They are pretty, they are simple and they are great.The music is pretty good too. Again, the music matches the gameplay and the whole atmosphere.The story. Well, WHICH one? I mean, every player, has their own experience. YOU choose your path. YOU choose what to do with the guy or girl you are controlling. YOU can go around and kill everyone. Or YOU can be the hero and kill the Demon Lord. And on top of all, it's Rogue-like. That means, that everytime you play, even if you try to do exactly the same things, you will have a different experience.This game has humor. When you ""socialize"" with your ""companion"", a smile on your face is guaranteed.The only thing that I kinda hoped I could change, is the speed the darkness advances. The speed is perfect, don't get me wrong, but I would love to mess around a bit.All in all, great game, I bought it for 0,74 euros and I would buy it even if it was 7 euros.			"

												One Way Heroics is a rogue-type constantly moving rpg. In short, it's a brilliant game for a lover of rpgs who also happens to be incredibly ADHD. I picked it up for in incredibly low price (less than a dollar!) and got way more than my money's worth. I would pay more for this game, if only I wasn't a cheap sonofagun.The game starts with a basic intro, then throws you right into character making. Not many choices for now, but after the first run (and death) it becomes obvious that there are many more classes, perks, and items to unlock.My first few runs were less than perfect. I found one chest out of thirty and didn't even make it 100km. I tried to esacpe from monsters by going into the mountains. HINT: Don't do that.But I was immediately hooked. I loved the looks, the AMAZING music, and I really wanted to beat the hell out of the enemies that were doing the same to me.I'll be playing this game very often. I give it a 9/10. "

												First of all, this game is unforgiving. If this statment puts a bad taste in your mouth, then this game is not for you. However, if what I just said doesn't bother you at all, then you just might have found a gem worth keeping. This game is a rougelike, so don't expect to have all the pieces of the puzzle when you first begin. (Google ""Rougelike"" if you don't know what that term means, trust me it helps.) Your first dozen (or few dozen, depending on your luck) playthroughs are more than likely going to end in failure, and the world will be doomed without you. However, as you discover strategies that work (and ones that don't) things will start to turn around. Still, odds are you will die more times than you will reach that happy ending. But that's the thing, the game doesn't stop at the ending. Multiple endings add to replay value, as do multiple objectives that you don't even know exist when the game begins. Add in the fact that worlds are randomly generated, and you will never have two playthroughs that are quite the same (aside from multiple deaths, as that is always a possibility).In short, this game will give you back everything that you put into it. If you don't give it a chance, you will have wasted your money. Fight through the first dozen deaths and learn from your mistakes, and this game will leave you addicted like it has done for me.			"

												After quite a number of playthroughs, shoot, even before most of these playthroughs, I must say, this game is marvelous. So far the challenge is nice, it was pretty challenging up until I got to a certain point Potential spoilers ahead when I unlocked the Hero class, I just slapped all but one perks with pro wrestling and one with loyal pet, and just punch to win basically with some strategy. This game is SO WORTH THE PRICE, I honestly feel like it's a steal, I know it's under rpg maker and honestly.. I was not expecting this, it's simply amazing, at first few playthroughs the game is simply fun but there is more... much more inside this game, such as seeing the Demon Lord's true purpose, obtaining quirky teammates (I even at one point recruited a... Naughty Frieda, and she has some interesting things to say, not to mention I had a female character at the time), I just love how well this game was put together and all the neat little (not so little actually) things you can discover in this game that isn't.. well, swords, well, other than swords, engaging plot/characters in a roguelike? I haven't seen many, aside from Pokemon Mystery Dungeon (if you can call it a Roguelike, it retains some elements)I love roguelike games, and this is no exception, this went well above and beyond my expectations, and with a  $3.49 price tag? Dude it's a steal, I enjoy this more than Rogue Legacy, if you haven't even tried a roguelike before, just try this, it's amazing when you dig deeper into it.			"

												This game is amazing. It's something that you can just pick up and play whenever you have a bit of free time. The replay value is infinite. You control a character that is running away from the darkness that is engulfing the world. Your goal is to slay the Demon Lord to stop the darkness. Everything in between is a massive fight to survive and power up so that you can actually stand up to the Demon Lord. There are millions of dimensions with different map configurations. You can make the game very difficult if you want a challenge or very easy if you want some quick achievements.Get this if you like old school RPG and RTS games. You won't regret it.For you achievement hunters out there, this is a fairly easy game to 100%. I did it in 21.4 hours but you can easily do it in less as I messed around alot.I have written a guide to help you unlock every achievement:

												So the game hits on a lot of nostalgia for me.  With the very retro RPG look, and the handling of an old school adventure RPG, it's already got a lot going for it.The game play is basically a ""Run from the wall of death"" style game reminicent of old side scrollers, where if the Death Wall (the Darkness in this case) gets you, you die, while at the same time, all of your resources are limited and nothing is infinite.  This makes the game heavy on the two major elements of game play:  Risk/Reward and Resourse Management.  Do I want to venture into that dungeon?  Will I get more out of it then I use to go in?  Will I die?The other big element of gameplay is multiple play throughs.  You do a dimention, and either win or die.  All characters are ""one and done.""  On each subsequent play through, you make new characters, allowing you knowledge of what your characters are good and bad at, and giving you control over HOW you'll play each adventure.  After each adventure, you get points that you can use to unlock stronger abilities (perks), new classes, and expand the ""Dimentional Box"" which allows you to carry a limited number of items over to new adventures, or to merely store them for future difficult adventures.The final big element of the game is the randomly genereated dimentions.  Each play through you can go to a new random dimention (with differing base parameters), replay old dimentions (same base parameters but different world layout), or do any of the current special dimentions with descriptions of what's special about them.  Alternately, you can input dimention codes manually to have a similar experience as friends, to find dimentions that spawn things you might want (finding codes online), or just to do your own variety of random.Pros:- That price!- Lots of replay value- Enough customization options- Very rewarding gameplayCons:- Some dimentions can be surprisingly difficult even on the easiest mode- Can be grind intensiveTips:- I have a coveted ""Lumberjack Battleaxe"" which is just the best at breaking walls.- Nice easy dimention:  RVOFGTKI			"

												This is an extremely engaging game with simple mechanics that work well for it. If you are a fan of JRPGs or loot snagging in general, you'll have a great time.Despite this being a procedurally generated roguelike game, it does manage to squeeze in some story and interesting characters. The unique bit is that, the generation is based off of whatever you want to type in. If you die in the dimension you entered if you want to revisit that dimension, the map generated will be the same (from what I've seen). This means that you can try to learn aspects of a specific dimension and plan around it. Don't worry about the random generation screwing you over too hard either. On each character run you are always given 15 free turns that you can use in bundles of 3 whenever you want. So if you see a long stretch of unavoidable mountains, you could in theory use all 15 turns to pass them if it was really that bad/unavoidable. The combat is simplistic, but deep enough that strategy actually matters since your positioning will often determine the outcome of a fight if more than one opponent is present. The game has a fair number of weapons and weapon types, some of which offer longer ranges and others which are really great at busting down terrain (Yes, you can break down walls of a house to talk to the people inside).If you love optimization, NPC party building, pretending you actually have friends or are just looking for a fun game with a wonderful soundtrack, I'd spend the 83 cents to play this. I believe the regular asking price is $3, which is more than fair. Had I not only found this thanks to the steam sale, I would have gladly paid the $3.			"

												I went into One Way Heroics...not expecting too much. Rogue-likes were always difficult for me to grasp. And I am always weak at taking on the difficulty curve, however those expectations were quickly turned around though. It was great, not only that there's something about the...feel? of the game that really struck a chord with me, the...melancholic, joking, and sometimes self-sacrificing manner the chat, dialogue and text went about.One of the best things I can say about One Way Heroics though, is the relative simplicity of it compared to other Roguelikes. Personally, I always loved Roguelikes, but I could never really enjoy them due to the aforementioned rather crazy steep learning curve which I always had issues handling. However, One Way Heroics was easy, Simple goal, Simple controls. A truly magnificent experience. I am sorely tempted to rate it among the top of the games I played ^_^			"

It's very much like an abandonware game I loved called Ragnarok, except they also threw in a side-scrolling mechanic which will influence your decisions. Thing is, the side scrolling darkness is fairly easy to get away from if you are clever, but if you aren't paying attention...game over man. My favorite part is the downloadable adventures that seem to change on some schedule and the mechanism that allows you to carry over equipment from a prior dead character into a new one. This was a steal at 3 bucks...and I' am addicted ;)			"

												Similar to Rogue Legacy with its ""continue with a new character but some stuff from your previous playthrough"" gimmick, this is a very good indie RPG. You can't plan and stay forever, because every step you make causes the Darkness to continue scrolling and eating the left side. Different classes, perks, and just customization of your character to your preferences. I've beaten the Demon Lord with the Swordsmaster, Knight, and Pirate already, and I am en route to beating him with the other classes, especially hero. The replay value of this game is amazing--just can't stop until the Demon Lord is dead. :)			"

												First things first, do you like Roguelikes? If so then this game is a very prospective find for your collection! It's a very perma death and turn based unforgiving type game but of course it has features that work around that kind of system, being able to bring items over from previous gameplays and also unlocking new classes and perks to make yourself stronger at the beginning. The pace it sets with the darkness constantly chasing you is very fresh as well because not only is it a roguelike game but it also has aspects of time management almost like Half Minute Hero, making gameplay have a much more frantic pace even though it's still turn based. Another thing that makes the game fun to play is the online features, it's always fun playing a game and knowing others are doing the same, the little pop in messages aren't disruptive at all and seeing how far other people are reaching and how many other people are failing is fun in it's own rights. Of course, it's got the sharing aspect from games like Minecraft and Starbound, you can share any of the worlds that have been generated by simply giving the world's code to friends and other people. All the worlds have their own little leaderboards too, with rankings and other things, you can even see how people went about their adventure. Also, you can actually get better at a world/dimension since it's layout never changes aside from random loot drops and events. Overall, while simplistic and a bit more on the hectic/rushed side, it's still pretty in depth, especially with the carryovers and whatnot, you can even grind items out to twink yourself up for the next run. As an ending note, don't expect to win early on unless you play on the easiest difficulty, losses are inevitable on this game as they are a part of it, take it in as it comes and build yourself up to become stronger to finally defeat the Demon Lord!

												Okay, One Way Heroics is not a normal RPG, not by any means. Sure, there are the usual suspects, such as stats, leveling, items, monsters and even a final boss. But that is where the similarities end. Each game is a race against the clock where the encroaching darkness at the left of the screen advances while your heroic character must scramble right in search of experience, items, gold and helpful npc's.Sound fun so far? It gets better, not only is the difficulty brutally hard and the classes vary in play style, but each world you play in is randomly determined at the start of a game. You can keep the names of these worlds and re-enter them to go back to the same world as before, yet even then the experiences are fresh enough to ensure replayability of the highest caliber.Like in Rogue Legacy, death is not the end of your efforts. Choosing a new class, and storing items in the dimensional vault makes the next game a little less harrowing if you choose. You can use the Hero points, awarded at the end of the game to unlock more classes and perks.That being said, I was not kidding when I mentioned the brutal difficulty. In addition to powerful enemies, you might not have the best equipment because merchants do not appear often and you might not have cash at hand then. Or they appear often, but sell basic articles. And if you find a legendary sword? Use it sparingly as all equipment has a lifebar of such, if it runs out they break. Unless you have awesome perks and have gained levels at a crazy rate you can't beat the Demon Lord naked and unarmed.In conclusion, this game is truly one that gives great bang for so few bucks. So get it!			"

												Let's keep this straightforward.Put simply, this game is a roguelike mixed with JRPG elements. It is a charming little game with unlockables, challenges, & leaderboards to keep the gameplay fresh. There are several difficulties, a handful of classes, and countless worlds to choose from, each with their own challenges, features, and obstacles to overcome. This adds up to a lot of content to play through, should you feel so inclined.With the price it's at, there's really no reason not to buy it.There's only one way this can go - will you do the right thing?

												When I first saw this on the store, my immediate reaction was ""Oh look some crappy RPG maker game. This is gonna suck"" and my second reaction was ""BUT IT'S ONLY $0.87 AND WITH A 96% POSITIVE RATING WHY NOT?!""This game is great. Incredibly addicting, very strategic, and insanely replayable. Easily my new favorite game. Belongs right up there with classics like Terraria, Binding of Isaac, and FTL. Definitely get this game. Buy a 20 pack.			"

												There's not much I can add that isn't on a dozen reviews already.  I got this game with a Humble Bundle, but it's easily worth the asking price and more.    You move through procedurally generated  worlds while trying not to get swallowed by the darkness (the left edge of the screen), picking up treasure and fighting monsters along the way.  With luck you will be strong enough to take on the demon lord.   But..there's more.  The demon lord can be a friend.  There are other people you can recruit, a number of unlockable classes, and a host of perks.  The real enemy is the darkness itself....I'm averaging about half an hour per playthrough so far.  There's enough here to keep your mind busy - thinking up strategies, and running around looting things without running out of time - but the game's not going to bog down either.As for replayability:  New dimensions, different classes, different endings?  This game has you covered.			"

												This light-hearted turn-based roguelike requires careful planning. Lots of replay as each playthrough gives you the opportunity to unlock additional abilities / classes, and you can stash loot into a shared vault even when you die. Similar to Cargo Commander, worlds are named by their seeds, so you can rank against friends by manually typing in the world name on a start (or similar.) It's, what, five dollars? Pick it up.			"

												This is truly wonderful game, easily better than some Triple A titles(in my opinion), and it is filled with many feels. It is generally simple, and at times it can be tense. The story itself is simple, as well with its gameplay and mechanics, but it is incredibly well done and thought out. At times it can be pretty easy, but can be extremely difficult. A great game for both; ones who want something simple and ones who look for a challenge. The generated worlds and rogue-like elements really add to it. Worth far more than it's standard price, and I bought it on the summer sale deal for $0.87.			"

I picked this up on a sale and honestly, I would say this game is worth it even at full price. I have 20+ hrs on this game and I haven't even finished it. I'm not sure if that's an indication of anything; maybe I'm just terrible at this game.

												Really fun game...Difficult is really enjoyable, leveling up to have a powerfull warrior (like lvl 300 or more) doesn't mean you can't die!The quests, features and new classes in the Plus version really worth the way... but the game seems a bit more balanced (more difficult) with it.The fact you can stock your previous gears in the dimentional storage for next games is kind of enjoyable (except for tourist that is not allowed ><)! You'll maybe die a few time before completing the game first, but keeping a few items from your previous game could make it way easier after!If you enjoy leveling up fast, playing a party for 1 to 2 hours to finish it... it's the stuff you need!

												It has some bugs, and it may be a little hard to get into at first, but once you understand the concept, it is really fun!The price is unbelievable, especially on sale. I'm not usually the kind of person who looks in their recommendations and randomly buys a game, but this is my genre, and less than one euro? Bought.The gameplay itself kinda reminds me of Pokemon Mystery Dungeon, but with a lot more RPG elements and... well... Darkness. Apart from that, it also has other unique elements like the dimensional vault or some of the abilities.I'm pretty sure I have never seen an ability before which makes my stats OP in exchange for my clothing. Artstyle is awesome too.And if you complain about missing content: Look at the price again. Or buy the DLC, like I did, which also makes the game easier too play with improved controls.I love it.

												I seriously enjoy this game. One of my favorite aspects of a randomly generated world is the fact that you're not going to see everything the first play through... Or the second play through... Or even the twenty-second! I still have not figured out how to recruit other party members during the journey, but I'm fine with that because I've been so preoccupied with discovering all the other things you can do with different classes.Speaking of classes, I normally hate class systems in an RPG. When you have to devote to one for the entire game and you're not even sure if it's your favorite because you haven't got to try the others yet. But in One Way Heroics, many runs are fairly short, so you can try every class that you like. Get a feel for all of them. Then play the one you feel like playing based on your mood. It's kind of like a fighter game in that aspect; you pick a character based on the kind of match you expect to have.Another great thing about the classes in One Way Heroics is the fact that they all have something unique and interesting to bring to the table. Each has a special skills, and each has regular skills that they perform better or with a bonus. It's balanced pretty well and it makes picking a favorite for your style of play easy.The variety of items is the last good point I'd like to touch on. One thing I almost always start out with is increased inventory ability, because I love picking up as many items as I can and using them effectively. One Way Heroics exhibits great balance between character stats and the necessity for equipment. You can make your character strong, sure, but if you don't find a rare and powerful weapon or some really good armor, you're going to be running from the demon lord many times before you can hope to fight him.The one down side to this game I'll mention is the character design. The artwork is a little sloppy looking, though charming in it's own way, and the character dialog, while funny at first, is a little lacking in terms of variety. Well. during gameplay anyway--Dialog is actually pretty good during cut scenes, as I am hit with something new almost every new game and end game. Finally characters feel a little flat. Even though the after story of you and the fairy continuing your journey after the world is saved is rather touching, it feels awkward because I don't really feel connected to the characters. They're too generic, but then, maybe that was intended.All in all, great game. 9/10(This is my first review, so I haven't developed any kind of coherent style.)			"

												An addicting kind-of-roguelike that has a neat feature where the endgame boss will show up periodically to try and mess you up. Using meta knowledge and a bit of luck with items and attacks, you can actually skill the end boss down really fast if you're good.Eventually the boss leaves after so many turns of running, has a bunch of different classes that (poorly enough) need to be unlocked.Short, sweet, and some replayability, but once you hit a certain level of meta knowledge and beat it a few times it gets stale.

												This is a gem of a game that I picked up for $.87, would've paid full price in hindsight. The simple concept, the execution in a rougelike randomly* generated rpg world-- and it all comes together wonderfully in whatever way you want it to. A quick, leisurely stroll into a final boss confrontation that might end with a little cheeky grin? Aye, not too hard to play your cards that way on easymode after you test the game dynamics in a few runs. Something a little more intensive and nervewracking for that character you've grown fond of as they developed? You can have that too. Layer on top the rotating special worlds you can select and the game has fantastic replayability that more than outweighs the meagre price.9/10. Gave me everything I wanted out of the title and more.			"

												One Way Heroics is a Mystery Dungeon-style roguelike (that is, similar to Pokemon Mystery Dungeon, Chocobo's Dungeon, Shiren, Izuna, etc) with an open world that constantly scrolls to the right, meaning you have limited time to spend in each place and you have to keep moving forward to avoid death by screen edge.Gameplay is standard Mystery Dungeon-style roguelike fare; you have an attack button, inventory with weight limit, three pieces of equipment, some basic stats, everything is turn-based, the usual stuff. Unlike other Mystery Dungeons the world is open (though you can't go back, obviously) with mini-towns and dungeons spread throughout the map. Objective of the game is to level up and get good items to defeat the Demon Lord.Items can be passed to future characters after your run, and you get a score in points which you can use to unlock classes, unlock perks or expand your item storage. Character creation is limited to picking a class and a bunch of simple perks. Various difficulty levels, and a 'Maniac mode' makes the game harder by disabling the item storage. Unfortunately there are perma-saves with no mode for a no-save run; not saving is entirely optional and only gets you a few extra points.Definitely worth it for the really low price.			"

												Pure genius.  One Way Heroics is probably one of the better indie games this year that you won't hear about.If you enjoy generated games or the old school sprite RPG's, get this, get it now.The game-play is pseudo-turn-based where every time the player performs an action, the game world will iterate as well.Pros: Excellent replay value. Nice sprite visuals Fun, Simple gameplay: Run right, adventure, fight or flee from a large variety of monsters, search for supplies. Visit towns and talk to NPCS. Do all of the above while impending doom is always advancing towards you. Due to generated content, you never know what you'll encounter.  Each new adventure has its surprises. Lots of secrets to uncover. Works with gamepads other than the Xbox360 Controller. Able to carry some equipment over to a new adventure.Cons: None.  Although you need to come into this game expecting to replay it repeatedly to really get anything out of it.  Not a traditional linear RPG at all.One of my favorite indie games for 2014. "

												This game is far-worth the less-than-1$ I've spent on it, to get as much time as I've had out of it all in one sitting...The entire urgency feeling that ""the darkness"" puts upon you is one of (if not -the-) game's defining factor(s).You end up weighing in how much loot you can drag with you, what loot to drag with you, what items to keep on you, what stats to raise at an altar (because you want to carry more items right? RIGHTT??!?), how far you can even get through a dungeon before it becomes too risky, what monsters you should engage (is that lizard behind that chest a noob? or will he kill me in 2 hits right after i open this treasure chest...), how you should play your class (focus characters are a total pain in the♥♥♥♥♥..even though I killed the final boss in only 3 hits, as opposed to 100...total pain-in-the♥♥♥♥♥), what class to play after you've tried them all (heck, I've JUST tried them all...they're all unique enough to want a bit of each of them, even though the first two are quite similar).Its just a total cluster♥♥♥♥ of choices put upon you, all because of the timed factor...I'm ashamed to say I don't even know what some of the stats even DO I've been so sucked into playing the game and not worrying about it...If that sounds too stressful for you, don't worry, it isnt, the game doesn't take itself too seriously, with cutesy anime graphics everywhere, and your hilarious little fairy companion that you might get a dialogue prompt asking to 'equip' (lol!). The first difficulty is cakewalk anyways...you could practically travel all the way to the demon lord (the final boss) without picking up a single item, or leveling up at all, and still beat him if you were careful enough. That doesn't mean it isn't fun as heck to play, since the further you go the harder the game gets, but you get to choose if you go just as far as you need to to finish, or if you push on to get better gear for the final battle...CHOICES! :pHavn't played anything like this before, probably won't find another chance to...That, and, with the time I've had right now (7hrs) I've only scratched the surface, beating the game once with each character on only the easiest difficulty!

												A cute game that satisfied all my expectations!But~ expect a rigid story and you'll be disappointed as the story is rogue-like as is the gameplay. Although this also means that there is room to tell your own tale in the adventures that will be had.The difficulty is hard from the get go, and you'll take risks along the way to level up- Being too careful will hinder your level from rising, but barging in to a fight expecting to win will usually not end well!So you will have to take use of the turn-based system to plan a strategy. But! Is there enough time for a rigid strategy as the world is swallowed up behind you? (each turn) -That is for you to adapt to as you discover this ever changing landscape.-Good-About the turn-based system, keep in mind it goes as fast as you want it to. You can run just as in any overview-2d game. But when you stop, everything else stops. This makes it both exhilarating but calming at the same time to me!Want to compete with other players? You can play the very same world (not simultaneously) and check leaderboards for whom performed the best in a variety of aspects such as leveling and treasure hunting etc-.And lest forget the character art, they have a charming manga-illustration kind of look which takes me back Final Fantasy IV.-Cons-Not a variety of tile texture- Since you'll find yourself writing a story to complement the lack of complete story, a larger variety of landscapes to inspire our minds would be nice. Also weather and lightning effects would be welcome.No simultaneous multiplayer (just leaderboards). If the creators got an idea for how to implement multiplayer but still hold this fast-paced turn-based system, i could potentially see how that'd make for a sequel with great promise! But that's just me. (^^)Okay! Get to the adventure! :3楽しんでくださいね！			"

												To the team who made this game: I wish I could shake your hands. This is just great. Just great.Now, to the rest of the people, who want to know if they should buy the game. YES. DEFINITELY YES!The price is ridiculously low. I got this game by selling trading cards.The graphics are ""fine"". I don't know the engine this game was made on, but if I had to guess, I would say RPG Maker VX Ace (I use that engine for my works, and the graphics are pretty close) with a loooooot of custom scripting. Another reason this game is so good. A lot of work has been put on it, and I can see it.So yeah, the graphics. They match the gameplay perfectly and they don't ""try too hard"" to impress. They are pretty, they are simple and they are great.The music is pretty good too. Again, the music matches the gameplay and the whole atmosphere.The story. Well, WHICH one? I mean, every player, has their own experience. YOU choose your path. YOU choose what to do with the guy or girl you are controlling. YOU can go around and kill everyone. Or YOU can be the hero and kill the Demon Lord. And on top of all, it's Rogue-like. That means, that everytime you play, even if you try to do exactly the same things, you will have a different experience.This game has humor. When you ""socialize"" with your ""companion"", a smile on your face is guaranteed.The only thing that I kinda hoped I could change, is the speed the darkness advances. The speed is perfect, don't get me wrong, but I would love to mess around a bit.All in all, great game, I bought it for 0,74 euros and I would buy it even if it was 7 euros.			"

												One Way Heroics satirizes the classic RPG genre with its 8-bit graphics and generic storyline. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to slay the evil Demon Lord and save King Viktor's kingdom from certain destruction. There are different modes/difficulties to choose from; from starting a quick adventure that lasts 400km to an epic adventure to the end of time and space. Gather allies, fight evil, kill innocent animals or fight the very people you sought to protect - nothing is impossible, besides maybe turning youself into a fish. With full steam achievement and trading card support there are plenty of reasons to play and have tons of fun while doing it. Happy Questing.			"

												I managed to snag this game for one dollar, and even at it's worst it is a couple bucks. And quite frankly it feels like I'm robbing the developers. I've been pretty hooked the last few days on it and expect to push through until I get full completion.It is a rogue-like game, meaning that it has perma death and randomly generated worlds. You make a character, you pick from some classes and perks, and you push that character as far as it can go. A darkness on the left side of the screen keeps you moving ever forward in your attempt to get as much gear and power before your inevitable death or the death of the endboss. When you die, you gain some points that you can use to unlock more bonuses to choose from and slowly amass a constant storage between characters so you can save some epic items.There is no real multiplayer other than a Dark Souls-like feature where you encounter the ghosts of players on the same server that benefit you slightly and that you can compete with. The sound is cute and retro, nothing astounding. The visuals are about Final Fantasy 1 quality but are pretty enough to get you through. The gameplay really hooks me. For some people, you will spend many hours through many characters striving to do better and unlock everything. For others, you'll play for an hour or two. And for the price you pay, you really can't go wrong.			"

												=HEADS UP=I had a review before this one about the game being good. This stays of course but i had to clarify some points and fix this old messy review that i made before.=INFO ABOUT THE REVIEW=1. My reviews tend to be a bit longer. If that is the case please be patient and read everything.2. This review is about my point of view and opinion. [If you disagree on a certain point or want to correct me: Be reasonable or i will ignore your comment.]3. If you want to try to change my opinion with arguments that make no sense in any way then please do not comment at all.=REVIEW=Now what can i say about this game? That it is worth the money. It is a small game with only one purpose for you. Go forth and kill stuff. But there is a twist to it. The World is ending and you are the legendary hero to venture out and try to get ahead of what is coming after you to kill you. And what is that right behind you? Pure Darkness.This game leads in a certain direction and that one is Right. You go as far as you can get to meet at the end the Bad guy to stop the End of the World. But that is not an easy task. Even though this game is semi roguelike you wont have that much trouble with it like other roguelike games. Over the time of you playing you will die. But everytime you can transfer items into a little box that is between the dimensions. And as soon as you visit a new world you can decide if you want to take it with you or not. This makes the game a bit more enjoyable and easier for you. But in the end it depends on you how it ends.The game brings you into a randomly generated world. Here will the Adventure begin and here you can do whatever you want. Go on and kill some bad guys. You are the Hero. Go into the Taverns and buy gear and let the people help you. Or just kill them and their guards. That is right. You are allowed to do everything you want. Kill, destroy and so on and so forth. But there is a nice twist to it. If you are the great Hero you are able to find people that want to help you defeating the bad guy. And since everyone trusts you they will not attack you when seeing you. If you do attack other people though the game will punish you. The word goes around very fast and in other inns or taverns the guards will recognize you for what you did and will try to kill you. But not only the guards will turn aggressive but also the other people.So it is up to you what will happen in the game. At the very end it is the bad guy who you want to kill. But it depends on you how easy or hard this may be.			"

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a RPG Rogue-like game.Interface/Menu/SettingsThere are some settings before the launch. at Config. You can choose if you want to play on a high pc/medium pc or a low end pc. (you can change during the game by pressing F5).There is 3D mode and software mode. Software mode is better for low end pc.There is a Sound volume slidebar and it is marked with bars.There is a music volume slidebar and it is marked with bars.Pressing F10 will make it fullscreen. Pressing it again will make it windowed.You can play with a controller.About the game.You are playing a hero that has to defeat the evil. You can choose between a class and a perk. Each with their own effect and attritbutes. Each step that you take will bring you closer to the evil. But the game is side-scrolling and everything on the left is ""destroyed"" and you are forced to keep walking to the right. Whenever the screen has catched up, you will die. Every step, Every move, Every action that you will do, will bring the left side of the screen closer to you. You have to kill enemies to get experience to level up and finding loot to make your character stronger. Once you have finished a run, you will get points at the end of the level which will help you on the next run. (once you have spend it ofcourse).Game has very good music.Gameplay is fun but a bit repetitive.Graphics is decent.The game is fun but at some parts tricky too.There are different save slots.Other things.Let's Try Video:

												Welp, if you're a fan of either RTS or Rouge-likes, this game is for you. Scratch that, this game is for anybody! Its really entertaining, espically the characters and dialouge. The combat is fairly average, at first! Firstly you have a sword, you target with shift and press space. Then you find out you can break blocks a'la'Minecraft. Then you get a shield AND sword! And then you realize you have special moves! And then you realize they take up energy/stamina! And then you die. :P  Like that, the game is very in-depth about multiple things, and, like many rouge-lites, you will die. But I swear, this game is the Dark Souls of RTS.  Now, the only bad thing about the game is that due to the impending wall of black death, you never really get the chance to explore dungeons, so they'll just be part of the scenery in most laythroughs. Also, some the terrain generation can be kinda weird, causing mountains to spawn and impede you, thus killing you because you couldn't move in time because of the darkness. These instances are both rare however, and can be overlooked for the sheer joy of this game.Epic Game, buy it now since its on sale, and I can promise you it'll be a blast.			"

												Very clever use of scrolling. The game is based upon the idea that darkness is taking over the world so you have to constantly move forward or else you die. There are RPG elements that allows you to get stronger as well as a nice level of exploration. There a several classes you can unlock that slightly alters the gameplay.This game is highly addicting. The replay value is amazing because every time, you can generate a new world to experience something new everytime.			"

												For a game that regularly goes on sale for less than a dollar, it's absolutely amazing, the dlc for the game, while making the game harder, adds so much convenience to the interface. Now for the breakdownMusic The music is never really downbeat, though there are times when it's calmed down. It tends to pick up to a rousing adventure theme when combat really begins to happen The music in towns is really calming, to the point that I've just sat in towns listening to the music playing I tend to reccomend listening to the music of any game prior to purchase though, and there's an awesome playlist on youtube containing all of the music from the game.Interface The interface in the base game is kind of unintuitive, with the keys being used as follows: R T W A S D Ctrl Shift There might have been more, but either never needed them, or they just didn't come up. The intro menu here is really simple, but the opportunity to rerun a map you like just because you remember its seed is awesome, but there's not much that's all that interesting in the intro menu. The in-game menus are interesting, but I do have just one issue in that you can ""use"" a bomb, by which I mean it will just explode on you. I don't know why this is an option but I accidently use the bomb instead of throwing it more often than I'd like to admit. But beyond the occasional issue with that, the menus are easy to understand, just getting into it the first time is a bit interesting. The interface in the expansion is much more compact with the numbers on the keyboard being used for quick acess inventory slots. The rest of the keys are: Z X C V Shift Ctrl W A S D or the arrowsThe expansion makes the menus even easier to use, as well as picking up dropped items.Gameplay It's a Turn based roguelike with the opportunity to overcome every map that I've come across, though it may take several attempts to do so.The combat is really intuitive, where the combination of shift and direction makes aiming easy, and there's only one attack button, which allows you to really take advantage of the turn-based global interaction.It is possible to get all pooped on by the spawning of the enemies, or even by travelling to the wrong bit of the map and getting stuck behind a wall of mountains, but so far, I've had only a couple of instances where this happened. My complaints here are really just twofold, with the first one being the bomb issue. There's a number of games I lost because of that, but it's my fault. The other is how slow the game can be on the longer runs, but the expansion allows the speeding up of movement so I no longer have this issue.StoryNope. not telling you. If you want to find out, do so yourself.It is a compelling story found out through gameplay if done correctly though.Really, as a quick sum up of all that: the game is really well put together and the expansion just tightens some controls and adds to the game as a whole. I spent $7 on this and as you can see I've put in 40-ish hours into it. I love it, and it's something that, if you like the gameplay, you'll love the game. If you don't like the aesthetics and or the gameplay, you won't really feel bad about it because you've probably spent more money on worse games.Enjoy! I did.			"

												One Way Heroics is a 2D overhead rogue-like game where you're constantly escaping from an ever encroaching black mist coming from the left. If the mist catches up to you, or you die then it's completely game over and you start again while given the option to retain some of the items from this run, unlocking various new features classes and goodies along the way.The game, at first, gives you a constant drive to play. The classes seem interesting and relatively varied and unlocking new skills, classes, and goodies in general is a fun. The interface and visuals are basic but well fleshed out and feel great, giving a bit of nostalgia to the 8-bit era of games like Dragon Quest Warrior. However, the issues with the game become apparent after the honeymoon period wears off.The first of two major issues is the most unique aspect of the game - the darkness. The darkness was undoubtedly designed to create a sort of pacing and pressure, and at first it does. But once you become accustomed to the pacing of the game all it really does is discourage exploration. So long as you don't explore you'll never run into any problems with the darkness. But I happen to enjoy exploring!The second is in the balance of the game. I think the best way to illustrate this is with one particularly absurd example. The main villain in the game is the demon lord. He'll occasionally fly in and you're supposed to wack at him a bit, constantly denting his hp a bit, until he flies away only to come back again. Rince, wash, repeat, until he's dead and the credits roll. One major strength of his is in shields - each time he appears, he has up to 45 layers of shields that need to be removed before you can even start damaging him. With a mellee class that might do just a few hits per turn at most while he's pounding on you with all he has - this is a big problem. For a mage class? Well for some reason their attacks go right through the shields. On the hardest difficultly level in the game, I defeated him the first time he appeared by just zapping him a few time with the weakest attack the mage has boosted by a pretty generic staff and beat him the first time he appeared - achieving consistent victory on the max difficulty in about 15 minutes. Pretty anticlimatic for a roguelike. This isn't a game you'll be spending hundreds and probably not even tens of hours on, but for a fun 10 or 20 hour romp it's an enjoyable experience.			"

												One Way Heroics is a simple rogue-like with a lot of character. The worlds are randomly generated and randomly populated, so each play through is different. The difficulty is moderate, and each run through a campaign yields points that can be used for upgrades, making subsequent runs easier. OWH keeps a large record of all sorts of statistics and completionists will find plenty of stuff to do in order to fill out the statistics screen.OWH includes all sorts of endings and random events within the worlds. Every supporting character has their own interesting stories, and discovering the whole story behind the game across multiple playthroughs an interesting approach to narrative. It also has a fantastic soundtrack.The DLC is a great addition and adds a fair bit of content and replayabilitiy, though the base game still feels complete enough to have provided me dozens of hours of play. The game is flexible enough where you can do a short 15 minute run or a several hour long journey, if you wish. At the asking price, One Way Heroics is more than worth it, and is my favorite rogue-like on Steam. I cannot recommend this game enough.			"

												One Way Heroics is an auto-scrolling rogue-like. As you move about and act in the game, the screen will slowly moves to the right - and should it reach your character it will devour you in darkness..... The goal of the game is essentially all about keeping ahead of the encroaching darkness as you travel across various lands. You get stronger, collecting items and leveling up, stop in settlements (before they can consumed by darkness) and eventually you will battle across the lands against the Demon Lord behind it all!And... that's it. The vanilla game is a cheap game after all and the DLC you get adds in a good deal more content to improve the gaming experience. Without it, you'll get a nice taste of what the gameplay is all about though it will feel somewhat lacking quite quickly.Notably though you can buy the game and its DLC for a fairly cheap price bundled together. Also, keep in mind that you may want to keep and eye out for Mystery Chronicle: One Way Heroics; which is a sequel to this game.			"

												Short answer: Reccomended for completionists, peopel who love NG+, and achievement hunters. If you like to complete a game and put it away, your experience may be lacking.This review is somewhat late, as I beat it several months ago. It only took me about 4-6 playthroughs if I remember right. I think I only unlocked 2 additional classes and barely any of the other content, as I was able to ""win"" through the luck of the RNG. I am someone who does not mind restarting games over and over due to dying and learning, but I can't say I like replaying a game once I've beat it.One Way Heroics has fairly standard roguelike combat which I got the hang of fairly easily having played other games. The darkness adds an additional layer to this, almost making it like chess - you have to be able to plan your moves several steps ahead, taking into account each enemy's movement speed, movement patterns, item locations, and whether you might get trapped by the terrain. This can all be done fairly rapidly in most areas outside towns and dungeons. The game, being a rogelike, has a decent amount of teaching through experience and playthroughs.The big big big gripe I have with the game, and is the primary reason I wish I could give a ""mixed"" rating? I managed to kill the dark lord before I think I should have been able to. I discovered one of the special artifact items and managed to fight him inside a town. Just a single artifact, my level wasn't that high. I truly expected him to be harder. Then I expected that to not be all and for the devs to pull a ""Disc 1 final boss"" on me. But no, the Big Bad of the game can be defeated by simply holeing up in an inn with a single artifact weapon and blowing all your items and special abilities.  I had no longer felt a real desire to play it afterwards.However, this is my personal taste. While I find the idea of NG+ and completing a game many many times fairly dull (in most cases) for those people who DO like that sort of gameplay, this is a decent offering. I didn't encounter many, if any bugs in my playing, and the visuals are uniformly presented with nothing that seemed out of place. Worth the money for that kind of player, and having gotten it on sale and with the addition of trading cards I can't say it wasn't worth the 69 cents I paid for it, if not more.			"

												So, I picked this game up for under a dollar, not really expecting much. And I can fairly say that this is one of the best RPGS that you can pick up on steam. Interestingly enough, it's a top down perspective sidescroller. You can travel in all directions, but must continue on towards the right, for an ever-moving darkness is coming from the left, which kills on contact. Which randomly generated worlds, as well as 'challenge worlds', it has quite a bit of replay value. Very much worth picking up.			"

												It has been fun to pick this one up  and play it for about 20-30 minutes at a time.  Whether that means 5 deaths, or ""beating"" the game (i've only done it in the most obvious way a few times) plus a death or two, it tends to hold the same amount of fun for me.  I appreciate the way that the difficulties are ramped, as well as the increased difficulty for certain maps given as options during new game selection.  Only thing that I haven't had a chance to read up on, is why the game is built with old squarish monitor ratios.  Screen is very busy with all of the stats on screen, but I got used to it rather quickly.			"

												Even if I had paid full price for this, I would still recommend this game. Its a quick to play roguelike game that is easy to jump in to and play and can be difficult to master, although being that its a roguelike still means that there is an element to randomness so that even if you feel you have the hang of it you can be thrown a curve ball and knocked out.In addition to the roguelike nature of it, there is some perma elements, such as unlocking new classes to be played in next playthroughs as well as a stash that allows you to store good items for next playthroughs.Overall for the cost, whether you get it on sale or not, definitely a recommend and I definitely wish more games were as easy to jump into and have fun as this game.

												A simple but fun roguelike that keeps you moving forward (pun intended) with its constantly moving landscape.  While hardcore roguelike players may find withselves wanting and/or dislike the forced progression gimmick, there's enough content and difficulty to play through for intermediate and beginner roguelike players to easily get your money and enjoyment out of.

												Great for quick sessions, surprising depth of play, multiple classes, a cool unlock system based on Hero Points for each run, rogue-like (perma-death), a vault for item transfer between plays, cool boss battle, and not too hard for newies to the type to get into. Seriously, A+ and an absolute STEAL at the price.			"

												This is an interesting and fun rougelike RPG. It has tons of replayability with the classes, worlds, and difficulties, and you can either play it as a normal rougelike with permadeath and fresh starts or more like a normal RPG by continuing from your saved games (although it doesn't really count the game then) or by improving yourself with the dimensional vault. It could use some more perks and classes and stuff, but either way, it's a a very fun game, especially for the price.			"

												Have you ever gotten a game for sale price and after playing it, you feel like you'd have been satisfied with the value even if you paid full price? For me, One Way Heroics is that, except I'd feel happy paying more than sale price.One Way Heroics is a rouge-like game kinda like a Mystery Dungeon game, except you're not stuck in a dungeon and have a randomly generated world to explore. Except with one twist: There's Darkness to the left. And it endlessly creeps up on you. And if you fall in it, you're dead! So you're stuck going to the right. And there's monsters out there, too, so remain on guard! Of course, there's helpful stuff out there, too!One Way Heroics is kinda tough at first, but it gets easier as you go along, unlock classes, and generally get an idea of what to do. And it's alright if you mess up after you got some cool item, because after you die or clear you game, you're allowed to put items into the Dimensional Vault, to use them on another run. You've got limited space, though, so until you're heroic enough to expand it, watch how you use it!I had a lot of fun with this game, and I only spent 87 cents on it! So it's a definite recommendation from me.			"

One of the best and most addictive indie rogue-like RPGs I ever played.Personally this is my favorite!Unique idea of going ""One Way"" to the right of the screen, without turning back or you will be consumed by the ""Darkness"" and die. The goal is to defeat the ""Demon Lord"", defeat the ""Darkness Dragon"" or reach the ""End of the World"" at 2000 kilometers.Many different and exciting quests/endings along with strong storytellingVarious difficulty settings and random map generation, which increases the replay valueIt has perma-death, but you can still save your gamePick up and deposit items from other playthroughs (dimensional vault)Lots of items, classes, perks and NPCs to unlockLeveling up system including different affected statssimple fast paced/turn-based combat and class specific skillsLots of depth, still simple and quick learning curveJ-RPG menus & comedytowns with merchants and other NPCsdungeons with monsters and lootonline feature which shows other players current progression in their world (live)online events/quests with specific rules, which change every daymanually input seed to replay a worldNice Anime ""RPG-Maker""-like graphics. If it´s made by RPG-Maker, I would say it´s the most possible content you can get out of that engine, so far.Great fitting soundtrack :)Highly recommended and totally worth the money =P  "

												I bought this game not expecting too much for the price tag *insert subliminal buy now message*. Maybe a couple of hours fun or an atrasfomany like so many others. You know? The type of game where you take a break from a big game just to break the pace a bit? It has that quality sure. But never did I expect the amount of content, replayability and just plain fun I have had with this game so far. I haven't even tried out harder difficulties and many of the classes I have yet to unlock! I'll tell you about some time spent in game.I played this a bit on my own and a friend said it looked interesting. So I got it for him...the price is too good *insert subliminal buy now message* and Smoking Wolf deserves it for the excellent work!This game isn't co-op but we chose the same map to kinda compete and help each other out. We got into the same map. A nice, easy, stroll in the park difficulty map for his first time. He chose the Swordmaster class and I choose the Force user. Me being all experienced from my 2-3 hours game time, ran off looking for treasures, things to kill and xp. While happily one shotting every thing (first time Force user class...dayum) he asks some questions about the mechanics, the tutorial isn't great but you can figure most things out.I run into a Carzy Dragon knight, or something simliar, whom I one shot with glee because these guys are tough and I've died to them many times! Meanwhile my friend runs around, way behind, having a grand time. Some time passes.Suddenly he yells: ""Oh **** that guy just killed me!""Me: ""What? Who killed you?""Him: ""Some guy in a building! What the hell!? He just killed me in one hit!"" Me: ""Huh? Where? All these creeps are pretty basic. Noob! Thought you had this old gamer style!? Hahahahaha!"" We pride ourselves on being born gamers (another way of saying we are getting old), because we do well or above average in most games, having played games since the first Commodores. So if a game is hard or we fail our pride takes quite a hit.Him: ""Some green dude in building with chests. What the ****!? Such BS...""Realization dawns. Fail friend...Me: ""Hahahahaa! Sorry dude forgot to tell you those green dragon knight guys are very tough! I had no problem. Just one shot them muehehehehehe.""With his fail run of the map he somehow managed to unlock the Adventurer class and decides to try it out on the same map.Him: ""Ok so screw that place, Ima go ova mere."" Apologies...he actually talks like that.Him: ""OMF A ****ING BEAR!""NOOO!!""Me: ""Hahaahhaa a bear!? What the hell man, you have the worste luck!""Him: ""Noooo! He has friends!! They're chasing meeeee! They're chasing meeeeee!!! Aahhhh!""Just rofling at his attempts to run away from the killer bears. He dies horribly gain.Him: ""**** those bears. I'm gonna get them.""Me: ""Dude bears are sick, we don't even have gear or levels to kill them, just go take another route.""Him: ""Nah **** that. Them bears are going down!""Me: ""Psh, good luck fool.""He restarts.Him: ""Ok they're coming for me, gonna lead them to these guards.""Me: ""Could work, maybe.""im: ""Shweet! The guards did all the work for me! See I told you I'd get those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s!""Me: ""Nice one. Now you can finally catch up. Sheesh you suck! You've only gone like 20km all this time. I'm almost to the Demon Lord."" Him: ""Oh my sweet cheesus balls...""Me: ""More bears?""Him: ""Duuuuuuude...""Me: ""What?""Him: ""Duuuuuuude...""Me: ""WHAT?!""Him: ""Duuuuuuude...I just picked up a Godslaying longsword....""Me: ""What the ****!? Where?"" <----already turning jelly.Him: ""From a Feral Dog! Hahaha! I just killed it and it dropped this! It has X and Y and OMFG check this Z out""Me: ""...""  -.-Him: ""Omg this thing is ridiculous! ###dmg in one hit!

												One Way Heroics is a game about valiantly trying to navigate the confusing and deadly maze of one way streets that make up Perth, Australia. As such, it is an exceedingly difficult and frustrating game.I give it four kangaroos out of a billabong.			"

												I bought this game not expecting too much for the price tag *insert subliminal buy now message*. Maybe a couple of hours fun or an atrasfomany like so many others. You know? The type of game where you take a break from a big game just to break the pace a bit? It has that quality sure. But never did I expect the amount of content, replayability and just plain fun I have had with this game so far. I haven't even tried out harder difficulties and many of the classes I have yet to unlock! I'll tell you about some time spent in game.I played this a bit on my own and a friend said it looked interesting. So I got it for him...the price is too good *insert subliminal buy now message* and Smoking Wolf deserves it for the excellent work!This game isn't co-op but we chose the same map to kinda compete and help each other out. We got into the same map. A nice, easy, stroll in the park difficulty map for his first time. He chose the Swordmaster class and I choose the Force user. Me being all experienced from my 2-3 hours game time, ran off looking for treasures, things to kill and xp. While happily one shotting every thing (first time Force user class...dayum) he asks some questions about the mechanics, the tutorial isn't great but you can figure most things out.I run into a Carzy Dragon knight, or something simliar, whom I one shot with glee because these guys are tough and I've died to them many times! Meanwhile my friend runs around, way behind, having a grand time. Some time passes.Suddenly he yells: ""Oh **** that guy just killed me!""Me: ""What? Who killed you?""Him: ""Some guy in a building! What the hell!? He just killed me in one hit!"" Me: ""Huh? Where? All these creeps are pretty basic. Noob! Thought you had this old gamer style!? Hahahahaha!"" We pride ourselves on being born gamers (another way of saying we are getting old), because we do well or above average in most games, having played games since the first Commodores. So if a game is hard or we fail our pride takes quite a hit.Him: ""Some green dude in building with chests. What the ****!? Such BS...""Realization dawns. Fail friend...Me: ""Hahahahaa! Sorry dude forgot to tell you those green dragon knight guys are very tough! I had no problem. Just one shot them muehehehehehe.""With his fail run of the map he somehow managed to unlock the Adventurer class and decides to try it out on the same map.Him: ""Ok so screw that place, Ima go ova mere."" Apologies...he actually talks like that.Him: ""OMF A ****ING BEAR!""NOOO!!""Me: ""Hahaahhaa a bear!? What the hell man, you have the worste luck!""Him: ""Noooo! He has friends!! They're chasing meeeee! They're chasing meeeeee!!! Aahhhh!""Just rofling at his attempts to run away from the killer bears. He dies horribly gain.Him: ""**** those bears. I'm gonna get them.""Me: ""Dude bears are sick, we don't even have gear or levels to kill them, just go take another route.""Him: ""Nah **** that. Them bears are going down!""Me: ""Psh, good luck fool.""He restarts.Him: ""Ok they're coming for me, gonna lead them to these guards.""Me: ""Could work, maybe.""im: ""Shweet! The guards did all the work for me! See I told you I'd get those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s!""Me: ""Nice one. Now you can finally catch up. Sheesh you suck! You've only gone like 20km all this time. I'm almost to the Demon Lord."" Him: ""Oh my sweet cheesus balls...""Me: ""More bears?""Him: ""Duuuuuuude...""Me: ""What?""Him: ""Duuuuuuude...""Me: ""WHAT?!""Him: ""Duuuuuuude...I just picked up a Godslaying longsword....""Me: ""What the ****!? Where?"" <----already turning jelly.Him: ""From a Feral Dog! Hahaha! I just killed it and it dropped this! It has X and Y and OMFG check this Z out""Me: ""...""  -.-Him: ""Omg this thing is ridiculous! ###dmg in one hit! Gib, hahahahahah...gib, hahahahahaha!""Me: ""How the **** does that drop from a dog!?"" all jelly now, and greedy.Him: ""I dunno. You're s'posed to be the expert...gib, hahahahahaha!""Me: ""..."" full of jelly and careless.Me: ""**** I just died trying to open a stupid chest.""Him: ""The darkness?""Me: ""Yes the darkness.""Him: ""Noob.

												The game's great and very, very unique, but there's some serious UI / HUD issues that need addressing. The game's super cluttered with a lot of unnecessary junk and the menus are so hard to follow. There are definitely ways to make this game look more charming and polished while still keeping that old-school 8-bit feel that they're going for. It makes it way, way, WAY too hard for new players to follow and is actually really off-putting. I had a lot of fun with playing the game, but the whole time I just couldn't overlook those two things due to just how annoying they were. Move the life and energy bars to the top corner, give them nice little borders, get rid of a lot of the unnecessary information like.. ""Made it to x place!"" and instead, just have a little notification pop up above your character when you're in game to say ""You've reached x place!"". There's a lot of junk that can be moved around or removed to open up the game and make it look nicer. The fact that there's a watermark in the top corner for the music creator is just absurd. Put that crap in the menu, NOT in game. Also, give the same treatment to the menus. Clean them up and make things easier to understand for new players. Once that's done, the game will be great.			"

I wish I could play with my friends on here but I'm ok with it. I recommend this game if you like rpg and scrolling games.  With it's many classes try to find one that suits you. For me I like the Knight and Hero class. Also the perks are great as well. You can pick from different perks to enchance your hero. This is a well made game. I put in quite a few hours into it. With it's different dimension It's a new adventure everytime. If you wish to replay it type it's name.This is an amazing game. And you should give it a try.			"

												I have played a decent amount of this game, and I think it is time to write a review. One Way Heroics may not seem much as it is an RPG game, but once you get into it, you will fall in love with it. The first thing you may notice of the game is the music. The music practically sets it apart from other RPG or any other games in general. The music is the emotion of the game. The story is pretty interesting too, and the whole time you have to run away from the looming darkness. That is where the name comes from, since you can only go in one way or direction. The last thing I have to say about this amazing game is: The difficulty. This game is not easy at all, you will die many times. Sure, you may rage quit, but this game will draw you back. It is different everytime you play it. To sum all things up, get the game. The money is worth it, and you will enjoy playing it.			"

After giving it a shot, I can say it's a breath of fresh air in terms of innovating on some ancient gameplay ideas.  The design of the game keeps you moving, so it's fast-paced and very replayable.  The controller support is a great touch.  There are quite a few levels of difficulty though I haven't experienced any of the more advanced stuff myself yet.  If you're looking for a game that's worth a few bucks, this is a nice addition to your library.			"

												I adore this game, so much so i've bought it dozens of times for people on my friends list. It's nearly perfect in what it tries to do, the perfect roguelike rpg that isn't unfair or filled with annoying rng.It's fast, simple and clean, no uneeded features or mechanics to weigh it down yet there's still a lot of strategy to it. Why doesn't the maid have a portrait though "

												Wow! I must say I""m not usually the Roguelike kind of guy.  But this game has been FUN in just the few hours I've put into it.  It's pretty nifty trial and error on some things but for the most part it's understandable in how the mechanics play out.I will spoil 2 things for you though:1) Use the mountains to lose monsters that are chasing you (make sure you remember you can move diagonally.2) Use axes on wooden walls.  Great way to get out of a bad building.Please give this one a shot.  Totally fun!			"

												I have played a decent amount of this game, and I think it is time to write a review. One Way Heroics may not seem much as it is an RPG game, but once you get into it, you will fall in love with it. The first thing you may notice of the game is the music. The music practically sets it apart from other RPG or any other games in general. The music is the emotion of the game. The story is pretty interesting too, and the whole time you have to run away from the looming darkness. That is where the name comes from, since you can only go in one way or direction. The last thing I have to say about this amazing game is: The difficulty. This game is not easy at all, you will die many times. Sure, you may rage quit, but this game will draw you back. It is different everytime you play it. To sum all things up, get the game. The money is worth it, and you will enjoy playing it.			"

												The game is exactly what it says on the tin, it's a procedurally generated RPG-roguelike where you can go where you want, pick special challenges, unlock classes to play with and suck less with each time, if the RNG approves of it by giving you nice (or not-so-nice) things.What makes it excellent compared to most other roguelikes is the actual J-RPG feel, quick pace, and variety of challenges you face as you level onwards. I can't think of another game where I can be a swordsman that beats the final boss with just overly buffed plate armour.			"

												This is a highly addicting game for something so simple.You simply keep going to the right and kill anything on the way there.While you do so, you level up, try not to starve, try not to get killed by the giant massive cloud of darkness which is the reason why you're going right and even recruit possible allies as you venture forth.Even ignoring the simple gameplay, the hidden story this game tells is quite elusive and you'll find yourself struggling to learn what's going on.One moment you just want to kill the Demon Lord.Then you find out  The Demon Lord's a girl and is the sister of the king who sent you on this quest.	Then you manage to  Kill the Darkness that's trying to swallow the entire Earth. Oh, it's also a GIANT DRAGON	 which is generic, but at the same time, it's pretty interesting.But wait, if you buy the DLC, you get to  Fight and kill god	This is just the basic mainstream story, because there's a plethora of characters with their own little story, ranging from Dosey to you simply trying to be a tourist.In the end, I highly recommend this game, especially if you're the type of person to want to hoard legendary holy items, which I did.

												The best classical final fantasy game that had never been created by square enix.Can get repetitive, but not bad if you are up for a challenge. Yes, it gets repetitive. The roguelike curtain the game hides itself behind is a huge illusion here, don't be fooled by it. Because you do the exact same things in every run, regardless of how different the map is. Even the direction you advance is the same. Definitely don't expect a life-changing, groundbreaking RPG experience neither. But still can be an alternative to any other time-waster game.Energy concept had gave a nice survival feeling to the game.I really don't like the minimap though, it's so hard to distinguish if there's a mountain or a road there, I hope they improve the quality of the minimap in the future.When you are able to beat the endgame boss and unlock new things, it's damn satisfying though!

												One Way is a multiplayer RTS, it kind of reminds me like Starcraft II, but before the big update. In this game you play as a small, low quality character with low stats, and get better by killing things, the aim is to get strong enough to take the enemies base before he takes yours. In the campaign mode you're tasked to destroy the Government by progressively building up your rep through street racing, and (Spoilers) taking the crown off of the president when you long distance race for pinks.All in all I really enjoyed playing this game, and I would recommend it to my friends, I will update this when I have tried the Co-op mode :D			"

												The first thing that I noticed about this game was that it reminds me of the very first Final Fantasy, both in terms of looks and sound. Although, it plays nothing like it. Simply put, you travel in one direction (east) to avoid being consumed by the darkness that chases you. Meanwhile, you are fighting monsters and collecting treasure and visiting every little settlement along the way. You will die often, but that is kind of the point. You collect points at the end of your adventure so that you can upgrade your character. Thats about it. I paid about $0.30 for this game during a major sale, and I think it was a good deal. But I don't see myself playing this game very long. About an hour was enough for me. Then again, I have spent more money on steam trading cards than I did on this game, so no complaints here.			"

												A buy at 2.99.This game is easy to learn, hard to master. It rewards perserverence.I would call on the developer to continue to market their game and to improve it, XBOX 360 wireless controls were a little iffy, especially considering that the sprites are small on the screen.Finally, at first glance this is a RPGMaker cloneware, but there is something existential about the ever aproaching darkness that gives the game a deeper meaning, while it remains entertaining. Dare we call it art?A great pick up for a weekend (I bought a pineapple more expensive than this game, and while it was a good pine apple, the game will be  with me longer...) cheap enough to be a good gift as well.

												I got this game on a sale, long time ago, for a dumb and extremely low price, something like half an euro, or even less. To tell you the truth, for such a price, I was expecting something horrible, dreadful, like an 8-bit Ride to Hell. Did I got surprised? Yeah! Buuuuuuut as usual, let me explain the BAD things the game has first, so we can take them out of the way:The game is kind of short. Of course, for such a price, you can understand it, so it's not that big of a deal. Besides, this is a Rogue-like game, and rogue-like games are usually short, but change in every playthrough, this is no different from the standard on that regard.The other thing that I did not like at all, is the lack of multiplayer. This game had such extreme potential for a Coop experience, but instead you can play the same randomly generated world at the same time as one of your friends, to see who goes further...INSTEAD OF PLAYING TOGETHER, AND HAVING FUN! I was indeed dissapointed by that, by looking at the captures of some friends that got the game, and by looking at the pictures and videos of the Steam-Store, I was expecting to play at least with one friend in a journey to save the world by punching demons on their d#cks.  You know, the usual. Now, let's talk about the GOOD stuff, pretty much everything else. As I said, it's a Rogue-Like. At the start of the playthrough you select the kind of character you desire to control, and special skills for you: You want to be fast? You want to be strong? You want to use magic? You want to start with a companion? You want to start with insane amoutns of gold? It's your choice, and it's indeed well made. I really did enjoy starting in different ways, and testing different strategies.The game pretty much goes like this: The world is being taken out by some sort of ""Dark Sonic Boom"" (Damn Obama, he stole that from Guille!), and ANYTHING NEAR THE LEFT SIDE OF THE SCREEN IS F#CKED. Your goal is to travel to the right, getting stronger, surviving the wilds, getting better gear, meeting other people, saving lives, and if you get far enough, saving the world. It might sound simple enough, but the game mechanics make this journey, a journey to remember: First of all, you have to eat, or your character will get tired. Sounds easy enough? Well, there's not that many free food out there, so you have to make sure to visit any Inn or Town and get supplies before they got suck up into Oblivion (I bet that portal leads to Obama's #sshole, NOW THAT'S ONE SICK WAY TO END UP DEAD). Not only that, but your equipment won't last forever. Your stuff has limited use, for example, 100 uses on a sword. Once you swing it for the 100th time, the thing breaks, and it's lost forever. There are ways to repair it and make it last longer, but you should make sure to AT LEAST CARRY 1 BACKUP WEAPON. Infact, I always try to carry at least 3 weapons on myself. And armor? HAH, THOSE THINGS BREAK TOO, SHIELDS INCLUDED! You're far pass f#cked on these lands, specially later on when enemies start to get dangerous!For a cheap game, there's a lot of fun to be had in this game, and I do recommend it. The game is worth 3€ WITHOUT sales, and that's already cheap enough, on sales it usually lowers to 1€ or so. It's up to you to buy it or not, but I do recommend that you give it a try.			"

												This game is brutal no matter what difficulty you pick, in best possible way as a rogue-like. It has a VERY surprising amount of depth for a game that is by default played on a resolution of about a smart phone (what you see in the screenshots is what you get, and full-screening it does not help its prettiness!). Graphics-wise, it's incredibly indie -- see the character ""portraits"" in the bottom left corner that seem to be sketches made a bored developer, especially Swordmaster Class C for a laugh.If you get this game, it's for its gameplay, which does one thing, but does it really, really well. The turn-based gameplay with a constant timer and emphasis on movement will make it incredibly addicting for old-time Rogue-like players, as experience points (read: monsters to farm) and treasure may be within arm's reach but inaccessible due to the choices you have to make. The item appraisal system makes every item a mystery and makes even a new starting sword drop a desired reward, as durability constantly counts down with few ways to repair items and replenish supplies. Even when you're on top of the world, you'll feel pressured and challenged by item weights and inventory limits, decreasing energy and stamina, and other factors to encourage you to weigh risk and reward (""how long should I wear this Training Bracelet, which cripples my stats for more experience?"") to get ready for the next area.The ""hidden"" parts of the game are by far the most enticing. You simply have to go out and find out for yourself how to get access to things like Party Members, Force powers (spells), the Dark Brotherhood, Hidden Elf Villages, Goddess Statues, and Key of Seals and their associated doors. After each death or victory, the progression system encourages trial and error, mixing and matching unlockable classes and perks with rotating featured Dimensions and allowing players to access the Dimensional Vault to carry over a limited number of items. The game is well-supported outside of a playthrough with a replay system, a hall of fame for each dimension and for your overall profile, and, of course, the different daily Dimensions featured. It does not hold your hand after kicking you out of the castle with a fairy of questionable use, explaining only the most basic and necessary mechanics until you recruit party members: you have to go out and discover it for yourself, since at a base level the game is so simple! Even the limited story and simple humor is fun to discover, especially as more party-member-specific endings are unlocked.One of the best games on Steam under $5, and amongst my favorite Rogue-likes; highly, highly recommend.

There's a crapload of loot (armor, weapons, items, random stuff) and the ""dimensions"" (worlds) you generate are seed based, so if hear about a particularly cool one you can play it. Once you've beaten the boss, the game really is just starting. There are loads of weird things you can discover, and theres about 3 or 4 ways to conquer a dimension. I highly suggest you buy it, and its only 3 and a half dollars. I have completely got my moneys worth and will continue to do so.			"

For a trifling $3.50 I have so far enjoyed the game for 8 hours or so and rising.  In the casual/roguelike genre there aren't many games that are this good.

												For such a low price, this game is a lot of fun!  There is a wide variety of worlds, character classes, perks/stats, items/equipment, game modes, unlockables, etc, which adds a lot of replayability to the game.  For a trifling $3.50 I have so far enjoyed the game for 8 hours or so and rising.  In the casual/roguelike genre there aren't many games that are this good.  I would say this game ranks up there alongside FTL and Binding of Iaasac in terms of overall quality and fun.			"

												The graphics are very RPG-Maker-y, and honestly from just looking at the game you might want to give it a pass, but it was in a Humble pack and I'll try any rouge like for under a buck.It turns out, this game is really fantastic. Games play out quickly, and the point system keeps you unlocking new helpful things even when you have a bad run. The game gives you advise after every run, and its really pretty great and noticing things that got you killed and giving you tips you might not have known to help you do better next time. Full price of US$3.50 is honestly a bargain for what a cool and fun game this is.			"

												A game that puts you to the test in every press of time and action.  This game puts you think not only about stock, but the matter of stats in what you have. Tthe game provides a good random world generation and fun little remarks along the way with each playthrough. However at the end, they provide advice, help, tips, and tricks that will help you in your next playthrough. The points you obtain after each playthrough are put to the end game to help you decide if you want to unlock a class, perk, or add items to a dimensional vault. With that said, the game provides entertainment. I give it a 5 out of 5 in my opinion for keeping it good paced, makes me go back for more. If to put it accurately on scale, It would be nice if would be a 4.8 out of 5 because of some things such as the matter of certain monsters. Nonetheless even if it is a ""walk in the park"" mode, each playthrough in each world provides an experience unique. I found it quite entertaining and enthralling. However at points can get mad because of the fact of certain options, do yo wanna save now and lose 5 levels. I think not, however as you play more and more throughout you get more info around the world and develop more points that add up. Rack them all up and bonuses appear on skills and perks. Eventually you will obtain a nice amount and make your experience turn. I hate to admit it but dying in this game sort of helps you out.  Reminds me of other games and concepts. Nonetheless great game  I recommend for those interested in a fun highly replayable and growing game. It's something that is quite indulging. I took the time going through the npcs, areas, while running for my life against that horde. Yet I feel bad everytime I think about some of them. Nonetheless as some say, you realize what really matters or what you have to do when it is about to be gone in your life. Still this game adds quite the element on point of classes. They give you each specifics with bonuses and will help you understand how you want to play if you choose this. There are as many worlds you can make and use as long as you keep trying. Been playing at odds and ends with it in my first world since I got it. I got highly addicted.			"

												One way heroics is a great rogue-like turn-based quasi-tactical rpg. It's hard to label this game as any one specific catagory, but it's ideal is apparent.This game is all about strategy, and uses a grid-based platform.If you are a fan of fire emblem style gameplay, you may like this game.The second element is more of a rough and tumble type of turn-based rogue-like battle system.First you choose your action, then all other actions occur after your action, then time moves foreward and stops when it comes back to your turn. It's a very simple, yet complex system as there are a multitude of effects to change the style that you play. (examples: combos, criticals, ranged, meditation, throwables, etc etc)Another huge aspect, which I believe carries this game to a better aspect, is it's music.While the volume isn't always properly adjusted for some of the areas, the music is still great for every single area/theme in the game.also I swear I heard guile's theme...In addition to to having great music, the effort they put into the smaller details in the game, such as character interaction and ending sequences, goes to show how much they actually cared for the game. This is something more developers need to do.I would give this game a solid 9/10.-1 point for including hippy tree huggers.			"

												Very addicting, cute and hilarious. Some online connectivity but very limited. When the game said it had online features I thought it meant you could have a party for a single instance at least but the closest you get is a leaderboard and ghosts of the dead players. Hopefully this can be expanded a little at least. Otherwise, I've thoroughly enjoyed playing hours at a time of this game, the replay value is worth it. And hopefully the upcoming DLC will not be more then twice the base price of the game....			"

												Overall    :   7.5The game overall is very simple, straight forward, yet incredibly complex all at once.  This game uses the ""Inheritance"" system, where as you level though the game, you will gain attributes/abilities from one save to the next.  Because of this, every playthrough is new, and every time you make a character, you can choose to continue with the gear you had (or have) or start fresh.  If you are a fan of rogue likes, you should give this a try.Graphics   :   7The rogue style game really has nothing that 'stands out'.  Simply put though, if you play rogue games for graphics, you are probably looking in the wrong genre.Sound       :  9The music and sound effects for the game are astounding.  They really add to the look and feel of the game as you are moving through the world.Storyline    :  6I can't really comment too much on the storyline, as I keep dieing before I get to a boss fight, but the general theory of running away from a mist that is chasing you that destroys all feels very similar to FTL, but with a very awesome roguelike style.  Presentation:  6The games graphics and menus work well, are very easy to use.  The only reason I can not give this an 8 is because while there is localization for controllers, the UI does not reflect that you have a controller plugged in and are using it.  Often when I first started playing I had to push the buttons to figure out what did what.  This cost some turns and a few deaths (although kind of funny).Replayability:  10Every playthough gets better and better, this game is incredibily addictive and has an extreme level of enjoyment with each playthroughContent         :  7There are adequate skills/classes/weapons and status to engate a truely unique rogue like expreience.

												This is an amazing roguelike game. Just like any other, YOU WILL DIE the first few times you try. However, you will eventually get the hang of it, and be able to survive just about any situation. For example: I recently got the plus version, and in it they added a couple new biomes and new items. One new biome is an ocean area, where there is a very large area of water. Water takes 5 times as long to navigate as dry land, and this is a major issue with the darkness chasing you. What made the area worse is that the Demon Lord (powerful boss) spawned for me right after I found the ocean. I fought for a while, before I realized I was screwed if I kept fighting. I was trapped between a very powerful enemy and an ocean that would cause my death. Luckily, I found an item that proved highly useful. Its called Magic Bridge. It forms a bridge that extends to 15 tiles in front of you. I used it over the ocean, and managed to run away for a little while, and heal. However, the bridge wasnt long enough to make it all the way over. So I was trapped once again. However, through strategic item, skill, and using my followers as bodyguards, I was able to get him down to about 10% hp. However, I couldnt survive another hit. I thought to myself ""How can I possibly survive?"" I was skimming my skills, and I noticed I had one more awakening left. Awakening is a skill that freezes time for 3 turns. However, you can only use it 5 times a playthrough. I used it. And on the last turn of the awakening, I managed to finish him off. It was the single most intense moment of my One Way Heroics life.I highly advise that you get this game, and the Plus version. Easily worth the money.

												A rouge-like/rpg hwhere you must keep moving to avoid the darkness (AKA the dark void of death).You first begin the game with the hero (you) selecting a class and a variety of perks to aid you on your quest. You can enter a randomly generated world or scenarios that change in real time. Depending on what mode you choose, the dark lord will appear at a certain time during your playthrough. You must defeat him to beat the game but this is no easy feat without proper equipment or items. Of course, there are dungeons and towns but you have to plan how to get in and out safely throughly without being eaten alive by the void. If you die on a playthrough, you can store items you had in the dimensional vault and use them on the next playthrough. You also accumulate hero points after each playthrough in which you can spend these points on extra vault space or hidden perks or classes for your next run. The amont of points you get depends on how well you did on your last playthrough.A nice, time-killing game overall with buckets full of replayability but try not to swim in lava. Can you reach the end of the world? "

												I love this game, however I *really* wish the flaws werent so blistering.-Your weight limit is abysmal. You can literally start the game, pick up a SINGLE weapon and you're already overencumbered. - Your stat increases per level are completely random. You could literally get nothing but SP upgrades from Level 1 - 15 and you'd be just as weak as when you started. - The Identify System is unfair. Like I said earlier, your weight limit is terrible so, you end up picking up a Sword???, you have no idea what it is... and because the system is so unfair, odds are you wont Identify the weapon. You can't bring it with you because it's too heavy. It's just not fair. And considering Item Shops rarely have Apraisal Scrolls and an Apraiser is Expensive / Sometimes to Hard to Come by.... It's almost wiser to just ignore weapons.- You have no idea how powerful your enemies are. One Bat could be the easiest bat in the game and the next one could possibly 1 shot you. Who knows? It's not consistent. I wish it was. Now, all of these things by themselves are not bad... but put together, it's almost unforgiving how hard the game is.But still...The music is *amazing*.The gameplay is addictingAnd you have a Shared Loot system between games that helps you out.And I'd say it makes up for all that.

												A solid turn base strategy game that caters to players who don't mind honing one of 3 effective ways to fight enemies and wants to complete endurance challenges. I liked it for the 4 hours I practiced the techniques I learned, but after beating the first major obstacle, I personally became bored with having to forever go right while not gaining anything cool for the effort. I would give it half a thumb up because it is not a game that I feel the urge to spend a long playing, but I can see the positives where others can enjoy messing around with how the game was made. Highly encourage getting the game for those who like to compete with other players with the use of the Seed Generation system.			"

												A solid turn base strategy game that caters to players who don't mind honing one of 3 effective ways to fight enemies and wants to complete endurance challenges. I liked it for the 4 hours I practiced the techniques I learned, but after beating the first major obstacle, I personally became bored with having to forever go right while not gaining anything cool for the effort. I would give it half a thumb up because it is not a game that I feel the urge to spend a long playing, but I can see the positives where others can enjoy messing around with how the game was made. Highly encourage getting the game for those who like to compete with other players with the use of the Seed Generation system.			"

												If you like roguelike games, this one is a must buy in my opinion. The system is kept rather simple, and games necessarily have a relatively short duration even if you win them by killing the demon lord at the end. (I managed to win on my 3rd try, which took about an hour.)Multiple playthroughs are worthwhile because there are various classes and perks to be unlocked. Additionally you have a ""dimensional vault"" that you can use to store up items from your previous attempt to use in your next one. So while your character isnt all that persistent, your profile is.I bought the game on sale for $1, and it was one of the best $1 purchases I've made here.			"

												This is the story of a Hunter who threw away his puny bow and picked up a super-manly Sharp Holy Axe Elizabeth+6. Because this item was guaranteed to deal critical damage when it hit the target, this Hunter managed to kill every enemy that came his way in one hit. Even golems and polar bears. As a result his level grew very rapidly. Soon he had a level above 30, even, and enough Strength to where he could carry several battleaxes and greatswords with ease. But it all went to his head. For his head, much like every other part of his body except for his massive beefcake arms, was puny and weak. So it was, when he got cocky and decided to break into the hold of the Dark Brotherhood (not THAT Dark Brotherhood), that he soon realized he could only kill one of them, before all the other members inside would shank him from all sides and kill him instantly. And so they did.That is the story of my... I wanna say my twelfth time playing through the game. I lost count, honestly. This game is wicked addictive. It's a really good buy if you're into rogue-likes and your computer is getting on in years or is otherwise not that strong. I play it on a laptop with Intel HD 3000 graphics and it runs 60fps solid at the highest detail settings.I want the expansion pack though... (sniff)			"

												Like FTL, but as a medieval RPG.This game has a deceptive level of depth to it, especially for such a cheap game. What makes this roguelike different from most other roguelikes and yet similiar to FTL, is that there is an advancing wave of darkness that forces the screen to scroll to the right. If you fall into the darkness? You die, and thus you need to keep moving to the right to survive, hence the name of the game. You would think that something like that would leave very little room for story, and in a way you are correct. But there is actually a bit more plot than it appears on first glance and you will need multiple playthroughs to fully understand what is going on. The gameplay is mostly based around exploring, killing enemies and finding items while staying ahead of the scrolling wave. You need to find items to recover your energy, health and stamina, while also looking for weapons, armor, and enchantments. During this time the Demon Lord will occasionally pop in to try to kill you, and you either have to run from him, using whatever status effect items you have to slow him down, or finish him then and there. This sounds very simple on paper, but in practice it's actually a quite expansive resource and time management game, and you often need to plan your movements carefully to avoid getting killed by the scrolling darkness.There are also a number of interesting NPCs, but sadly they very rarely appear. Each one has their own backstory, personaliy quirks, and even an associated ending. To mix things up even more, there is a random prefix system that can sometimes spawn either an enemy or an NPC with a stat changing prefix such as ""stiff-necked"", with some of them even changing the character's dialog, often in hilarious ways.Like most roguelikes this game has a lot of replay value, but here it's even more enforced by the fact that you can ""vault"" items at the end of a playthrough so you can get them at the start of another playthrough. Combined with the various classes, starting perks, and random world generation, you will likely end up with quite a bit of variety right at the start of your various runs through the game.There is even a limited online play component, in that you can start on a world where other players have played and see their ghosts where they have died. At the end of a run you will also see leaderboards listed all the other players who have played on that world.Unfortunately this game isn't perfect, which is to be expected with it's nearly non-existant price. The stats aren't very balanced, with some like intelligence being less useful than the others, and charm in particular is almost useless given that it's mainly used for recruiting companions, who, as said before are extremely rare. I also noticed that bows seem a bit underpowered since they can't combo like melee weapons and often you can just throw things for similiar damage. Hopefully the upcoming expansion polishes the game up a bit, but even with the few issues this game has, it's worth far more than it's listed price at the moment.			"

												This is the game that made me realize how great roguelikes can be. I love this game, even though I probably will never beat it. The core premise of this game is what got me to buy it, and all the stuff i could unlock just by playing the game kept me coming back for more. New classes, more health, better stats, etc. I love it! Then there's the fact that there are nearly infinite worlds to explore and you can replay the ones you like and you have a vault where you can store items for subsequent playthroughs-allowing you to keep things you don't want to risk losing. There's so much more to this game than I could fit into a few paragraphs. It's something you'd have to play for yourself and see. If you like JRPGs, replayability, and roguelikes, you almost certainly will like this game.			"

												This game is wonderful, you get used to this unique gameplay really quick, the default playthrough is quite short, but the concept behind this game is to play it through 100+ times, to enjoy it over and over, and every round you find out something new about the world, why it collapses and so on. I personally think that the developers should have made this game a little more expensive, with cuter/better tilesets and char sprites, but it's ok.It's worth it even if you get it at full price, no need to wait for a sale for this one.

												It's an alright indie rogue-like game but there isn't much to it. Pretty much just try to see how far you can get in a certain amount of steps or something... Idk the game is kind of vague on how it works. It took me 4 hours to beat the Demon Lord the first time and I didn't have the motivation to try to get any further. Doing well rewards you with more usable characters and you can use chests to store items you might want on your next character walk. SO basically with storing your items you're saying screw it to this play-thru and the next one will be better or something.The game seemed kind of counter-productive as you have to make very fine decisions on whether or not to even fight monsters as they slow you down or deal alot of damage. You pretty much have to get lucky enough to get some good items and also fight enough enemies, but not too much, to be able to fight the Demon Lord at the end with high enough stats to survive. If I were to give this game a rating I would have to say something around 6/10.  It's an alright adventure game but just seems like I'm making no progress while I play. Also there is not a whole lot of content but it's only like $3.50 so it's forgivable.			"

												It's an alright indie rogue-like game but there isn't much to it. Pretty much just try to see how far you can get in a certain amount of steps or something... Idk the game is kind of vague on how it works. It took me 4 hours to beat the Demon Lord the first time and I didn't have the motivation to try to get any further.

												One Way Heroics is like an old Ultima game condensed into a Roguelike. The various classes and goals make the game very replayable, and I think this is a really interesting model for RPGs to overcome the monotony and over-simplification of Final Fantasy style games. The only thing I would say is, I wish they'd combine the great maps and interesting gameplay with some kind of story and/or more unlockables or goals. To me, this game is a model of the potential unlocked by games like League of Legends or Binding of Isaac, where there is always a reason to try your best during the game, and to be satisfied with losing. The only thing designers need to do is combine this perpetual effort by its players with some kind of story that works despite the seeming interchangability of the maps. Recommend this game to a RPG roguelike fans who are slightly on the hardcore side.			"

												UPDATE:  The game works (that is, will not crash to your desktop) if you turn off the ""online features"" option.  I have no idea what the online features are supposed to allow you to do, but they apparently crash the game, so I definitely recommend turning them off until the game is patched.Even without the online features, the game itself is a lot of fun, from the limited time I have played it so far.  You will die a lot, but it's never too frustrating.  It reminds me a bit of a turn-based Rogue Legacy in that you get to keep a set of the old equipment you have found from run to run.  Success in earlier runs makes more success in later runs easier (possible).  Now that I can actually run the game without it crashing, I'm happy to recommend it -- it's certainly a lot of fun for the price.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------OLD REVIEW:  This game looks like it could be fun, but the Steam version isn't stable.  I've launched the game twice, created characters, ventured out, and within five minutes both times, the game has crashed to the desktop.  I'd wait until the patches come in before buying it.			"

												Got this on a sale for like 0.3£, and have to say, I love it so far, it's better then I thought it would be. Even for the standard price of 2.99£. get it, it's worth it, small price for a fun game on a bad day and you don't know what to play of those 150 games you have on the list. Gameplay, well you make a character, and at start you have one class, and then you can put in the start perks. As you start, you have to run and get away from the left part of your screen and it only moves whenever you make a move that get's time to go again. As you progress you find items, friends, enemies. You will die, I promise that. But your stats progress wont die, you will then start again and continue with your stats from the start. You can upgrade some dimention box or something and save your items for your next run. Every level you give that box you can store one more item. And when you die, you will get to a screen with some kawaii ughuu fairy gurl that will give you weary helpfull tips of how you could have changed your run to survive longer. Warning, only tutorial you get is, how to walk, turn and talk. No more help then that, rest you have to figure out yourserlf... unless I missed something. You can find save points btw. Like I said it's fun, and worth playing. I had a good time and I thought this game was going to be♥♥♥♥♥♥honestly.			"

												I realized it's called One Way Heroics for a reason.Anyways, it's a gem that's fairly well for it's price (on sale for me) for 0.77 USD. Combat might not be in depth as it should be, but it serves it purpose of wasting your time of the mist to get you. Combat was really clunkly because of the directional aspect (I got killed by a Spooky Skele because I was a noob and did not know how to change direction). Dialogue with Iris is the most fun part of this game, breaking the 4th wall all the time. When I smashed every button on my computer, she popped up out of nowhere, and questioned me about ignoring her for the last 3 runs I attempted. Perhaps it's better that there is classes at all that, but it's really kinda like Killing Floor 'cept being more niche at their roles.Verdict: It's a timewaster for 1 hour at best, but's it's like a short comedy, not a full game. Don't treat it as one.(still cheaper than a movie ticket, more fun to play.)			"

												Across all dimensions, the only constant is Darkness! A procedurally generated RPG-roguelike journey across the multiverse!In One Way Heroics, you take on the role of an intrepid adventurer who must travel across the land and face the Demon Lord before a mysterious darkness engulfs everything.Darkness always approaches from the left, and with each movement, attack and action you take, the darkness creeps ever closer. Forced to run right, you'll encounter any number of monsters, allies, thieves and shops on your desperate journey to stop the end of everything.The good news is that you don't just have access to one world. You have access to all of them. Born with the mysterious power to travel to other dimensions, you can choose which dimension you wish to travel to in order to get to the Demon Lord.Dimensions vary based on their name. One might be full of lush forest landscapes full of adorable animals and cunning thieves, while another might be full of corrupted hellscapes infested with demons. You might find likeminded heroes willing to journey with you, or you might meet no one and be forced to venture into the unknown alone.Like a dimension you previously visited? Simply input the name at the Dimensional selection screen before you begin your journey. Want to try your luck with a random dimension? Type any word that pops into your head, and watch as One Way Heroics builds you a world based on the name you chose.Infinite permutations. Infinite worlds. Infinite adventure.			"

												There are two philosophies in making Roguelikes: The classic Roguelikes like NetHack had dungeons that weren't terribly long with permadeath, but were excessively lethal because the point was that you, the player were the one ""leveling up"" by learning new techniques for beating the game that you never thought about before you had YASD or hit the oracle; The other usually eschews permadeath to have a more classic RPG sense of character progression through nigh-infinite procedural dungeons.  One Way Heroics goes the ultra-short game route with none of the character progression, but it also manages to be so rules-light that it fails to really give the player any sense that they learned anything.  I ""beat"" the game on my second try, and it just said, ""Yay, now try again!""... WHY? What goal do I have in playing through a 10-minute game I've already beaten to get more loot I don't need to beat it again?It just feels like it gutted the biggest reason I enjoy RPGs - the sense of customization and development of your characters - in favor of nameless forgettable nobodies, and there's nothing in the game that replaces that or gives me any sense of reason why I'd want to play any more than that 10 minutes it takes to see the whole story play out once.

												I bought this because it was labeled as an RPG. I realize this is a rogue like also. In my personal opinion this game feels like it fails both genres.When playing an RPG there needs to be a sense of exploration/story. However, this game really punishes you for exploring. You will come across tons of little enemy houses with treasure in them, but most of the time it is impossible to kill the swarm of enemies inside and unlock a box before the area gets swallowed by the black edge of the screen. Furthermore, the character progression just isn't there. I get that one of the man features of rogue likes is permadeath, but the perks you can buy and upgrade a new character with don't make you feel stronger. You can unlock different classes of hero but they don't feel any different.  The controls suck for the combat style. It's both live action and turn based. You pretty much walk around the map, but when you come across enemies you must take it slow and be very deliberate about facing the right direction before initiating any action, otherwise you swing at air and waste a turn. The controls just felt very clunky and took away from the immersion. I feel like pure turn based combat would have been better.My final verdict is 5/10. This game probably is more enjoyable as a rogue like than an RPG. Only worth purchasing when on sale for 50% off or more. "

												After disableing the online features(Thanks whisperling!) the game has not crashed. While playing I noticed the game works a lot like the pokemon mystery dungeon series. At first I didn't think that was good thing as I played those games a lot and assumed I would get nothing out of this game.*predictable twist* The sense of urgency that is thrust apon you gives the game a very unique feel.It stops you from grinding enemies and forces you to stop and make very important desisions, especially considering being a nuetral persons house is more dangerous that fighting a zombie. Even swapping out items takes time and you end up keeping the item just to throw it at a bat.One thing that draws me to the game is what happens when you die. The game is designed to be quite difficult, which I think works great in these kinds of greenlit games, but what works good in this one is the ability to make your next run slightly easier with upgrades without making it too easy.The only downside I have with this game is that when changing to the controller, the button prompts stay as keyboard buttons meaning you have to work out the corresponding button and remember it, often leading in you doing the wrong thing.

												Simply put: I didn't find this game fun. The gameplay mechanics are interesting and I especially like the idea of character progression through new characters, but the content is just... lacking. Going through the game and advancing my character gave me no sense of accomplishment or progression. Nothing immersed me in the world or made me care about the Demon Lord. The interface was frustrating and took away most of the enjoyment I could get out of the rougelike aspect of it. Oh, and the lack of language support in the game itself is frustrating--I decided I wanted to play through in English this time instead of Japanese and changing it via Steam (the only way) wiped all of my data. There's no real excuse to not have proper language support these days... except that I'm pretty sure this game was made with RPG Maker, which has absolutely no localization support.Anyway, despite the low price I'd recommend giving this game a pass.

												Didn't like it. While it does feature proper randomization and varied starting options, I can't say I find it an enjoyable roguelike. First of all, interface is bad, no mouse support, and various dialogues during each run start / end repeat every time without ability to skip them. Also, it was obviously designed for Japanese language, the information is crammed in too tightly, and those dialogues I mentioned are like something out of a jRPG/visual novel but, you know, this is a roguelike with many retries necesseary to achieve something, so you'll see those pop up every now and then, forcing you to rapidly skim trough same lines every time!Next, it's... I can't really say it has that much tactical depth. I mean, there are special abilities which are not very convinient to use due to interface, some of them cost stats, some can be used just few times, but due to the price you pay to use them they are only handy in extreme situations. Same with items, they run out of durability and break, so you have to spare better ones, but even then there's no depth beyond ""know when it's right time to use this"".Also, can't say I enjoyed either visuals or audio. Guess I'm just not weaboo enough to enjoy Japanese style. Although if you are into this sort of thing, you should probably enjoy it.Finally while it has some nice simple ideas, the balance is pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥ Like charisma is near-useless except for getting extremely rare companions, meanwhile other stats are essential for survival. While unfairness is a common thing in random roguelikes, having one of the essential stats useless outside of daily events and extremely rare occurences is just plain wrong.All in all, this might be a pretty good simple timekiller for a weaboo, you might even enjoy the extra challenges the game offers, but for anyone not used to Japanese game design practices and aesthetics this might prove rather dull.

												There is a TL:DRIf you grab this game for less than $1 then it is very much worth it. I actually REALLY like the game and the simplicity of combat but boy oh howdy is it a very shallow experience. Aside from tiny modifiers and higher difficulties this is a very easy game to beat once you figure out how not to die to the moving wall of darkness.There are 2 types of rogue like games. The first type you actually progress your character accross playthroughs (Dead Rising, Rogue Legacy) where you get your sense of accomplishment despite not beating the game.The other type consists of losing literally everything stat and possession and see if you roll the dice better this time around. Thats much harder to remain satisfying since from a stat angle you can't tell who has 80 hours of play time and who has 5 hours. So why invest the additional 75 hours?This game is the latter, sure certain games can pull it off like Faster then Light because you unlock ways that alter the game in a dramatic way that getting those unlocks feels worth it even if you lose. This game has a few different classes but they control and play almost identically and their bonuses would only be noticed if this game was in the former catagory. It wouldn't be hard either, you remove weapon degredation (since you can save items between playthroughs) and allow perminent base stat increases using the levels you gain in playthrough as currency. Make this playthrough harder so that future ones will be easier sort of deal, they already have something like that but it only applies to the current playthroughTL:DR this game is very much worth if you're buying it for literal cents on the dollar. It goes on sale frequently			"

												I do believe that this game is good. However it is very repetitive and gets boring after a while. Even the variety in classes and zones don't do anything for me. Losing interest is a very bad sign especally after only a few hours. Permadeath is a nice idea but it does get frustrating not being able to progress.			"

												I bought this one during the Summer Monster Sale for very little money, but it also brought me very little enjoyment.The game feels really, really basic. You move towards the right on a wide plain/desert/forest (terrains have different effects), fight some monsters, explore some dungeons (really just rooms with a few monsters and an item chest in them).The terrain is generated procedurally, so each run is a little different.Combat is really simple. You either attack with your weapon or use abilities.There are little tactical moves beyond moving so that you get the first attack, or running away from stronger monsters.After a certain distance travelled, the boss appears.In case you die, you get a little lecture (like ""you should use your time travel skill in dire situations"") and then get some points with which you can unlock other characters and perks.You can also put some of your items in a dimensional stash, to have them present in your next run.I can honestly not understand the massive praise this game receives, maybe I just did not ""get"" it.So I have no hard feelings downvoting it, despite its very low price.

												I don't understand the reviews for this game. I hated it. I got no story at all. I basically ran for all of two minutes (tops) to the right. I would pick up a bag or slash at a bat or two before darkness was upon me and I lost. I dont know if you just have to constantly reload and level up your character that way, but no one really talked about that in the reviews. I hate timed games in general and this might actually be the worst about it. Also I have no clue what those screen shots are but they tricked me into believing their was going to be character interaction and plot building, which I did not recieve.So honestly, if I'm playing it wrong please correct me and my review because I really wanted to like this game.

												I don't understand how this game gets such huge amounts of praise, i feel like the game concept was good but executed in such a bad way, Going into it i already cringed at the fact that it had Anime in it (Don't hold this point against the game, this is just my personal preference) After making my hero I played the game and was killed off instantly when trying to visit a home, you only get very small time windows to visit shops, save or raid a dungeon, which is a bit challenging and kills off my need for exploration and monster fighting, speaking of monster fighting lets talk about how lack-luster it is, you'll come across almost no enemies in the beginning but once you reach a further area you get overwhelmed and killed instantly, healing items can almost never save you and shops sell very little healing items at a time, and seeing as you have too get in and get out as fast as possible when it comes to the shops, it's extremely hard to stay alive.  there was almost no story in the mode i chose, other than the fact that we're running from darkness to get to a demon to defeat him, The game mostly never explains most things, like identifying items. i find this game really hard to wrap my head around the full concept of the game, thank god i didn't pay for this and got it as a gift.

												It's an interesting idea, but little more than that.One Way Heroics is a typical roguelike, that (thankfully) lets you gain in power on restart based partially on what you've done in  previous games.However, it's always-move-right-or-you-die nature doesn't let you really enjoy an area; it makes encounters overly tough; and, worst of all, it actively discourages exploration in a a genre, and most importanntly, IN A GAME, that rewards exploration.While some may find fun in it, it's overwhelmingly a game based in randomness, and I personally don't like games that prioritize randomness over skill.

												This was another ""why not"" purchase in the range of $2.  It's hard to know what to say about this, because there's some interesting ideas in here, but the execution is...not good.  There's very little polish or evidence of artistic love in this game.  But it can be a decent way to kill a few hours while you try to determine what various terms mean and wonder how much longer you can keep running from this demon thing that appeared 10 minutes ago that would appear to be a boss but man you just aren't sure, but you know it deals a lot of damage so you might as well keep running.I don't know.  It's games like this where the Yes/No recommendation really falls short.			"

												I strive to look for good RPG Maker style games, but I can never find any. I think that everything in this game is great, however with every seemingly good game, there is a gimmick. I dont know if anyone will pay attention to this review but you may want to. Everything you do in this game causes the screen to move to the right. Everything. Talking to someone repeatedly will move the screen, and if you go off screen at all, game over. So if you're really far and die, well there goes everything. I was really excited when I bought this game. The random worlds feature lured me in and I was so happy to finally play, then when I did, I was so disappointed. It's not the game, or the price, or anything else. It's just that the screen keeps moving right, and it will kill you. Oh, and it's not a glitch, it's a main feature of the game. Just a heads up to anyone thinking of buying it.*Edit:*I know this is the main feature of the game and I'll admit I shouldn't have acted so surprised about it, however I still have to say that that feature drives me off. Personal preference I guess. Games cool but the screen going to the right is just too bothersome.~			"

												It sounds like a great game for the people that can play it, but there's a lot of users, like myself, all over the forums who have never been able to run it.  Posts go as far back as March, and the developer hasn't done anything to improve or try to diagnose the issue other than asking, once, for system specs.  As it is, the whole thing was a ripoff, at any price, since it NEVER launches, regardless of settings or compatibility options.  I might re-review it, if they ever decide to care, but at the moment, they have the money, and don't seem interested.  I suppose some might feel I'm ""entitled"" because I bought a game and expect it to run, or for the dev to make an attempt to assist.  You're damned right.			"

												I decided to write an in depth negative review beyond ""Its♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; that the other negative reviews seems to boil down to.Whenever I start a game and its by default in such a small screen that you cant really see anything, I get a bad feeling. Turns out you can pick between three settings in a windowed mode. So small you cant see, Slightly bigger you cant see, and about the size of a tablet screen.  There are no more visual options to speak of.There is no tutorial so its going to take a second to figure out what you are supposed to be doing. The mechanics aren't very deep but it takes a while to get used to the awkward controls that will have you moving with the arrow keys, attacking with the enter key, and using the menu with the escape key.You can unlock new heros and new perks as well as carry over a few items from playthoughs. Your progress resets everytime though so its a very samey feeling every time. It really has the JRPG grinding thing going on. There isnt much else to it. The story is the basic of basic stories, there arent many other characters, and the new items are kind of boring minor stat increases.As a rogue like game it fails because it much to grindy to be any fun and as an rpg it fails because other than having your hero level up, it is missing any other rpg elements. All in all its a novel idea but is plauged by some strange design choices and a horrible options menu.			"

												The music is ear-bleedingly bad and manages to sound repetitive without actually being repetitive.  Why would the ""artist"" put their name on this? The sounds in general are terribad.  It is trying to pay homage to the 8 bit games of NES and the like, but it manages to actually be the same quality, only more shrill.  Paying homage does not mean trying to literally copy the original, and then amp up the worst aspects.There are 3 available resolutions.  None are wide screen.  One is so small that my phone actually has a larger screen.  Terrible.The resolution in general is very poor.  Again, paying homage does not mean turning the negative aspects of something up to 11.  There are numerous interface issues.  EG, why doesn't moving into an enemy attack them?  Overall, I cannot recommend this.  It's an interesting idea done poorly.			"

												I thought this game was going to be a procedural generate game with elements similer to final fantasy or phtasy star. The point is a dark wave from the right kills everything and u have to stay ahead of it fighting monsters and collecting loot. It sounded too good to be true which it was. The dark wave chases you down a procedurally generated corridor where the top and the bottom end very soon which gives you a complete lack of a world of any kind. The game does not allow you to feel like to grow like an rpg should. This game is more like a poor imitation of old archade games that need a quater to play. I understand that it is trying new things and thats cool but it somehow lacks almost all the things that make and old fashion 2D rpg game so special. I give it an overall 3/10.			"

												The UI is terrible and requires you to navigate vast quantities of terrible menus using the keyboard or a controller since there's no mouse support.The game only runs in windowed mode in one of 3 sizes (too small to see, too small to be useful and big and blurry) or full screen in some resolution that's nowhere close to the monitor's native resolution and is thus really blurry and has black bars on the side.I can't say anything about the game itself. The terrible UI and eye strain inducing resolutions were too much for me to get past. My whole ""played"" time was sat at the menu with the monitor turned off in order to get trading cards.0/10. Stay away.			"

You feel rushed because of the screen always moving foward and the lack of map information makes you feel like you ned to save, expore and then reload your save to get the right things. Any game where gameplay is better if you save and reload saves to min/max are just dumb. The game should not be desgined in such a way that you need to do that.

You have to bypass everything there is to loot, you can't really even go in any of the buildings or dungeons because you would get stuck and die.  You have to keep running to the right and keep getting attacked by monsters that are signifigantly faster than you so if you see one, you HAVE to fight it.  Also, the faster you go, the faster the darkness moves... esentially making this super frustrating all around.			"

												Edit: I'm changing this to a 5/10 because I didn't realize the game crash was related to server issues. I still have gripes (comments below) but if those get fixed, I'll be happy to edit my review again. The game is simple enough but the learning curve for newbies is pretty steep. If it becomes as easy to understand as it is to pick up and play I'll give another update and rewrite my review. (Preview review below)I don't write reviews often - like, hardly at all - but this game randomly crashes. Normally I'd suck it up but in a game where literally everything is randomly generated and you get points taken away from your complete game if you save (essentially forcing a perfectionist to never save in a run-through, which you can clear in 15-20 minutes tops) this is a huge problem. 0/10 would not buy, even for the 2 bucks and change I spent on it. I'd love a refund.			"

												One Way Heroics is a nice semi-Rougelike RPG where you have to constantly move to the right to out run the Darkness that's eating up the world. For the really low price, there's tons of content, such as different classes and skills to help you with each attempt to beat it. There's multiple endings to go for and companions to get along the way. For the really low price, I recommend it for those who really enjoy games like Mystery Dungeon or RPGs in general.			"

												If you like JPRGs and Roguelike you'll love this. The crux of the game is the sidescrolling mechanic.  DARKNESS is on the left side of the screen and you have to keep moving right. Touch the left and it's game over. However, getting game over is not the end...OWH lets you pick a few items to carry on your next run via a Dimensional Vault. This means you can get stronger on subsequent runs. You put items in that box after your run is over and when you start a new game you can pull them out of the Dimensional Box and power up your character. Gameplay: 9/10Sometimes you will get annoyed with how things turn out, but as with many roguelikes, the next run is usually better than the previous. There is also plenty of things to unlock such as more classes and stat perks can be chosen to further customize your character. There are save points like a traditional JRPG, if you find a town you can save your progress. If you just can't let go of that one run, then just fire up the previous save.Graphics: 8/10Classic 16-bit RPG style. One caveat: The game will go fullscreen mode, but there is no way to change the resolution. Compared to the rest of the game, this is a minor gripe.Soundtrack: 8/10 Great! At times I was reminded of greats like Chrono Trigger. It's not that good, but its a very solid soundtrack. Fits the adventuring motif perfectly.Replayability: 10/10This game is an absolute steal on sale for $0.87 on Summer Sale. BUY IT.			"

												This game is very much worth it.Every new random world you regenrate you get different loot and a different terrian,making it possible to immediately find an enemy filled building or have a stroke of luck and find a string of towns.Using the Vault system,you can bring over items from characters when they die to store into the vault,and use them for your next playthrough.Then,you can use hero points which are earned after character death to buy new classes,perks,and vault slots,making it feel like each death actually earns you something(besides goodies for storage in your vault).Overall,an enjoyable experience.

												The world is ending, what do you do? Go out and kick the crap out of a demon lord. But in all seriousness this is a very good game. At its core it's a JRPG but has roguelike mechanics. You start off with 2 classes and a few minor perks(which are optional) and you'll unlock more as you meet certain requirements. Each class can equip basically any type of equipment(which has durability), with each class having their own unique passive ability. For example the hunter has longer range with bows or the knight being able to defend against more attacks. As you travel through the world fighting monsters and visiting towns you'll probably notice the big wall of death to your left. That's pretty much what your trying to stop. Pushing forward while leveling and gearing up seems to be your only option. Eventually you'll make it to the demon lord(hopefully powerful enough to stop him). Died to him, the wilderness, nature, and/or the big wall of looming death? No problem. There's a carry over feature. Every playthrough allows you the chance to purchase perks and transfer items with your hero points(how much you gain depends on your performance). All in all it's a solid game(especially considering the price(even more so during the summer sale)).			"

												So I'm a fan of Rogue-like games and this one caught me a bit off gaurd. At first glance, with the low price and generic look, it seems to be some money-grab like those crappy flash games and sub-par RPGmaker games that were popping up on Steam because Valve just stopped caring what was let into Steam. But after getting it on sale for 87cents (like I said, cheap) I gave it a chance.It surprised me, so far it actually seems to have some serious work put into it. Like the developer actually cares! *gasp*Not to mention it seems like theres a bit of things you can unlock to keep the game engaging and its seemingly randomly generated so theres that. (Rogue-likes usually ARE Randomly generated)7/10 would recommend for such a cheap price if you like Rogue-likes.			"

Some enemies can be a bit overwhelming but you need to learn to not hoard your heals. VERY limited weight capacity can get annoying until you can afford to upgrade. Really need to fix diagonal attacking and moving, can get difficult to use.			"

												For anyone who's a fan of roguelikes, this game is right up your alley. It's actually got a bit of personality above and beyond many roguelikes that are out there, and the pixel graphics really add charm, if they're your style.Progression is quick, and every death seems to lead to either a new bit of knowledge, or extra strength for the next run. It also provides a fine amount of replay, incorporating daily realms and other online elements, so if you're looking for another run on a new class, or a new level of challenge, the game is constantly giving you new stuff to contend with.For whatever reason, the game won't let me play in fullscreen, despite my best efforts to do so, but that's really just a tiny complaint. Same thing for the keyboard-only controls, which thankfully are very simple and intuitive.  All in all, this game provides a remarkable amount of content for under five bucks, and even if it was ten, I'd heartily recommend it to roguelike fans.Final rating: 8/10			"

												This game is AMAZING!I love the music, I love the gameplay, I love the story and characters.But will you love this game?First of all, it's turn-based. Good to think over in critical situations.For these situations there is also a power that gives you the ability to make 5 moves without having fear the darkness swallows you/enemies are beating you. (five uses per run)There are a few ""classes"", like hunter, ""force user"" (the force is similar to magic) and pirate, each with his own unique strengths and weaknesses. On your journey you can find statues, which are giving you stat boosts against reducing your level.The stats of weapons and armor you will find aren't visible from the beginning, but are unlocked once you die or pay someone to reveal them. After you die, you can buy new perks and classes with ""hero points"", you'll get more of them the better your performance was.One of the mechanics I love the most is the ""dimensional vault"". This useful function allows you, once you bought slots with hero points, to carry your best items over to your next character! I've already created a very overpowered blade with it, sharping and boosting it with scrolls again and again in every run ^_^The screen resolution is low, although I think it's OK. The price is awesome, in my opinion it's very cheap! If you're a miser, for example in summer sale 2014 it was reduced to 75%, but if you want to support the developer buy it full priced.(My first review, I'm not a native speaker.)			"

												Amazing blend of classic jRPG and rogue-lite. Original, amazingly deep content, interesting and simple mechanics, fair, really all that's needed for a top notch rogue-lite. It does have some limited saves, but I still think it qualifies. The humor is also very good, and the story surprisingly interesting despite how the entire game can be finished in an hour or so. Which is good because that's a type of game you're meant to finish many times to get the many different endings and face the many different daily challenges.The graphics and soundtrack are also good in a 8-bit kind of way, but the real draw is really the gameplay.It's a very solid recommendation for anyone who likes roguelikes and don't mind jRPGs. If you're a fan of jRPGs and can stomach roguelike mechanics, you should also definitely give it a try, it's an experience you have to make. Easily one of my favorite games.			"

												This is a charming game. It's in the ""easy to learn, difficult to master"" category. You're being chased across the map by inexorable darkness, which can only be defeated by the death of the Demon Lord! It's your job to wander the land, kill monsters, collect loot, sell it (and if you're like me, feel slightly sad at all the town NPCs who get eaten by the encroaching darkness), and kick some Demon Lord butt so you can unlock new classes and abilities. It's a steal at twice the price. (Twice the price, btw, would still only be like $7. I'm broke these days and can afford this game. Go get it!)			"

It's also forgiving to lesser-skilled gamers, as it has difficulty levels, easier and harder dimensions, and persistence between playthroughs with the ability to spend points earned each playthrough on perks, classes, and the ability to transfer items between playthroughs.The art style and music are very charming, and if you like games like the Final Fantasy games for the SNES, you'll love this.

												This is a very nice and interesting game, but it is not perfect. The insta-death if you go to the left is quite a good motivator, and makes you think about what to do and what is worth the risk. Should you go into that dungeon for great treasure? Or should you just run because the darkness is too close?However, i personally believe that it's a bit too easy to outrun. Once you use the diagonal movement, it is actually rather hard to get caught. I understand that it is meant to be playable by most, but i wish there was a mode that made it harder to outrun...			"

												One Way Heroics is simple: pick your class, stats, and perks, and start heading to the right to flee the advancing darkness.  Roguelike influences abound; the game is heavily randomized, and dying will force you to start over again (though your progress can grant you upgrades, like new perks or more storage space to pass items from your dead character to the living ones).The game is perfect for play in short bursts, and can often be found very cheap in the midst of a sale, so you may as well pick it up!

												Fantastic game even if you don't particularly like rogue-likes. Great concept of pacing through being forced along which forces you to be efficient with your turns. There are many ways to win as well as build your character the way you like to play. Be a huge tank with tons of armor and a big axe or an agile hunter and never let enemies touch you or be a straight up treasure hunter and get all the fat loots. This is one of the most well put together rogue-likes and just games in general that I have played.			"

												I'm not really the best at reviews unless I have something..ya know..negative to say about a game. My friend bought me this game, and it's really quite enjoyable. About the only con I have to it, sometimes you either start on a map or explore a map with impassable mountains. Now, there is an option to ""pause"" advancement of the Darkness and enemies for 3 turns I think, but sometimes, that's not enough...and you end up dying :/But yeah, other than that, I really enjoyed this game!

												Basically a rogue-like with a procrastination prevention method.  The Darkness in the game keeps you continually advancing to the right of screen.  Otherwise you die.  This is a consistent play mechanic.  Otherwise the levels, or ""dimensions"" are randomly assigned from a large specifically coded database, and the game saves your last 2 recent ones.  So, if you played a dimension you really liked, you can come back to it.  If the next random one generates a virtually impassable mountain range, you can go back to the first one.  I'd recommend keeping a list of the favourable dimensions.You're given a choice of a variety of classes, with more unlockable as you play, with little restriction on equipment.  Nevertheless, some classes are geared to more specific weapons and styles of play than others.  You can also unlock perks that help out in general, and can give that bit of a boost to a class that may otherwise lie outside your usual play style.  You can also save items and equipment to your Dimension Vault to take between playthroughs, but I haven't found anything awesome enough yet to make it worth finding out how to retrieve it.And fear not, those on lunch breaks, there is a save feature.  It does require either buying a Save Crystal item, or finding an NPC who will save your game.  But if you've invested time on especially the higher difficulties, you can come back to a game you may not have had time to finish in one sitting.As far as price and gameplay value go, it gets a thumbs up from me.

												One Way Heroics is an open-world roguelike.  You explore the world from left to right, running away from the darkness that will literally kill you, so be afraid of the dark.  This is a good feature as it prioritizes movement (such as if that chest behind me is worth getting) rather than just attacking.  Combined with terrain effects, like evasion rising in forests, this is a must-have for such a low price (on sale for 87 cents).  I have only seen movement set up in such importance in those grid-based strategy rpg's like Final Fantasy Tactics.  The random story loading up during the first load is an excellent idea too, and it is pretty decent.You have various classes to try out for replay value.  The only issue I have with this game is that hotkeying isn't really mentioned.  I would prefer to have a hotkey for a few items or skills, but that isn't a big deal.  Neither are the tiny graphics because it can immerse you on your very first play.			"

You get new weapons and killing things along the way to get stronger so you can eventually kill the final boss. Which is impossible on your first runbecause your character carriers certain things over to the next play through. You unlock new perks and classes as you go and can take more and more items from previous playthroughs as well.It is alot of fun.

												I like it. a rougue lite with perma death. It's like a mix of Half Minute Hero and Desktop Dungeon, but with a bit more freedom and longer game sessions - around 20 minutes till the (first?) boss. There is a save feature provided by certain NPCs, so you can experiment during one playthrough and pick it up again at an ealier point - which is very rogue-unlike. Otherwise the meta progression is like in Rogue Legacy and others: You gain points based on your performance and you keep them between sessions  and use them do unlock perks and new classes.

												Really quite a cool little replayable JRPG roguelike with a great personality!  If you enjoy games like Half-Minute Hero and Final Fantasy 1, you'll enjoy this game.  8/8.The replayability feature-set is very similar to Realm of the Mad God.  You gain hero points when you die.  With these hero points you can unlock perks, classes, and add inventory spaces for your ""Dimensional Vault"".  This is where it really gets interesting.  Upon death, you can choose 1 or more items to put in your ""Dimensional Vault"" to make them available on the start of your next game.  Found an awesome weapon or armor that you don't want to lose?  Throw it in the vault and start a new game with a powerful item!  You can increase the capacity of the vault by using more hero points!  Very cool concept!			"

												(/O_O)/  |VVV|  \(O_O\)A unique and easy to learn rogue-like role-playing game. Main gist of the game is that you have to keep going! Why? Behind you all world is falling into the darkness because of the demon lords curse, which you're trying to hunt down. So, taking on this side-scrolling adventure, you have to keep in mind to not waste time on ANYTHING. Yes, don't go into buildings you won't be able to get out of, don't trip, don't fight if you don't have time to and hell don't flirt with the grills, they will vanish in less than a blink. The character design and great humour guarantees some good laughs and is quite refreshing. The price...man, that's almost for free. I can see having spent 50+ hours to play through the basic stuff.So, if you like the art style, rogue-likes or just played a few old rpg's, give this one a try!-I will come back after going real hard on it and see if it holds this awesomeness up!

												Rating: 9/10If you're looking for a roguelike game in an RPG setting, then you will not be disappointed in this game. It offers endless amounts of fun since each game is randomly generated. And to top things off, each game has its own seeded value allowing you to play the same world again if you found it interesting enough!The game has multiplayer in the sense that everyone in the same generated world will be listed at the side of the screen. This makes things interesting as the developers generate daily challenges and list worlds to play on if you wanted a more multiplayer experience.The classes, items, and monsters in the game is solid. The mechanics of climbing mountains and swimming through rivers really create a roguelike atmosphere as moving though the terrain can make your life difficult. So you're forced to path around objects which could force you into bad situations if you're not careful due to the darkness chasing you. The game has different difficulty settings allowing those hardcore roguelike (or RPG) fans to go crazy with their accomplishments.This is a MUST BUY for any RPG fan.			"

It's simple enough on the surface: You must travel across the land to defeat the demon lord in order to stop the approaching darkness. However, there is a huge amount of secrets in the game, from the shady Dark Brotherhood, to the ""tree huggers"" of the Jade Forest group.

												This game is great, I can say that as may times as I need to. The nostalgia of Final Fantasy, the feeling of panic and urgency of a rogue like. The replayability of this game is great and it makes you strive to be better. While alot of RPGs seem to wave loot infront of you so you die countless times to get it you have to meake descisions carefully here, you only get one shot and one wrong move can cut your chance short.While the game has the flaw of being repetitive that's part of the point but you never notice unless you've been playing for hours. The world generation is great and you eventually lear stratigies to over come obstacles that appear each playthrough.This game is a hidden gem on the PC, it doesn't require a beast to run it si it's great.I reccomend grabing it when it's on sale and grabbing the DLC as soon as you can.

												Simply one of the best deals on Steam. While it's not free-to-play, you know what that means these days? It means no microtransactions, no extra bells and whistles tugging at your wallet, what you pay for is what you get, while at a mere $3.50 it might as well be free!As for the game itself? It's GREAT! A frenetic roguelike with an old-school SNES vibe and attractive retro graphics, fast-paced gameplay (despite being turn-based), STACKS of content to unlock, huge replayability and variety, cute design and some amusing humour, this game is MORE than worth the $3.50 asking price. Up there with FTL, Rogues Legacy and The Binding of Isaac as one of the best cheap roguelikes on Steam. Get it. Now.			"

												One Way Heroics is tough rogue-like. I'm not a huge fan of these types of games but the overall look of the game pleased me which prompted me to buy it. Although I haven't played very long I have enjoyed the time I've put in. One Way Heroics is packed with a ton of content on the base game and offers even more with the OWH: PLUS add-on which makes the game even bigger, longer and harder too. The base game goes on sale quite often for a single dollar and should you choose to buy it you won't be disappointed.			"

As you progress you unlock more classes and get to carry over some items from your previous session if you win. The music is appropriate to the genre and pretty good quality, really gets you in that pixil adventuing mood. Not a bad buy at all.			"

												A distinctly (but not stereotypically) Japanese take on the (real) roguelike. Kill things. Collect utility items. Find good gear, hopefully. Carefully contemplate your options as a cabal of imps breathe down your neck. Probably get killed, or more likely kill yourself in a nearsighted blunder. Every once in a blue moon, reach the the Big Bad only to lose your head to a casually-flung fireball. Every once in a hundred blue moons or so, actually kill the guy. It's simpler than, say, Nethack, but bears more depth than grandaddy Rogue.In true roguelike spirit, there is a leveling system, but progression is heavily biased towards gear, and by extension very random.The advancing wall of doom is a unique spin on the roguelike formula, forcing you to budget your actual turns. Can you make it back to the entrance of the dungeon? You can easily kill the enemy harassing you, but do you have time? It creates a real sense of urgency without imposing actual time limits. You have plenty of time to think... about the 8 turns you have remaining before the darkness consumes you.Another unique mechanic is the final boss periodically shows up and harasses you before running away. It's a double-edged sword; this gives you an opportunity to slay him early, if you got lucky enough or twinked over powerful items from your vault. At the same time, you have to know not just when, but HOW to run. The game does warn you when he'll be showing up soon, so you always get a chance to put your pants back on.And unlike your average roguelike, it's controller-friendly, being largely driven by graphical menus as opposed to keystroke commands.If you like very unusual games, buy it. If you enjoy a proper roguelike, buy it. Hell, it's dirt cheap even without a sale. And quite good.			"

												Do not be fooled by the cheap price, this game is worth way more than what it's up for. At first i thought it was going to be another cheesy sidescroller game, and boy was I wrong. This game is absolutely fantastic, a real gem, and I'm suprised it's not exploding. The game is fun. Anyways, enough ranting about how fun it is, here's my pros and cons.PROS: Massive replay value. There is a lot of hidden content, and a lot more to the game than what you see on your first clear.Multiple classes for your own style of adventuring. While this may not seem huge, the differences in classes are a lot more diverse than what you think. Join up with a party of a few people, or go completely ham solo with a knight. Choice is yoursGreat soundtrack. Honestly, i really enjoy the music in this game. It's something i can sit down to, and not mute the game for my own music.Difficulty. This game can throw some suprising difficulty at the most unexpected places. I've died at some very unexpected places. There is a lot of strategy into this game. Very good for those who enjoy a challenge.CONS: Well, I haven't run into anything that would deter me or anyone i know away from the game yet, but I'll update this if I do.			"

												Amazing blend of classic jRPG and rogue-lite. Original, amazingly deep content, interesting and simple mechanics, fair, really all that's needed for a top notch rogue-lite. It does have some limited saves, but I still think it qualifies. The humor is also very good, and the story surprisingly interesting despite how the entire game can be finished in an hour or so. Which is good because that's a type of game you're meant to finish many times to get the many different endings and face the many different daily challenges.The graphics and soundtrack are also good in a 8-bit kind of way, but the real draw is really the gameplay.It's a very solid recommendation for anyone who likes roguelikes and don't mind jRPGs. If you're a fan of jRPGs and can stomach roguelike mechanics, you should also definitely give it a try, it's an experience you have to make. Easily one of my favorite games.			"

												The cheery beat is what got me into the game and I stayed for the tactful gameplay and progression system. You start off as a character with a little gear and a potted plant worth a kings ransom, if you play it on easy. You basically venture through this wonderful 2-D sidescroller fighting baddies and picking up loot all the way. When you die (and you will) you are allowed to pass items down to your decendents through the use of the vault, an expandable bank for the goodies you pick up in your travels. My only tip is to keep a key of seals on you at all times in the later games and always run from golems. No matter how BA you feel you are... they will destroy you.			"

												Probably one of my favorite games on Steam.  It's a rogue-like game, except the catch is the screen is always moving to the right, and if you get swallowed by the darkness on the left side of the screen you die.  It does always keep you moving, and makes exploring the small dungeons you may come across rather quick, but that is part of this game's charm.  It is loads of fun, quite challenging, and has tons of different ends.  Since every world is different, no two games will play the same.  I definitely recommend it (it is 3 dollars, technically under a dollar as of the sale at the time of this review) as it is well worth the money.  And if you like the game, the expansion is also well worth the cost and has some excellent additions to the game.			"

												On sale for less than a dollar, highly reviewed, sure I'll sell a TF2 item and buy it.I looked up 5 hours later after my phone rang. It has been years since I played a game where I did that.This is my very first review ever, in my 3 years of steam. The fact that this game has made me want to write a review is a feat. Enough rambling, to the game.Most 2d tile based rpg lack a real since of progression and story. This is not the case here. I dug deeper into the game, and discovered some secrets that made me cry manly tears. The combat is excellent, and the difficulty is perfect. Easy first difficulty is just hard enough, while the second can still throw a hard curve even to experienced players, but is not frustrating like deaths in minecraft. This game has a storage system you can upgrade to store important items you find on your journey, then use from the beginning on a new world or character. Then there's the random world generation, like Terraria and Minecraft. TL:DRBuy this. It's cheap, and fantastic.			"

And let me tell you, it's a neat little game.I like the concept, and even though each round I have played thus far has been rather short, I'm gathering up Hero Points to apply to further tries. Opening up a little storage vault to put what I find inside, new classes, new abilities... I love how much potential is in this. I haven't played very far yet, but I love what I have seen of it in the time I have played with it. I get the feeling there's no story aside from the shadows on the left are gonna consume everything, and for a little game like this, that is all it needs. The music, though? The music is really good!

												A great roguelite game, which takes the gameplay of classic roguelikes like TOME, etc. but infuses it with new mechanics such as seed sharing, unlockable classes, storing items for future characters, and a unique scrolling mechanic which forces you to move carefully at all times. Recommended, especially on sale!			"

												Bought this for an irresistable $1 when it was 75% off and, this is probably the best $1 I have spent on any game that I have played, let alone all the time I have already invested into it.  To really sum it up, If you grew up playing games like Final Fantasy, Breath of Fire 3, Vandal Hearts and Saga Frontier 2, then this game is right up your alley.   Side note: This game is best played with a USB plug gaming controller in front of a 50"" screen TV.			"

Although it's a bit awkward how they integrated their + Edition, as DLC for the base game, I recommend getting that as well, but by all means check the base game out first, it's not hugely different.

												On the surface, this game looks really simplistic and boring, but once you start playing and failing, you'll quickly realize how much there is going on with this game and how much more there is to do besides just playing through it once. Not to mention that once you start unlocking other classes, it's like learning to play the game all over again.This game is dirt cheap and it's guaranteed to give you hours of gameplay. Buy it.

												To be honest, I was very skeptical when I heard this was a good game. Only after i bought it did I realize that it was true. The game is pretty straight forward and the name doesn't lie; you are forced to move to the right and fight the monsters you come into contact with. Along the way, you may come into contact with some companions that will help you fight. The companions each have their own story and quest that you can complete during your adventure. Collecting food and health items that are scattered throughout the randomly generated map are essential to your survival and can be the deciding factor between victory and a slow failure. There is a begginer mode that lets you fight the final boss after a set amount of time and you get two companions to help you through the battle. The normal mode is actually quite challenging as the final boss will chase you from time to time and the enemies are relentless in their efforts to destroy you. All in all, this game is well worth the money and is fit for those who like to casualy play and for those who like a good challenge from time to time.			"

With infinate number of maps (three of which are challenge/story specific) you will find a lot of replayability and extra content.

Ingame accesable dedicated servers (Offline capable)  Tutorial woven into the story, and intuitiveness allows for learning on the fly easilyCons:  No real multiplayer; just messages people leave, or their dead ghosts that help you   Simplistic graphics (It's a WolfRPG-Maker game though. . .  so, duh.)Final Suggestion:  Get It!!

												OWH is a roguelike RPG in the shape of one of the old classics. Pick your hero and hack your way through one of the many worlds as you try to save it. You can influence your strengths and weaknesses by selecting different perks that'll allow you to increase your attack/health or other stats. A dimensional vault will allow you to carry on the items of your dead hero unto the next unlucky chap in line. It also bears to mention that OWH has one of the most interesting takes on turn-based combat that I've seen for quite some time. While the game is technically ""turn-based"", everything happens in real time. Enemies will move as you move, attack as you attack and so forth. If you don't plan ahead, you'll likely find yourself stuck between 5 killer hounds.Due to the random nature of the game, differences in the gameplay between the classes as well as the ability to have maps randomly generated for you, the replay value of this gem is off the charts. Oh, and the difficulty options will allow you to choose between having a quick 20 minute adventure, or an epic struggle for survival that might stretch on for hours.  With the risk of overselling a bit, One Way Heroics has gorgeous aesthetics, fun gameplay and a great soundtrack. I'd recommend this for anyone who enjoys roguelike games, or RPGs with a bit of a twist.			"

												Good difficulty progression in this game;  was a bit boring after jerryrigging a Godslaying lance five times over and steamrolling everything within 500km of the start each run.This is definitely one of the best rogue-like games out there, I like its concept even better than Rogue Legacy.

												This game is a great 8 bit style game where you run away from the unrelenting darkness through randomly generated worlds. it has an unlock system where you have to do better each time to unlock more points and do better. the main goal is to reach 400 km to fight him. there are several class systems the first 2 you have to work with is swordmaster who is a standard sword wielding character and a knight who has better defense. the rest of the classes have different names than what you would expect an adventurer is really a thief and a hunter is the ranger character. it is a entirely unique game from having a lot of things hidden from the player, such as stats of weapons and armor and the type of enemy's that will spawn. It is player hostile when you first start out and the fairy can be annoying as anything but overall I would recommend this game I  bought it when it was on sale and I wish I could have given them full price because they deserved those extra $2. I give it a  9/10			"

												This is a surprisingly solid title. It's a JRPG turn-based game with roguelike elements. Every decision you make, be it talking or equipping, the darkness moves a tile towards you. If you can't keep the distance from the ever encroaching darkness, you will die. There are varying difficulty levels to try, which presents different kinds of challenges. You can choose among different classes with different playstyles such as Hunter, Pirate, Knight, Bard etcAnd you can unlock perks to customize your classes with or choose to skip them for a greater challenge.Bought it on sale a while ago on chance that it ""might"" be interesting and I was pleasantly surprised :)The price of this title is really cheap and fans of the genre should definitely give this one a go.

												At a non sale-price, this is the best game I've ever managed to find for only $3.49.  It's a fair value given the stigma of the RPG Maker engine, but that stigma is easily made up for with the gameplay, UI, and fun dialogue. The idea is that you're exploring a procedurally generated open-world that is being consumed by a darkness that kills everything in its path. With roguelike turn-based combat, this can make for a very challenging game until you spend a few hours onit. You can play the game with permadeath, as appears to be intended, or save, which is discouraged by several penalties. I recommend playing it as a roguelike. There are quite a few characters with different traits to beat the game with, giving it a lot of replay value, even when the game starts to get a bit easier, too, so if you're a roguelike fan, this one may start to occupy quite a bit of your time.At $3.49, this is a great game, as well as a fantastic way to introduce yourself to roguelikes if you're unfamiliar with the combat style. I would suggest anyone pick it up, if not just for the sake of giving it a try.			"

												A rouge-like RPG that you must run right as fast as you can or you will surely die. But don't forget to fight monsters along the way or you might not have enough loot to go and fight the big bad at the end. The game is turn based, so you can sit and think about what your next move will be, not that it will help because if you have to stop you're more then likely screwed anyway (You're always screwed so that's nothing new). Another thing that can be quite funny is your helper fairy, you ask her questions about thing through out the game, and sometime you can get her to ask you questions like, ""Do heros ever use the restroom?"" Don't worry about death too much though, if you where awesome enough in life, your next life can be even more awesome the next time! Just remember all the gear in the world is useless, unless you equip it! Wait, why would you want to equip me?			"

												This game is really good for the $0.69 I paid! It has a very simple concept, but is also very challenging. You will be fighting stuff thinking it's easy, BUT then something crazy happens and you end up dying. You may have gone into a dark corridor and got stuck inside. Or a monster that looked normal turned out to be hardcore and killed you. Maybe you go into a town and find its surrounded by mountains and you cant get out in time. So you keep trying over and over thinking your last death was a fluke. Only thing i dislike is the ui is a little cluttered for me, but overall I would give it a 9/10.			"

												This game is a fun Roguelike dungeon crawler where the entire world is your ""dungeon"". In this game the world is being engulfed by darkness and you have to outrun it while killing enemies, collecting treasure, and recruiting teammates along the way. Whats more is that each teammate has their own story you gradually learn as they travel with you as well as several alternate endings involving them. The goal of the game is to stop the darkness from spreading which you do by defeating the Dark Lord who appears after 400km (Walk in the park mode) or randomly set distances in every other mode. With Walk in the park (easy) mode the Dark Lord only spawns once but chases you indefinitely until either of you dies while with other modes the Dark Lord will despawn if he doesn't kill you within 3 hours game time (aprox 27 actions) and it's spawn timer will reset.After each attempt win or loose, the dungeon crawler portion of the game kicks in. Your performance will be rated and you will get an amount of hero points based on how well you did. These hero points are used to purchase bonuses to make your future attempts easier such as new perks, more dimensional vault room, and new classes. After your performance is rated if you already have the vault unlocked you are free to move your most important items to the vault which can be withdrawn at the start of your next attempt. I'd also like to point out that this game is very informal both through your fairy companion who answers your questions and through the tips you get if you die which actually analyzes how you diedOverall it's a really fun game I like it			"

The dialog and scripting in the game is well written and amusing--sort of poking fun at both RPGs and platformers. This is a great game if you don't want to commit a lot of brainpower to a game and are looking for something fun to play that is constantly changing.			"

												One Way Heroics is one hell of an interesting concept - A mix of 'forced scrolling' RPG concept, as said by the developer, Smoking WOLF, himself on his triumphant Playsim product page:Originally posted by Smoking WOLF: Over time the belief that I could create a fun Forced-Scrolling RPG got stronger, and I decided I’d give developing it a go. The result of that attempt is this game: One Way Heroics.	 I have to say, it is strangely addicting at the least, and the addition of forced scrolling really adds an extra level of depth to an RPG concept. The game plays like a rougelike 8-bit top down JRPG, if you can imagine that - every step you take, and every action you take, a turn is made. The game will then play out the rest of the character on the screen's moves - damage taken, monsters moved, status effects applied. There's a catch, though. The world you are in is subjected by an encroaching 'darkness', which will move from the left edge of the screen by one pixel every turn. A cold, chilling touch from this darkness will send your body flying into the air (or so you're told) and your character will die from what I assume to be asyphxiation from the cold vacuum of space. So effectively, you must plan your next moves, and be sure you aren't trapped or caught fighting, or else succumb to a frosty death. Combat in the game is that of classic rougelike RPGs - press a button to attack, and you will attack in that direction. This makes combat smooth and doesn't impede on the sense of urgency the scrolling darkness imposes. You will soon find yourself trotting along the landscape, uninterupted and fleeting from the ever-infringing darkness. However, it does have the challenge to it - after all, it is a rougelike and will have different layouts if you so choose to play a randomly generated one. Sometimes, the game will throw obstacles in your way that require you to think ahead in order to escape the deathly left edge of the screen - climbing mountains, swimming through water, fighting, breaking down walls will take precious turns, and you must decide weather if you can wing it, or play it safe. What I love about this game and has kept me intrigued is the progression, not only through one game session but across multiple game sessions - a la Rouge Legacy, at the end of each session you will gain 'Hero Points', points that allow you to unlock various different starting perks, and allow you to purchase new classes if you don't want to meet the objectives for unlocking them. From this, I take away a kind of Dark Souls mentality - your starting class is just what you start with, and what you make of your character during the game is up to you, for example I could start with a knight class, which has low agility, but stack agility starting perks to make him agile and combo more hits in an attack turn. This allowed me to decide right at the start of an adventure what kind of character I wanted to play - the treasure hunter, who has a high lockpicking skill, the ranged hero, who is quick to escape, or the tank, who has high vitality. It also has the allure of getting benifits from NPCs, too. There is a gold system in place, and you'll find yourself picking up strewn items (which are abundant) from the floor and selling them for cash at the next town or city you come across. Overall, the game definately hits all the right RPG notes whilst still maintaining action. Characters can have party members, different classes, spells, abilities and must actively manage their time, stamina and energy to escape the darkness and ultimately defeat the demon lord. You can also choose the level of challenge you want, each world you choose will give you the option to play 'A Walk In The Park' mode which pits you against the boss at a certain distance travelled, or 'Afternoon Stroll' where the boss will appear at different intervals. Music will change dynamically depending on the terrain you're in, for example in a dungeon or in a town, and the art style is the classic 8-bit sprite look. If you're a fan of roguelike RPGs like Sword of the Star and Half Minute Hero, then you'll love this game, and the apocalyptic twist of darkness chasing you will add a refreshing approach to the RPG genre. That being said, it is a very unique experience and you'd really have to try it out to understand the game.			"

It can be hard at first, but each time you learn from your mistakes and you improve you score. You really have the feeling that you progress, that you're getting better, and it's great. And it's cheap. So what are you waiting for? If you like Rpg, rogue-like and if you have like 2 or 3 euros, just buy it! You'll not regret it.			"

												   A great, simple and entertaing Rogue-like rpg with a twist.This games offers engaging sessions of rogue-like adventuring , while being able to persistently unlock new features such as classes, perks and more. While its gameplay mechanics are pretty simple, there are many combinations of randomly-generated equipment, skills and events for you character. Each class is a bit different in terms of gameplay so you'll probably be wanting to try out every available combination of class+perks more than once. The gameplay gets repetitive after a while so I doubt anyone would be playing it 24/7 nonstop, but nevertheless it's a good experience for its price.   One of the few features that caught my eye was a 'Daily Online Challenge' or 'Campaign Dimensions'. Each day the seed is generated for a world where everyone who plays a game can join. While it's impossible to interact directly with other players you can encounter the ghosts of defeated players and read the recent chat logs of other adventurers, how much time they have spent, who killed them and what items they have obtained in this world.   Same with the 'online' adventures, new adventures with different conditions are also generated daily. E.g. The ones where you can recruit a powerful ally, or a world covered in constant darkness, limiting your vision.9/10 will play again.			"

												While still in progress, one way heroics is definetly a new, origanal take on rpg's, where instead of being given unlimited time, is constantly forced to keep moving. It has several key features that makes it stand out, such as apprasals, to find out the stats of randomly found items, forced to eat to regenerate energy, and more. And with several things such as perks and class to change your playstyle, it's not straying to far from popular RPG's to the point that it's risky. My personal favorite is that one playthrough takes 15 minutes, 20 tops. Only got a little bit of time? Not a problem. I'd recommemd this to anybody who is even remotely interested in RPG's, because if as, I can almost guarentee it's worth your cash. And even if it's unsatisfactory, it only cost a few bucks! "

												Basically a rogue-like with a procrastination prevention method.  The Darkness in the game keeps you continually advancing to the right of screen.  Otherwise you die.  This is a consistent play mechanic.  Otherwise the levels, or ""dimensions"" are randomly assigned from a large specifically coded database, and the game saves your last 2 recent ones.  So, if you played a dimension you really liked, you can come back to it.  If the next random one generates a virtually impassable mountain range, you can go back to the first one.  I'd recommend keeping a list of the favourable dimensions.You're given a choice of a variety of classes, with more unlockable as you play, with little restriction on equipment.  Nevertheless, some classes are geared to more specific weapons and styles of play than others.  You can also unlock perks that help out in general, and can give that bit of a boost to a class that may otherwise lie outside your usual play style.  You can also save items and equipment to your Dimension Vault to take between playthroughs, but I haven't found anything awesome enough yet to make it worth finding out how to retrieve it.And fear not, those on lunch breaks, there is a save feature.  It does require either buying a Save Crystal item, or finding an NPC who will save your game.  But if you've invested time on especially the higher difficulties, you can come back to a game you may not have had time to finish in one sitting.As far as price and gameplay value go, it gets a thumbs up from me.

Anyone who has played true Roguelikes (Rogue, NetHack, Moria etc) will feel instantly at home with the turn based, permadeath nature of the game.Fiendishly difficult, but rewarding too. Highly recommended.Buy it.			"

												An amazing adventure! This game is just fun, You will really want to play and play and play... I just cannot believe the price I paid for it, its too damn cheap.Edit: When i first wrote this review I just completed the game in ""A walk in the Park"" difficult. I thought that was it, now restart with another class and do the same thing over and over. I was wrong!When you play in the second difficult you dont end the game at 400km, you go until 2000km and it rises matching the difficult you choose. Now the REAL adventure begins. Im about 800m with my Bard and already rescued a girl and she joined me in my adventure, my pet died =/ , discovered the Dark Brotherhood, elven villages etc. Im really impressed with this game. This has even some Game of Thrones itens ;)			"

												""Journal Excerpt No. 5: Hefting my Longsword on my shoulder I sprinted away from the golem. In past lives I have always been killed by golems. This time I hope to escape. I used my awakening power to stop time for a short while so I can easily escape the golem. Finding a small village I ran inside hoping for the guards to save me. The golem took them apart. Suddenly my way was blocked by a mountain pass. There was no way I could scale it in time without taking a dozen hits from the monster. I am doomed. My last thoughts as the golem clobbers me is this, 'I hope that this haracter earns lots of hero points' ""This is a very fun rogue-like. Dont be confused about my lack of play time because I have played this before it was released on Steam.Basically it is a rogue-like game that is different in the fact that there are no real dungeons and the ""darkness"" follows you across the world. Touching the darkness kills you instantly.There is still random treasure and random world generation but it has a different spin on it. Instead of dungeons and narrow, dark pathways, it is a large strip of earth with mountains, water and lava. There are random NPC'S and little monster houses that are filled with enemies and treasure.Each game that you start you choose your characters name, class and up to 3 perks that change the gameplay. Each time that you die (it will happen) you are awarded ""Hero Points"" based on things like how far your guy got, what level you died at, how many monsters you killed and the like. These Hero Points are used to buy things like more classes, more perks and let you upgrade the amount of slots in this Between-Game inventory. This inventory lets you save OP items and stuff that you got in your last game to be used in your next game. you need to buy the slots though.It isnt a very difficult game to grasp. On my first game my Hero Point score was 3.  By my second my Hero Point score was 8, and by my third my score was 91 due to killing the final boss and being an all-around nice guy. These were all on the easy mode though. The next mode is much harder.For $3.50 I recommend this game for being simple, fun and have tons of replayability.			"

												I was a bit skeptical about this one, but it came as part of a bundle at an amazing price, and for its simplicity, the replay value is imense. You go on a moderate length (10-40 minute) campaign through either a random or known world, killing, shopping, levelling up, etc. and then you either die or fight a boss. Each playthrough unlocks a bit more to make future attempts easier. A style game I enjoy that others may not.			"

												Surprisingly fun. I saw this on sale a few times and thought it looked really boring (going in one direction with little plot), but its more than just that. It's difficult to start at first because of the lack of a tutorial and how punishing the game is even early on. After the first few deaths, though, you get the hang of it and it starts to get fun - you can upgrade your weapon infinitely (or at least I've put about 10 upgrades on my sword at one point) and you can recruit different people to your party. Among many other small things, I think this game should be tried and is definitely worth more than the price tag.			"

Challenging pathways force you to make decisions that might not end up in your favor. Every step is precious and so is every attack as well. The game reminds me of Fire Emblem and other rpgs for the gameboy color. I bought it for less than a dollar and I could actually pay more for the game after playing. It's definitely something to do in-between games or if you're bored. Be careful, it is very addicting.			"

												Recently got this game after seeing video of it online and I have to say I'm very pleased already.  This game is deceptively simple, appearing like a normal roguelike in gameplay and presentation, but the more you play the more you learn it has surprising depth of mechanics and writing, getting this for such an astoundingly cheap price is well worth your money.Starting with two available classes - Swordmaster who's good with combo hits and Knight who starts with a shield for extra defence you unlock more classes either by performing certain actions in game or by 'buying' them with the Hero Points you earn after each playthrough.  Hero Points can also be used to unlock new Perks you can add to your character at the start of an adventure or to expand your Dimensional Vault which allows you to store items from characters you've played then give them to a new character to start off stronger - very helpful for the higher, harder difficulties.In short I highly recommend this deceptively simple, tremendously affordable and greatly fun game to anyone a fan of RPGs and Roguelikes.

												It was hard to understand how the game worked at first, but after a little bit I figured it out. It's a simple game with an interesting concept. You can only move in one direction, hence the title. If you are caught on the far left side of the screen, you can die. So you always have to move forward. Each move causes the screen to move, so the more time you waste in one position, the less time you have to escape the left side of the screen. It sounds weird but you'll understand when you get into the game. Now, the game is simple, you buy equipment, level up, and defeat enemies. It's pretty difficult to fight the first boss at first, but at least you can transfer items from your first playthrough to the next one, making it easier. You can also receruit party members if your charisma is high enough. Just like in Magicite, another permanent death game, the point is to play multiple times to increase your stats and chances of survival. You'll get more bonuses to your character and it'll be easier to move on. The game is great when it's on sale! I think I got it for less than a dollar.			"

												If you're looking for an arcade-depth roguelike, you've found it! While it lacks the depth and intricacies of the pure breeds of the genre, such as the classic ADOM or more recent Dungeons of Dredmor, this game delivers familiar mechanics in a session you can begin AND win within an hour. The gimmick is simple, darkness is literally spreading across the land from the left side of the screen to the right, forcing you to run from it at all times. Every encounter or location you try to explore is an opportunity cost, and time is precious. However, failure to probe enough of the world will result in insufficient necessary medical supplies or a total lack of gear in time for the boss fight, should you survive long enough to hike to it. It follows a lot of the genre's standards, such as the world not moving until you take your actions, but since it is more simplistic, it adds something most roguelikes cannot do comfortably: 360 Controller support. Another fun feature is the world is generated by a key phrase, so you can replay a particular map, or seed a new one by letting your cat walk across your keyboard.			"

I like the campaign where you are travelling with the king. I hope there are more bosses and we could reach more than 400 m (it would be great if it's longer or make an endless mode game for longer journey)			"

												I'm usually a guy that requires graphics and gameplay however occasionally there is a ""Super Nintendo"" graphic game that comes out and shines for me.  This is one of those games.  Reading the overall concept of the game my first impression was, ok it's a half minute hero redub, And in some ways it does feel like that when you play it.  It really is not though.  Each time you finish a dungeon for better or worse you get points that you can use to unlock new classes, abilities, and storage slots.  This allows you to play as that new class your next play through or maybe carry some gear over from your previous experience.  The world generator while it is random using an 8 digit code that you can even manually control to challenge friends to the same world is fun even if in the end its all the same concept behind things.  There are various terrains as you travel through the different worlds to change up scenery now and again. And when you beat a world it will list off everyone else that had beaten it as well (if anyone) providing you are doing online synch updates.  Mind you the amount of possibilities of worlds is next to endless so unless you are actually writing down codes from friends for challenges you may always be the first one to beat a world.  All in all I give this game a good recommendation.			"

												Surprisingly fun. I saw this on sale a few times and thought it looked really boring (going in one direction with little plot), but its more than just that. It's difficult to start at first because of the lack of a tutorial and how punishing the game is even early on. After the first few deaths, though, you get the hang of it and it starts to get fun - you can upgrade your weapon infinitely (or at least I've put about 10 upgrades on my sword at one point) and you can recruit different people to your party. Among many other small things, I think this game should be tried and is definitely worth more than the price tag.			"

												I've beaten the end boss twice now and really like the pacing of this game. It's a classic roguelike in that enemies move only when you move / perform some action and the forced scrolling mechanic adds an interesting element to navigation. The average playtime for a successful run is 20-30 minutes, although I've only done the walk in the park mode. The dimensional chest also adds a nice way to store gear for a different class that may drop during your run. Overall I'm very happy and you can't beat the price - 87 cents during the Winter Sale. I'm even considering buying this for a few of my friends to share this gem and help support the dev since they did a stellar job with this.			"

												Brilliant, play it.It has a reasonable art style (despite the low resolution - it's a 2D game so it only hurts it to some extent, but a higher resolution and some more work on the artworks would ahve made it truly splendid), very good music (also reminiscent of Final Fantasy Tactics and the like, which is an added value to me) and awesomely solid mechanics.Some expansion could be very good to enhance the longevity of the game, which isn't bad at all anyway: I managed to finish it on easy, but there are tons of difficulty levels and even the medium one is very challenging; you can customise your character a lot and there are a bunch of interesting classes to choose from, so you will spend some time playing it; after all, it's a roguelike with elements of progression between the individual runs, so it is built upon replayability.

												I bought this game on sale for $0.87, and I feel a little bad for doing so because this game is worth much more than its full price.One Way Heroics is, as you probably already know, a scrolling roguelike in which if you get stuck in the darkness, it's game over. I can't speak much to the mechanics here - they are standard roguelike mechanics and, while there are a few imaginative additions (pills of teleportation, buddy tablets, etc), the game plays essentially like the standard roguelike. The gameplay is solid, and outperforms many other well-recognized roguelikes, but doesn't attempt to re-invent the genre.The charm of the game is in how well it is built. I enjoy the music and the look and feel of the world, as well as the characters (most of whom only have a few lines of dialogue). The world feels varied and interesting thanks to a variety of enemies and enemy modifiers, multiple area types (such as mountainous regions that force careful movement planning or deserts that drain energy), and NPC encounters. The fact that the game will generate a world based on an alphanumeric codeword is also a plus, since it can make every run different. To sum up: Aside from the scrolling mechanic, the game doesn't do anything new or different. But it doesn't really have to. It's well put-together, carries its own brand of charm, and it's definitely worth the $3 pricetag.			"

Graphics do not make a game, and if you're not going to play this just because of the graphics, you're missing out. I definitely recommend this game.			"

												One Way Heroics might look like a cheap and generic jrpg made in rpg-maker but it's definitely not the case.The game is a procedurally generated turn-based roguelike with many interesting features. One of the most noticable ones is that the game takes place on a world map, each move will take you one turn and the darkness on the left side of the screen will draw closer. Basically as you move and battle across the world, darkness will consume everything behind you. Be it an enemy, friendly npc, objects or the entire terrain. You have to avoid it at all costs. During your journey you can find various loot and treasures. From simple weapons and armors up to supplies and precious magic scrolls. The rpg mechanics are fairly generic, you defeat enemies and gain level points which can be spent later on cetain spots on the map. Although you still increase your stats normally by gaining experience. Various weapons and armors have different attributes. Scrolls and magic items might have special abilities, pretty much the usual roguelike stuff.Combat is extremely simple and only requires you to attack the enemy by pressing one key, then a series of dice rolls will determine everything. It's not that engaging but yet very enjoyable mainly due to the smooth controls and fast pace of the game. Your character has certain special abilities though that require stamina points which are automatically generated as long as your energy is high enough. Energy is another ressource and acts mostly as a starvation meter. You lose energy with each term and depending on the terrain, you might lose even more. You refill your energy by consuming various food items.Now let me explain the goal of the game and perhaps one of it's more compelling features. As soon as you start a new run, your goal is to defeat the Demon Lord which appears in 400km in the world map. During those 400km, you want to level up and get the most loot in order to prepare for the final encounter. But due to the darkness, time  management is vital and you have to carefully plan ahead your moves. Even if the combat is simple, there are many things to take into factor. For instance various terrain types can give you additional bonues/mali, some enemies are more resistant than others to various weapons. Furthermore with the spreading darkness, you really want to make the combat the most efficent as possible. Turning it into somewhat of a puzzle game. During your journey, you can also meet tons of charactets that have their own quests, some may join you on your journey. Others provide services or act as merchants. Finally there is a lot of variety and content in this game, there are tons of classes and things to unlock. Each generated map feels really unique and offers different challenges.Also the game let's you save items that your next character can chose right at the start of a new run. So there is some progression in this game, furthermore you can spent a rare currency to save at certain points of the maps.To conclude, there is a lot to talk about but this game is definitely a blast to play and offers something refreshing to the roguelike formula. It really conveys a sense of adventure.			"

												One Way Heroics emulates the aesthetic of old school JRPGs without feeling like it’s trying too hard to recapture nostalgia. With each procedurally generated world, each combination of Perks and Classes, and each difficulty level, there are infinite gameplay experiences possible. If you’re a fan of sprite-based JRPGs and want a break from traditional turn-based combat and random battles, I would highly suggest you check out One Way Heroics. The simplicity of the game makes it easy to get into and hard to put down, creating an experience that borders on addiction.			"

												Love it. I wanted to punch it. I couldn't stand the fact I had to have a 4:3 aspect ratio. The graphics were pretty average. Then I played it through a few times, got off my high horse and realised a few things.First, they way they've designed it, you need to maintain a 4:3 ratio. widescreen would change the scrolling field of view and actually change the game, making it easier. So, i moved on from that.Then I moved on from the graphics. After all - I still play Master of Magic. Sure, that game is 21 years old and this game is the ripe old age of 1, but hey - the old adage that playability trumps graphics is alive and well.The other comment to make is the balance. Some rogue-likes out at the moment are really hard. Fun, but searingly hard. This one is still damn hard, but play it through a few times and you can absolutely get your wins. Loving it. And it's crazy good value! Particularly right now. It's on sale for $1.18. That's just stupid. As in, stupidly good. You pay more than that for a piece of crap on the iTunes store... AND you then need to give them $25 just to actually be buffed enough to win. Summary: A nice indie gamer. Fun. Replayable. Easy to get into but with a bit of depth. You win some, you lose some, and it's all gravy!			"

They are right on the replay value and the game is a great price. (87 cents on sale atm, what do you have to lose?)     Like they mentioned, some issues are mouse support and resolution. But it doesnt really mean much when you play.			"

												So I'm a fan of Rogue-like games and this one caught me a bit off gaurd. At first glance, with the low price and generic look, it seems to be some money-grab like those crappy flash games and sub-par RPGmaker games that were popping up on Steam because Valve just stopped caring what was let into Steam. But after getting it on sale for 87cents (like I said, cheap) I gave it a chance.It surprised me, so far it actually seems to have some serious work put into it. Like the developer actually cares! *gasp*Not to mention it seems like theres a bit of things you can unlock to keep the game engaging and its seemingly randomly generated so theres that. (Rogue-likes usually ARE Randomly generated)7/10 would recommend for such a cheap price if you like Rogue-likes.			"

												This game is unbelievably addictive. I love the sprite art too, reminds me of old NES games. The music reminds me of wonderful JRPG scores from the early 2000s. That's just my first impression. This game combines elements of RPGs but is a ""GO RIGHT"" platformer. The challenges are sometimes very difficult, but always a lot of fun. The dialog and scripting in the game is well written and amusing--sort of poking fun at both RPGs and platformers. This is a great game if you don't want to commit a lot of brainpower to a game and are looking for something fun to play that is constantly changing.			"

												You are the ""hero"" and apperently the only one smart enough to run from the approaching darkness, which kills everything in its path. Every step and action you take will make the darkness come closer. So its always a gamble: ""Can I enter and leave the building in time beofre the darkness kills me?"" ""Can I break through this wall fast enough or should I search for another exit?""Also you have to choose which way to go, which area to explore, which monster to fight and of course which items to equip. After you die you get a rating based on how well you have been doing. This results in points which can be spent by unlocking classes, perks and the heroes vault, which lets you deposit some of the items you have found before you died.A fun roguelike-ish RPG with lots of content (especially considering the price).

												This game is a fun Roguelike dungeon crawler where the entire world is your ""dungeon"". In this game the world is being engulfed by darkness and you have to outrun it while killing enemies, collecting treasure, and recruiting teammates along the way. Whats more is that each teammate has their own story you gradually learn as they travel with you as well as several alternate endings involving them. The goal of the game is to stop the darkness from spreading which you do by defeating the Dark Lord who appears after 400km (Walk in the park mode) or randomly set distances in every other mode. With Walk in the park (easy) mode the Dark Lord only spawns once but chases you indefinitely until either of you dies while with other modes the Dark Lord will despawn if he doesn't kill you within 3 hours game time (aprox 27 actions) and it's spawn timer will reset.After each attempt win or loose, the dungeon crawler portion of the game kicks in. Your performance will be rated and you will get an amount of hero points based on how well you did. These hero points are used to purchase bonuses to make your future attempts easier such as new perks, more dimensional vault room, and new classes. After your performance is rated if you already have the vault unlocked you are free to move your most important items to the vault which can be withdrawn at the start of your next attempt. I'd also like to point out that this game is very informal both through your fairy companion who answers your questions and through the tips you get if you die which actually analyzes how you diedOverall it's a really fun game I like it			"

												In response to the final boss assaulting me early in my journey, I ripped all my clothes off and beat him to death with my bare hands.  What's not to love about that?Normally I don't enjoy rogue-likes because dying usually just means losing all your work, but this game really handles that sense of achievement and constant growth despite death very well.  This is a really snazzy game, and you'd be doing yourself a disservice if you didn't give it a try.			"

												Bought this game for 87 cents.  Worth at least 10 bucks.  By far the most fun I've had playing a rogue like game.  The music is cool, the graphics have a neat Final Fantasy feel, and talking to the fairy is amusing.  Lots of different items to find, as well  as hidden secrets.  One playthrough lasts maybe 30 minutes to an hour, but you'll want to unlock more perks/classes/vault space and have another go at that arrogant demon king.  Just beat the easiest difficulty with Slinky the Swordmaster, and I look forward to playing several more times to beat the other difficulties.  A different world can be generated every time, so there is a ton of replayability.  Since death is frequent and still yields hero points to spend on unlocks, it is a great game to chill with.  Laughed hard when I realized my poor hunter Sasha got set on fire with her own flammable potion.  Definitely pick this up if you like rogue likes. love that old school feel, and are looking for a game that is challenging but not frustrating.			"

												This game is probably the most worthwhile purchase I've made on Steam thus far. I bought it for $0.87 during the summer sale and definitely didn't expect to get as much mileage out of it as I am. One Way Heroics starts with a pretty simple plot and concept, but there's a lot lurking beneath the surface. What starts off as a simple JRPG excuse plot-- the encroaching darkness that you have to defeat-- actually serves as an interesting and challenging game mechanic. Since you're constantly advancing and trying to stay as far ahead of the Darkness as possible, you're basically forced to make decisions about where you go, who you fight, and what dungeons and towns are worth investigating. Add the class/perk character customization system, and you can pretty much play this game in any way you choose (once you unlock the classes and perks with Hero Points, anyway).I liked the fact that after you die the results screen actually gives you an evaluation and advice on how to succeed in your next run. The Hero Point/Dimensional Vault system is also pretty interesting; having your previous runs contribute to your next feels a lot more satisfying than just having your saves wiped whenever you die. Despite these concessions and the save system that allows you to savescum if you want to, the game is still challenging and fun to play. If you like roguelikes, you really can't go wrong with this one, especially for the price (even when it's not on sale!). I've played way too much of this game and don't plan to stop anytime soon. Not until I reach 10,000 km!			"

												This is one of the best cheap games I have ever played. I feel compelled to play it again and again. It's a game that you can play for a few minutes or a few hours, even while you're doing something else. The controls are a bit awkward if you are using only a keyboard, but it's not terrible when you get used to it. Being a naked hero is too much fun. I've spent 10 times more money on games that were much less fun.			"

												A very fun and challenging game.  Takes a lot of skill and luck to save abilities and items for when you need them most and to find better items.  The game mechanic of the darkness makes the game challenging as you can't linger in an area searching for goods forever which forces you to press on.  One way heroics is a great cheap and quick game to play that provides a challenge to the player.			"

												I have only played a few hours of this game but man is it well done. To not spoil anything too much, I'm just going to make a list of some Pros and Cons for One Way Heroics. Pros:1. Randomly generated world2. Well done rpg/strategy system3. Good graphics4. Great music5. Game controls work well whether you use an old controller (such as a Logitech f310 gamepad) or a keyboard. 6. Rewards system after the end of each runCons: 1. The options menu can be limited. I did have a problem with it at first but I got over it.2. Can be hard to read everything that is in small text on the screen. I hooked up my laptop to my TV with an HDMI cable while playing One Way Heroics and even though it helped somewhat with what I was doing it could be improved on.3. Very simplistic. For some it may be boring because of how simple the game it is, but for others like me it's fine since it's not at all complicated. Summary:Overall this is a very well done game. If you only have a few dollars for Steam, I would recommend giving this game a shot. Some people may not enjoy this game and other people will, but as for me I enjoyed it.  "

												Fun game. Reminds me of the past final fantasies, which is a huge plus in my book. It also seems from what I have played so far to rely on multiple playthroughs. But, I feel this game will be able to entertain you for quite a while.			"

												Good difficulty progression in this game;  was a bit boring after jerryrigging a Godslaying lance five times over and steamrolling everything within 500km of the start each run.This is definitely one of the best rogue-like games out there, I like its concept even better than Rogue Legacy.

												Okay, so this is an excellent little game. It is fairly simple and easy to get into. I'm generally not one to really care about completing a game and getting all the achievements, but this is one of those games that I've actually taken the time to get the achievements, because it's very replayable. Of course, it's a game where you will die often, until you get the hang of it. Of course, it won't bother you very much because you are able to save items for when you start over. There actually is a save function in the game, but I personally never felt the need to start over from a save. I simply started all over and did it again. This game is strangely addicting and it's easy to lose a few hours any time you start playing it. I give it a 9/10 because no game is perfect, but this game is very good for what it is, and definitely worth the small price tag.			"

												Neat game, but with a steep learning curve at the beginning. If you enjoy roguelikes and short playthroughs, this is an inexpensive game to try.I'd compare the permadeath with minor advancement each death to Rogue Legacy. It's fun even if it's frustrating.			"

												Buy it. I am really moved by the plot, once you are smart enough to see through the veil and get to the deeper part of the characters and their backstories and the future you want to create for them.Let's start with the pros:Maps related;- Enough rogue like elements to keep players who wants new experience every time interested (create random world/enter different map codes)- Rogue-like features frustrates you? Don't worry, you get to stay on the same map and die as many times as you want if it pleases you. In another word, this game will provide you the opportunity to get a good learning curve, and the elements to make your future gameplay easier or more challenging, totally by your choice (such as using pre-saved items from last playthrough/death or not doing that and just hop right into a new world)- Maps aren't just 'different', they have different characteristics, coming with different perks and extra challenge. Pick according to your own liking/style (some of them are pre-sets with description, no worry of getting confused!)In another word, a great deal of variety for gameplay experience and control on difficulties, pick as you desired or just go random!.Gameplay;- Interesting game mechanics; More than 'move and attack'. Different classes have totally different play style (aside from knight and swordman, the 2 starting classes. Tho not having the same stats and starting items already meant a great deal of deaths and exploring for new players until they got lucky or unlock other classes). Strategies are based around classes more than how skillful you are. Also, you are at risk every moment. Move to the right or be annihilated!- Challenging; this is a game that you will die quite a lot in it. Is it unfair tho? Like, deliberately making the game overly punishing or clunky to play? No, nothing of those. ""How to win"" is something that needs to be learned in this game. Game difficulty scales according to how far you traveled, so no 'getting to level 99 and 1 shot the boss'. Try that and you will get one shot by a skeleton instead.Plot:- IT HAS DEPTH. Esp consider the different worlds you play in and as a result, having different play route/traveling experience. Without trying to get all the NPCS, it took me 3 clears to fully understand the story of this game, which left me almost in tears when I finally 'know'. All the npcs have more personality than you do :0) Music:- I like them. That small ense of sadness coming from them fits very well with the atmosphere and the plot of the game.There is so much heart in this game that this sales is totally not doing it justice!Ok, as for the cons: One may complain about it being 'too short' i guess. As much as I liked it, I am a bit disappointed when I see that I have only 13.4 hours on it... well, there's only that much it can offer I suppose. That keeps it concise tho! I am just sad that it ended so soon hm...Game can be a bit too punishing/unfair at times :0) like, a wrong map for new players whatnot.... that is compensated by allowing players to try different maps, preset or no. Also there are lots of sharing/walkthroughs online, just try google. Seriously tho, just because it's pixiled which may or may not remind you of FF/dragon quest, doesn't mean ""One Way Heroic"" is as easy when you first started; just move, encounter, level up and kick♥♥♥♥♥ Doesn't work like that, and it will be your♥♥♥♥♥that is kicked.No other complaints really, you'll find the game quite fair once you actually start playing it.For any RPG fan that doesn't mind a challenge, 10/10 must buy, esp consider its low price. You'll find it worth it, the creators deserve the respect.Extra points if you're into oldschool RPG music and characters development.... no, just the NPCs, you are as uninteresting as you ever are.EDIT: NO ""WALK IN THE PARK"" DIFFICULTY IS ALLOWED			"

												Got this on sale a while back for less than a dollar. Still trying to beat it. Worth even more than its original price. Graphics: Old-school graphics, which can be a boon or curse depending on your tastes. Art style for the characters is anime-style, and I kinda like the sketch style for the PC portrait.Sound and Music: the music is pretty good( especially in snow terrain), though one track seems to cut out a little when it loops. The Music does fit the mood really well every time, though. Sound effects are nothing special. Story: Being a rogue-lite, the story isn't all deep and engrossing as the heavier hitters, but has some interesting twists.Characters: Pretty likable, actually. The way they develop as you go on your journey is great and while they're not totally original, they're awesome nonetheless. ( and the endings can get pretty touching.)Gameplay: If you're dipping your feet in the rogue genre, this would be a great place to start. The Ransom aspect is there( provided you don't make perfect world by abusing the world naming system) and death is permanent, but you can reload from saves, provided you have the crystals or luck, the awakening skill helps save your♥♥♥♥♥if things don't go as planned, and the Vault helps with later playthroughs. The idea of using levels as potential stat boosters is great. There's a variety of classes, each with their own playstyle(defense, long-range, offense, charisma, etc.), though you'll have to earn a few before you get them. I love the simple idea of the side-scrolling aspect; it leads to some very tense moments( especially when in dungeons or near mountains.)And the little touches, like the NPC dialog, the varying levels for enemies, the differeing difficulties, the replays,  and even the multiplayer aspects( no co-op, but there is a way they can help... and you can show how awesome you are when you clear a world.)All in all, if you can live with the old-school graphics, the relative lack of multiplayer and the rogue-liteness, you'll find a game that is well worth or even more than the price. ( and also, keep an eye on a sequel, which is in developement at the time of this writing.)			"
