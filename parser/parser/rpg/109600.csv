												I liked this game up until about four to six months ago. The game was fun to play, had some intuitive controls, and had graphics that I've never seen in another MMO.However, it has turned into nothing but a money grab.The devs have made absolutely abismal design choices, and have made no indication that they're going to stop. The most recent is Module 6, which was chocked full of awful surprises. It raised he level cap, but in order to get to it you were stripped of your epic/legendary gear that you JUST obtained through the last module released four months prior. On top of this, the new maps that you have to play through to get there are a massive grind, made from minimally reworked content. Endgame content was made virtually impossible, and was filled with bugs.Back to the money grab though. Basically, what it comes down to, is that this game belongs to Cryptic Studios. They've made that abundantly clear. It doesn't belong to the players a single bit. ANY purchase you make belongs to them, and they have a right to change the parameters of that purchase at any time; for instance, the bags from the cash shop that WERE bound to your account were just changed to be bound to character on equip. Considering that your character, given they have an empty bag slot, will automatically put it on when you purchase it, this basically means that the bags are now bind-to-character-on-purchase.Why would they make such a change? What does it fix? Well, I have the answer for you: It sells their bags. Or so they think. With this ""patch,"" they released a bag with a few more slots on the cash shop.Mind you, this patch was added AFTER a new dev acknowledged all the problems with their pre-alpha-quality module, and said that he would ""work hard"" to ""fix the problems on hand."" His first action was to fix almost nothing that anyone had complaints about, and try to score Cryptic some more cash.This game is just too wildly inconsistant. Even purchases that I've made have been changed. I purchased the Bahamut Legacy pack off of the cash shop, because it came with a title, some costume weapons (or ""transmutes"" as they're called), and a companion. Up until recently, these weapons were reclaimable on any character multiple times, in case you wanted to get your free weapon change at any level. This is the case no longer. If you want your weapon to have the Bahamut style, you must now spend an excess of Astral Diamonds to transmute your new weapon into your old, crappy one.Cryptic is not about customer convenience. They are about THEIR convenience, and nothing else. Any and all of their ""convenience"" items are slowly being made as inconvenient as humanly possible, given they aren't already. I wouldn't be surprised if account-wide mounts were made to be purchased on each individual character in an upcoming patch.TL;DR, if you're going to spend your money on an MMO, don't spend it on a free one, and ESPECIALLY don't spend it on this one. I can't stress that enough. Any purchases you make will be nullified in some future patch. Go buy a subscription to WoW or something, it'll cost you less in the long run. And you can get all the mounts NWO ripped off of it for free with the full game.			"

												So I wanted to love this game, I really, really did.  In the end, I just can't recommend it in the current state.Pros -If you loved the forgotten realms books, and setting for DnD you will feel like you just walked in.  They really did a great job of capturing the essence of the world.The character leveling system is intuitive, and things are explained fairly, if briefly.The game isn't really Pay to Win in that you can if you try hard get everything a paying player could.The combat is fun, and diverse.  You can learn many different skills and slot the right ones for a situation, and make a build you play well.The playerbase is amazing, at times.  No one complains about kill stealing, most people I encountered were friendly and helpful, and I never once had problems finding a group to take on a quest.  As a soloer the part I really liked, no one whined when the group immediately disbanded after the quest it formed around was completed.The quests for getting to max level are interesting, diverse, and straightforward.  I very rarely was confused by anything laid before me, and found the game fun to play.  Until I hit max level.Cons -The servers lag like you wouldn't believe.  The amount of rubberbanding and failure to accept inputs is just ridiculous.  This really becomes painful in combat where the situation gets worse.  I played as a rogue, as a rogue you have very limited armor, and very good dodging ability.  A skilled player can dodge nearly any attack because of how the game shows them to you, well, you could if the game wasn't constantly lagging.  Half the time I would go through the dodge animation and take the damage anyways finding myself now out of position, and half dead because the server couldn't decide if I dodged in time, so decided I dodged, but too late.Remember that thing about 'technically not pay to win'? I'm about to take that back.  Admittedly, it is technically possible through the game to get a reasonable amount of Astral Diamonds, the currency of the player based economy, and exchange them for Zen, the currency you buy with real money.  This can be done all through the game.  The problem is they are undergoing a major AD revision trying to rebalance the economy.  This means that a new player just starting out will find getting any reasonable amount of AD together in a timely fashion nearly impossible.  Players haven't adapted to the new scarcity of AD yet, so all pricing is still way overinflated for what you get.  This problem may eventually sort itself out, but as of this review it has not.Max level is a horror show for a new player.  There's no good way to put this.  When you are leveling up from 1-70 your character 'fits' it's role.  If you're going for pure DPS you can put up some huge numbers, and work well in a team.  I've heard similar from clerics, support, and tanks.  You feel like you fit in a group right where you should.  From the time I hit level 30 I was constantly at the top of the damage charts for any given dungeon, usually #1, sometimes #2.  How it should be for a dedicated DPSer.  The second you hit 70 kiss your role goodbye.  You are now in the part of the game known as hell.  You don't have the gear to do well in any dungeon, or even any of the lvl 70 questing areas.  Some players won't want to drag you along, some will flat out insult you and leave you to rot.  You are expected to find a way, by hook or crook to get your item level up to a competitive level, and no one, and nothing in game is going to tell you how.  The game itself won't tell you item level matters, other players will.  But they can't really help you get it up, because they don't know how you can do so either.Those beautiful quests I mentioned that lead you straight up the levels until you're ready for end game content?  They run out just before you hit level 70, actually I started during a 2x experience event, and I ran out of quests at level 68.  I didn't want to put in the time to test, but I suspect without that advantage of 2x experience you might run out sooner.  It also has to be mentioned that the developers made one of the most bone-headed decisions I've ever seen.  They're trying to revamp all the end zone dungeons.  As a result, they removed all the old dungeons.  In and of itself this isn't a real problem.  It makes for less dungeons available as you grow, but you can manage.  Here's the big problem.  They left all of the quest lead-ins and references to events in place.  If you're following the quests along you will suddenly hit a 'party needed' quest that can never be completed because the zone for the quest no longer exists.  This all stems from a recent increase in the level cap.  They increased the level cap, but never changed the associated xp rewards to get you there, never changed the references to level requirements in tips, and never bothered to think of how that is going to impact new players.The 'crafting system' or what passes for one, professions, are a joke.  It is a tiered system of hire people to do things for you.  But the catch, always a catch, you can't directly hire the best guys.  They're items, you have to find them, or buy them.  I won't comment on how easy they are to find beyond saying in the time I played I only found 1 green level, and 1 blue level worker, both for professions I wasn't currently training.  I will say buying them is god awful expensive.  So why bother?  Gear is limited in choices in this game.  The best rings you can wear, you have to craft.  There's no getting around it that I was able to discover as the items bind to the character.  Same for the highest tier armors.That brings me to my next point.  You want to pass on that lovely sword you've been slicing kobolds with to a new character?  You want to maybe sell the old one to finance your new one?  Too bad.  You can't.  Once an item is equipped to a character it is permenantly bound to that character.  At which point you have three choices.  Equip it.  Unequip it. Sell it to a vendor for a handful of silver that is vastly less than the item is worth.  That's it.  Those are your options with anything you've ever used for even the shortest amount of time.  You can sell equipment you find, but only if you do not ever use it yourself.Everything FEELS like a cash grab.  I will not say this is intentional, I have no idea what the developers were thinking.  Everything from the way equipment works, to the way you feel underpowered the moment you hit max level, to the fact that your 'end game' healing potions heal for a fraction of your health and they sell an upgrade in the zen shop but no other way to get them.  The game feels like a cash grab.  Hell, even the servers being on their last legs, and barely able to take the strain of running the game makes it feel like they just want to make a buck and bail out quickly.I wanted to love this game.  I grew up with the forgotten realms books, I knew the setting and felt right at home.  I wanted to at least like this game.  But the truth is, this game is broken, back-loaded, and feels like an attempt to extract money from gamers.My recommendations are as follows: If you find the setting interesting, as I did, play until you hit level 70 and quit.  Do not under any circumstances give these people money.			"

												This was probably my favorite MMO for quite some time. I love the combat in the game, and it is still the standard for which I hold other MMO-type games too. The Cleric Class (my personal favorite) is probably some of the best I've seen in a game.But it's turned into a total cashgrab game.I've stopped playing for a while now, but all the events that I took part in during the last few months I played were something that you'd have to grind for the entirety of the event to even have a hope of getting a chance at some of the end-items. Of course, if you wanted to drop some cash on it you could increase your chances.They've got an incredbly great system in place for a lot of things, but the game got too greedy for me. Which is sad, considering how much fun I've had with it.EDIT: For izzy4020[ECDC]I most certainly did spend money on the game. I don't fault any game for trying to make money. It's when games try to make participating in the game cost money in a FTP game. It was getting to the point (when I stopped) that every event they had took a full weekend of grinding to get a decent prize. I can hear you say, ""Oh, you aren't entitled to things! It's free to play! You should enjoy whatever you get from it!""That's the issue. To me, it seemed like as the events grew harder to achieve, the more they started introducing ""bonuses"" to make the events easier. The events started having better loot once that started as well. I still ♥♥♥♥ing love the game, and want to go back to it at some point. But it got god damn greedy. I spent money on it in order to have some things made slightly easier (like traveling), but it just started to feel dirty to me. Of course, there were other things that drove me from the game (Faction Drama), but feeling like I had to pay money to participate in events was ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to me. I still hold the mechanics of the game as the best MMO I've played. I plan on playing it again. I just want better for it..			"

												REVIEW EDIT: Installed it again, its even worse than it used be when i left.Nevermind my playtime, as i have played this game since early beta (back when healing aggro wasnt fixed and clerics were the tanks, the top players were farming Castle Never with 11k Gear Score, etc). I have +15 days of playtime on several characters, i own all classes at max level and  a least decently geared up, having tried several specs for most of them. I have played the hardest dungeons sucessfully since beta and mastered 3 of the many available classes (for PvE).Most reviews of this game are either very good or very bad, ill try to balance mine. If you dont feel like reading the entire review just read the end.Lets start with the pros:-Its a very fun game. Combat is easy to get, but fast and still challenging, while being adictive. Endgame bosses can and will 1 shot you if you screw up.-The classes are very different from each others, each one has its perks, and some of them are extremely fun to play.-The background lore is right on WoW level. -There's new content like, every 6 months.-Foundry quests, made by users for users.-Leveling doesnt take too long, but its not too quick either. Its just right on spot.-You dont have 4 bars of abilities like in wow for example, its much simpler. You have 2 spammable At wills spells (mouse buttons), 3 Encounter skills (Q,E,R) that usually have average cooldowns, and 2 dailies that require you to fill a bar to use.  All classes have a special effect on TAB button, and you have a key (usually 5,  6 or 7 on your keyboard) to use your primary artifact. However you have many skills to slot on those few spots, so your rotation and playstyle are very customizable. For example, on my CW (Control Mage), with my rotation, i could keep 100% uptime of CC on packs of mobs if i played it perfectly, while still dealing top damage.-The community isnt bad at all. Ive made some good friends, as most players are older than the average gamer.-You can get anything in the game without paying a cent. Just get ready for the massive grind.The Cons:-PvP is rly messed up. Some players went all out on P2W, and are packing the most ultimate enchants, which you will never get even close to, since 1 of them is worth more than the average player's account, and the best armor available. They'll steamroll you so hard that you wont even have time to bite the pillow. And some classes are just too strong.-PvE is pretty meh. The old dungeons are useless and empty due to the release of the latest +25man ""raid"", which consists on a zerg rush of people dealing damage. The drop chances for lower tier gear (from the older dungeons) are good, so basically you're being ""forced"" to do that zerg rush. Oh and i was unable to do that with my friends. Going in party wasnt working, it was random for everyone.-Too much currency. There are literally +50 types of currency or tokens you can use, and most of them are useless.-Cryptic doesnt listen to the community, and they are very incompetent. They enforce their changes even thou 95% of the people disagree with them. A dungeon was impossible to finish for like 2 weeks because the item used to enter the boss room was missing. Dunno why they didnt just disable it, instead it was running but you couldnt finish it. They usually fix something and break something else with each patch.-The game pulls so much out of the computer that i had to buy a new fan (mine got busted from working 24/7, and i had my graphics pretty low. I can play most games with medium or high definitions). Some players using high end machines get like 40 fps with low graphics. Too much bad coding, and on top of it, graphics arent even that good on high settings.-The healer role is basically disappearing. You can have your tank run a toggle skill called Knight's Valor. This allows him to take half the damage for the party, and since everyone else just stacks lifesteal....Instead, the DPS Clerics came into scene and became mainstream (in PvE and PvP) after being buffed pretty hard. LOL!-The Foundry. I know i listed this as a pro. But its also a con, since it demonstrates the lack of courage (or brains) of the team behind this game. They could easily give the players tools to make their own dungeons and bosses. It would set this game apart from the competition and put it on a whole new level. It would be the next level of mmo's. Instead they refused to do it, and repeatedly release new content full of grind, grind, grind until your eyes bleed.-The Carpal tunnel inducing mechanics and grind in this game are over 9000. Seriously.-The bots and exploits. There are bots everywhere. Cryptic isnt rly doing much about it, and when it does, it hurts the community. And some people exploited so hard they had hundreds of million astral diamonds (the most used in game currency), while the average player doesnt reach 200k. The most known exploit is laughable as it shows how bad the people programming this game are. This happened like a year ago and its known as Caturday (happened on saturday and everyone was walking around with cat pets, which are expensive). If you entered negative values while bidding on AH, you would get those many astral diamonds back. Everyone was doing it.I dont even have words for how amateurish this is. An intern would do better. I could do better and i havent programmed in 3 years. They rolled back the servers a day, but sincerely, the damage was done already, and not many people were banned or punished, they just kept rolling on their rich and packed accounts and ruined the economy of the game.In the end, this is a game that had a fantastic potential, and could have been the ""next"" mmo. But it was given to people that didnt had the ability to take it there, and honestly, its getting worse each expansion, with huge lack of imagination that results in endless daily grind, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bugs that are a reflection of their inability to put their ""duh"" ideias into practice.Its not a bad game at all, its fun and adictive, and easy to play but hard to master; but you will struggle to reach the real items without paying; the grind is insane and getting worse; and finally, the company behind the game sucks really bad, at almost every level. It wont be hard for you to find something else better to play within the genre.			"

												The devs took all the fun out of this game. They say it's free to play but it's not. It used to be. Now it's free to sample.   There is NO way to get good gear anymore unless you are ok with spending hundreds of dollars to get gear only to have it rendered almost useless with the next mod, I wouldn't bother...			"

Keep in mind:  THIS GAME HAS AVAILABLE SINCE APRIL, and was officially released in June.  It was released on Steam less than a week ago, hence the ""1.4 hours"", meaning 1.4 hours since less than a week ago (that's how steam hours work...)  I have quite a bit of experience with this game.Pros: FREE! Fun, varied combat and classes.  Lots to do, and the Foundry adds endless adventures.Cons: Extremely Pay to Win at higher levels, quests are linear, classes all fall into boring MMO standards, strays too far away from D&D (a Cleric that can't Turn Undead?  No Draw Upon Holy Might?  Common Cryptic...)My opinion: Avoid.  I had fun for the first couple dozen hours, but I soon felt the pressure from all sides to spend real money on ridiculous things, which usually doesn't bother me. But the bigger issue is that free players are at a MASSIVE disadvantage.  Fusing shards and runestones is a giant cash grab, considering a ""Greater Thunderhead Enchantment"" is nearly impossible to craft through the game unless you shell out roughly $160.  The worst part, it IS usable in PvP.  Other monetary attrocities include $40 mounts, $10 slot bags, $6 skill respec, and $35 hirelings.Conclusion: Try it out for yourself, it's ""free"".  The combat is fun and Foundry is great to explore.  Be warned though that this is just a semi-typical MMO with limitless pay restrictions at every turn. I felt that throughout my gameplay, there wasn't any part of the experience where the developers weren't trying to squeeze every last penny out of me.  And that, to me, isn't fun.  6/10NOTE: Steam says I've played for 1 hour, but this game has been officially released since June, and was in open beta for months prior.  I quit in September after leveling a Cleric and a Rogue._______________________________________________________________________________EDIT 12/8/13: I had no idea that my opinion of this game would receive this amount of attention.  I had no idea people would get so worked up, it's kinda funny watching people raging so hard at the opinions of one person.  Makes me think I made the right choice not to support this game  ^.^EDIT 12/9/13: Here's a brief explaination of one of the ""Pay2Win"" elements of the game, as requested by PredatorAncient:Players are given the option to add additional stats/effects to their equipment in Neverwinter. These come in the forms of Runestones (pets) and Enchantments (Armor/Weapon). For pets, the Runestones are split into Offense and Defense. For Enchantments, they are split into Offense, Utility, and Defense. A single Runestone/Enchantment provides different bonuses depending on which slot there are equipped to. These also have ranks and start from 1 and ends at 9. Four of the same kind may also fuse to move up a tier. The chance of success starts at 95% at rank 1 and 10% at rank 8. You will lose a single Runestone/Enchantment upon failure.There are two ways to circumvent failure: Preservation Ward and Coalescent Ward. Preservation Wards cost 10 cents each and prevent the loss of materials upon failure. They are also only consumed upon failure. Coalescent Wards cost 10 dollars and guarantees success of fusion. Small amounts of both of these wards may also be obtained on a weekly basis through Celestial Coins (the later being rarer). (link)[i.imgur.com] Now you may be wondering why there's a huge discrepancy between the two Wards. I was wondering for a while too until I stepped my foot into endgame and found out there was an entirely different type of Enchantments: The Armor/Weapon Enchantments.Armor/Weapon Enchantments are for specific slots in your weapon/chest and grant special effects. They come in shards and have a chance to drop from Epic Dungeon bosses. You must combine 4 shards to create a Lesser version of the Enchantment. However, the success chance of fusion is at a staggeringly low 1%.(link)[imgur.com] To compensate, they have very strong effects. An example would be the Thunderhead Enchantment. However, the real kicker here is that these ""Lesser"" versions may be fused again to gain a stronger version. Those may also be fused again to create the strongest version. Ultimately, the Greater Thunderhead Enchantment will have a 30% on crit to damage and stun foes. To create the strongest Enchantment possible, it will cost 160 dollars and 64 shards. Unlike companions, these can be used in PvP.			"

												Whenever you play a MMO published by a Chinese or Korean corporation, you can expect certain aspects of the game and payment model to be different. Neverwinter is no exception. This game happens to be run by a Chinese corporation called Perfect World Entertainment. It is their ""North American"" division of Perfect World.The big issues brought up by many North American and EU players is Pay2Win. Something that is rampant and very accepted and acceptable in Chinese, Korean, and SEA cultures among PC games. Neverwinter is an attempt to get away from some prevalent Pay2Win features otherwise present in their Chinese counter-parts and to a degree, has almost found an acceptable amount for NA players in their action games, such as Blacklight Retribution and Tourchlight. But these are exceptions to the rule, and these are not MMOs.Neverwinter does have Pay2Win aspects, make no mistakes. Without paying any cash, it will require a hardcore player months to be on equal footing compare to what a paying customer can achieve in a week or two if they take their time.These aren't the things I personally have an issue with the game though. Because, with the exception of the price of coalescent wards constantly on the rise, an item required to craft high level weapon and armor enchants, most things a player can attain in a few months play, if their okay with settling for rank 7 and 8, maybe rank 9 enchants, instead of rank 10s.The issue I have with PWE is that forum discussions about the game among players almost exclusively happens on their official forums, which are heavily censored. Not surprising coming from a corporation that formed in Beijing, outside of China's Special Economic Zone(SEZ), their quasi-capitalist zones. Even though these areas aren't officially ran as communist zones, their strongest political party remains the communist party, and many North American and EU peoples would be unable to differentiate between the two because their are so many similarities to a full on communist country.--To get a quick idea of internet censorship in china, check out the wikipedia of Internet Censorship in China.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship_in_the_People's_Republic_of_ChinaHere is another link to a similar topic, a news.aky.com journalist story about Facebook having issues entering the Chinese scene because of internet censorship.http://news.sky.com/story/1206329/the-great-firewall-blocking-facebook-in-china--You don't have to read those links, they are just to give you an idea about why a corporation in a different culture might have different views of what's acceptable.--Discussions about Pay2Win, so that potential customers can decide whether they want to invest time into this game or not, are full censored on the official forums.Drop chances for dungeons are censored on the official forums, luckily these are large enough chances that they are generally well known, just don't post on the forums.Drop chances for lockboxes, which function as in-game gambling using Zen(cash) are fully censored and users can be banned from the forums for posting results of their findings. Users that have opened over a thousand lockboxes worth thousands of dollars, have been censored and banned for posting their results.Please individuals reading this, understand that when I say gambling, I mean wagering money for the chance of something of value, in this case, in game items. I actually saw a PWE forum moderator tell somebody that whether something is considered gambling or not is only determined by a court of law instead of the definition of the word and what the large majority of people understand it to be.It is believed among some individuals whom commonly open large amounts of lockboxes, that the chance to receive the rare item, which typically sale for between 300k-1m AD, which is equivalent to the price of 6-20 *keys, that the chance for an item fluctuates depending on a proprietary algorithm, and that a player's chance can be higher or lower depending on how long it has been since the last grouping of rare items were distributed from the boxes.Of course their is no way to know this, all we can know, is that it's over a 99.99% probability that a player has less than a 1% chance to receive $10+ item per box, which costs $1.25 to open. That it takes over $120.00 in keys purchased through PWE to average 1 of these $10+ items.One of the excuses moderators of the PWE forums use to delete such threads, is the claim that players present the data as factual drop chances while not knowing for sure because it's a proprietary system. Not only is this not true, because the players have only presented information as data representative of a sample, but is in actuality only used as an excuse to censor the information from the players. It is PWE forum policy to censor this information, they are the most strict regarding winning from their lockboxs.It's important to understand that this is a form of gambling that is not only unregulated, but is completely proprietary with chances and even results of other players kept secret. There is a reason this kind of secrecy isn't allowed in any gambling recognized by a regulatory body. It is for this reason it is unsurprising, that any discussion about winning rates be kept completely secret, and any discussion of Neverwinter's lockbox system being compared to gambling being a bannable offense. It is my belief that PWE, being a branch of a Chinese corporation, doesn't understand that this kind of censorship is unacceptable to North American and EU players. It is understandable that they don't understand this, but a corporation will have no idea that it is unacceptable to their customers unless we say so. The problem is they censored us!			"

												Run by HUGE BAIT AND SWITCH CorporationDecisions made with no consideration of player feedback, bugs do not get fixed.Enormous cash grab platform.   Love the game itself it's a shame that it's run with such an intent on the money grab.Any method a player finds to build some currency is systematically shutdown.   The latest change comes in the next patch removing the Astral Diamond generation from the Leadership profession.   Astral Diamonds are the main currency in the game that can be exchanged for ZEN which is the cash shop currency.   Leadership has provided a good way for the free to play mantra...  now the game has nothing going for it.   New players coming in fresh will need to spend a lot of real cash to be viable to play epic dungeons at end-game.... I came back around 12/2014 and STILL am not ready to play some of the end game content and I play daily.			"

												Pros:- graphics is good (when they're loaded properly on server), though not perfect even on Ultra- Combat is fast and fluid (better than TERA)- Story and Lore is just amazing - some NPCs are pretty funny- somewhat acceptable F2P model>>You can beat the game without spending a dime; all you need for sacrifice is time and a lot of Gear Score points.- challenging and difficult maps (good for end-game players)- good community (I love their Facebook page!)Cons:- skipped the DLC (HotN and GP are too expensive)- some quest items are even RNG-based- LAG EVERYWHERE- crap maintanence team. - Arc/Gateway website is buggy.- Frequent login issue- Server rubberbands like h377, making game unplayable.- sometimes buggy- feels P2W in PVP (those that paid for Slot enchantment/Weapon-Armor specials/Legendary gears have a high advantage due to high GS)- Poor guilds system. Was invited to a Guild after Mod 2's release and months later that Guild died. It's still there, but the GL abandoned the game, and rarely anyone but me logged in every day. - You actually have to buy some pack to play some exclusive race. And they're overly expensive. If you're going to play the upcoming XB1 version and you previously bought the DLC race packs, you have to buy it again. i.e Gold/Metal/regular Dragonborn, Wood/Moon Elf, or the MR Drow. - Some class are just unbalanced (CW, SW, and TRs are WAY TOO OP!!!) - Runestones/Enchantments/Weapon-Armor Specials feels P2W at high rank. The success gap between 5, 6, and 7 is just staggering. Also, Armor/Weapon Enchantments upgrades are always at 1% success PLUS ANOTHER ENCHANTMENT, forcing you to buy Coal Wards at $10 each. The Shards needed to forge an A/W Enchantment are rare to epic Dungeon drops. - the best looking/stats companions and mounts are usually in the Zen store, at a ridiculous high price ($30-$45). - Overall RNG is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. The gloves/MH in Mod3 IWD and Mod4-5's Artifact Gear drops are the best examples. You grind for months and still not get a decent loot while the lucky ones do. I spent some Zen cash on lockboxes and was lucky to get an Owlbear Artifact belt (very decent one) for my GWF. Still grinding Mod5 quest, eLOL, and eSoT for the Legendary Artifact Sword (Golden Dragons series). - annoying chat. Everyday I login, a  handful of new Goldspammers, bots, Trade Frauds, and Fake Selling Accounts starts PMing me with scamming Broken English item sale crap... ON MY CHAT BAR!!!!! Used to take part of the [NW_Legit_Community] chat subscription group but now it's just full of elites talking about the latest stuff; the newbs and low-GS players have no idea what's going on. -UPDATED: new VIP bull****. I don't mind locked content like Moonmask Lounge only for paying elite players, but adding other things like Trap Injury Immune perk is the biggest ripoff I've ever seen.-Furthermore, gears are now P2W. you can find overpowered Epic gears straight from teh Zen Market cash shop which allows you to buy to get ahead. Absolutely dumb and nastily greedy.-Lots of useless things cluttering my inventory. There's several variants of the same item, such as a normal unbounded Superior Potion of Healing, a Bound to Character SPoH, and Bound to Account SPoH! WTH?! are you forcing me to spend real cash on inventory spaces? I did the latest Scrying Orbs quest to unlock another free Emboldered Bag of holding, yet I'm still running out of space. Some of these items I get are unsellable, and I can't discard them!VERDICT: STILL A NO. these guys never learn their lesson on how to really make a good game.			"

												Been Playing this game over an year now.[Note: before reading the review of any player, please check the time the person has actually invested into the game. Since most of the reviews are terrible and are writen by players who hardly played 2hrs in total]PROS:-Good class and race selections.-Medium character customizations.-Good power animations and combat system.-Currently 7 different classes and all of them unique in their own way.-Really addictive.-New Maps and content every few months to keep you stuck to the game without getting bored.-Foundry system lets your craete your own interesting quests which you and other players in the game can play.-Premium contents aren't game performance affecting items. So you can really become a pro without spending a dime. Im a total free player without spending any cash on this game and I got almost every end game content. [Also there's an option to convert in-game cash (Astral Diamonds) into Premium cash (Zen). So you can buy all the premium contents with a little grinding of course]CONS:- Premium cash (ZEN) is too expensive if you choose to spend real cash in buying it.-Transition of the game from last year to now is big. The game has become heavily grinding game.-Poor Graphics Optimizations. [Not the best looking game out there but If I can get 50+ fps in most games of current graphics demanding games @1080p High settings, why can't a medium graphically looking game like this give poor fps? gives me 40-45fps in medium settings with some settings maxed. Very Poor Performance optimization.]-Heavy Server Lag issues [If there are too many people in 1 instance, then it starts to rubberband like hell making it literally unplayable]-DLCs are crazy ♥♥♥ expensive. Hero of the North pack is 199.99$? seriously? I can buy 2-3 award winning games for the same price!-TERRIBLE RNG LOOT Drop!!!! Which means some players grind for hours and hours and get ♥♥♥♥ from the Quest's chest where as some people get crazy luck to win the best thing! Would have been great if the % chance of winning the best gear of the ccheat increases with each run through into same dungeon.-Terrifying PVP Matchmaking sometimes. It's been over an year and it's still not fixed. High Gear score players facing up against low gear scored players. Making the defeat certain.This game would have got much better appreciations if it was made little easy for new players without banging our wallets to forcefully spend real cash too much. I agree that every Free2Play game has the option to spend real cash to get Premium stuffs. But there's a limit to how expensive it should get. This game crossed the line far beyond the limit..!!!The game runs purely because of the famous Dungeons and Dragons Title. Conclusion:Do I recommend it? Sure, the game is still lots of fun and it's fun to grind to some extent. It's great to play with friends. But this game is a killer for free players because for a new player to grind through all stuffs and get the End-game content will take nearly an year.			"

												Previously I recomened this game for various aspects like game play, roleplay and the fact that it was actually free, With the advent of Elemental Evil or as some call it the ""Great Unbalancing"" or the ""End of Faerun"" I can not recomend it to anyone that wants a free roleplay experience that can be played in a reasonable time with out paying large sums of money. The latest patch has removed nearly every feature to earn astral diamonds or currency you earn to purchase things in game or even to get Zen to buy things from the shop where people spend real moeny. Yes it used to be things many people bought with money could actually be bought with in game currency if you had enough patience. Invokes which used to give you 1,000 now only give you 250 if you are lucky. Some of the high quality gear on the exchange can cost nearly one million astral diamonds. To make matters worse many quests to earn astral diamonds have been removed. Many of the dungeons with the best equipment can not be entered until level seventy.           Why does that matter you ask? Well the game used to be only until level sixty. In the latest module there is much hype about the ""amazing paladin"" and how it will save Faerun from the Elemental Evil and how they will add ten more levels to game experience. There is just one problem existing classes already fufilled the role the paladin is supposed to play, There is a cleric, there is a tank and there is a warlock which drains health. The paladin is just a cleric in a tin suit with too much power. So how did they make this class relavant? First all methods of healing have been destroyed. Regeneration, lifesteal, potions, companions, spells from clerics ect all wrecked. Many spells that used to heal you now only give you a small chance at healing you. What does this mean? With out a highly skilled paladin in your party you will die over and over and over again. Also remember if you already played the game before Elemental Evil you worked hard to earn the best equipment for you experiecne after level sixty. This was now a waste of time since your characters will die at every turn. Everything to keep the game functional now relies on the ""Oathbound Paladin"" or as most call it simply ""Over Powered"" This healing tank in a party is the only way to do anything in the game now. Potions, clerics, self healing abilities all useless. If you try to level up to seventy now I pity the poor souls that struggle to get to that point.            You will hear how this balancing was put in place to strengthen tanks, encourage diverse parties and improve game play. Well if that was the goal you could also say dropping an atomic bomb on Neverwinter will improve the scenry. Frankly it is a lie and most will not realize it until the dust clears and everyone makes the grisly discovery Neverwinter has become a silent graveyard for adventurers that died everytime they turned a conner. This module has nothing to do with game play. All the other classes have been thrown off a cliff with a rock called Elemental Evil tied to their neck and left to figure out how to swim on their own. You will not be able to level up by yourself if you want, you will not be able to get anywhere in the game with out purchasing booster packs and buying Zen to get the best equipment is the only way to do anything in this game in a reasonable time. I have played this game for over a year and I am sad to say all my work and money I spent was a wasted effort.  Do not beleive the hype Neverwinter is not a free to play game in any sense of the term. It is a pay to win game that now only favors the PvP experience. If you want to do something else like level up and spend time with freinds in a party where everyone has a role. This is not the game for you. If you have more money than sense and love to smash other players while marching around as the most over powered class have at it while you can, this game will not be up for much longer with all the people leaving.

												Having played this game over the years, for a long time,  I have seen it fall in quality pretty hard.  At first it was ok, challenging, but not impossible to gear up your character.  But that is now in the past and sadly it is impossible. This game has 2 sides to it,  First the levels 1-69, and then the endgame after 70.   Here is the deal, cryptic has gutted the endgame so much, that it is not free to play at all.  The whole point of the endgame is to gear up your character, and be a badass in dungeons. But the only way to do that is earn some AD (Astral diamonds) by doing specfic quests.  This has been nerfed, over and over and over.  They have removed the ability earn it so much, that if i was to start fresh it would take years of constant playing to get everything i need in the game to be competive and win.  Now say i wanted to buy everything with real cash.  Well then to fully gear up your charater, it would cost you over 1,000 dollars.  It is a joke, and sadly even after all these years, paying over 100,  i'm still not even close to bing best in class.  The endgame is dead, don't waste your time with it.  I was lucky to play back in the day, but now forget it.  Because of this, there is a real gap between players who play for free and players who pay.  There is no balancing to be had, thus PVP is completly broken and croweded by geared guild players vs the unlucky few who are first trying to play pvp.  IT is a broken system. levels 1-69 was the best part of this free to play experience.  It is the part of the game where you level your character, and not your gear.  The bots have taken it over.  As stated above, cryptic has taken steps to limit AD gains, and one of the reasons for this was to combat bots from earning AD.  Like life, bots find a way.  The new thing is they are crowding dungeons, PVPs, and skirmish queues.  It is now comon when queuing up in the lower levels, to be placed in a game populated entirally by bots.  It is pretty funny to see them robotically run around.  Now if you want to play the main story quests, go ahead.  Those are still there and will never be ruined.  But by god don't spend a dime on this game.  It is No longer worth any money.  The game is going to be dead soon at this rate.  It is a pay 2 win game now, make no mistake about it.			"

												I really want to give this game a thumbs up. I really do. But I just can't. I love the combat, I love the mechanics, I love the class synergy. Its all there. But I can't give it thumbs up for a multitude of reasons. The first and primary reason I am giving this game a thumbs down is because server side latency can make this game literally unplayable at peak hours and unbearbly annoying at not peak hours. I can't even count how many times I've been fighting the boss of a dungeon and been forced to wipe because me and my entire party couldn't control our characters for 15 seconds, and when we regain control, everyone is dead and we have to start the boss over from scratch. Even when lag isn't this severe, theres always constant rubberbanding issues and unresposive abilty usage. This coupled with the fact that endgame bosses have extremely powerful attacks that must be dodged, can make for some extremly agrivating gameplay. I also can't count how many times I've been straight up kicked from the game while I was innocently running around doing daily quests. Sometimes I relog and I'm back up and running no problem, while other times I relog only to get kicked again in the next 10-15 minutes, and still other times I can't even relog even though the game says servers are up. Its annoying at best and downright aggrivating at worst. Lag is constant in this game, and makes what would be a well designed combat system aggrivating to deal with.Another reason I have to give this game a thumbs down is the lack of endgame scaling. In order to acquire the best gear in the game, you have to run dungeons. But in order to be effective in those dungeons, you need to be properly geared. But the only way to become properly geared is by running the dungeons. Its the chicken/egg paradox. What you end up with is people who queue in for the dungeon fresh off of hitting level 70 with regular rarity trash equipment, hoping to get carried by teammates so that they can get better gear, and with enough of these people the dungeons become impossble because you and your teammates aren't properly equiped to handle mobs and bosses. And its not their fault, its Cryptics fault for not including content that scales towards endgame appropiately. Its frustrating for new level 70s, because they can't contribute to dungeons, and its frustrating for veterans because they are forced to be matched with improperly geared teammates.My final complaint about this game is lack of endgame gear. Where is it? There is one set of gear you get from running T1 dungeons, another set from running T2 dungeons, and some PVP gear. You can also get some gear from crafting, but unless you've been playing the game for multiple months and have your crafting levels up, you're not going to be crafting anything worthwhile any time soon. And thats it. All of the gear from the campaign areas is still set at level 60, and no new gear has been added in those areas when they increased the level cap. Its garbage. The point of games like this is to personalize your character by finding the gear that fits the role you want your character to fill. But if there is only one set of gear that is viable in the endgame, then what is there? It just becomes a grind to get that set of gear, and then thats it. There is nothing else to do at that point.I love this game. I feel like it has a lot of good things going for it. I love the combat, I love the class variety, and I love the (few) dungeons that there are. But because of all the glaring flaws in the game's design, as well as the unbearable and constant server side latency that exists, I just can't in my right mind recommend this game to anyone looking for a new mmo to play.P.S. Something I feel I must mention (but didn't effect my decision in giving the game a thumbs down) is the fact that PVP in this game is awful. The pvp maps themselves are fine, and the tried and true king of the hill system works fine in this game, but the true flaw here is in matchmaking. Anyone who is level 70 will get matched with anyone else who is level 70, regardless of item level, class, pvp experience, record, anything. As best I can tell, the game just matches the first 10-20 (depeding on which pvp map you play) people in a match, randomly assigns them to teams, and lets it go. Needless to say, this does not make for any sort of competition at all, but instead becomes a battle of ""which team has RNJesus blessed with the higher geared teammates"". Rarely is there a PVP match that I have been placed in that was competitive. 90% of PVP matches are stomps one way or the other. This could be easily fixed by more intellegent matchmaking, but until that happens, just stay away from PVP entirely.			"

												I used to love this game to pieces, but with module 4 became the grand realisation that the game is just a massive cash grab for the end game players, they literally pull in player's, take their money and spit them out without listening to community input. Its sad and really pretty annoying how badly the game has been managed, it could of been great but you just feel cheated of your time and perhaps money if you spent zen.Id stear clear of this and Perfect World games alltogether.

												Well if you've read the (currently) top reviews by Dark Sun Silke and Blackdragonbird, they cover the bulk of it very well. I enjoyed the game for the first few hours when you're not subjected to the Pay2Win mechanics at every turn. You get eased into that, then can't escape it. Get ready to have your immersion completely sodomised.I wanted to like the game, really I did. I played the Neverwinter Nights games several times through, and have always been into D&D and Forgotten Realms, but if you're looking for that here, you won't find it. The developers are using the franchises for exposure, but aside from references, place names and deities who really serve no in-game purpose, the rest of it is just a bog-standard copy and paste mmo.The game is riddled with bugs, which I can live with - it's pretty standard in mmo's as they're pretty complicated with all said and done, but Neverwinter does seem to have more than the norm.. really silly ones that shouldn't be there this long after release, but then the developers are too busy making things you can pay for. It's a plague just like Team Fortress 2 and the hats.. oh the hats...Not that the game needs to be made easier.. so far in almost 100 hours of play, I've not died once, and not for lack of trying.  God knows I love to push the limits of what my characters can do, and regularly Leroy my cloth and leather wearers into the frey, but enemies just aren't a challenge, and bosses are just as easy but with larger health pools.Here are some more specific points:-Level design is ok if I'm generous. There are some areas that are nice enough, but certainly not inspired, and with the dire lack of graphical optimisation, I had to have the settings so low it looks like an mmo from 8 years ago just to have it not playing like a slideshow, and it's still less than 10 fps in the capital. My comp isn't great, but I can play most games at full settings. Any nice areas that might exist are lost to the battering the settings have taken.-Quests are mini-hub based, and your standard tired fare. There are voiceovers for all of them as far as I can tell (well, in fairness I haven't paid alot of attention to it beyond the first couple of zones), which is nice, but you'll probably end up just grabbing them all and ignoring the 'story', as ultimately you're just sent off to kill a bunch of things or click on something on the ground. The quests feel like they were just dumped in to fill out the zones with something to do and aren't engaging. Grab a few, complete them, and gain a new level. The level cap is 60, and you can get to 20 in a few hours of speeding through quests without reading them.-Music I can't really comment on, I have it turned off as I use a table mic for voicechat.-Voiceovers are hit and miss for me. I've read several reviews which like them, perhaps because people tend to recognise them from other games, though personally I find that the accents aren't done too well. An example is Sergeant Knox, the main go-to guy for your level quests throughout the game. He'll start off sounding Scottish, and then kind of slip into English, then the American accent comes through before pulling it back to Scottish. Some of the voiceovers are native speakers, and they sound fine, but it breaks immersion for me when a voiceactor doesn't get it right. Having said that, there are a few noteable exceptions, and the voice acting in the Linkletter quest line was actually quite good considering the difficulty of that kind of emotiveness.-Combat is reasonably action based, with dodging and timing your abilities for best effect, so positioning can be an advantage, but you can only slot a few abilities at any given time, so you'll spend most of your time feeling like there should be more to do as you'll be restricted to spamming the few you've chosen. For skills, feats and abilities, the descriptions often lack details, so you have to spend points on the skills/abilities to see if they're any good. Those wasted points can only be reassigned by spending real money on a respec, which will cost a few quid/bucks.-Healing is a lost cause for so many reasons. If, like me, you tend to play a healing class, this is a game to avoid. Aside from making life a little easier in end-game content (of which there is a woeful lack!), there's just no need for a healer. At release the sole healing class (Divine Cleric) was fairly balanced I suppose, but got nerfed for whatever reason, and is by far the least played class. In PvP the Cleric is simply dead-weight unless the player has spent a few hundred dollars on gear. Heals are generally Heal-Over-Time (HoT), and somewhat lackluster. They're fine for PvE, but are lost to the rediculous burst damage of PvP.-PvP is enjoyable ONLY when the teams are fair. On the rare occasion that both teams consist of players who haven't really spent much or anything on overpowered gear, you can enjoy it whether you win or lose and are satisfied in a balanced match. However, most games will just be utterly dominated by those with more money than sense. It simply does not matter how well you play, or how much better you are to your opponent, if they've paid out for gear you'll be the one face-down at the end of any fight. Not fun at all. You'll be repeating that scenario over and over, so bring spare lube. The fun matches are few and far between, and there's nothing enjoyable about a rogue unstealthing and killing you from full health in less than a second, even though you saw them stealth and were ready for them. Oh, and if you're riding one of the mounts you can get for in-game currency, you can be dismounted and land on your face if you take 3 hits of damage, or lose more than 10% of your health in a hit, while riding at +50% speed.. or you can spend £40 (about $65, though I think it's cheaper on the US Zen Market) for a mount at +110% that you can't be knocked from. Ahh the joys of Pay2Win. Gear has an overall score, and you could easily be matched with other players of similar scores, but then where would the incentive be to pay for all the best gear with real money if you couldn't dominate those who can't afford it? Noo, they'll never be adding that feature.Utimately Perfect World are farming the players for every last penny they can suck out of them. You'll feel like cattle being herded into pens ready for them to milk money out of. When you step into the capital, PvP matches or higher level areas, get ready to feel like a homeless person in the rich part of town. Everywhere you look you can take in the beauty of what could be yours if only you had loads of money - and loads of money it is too. I deeply regret buying just £17 ($28) of Zen tokens and adding to the whole farce. I feel dirty and used, grasping the soiled sheets to my body to hide what little dignity I have left. You only start with 2 character slots, so I bought the Zen to get another 2 slots and have some left over for something else. Hmm, perhaps a 24 slot backpack to help with the constantly full packs that are deliberately full of enchantment stones etc to make you need more space. That'll be £10 ($16) please.At least, I like to think they'd say please.			"

												Free to play, yeah sure. But the DLC listed on Steam alone adds up to 420 Euro. (Yes, 420!) This doesn't even include any of the in-game purchases, some of which are required to progress at a humanly acceptable rate (companion level unlocks for example).And it's a pity, too, because the basic mechanics of the game are decent and the combats are quite fun. I really wish they had published this as NWN3 instead of going down into f2p hell.			"

												Pay to win.The devs are greedy. The price it costs for max level items like mythic artifacts is quite funny. Maybe a few thousand dollars to get your char near max or more, it has been a while since I played so I'm not sure how much it is now, but everytime lots of players get maxed they increase the gear further, making people need to spend more money.I loved this game, the best combat in any MMO I have tried but after all the hours I have put into this game  I can be 1 shot by other players because of p2w and in pve the paying players can clear content so much easier. I have played nearly 1900 hours and not even close to being maxed. You will need to spend money to buy a mount, have fun using the slow one you get for free, it will make most content terrible. You will need to pay for inventory slots since items have soul bound, shared bound and about 4 other types even if it's all the same item they won't stack. A good way for the devs to make people need to spend money on extra slots.If your rich or don't mind never getting stronger no matter how long you play then you might like this game, otherwise I really wouldn't reccomend it.

												I gave up on this game a long time ago but figured I review it since they keep updating things. The story is fine and you might enjoy it once through. PVP and even most PVE is where it all falls apart.This is most definitely a pay to win game unless you are willing to put insane hours into grinding. I have over 1,000 hours and my main toon would still get demolished in the blink of an eye.Loved it for the D&D part but that wasn't enough to keep me going.Devs only seem to care about you if you line their pocket books.

												This game was actually fun for a while. But the developers are just nerfaholics and cannot stop. It doesn't matter which class you pick, they just do not and will not quit. After a year you'd have thought they'd be ok with things, but they're still attempting ""balance"" fixes... and not the small kinds. Complete redesigns with no real way to change the entire focus of what your character was. Don't count on playing for long, regardless of what you pick they'll destroy it eventually. Its just not worth anyones time to play like that. I wouldn't bother. These guys do not know what they want and keep changing their minds repeatedly. There's no reason to play a game like that. And that doesn't even count how far away from actual D&D the gameplay is getting after a year. It was pretty close early on, now its nothing even remotely close. I do not recommend this game anymore at this point. You just don't know what they're going to do next and I mean that in the bad way.... not the ""wow what will they come up with next for content"" way.			"

												I had been playing for some while and the micro purchases were just too tempting. Today I decided to purchase a bit of 'zen' so I could turn it into another in-game currency to buy a companion. They were very happy to take my money, but because the transaction was made via my Steam Wallet - they have limited my use of the funds and suspended my ability to exchange currencies for an indeterminate amount of time. No phone support, you can only submit a ticket which also, MAY be replied to within an indeterminate amount of time.Exceptionally efficient in their ability to shut down a potential customer in the long run.

												I made a purchase on Neverwinter on the undersatnding that I would receive a ""First Time Buyer's Pack"" The text on screen says (accessed by presing Alt then ""Y"" [Zen Market]) ""You will receive this item through in-game mail after transfering at least 500 Zen to your account"" (I transfered 1000 Yen through steam wallet) Then when I make an in game ticket the company says it does not apply to Steam transactions. Which they never told me in the first place. Then they tell me if I want a refund go to Steam. To be honset I think this company is deliberately scammig Steam users.			"

												NEVERWINTERS FIRST YEAR!!   PVE = good PVP = good. -I played this game when it first came out.   it was very promising, there was little hacking, pay to win wasnt so brutally overpowered, and balancing was getting better by the patch.  NEVEWINTERS SECOND YEAR!!   PVE = Messed up Horribly.   PVP= Messed up worse.  -Suddenly the game became all about how much money u could spend.   a Free to play charecter seems almsot impossible to reach max level without spending money.   -they have VIP status to make leveling reasonable.   -Alot of game function moved Clientside,  this allows for hackers,  and there is alot of them.  -Mass untested Code allowed for exploits to ruin the ingame economy and gameplay both pvp and pve. (example: putting a negative bid at auction house would cause the auction house to give you free money ) -PVP Rankin doesnt work right.  hacked charecter's seen every few pvp matches.  all charecter data is held clientside for easy manipulation.-many more hacks then just low gear score players with maxed stats and ability scores.   there are auto dodger hacks.   autoattack hacks,  hacks to to refine gear and enchanments.   All for alot less then the cost of paying to level ur charecter or buy the best gear.This game should be gasping for its last breath.   can cost you hundreds of dollars for a single godly item.   Then it cant kill a hacker then spent 20 bucks for the hacked code to inject into his client. "

												First of all I checked that I would not  recomend this game but in all honesty it really depends on what you exspect.  The game is free and you can play for hours and hours.  The money system in the game in Gold,Silver and Copper.  Now you also have a huge bunch of items which you earn and can spend for game items.  I won't go into them all because there are just too many to list.  The real money is in Astral Diamonds which you can earn in the game.  This is where my problem lays it cost 700,000 just to upgrade a companion from a level 25 to a level 30 and you still have to level one at a time until you reach level 30 with the companion.  I can only imagine what it then cost to upgrade from level 30 to 35.  I have been playing for appox. 2 months pretty much evey day and have only been able to accumeulate roughly 125,000 Astral Diamonds so you see the problem.  My chacter is a level 60 and a level 25 companion is not really that much help on quests.  Now for the real kicker, you can purchase Astral Diamonds for real money out of your Steam Wallet and trust me you can spend hundreds of dollars.  I paid $10 for my compaion thinking I could level her up to my level, nope they hide these things from the customer.  When I purchased her I had no idea it would cost so much to level her up.The whole game is built around getting the player to spend real money.  I can purchase a pack for DLC and it would cost me $59.99 in real money, included in this pack would be 600,000 Astral Diamonds so I could take them and add them to what I have and level up my companion to level 30 but what would be the point.Now the other big item you can use as money is a thing called Zen if you want to purchse Zen in the game 1 Zen cost roughly 365 Astral Diamonds and I need 125 Zen to purchase a key to unlock a box that the game puts in your inventory at like level 9 or so.  Do the math to see how many Astral Diamonds it would take to purchase 125 Zen so I could obtain a key to open the box.  Supposedly the box contains a vauable item and it gives you a list of what you might get.  I've had this box in my inventory for the whole game because I can't get justify spending all my Astral Diamonds to buy 125 Zen.Now at level 20 you can purchase a mount for roughly 5 gold game money.  This allows you to move around faster and hitting key pad number 6 or 7 puts you on the mount and takes you off the mount it just places it in you inventory.  You have a choise of what type of horse you would like, I won't go into all the choises.  Then comes the big kicker, if you want to go faster you have to upgrade to a 2 or 3 and again it will cost you more Astral Diamonds than you could earn in 6 months of playing. You say well why would I have to go faster, I'll tell you.  Some of the game is a fight called PVP, player verses player.  You can put yourself in a que to join a group of 4 other player and you fight with 5 other player in a kind of arena with 3 power points that change from Blue to Red depends on the team your on.  I'm not sure how it works but I'm allways on the blue team. I'm told that everyone has the same color that shows for them when they play so I don't really know how anyone would know. When I play the control points are blue and the team I'm on is blue. Now when your attacked while riding a horse your knocked off then attacked in the reg. way.  If you had an upgrade it would be more difficult for an opponant to knock you off the horse plus going faster helps you get away quicker.  The 3 power points I mentioned change hands in the game often and your team gets points for capturing them.  I think the first player to the power point gets the points and you also receive points by killing opponents.  So if your rushing to a power point to capture it and your not fast one of your team mates will get there first if they have a special mount or have purchased an upgrade.  Now you can buy game packs like the one I mentioned earlier for $59.00 and you get a unicorn which I assume is faster and better.  You can always tell who has spent real money in the game by what type of mount they are on, some have bears some have black panters etc etc etc.  The more money they spend the tougher they are. Armor has to be enchanted and it cost tons of Astral Diamonds to buy the enchantments.  When I started this review the enchantments were 3 times less exspensive now 7/9/2014 the enchantments will cost you 3 times what they use to.  That means that all the heavy hitters in the game that leveled out all 12 itmes in there gear when things were cheap will have a huge advantage. In combat in the PVP they always win.  I could go on but I think you have the idea spend money become a better player and have a bit more fun.  Don't spend money and you can have fun and reach the highest level which is 60 but if you play matches and go up against a level 60 with special armor, weapons and mounts you will loose.  It has nothing to do with ability.If the Developers of this game would have just sold it for $40 or $50 and let you earn all the special stuff it would have been a great game and tons of variety and fun for all.  I now someone from Neverwinter will read this and send me a nasty comment telling me I'm unfair but everything I've listed it true in my opinion.  Have I had fun sure but it would be more fun if I could afford all the extras.One big thing I forgot to mention is that on the Neverwinter log on screen there is a place to do surveys and you go to a spot called Peanutlabs and there is a list of surveys you can do. Each one tells you how much Zen you will receive for you game Neverwinter if you do the survey.  DON'T DO IT THEY DON'T PAY.  The people at Neverwinter don't care if you complain to them they send you to Peanutlabs you can look at the surveys you took each has a number and check the box ""didn't receive my Zen for doing the survey"" and all they do is send you an E-mail saying sometimes surveys can't be verified..What a load of crap.  SO DON'T BE FOOLED.			"

												Been playing since beta. It was good in terms of the core mechanics, and the actual way the gameplay flows. But then I hit endgame, and bam. Your hopes are quickly shattered. The lack of separate balancing in PvP and PvE makes it a nightmare, with flavour of the month classes dominating either one or both. Most recently in Mod 5, the TR class was overwhelmingly powerful, likewise with the CW class. However most classes were still able to get aroud it via skill and experience. And then Mod 6 came. Despite constant feedback from the players telling them that it wasn't ready for actual release from the preview forums, and an absolute litany of bugs for almost every single class, it was still released. And today, today we the players are left to deal with the crap left behind. From critical hits doing less damage then a regular attack in PvP, to the weakest enemies in Tier 2 dungeons being capable of 1 shotting tanks, to the absolutely ridiculous power levels of classes which we repeatedly said were too powerful. Imagine fighting a boss in any other game which was capable of becoming immune to your attacks and attempts to control it, while also being capable of killing anything in but a few hits while in that state. That's what a TR has become.Imagine any game where the devs would claim balance but make one class the best at tanking, controlling, and DPS, all while other classes are left in the dirt dealing practically no damage and gutted due to bugs which have existed since its release. Does that sound balanced? If it does to you, you'll love this game. If not, then the best advice I can give you is to go play some other mmorpg, that's certainly what I plan to do.Have fun and good luck no matter what you do.P.S. This is just about the gameplay, don't even get me started on stuff like the ridiculous Refinement Point system.			"

												NEVER-RICH-ENOUGH. In Perfect World's eyes, unless you are a direct descendent of the Neverwinter Crown or a high noble of the Jewel of the North, your experience will be limited to that of the slums or sewers. It is as if Lord Nasher said screw the Lords' Alliance, we are only accepting billionaires.Seriously though, every interaction in the game eventually comes down to Zenny. Astral Diamonds are a commodity in this game, and gold buys you absolutely nothing of value. They put that currency in there for aesthetics only. However, if you are a sucker for mobile cash grab games, and don't mind pouring $100/month into those, then by all means do yourself a favour and switch to this game. You will certainly have more fun.Yes, you can have fun playing this game when there isn't a microtransaction sneaking around every corner. No amount of Search or Listen training will prepare you for that garbage. Hopefully one day Perfect World will drop the license for Neverwinter and allow a new developer to take it up and maybe bring us what we all deserve, a Neverwinter Nights 3. We can only pray to the gods for a miracle, hopefully within 10 years best case scenario.			"

												Pros:- It's a stupid fun game- fighting is fluid- Despite all the rage over the market, you can go without buying thingsCons:- DLC is too gorram expensive, what the hell is up with that? 200 bucks for a gaggle of digital crap? PASS- Forced Five player dungeons...trust me, play with friends because you will never get these done otherwise and there is at least one in every area. Other thoughts:character slotting is very limited but I got arround that with multiple accounts...yes, I have no life, wanna fight about it? :). Some of the DLC is entirely to expensive so in the end you have to ask yourself a few questions that I've found helpful when I get the itch (btw 50 hours, 4 accounts, and not a penny dropped on this game)Q1: Do I really need this item and why?Q2: how will this help me?if the answer to either of these questions is ""cuz it's shiney!"" chances are you DO NOT NEED IT. but if you want to spend your money because you genuinely like the game then by all means do so but as with anything do so in moderation. Trust me I'd love to run around fearune with all the badest gear and mounts. I not only love DnD but I really enjoy my time in this game. 9.5/10 "

												The longer the game's life goes on and the more Module's they add onto it, the more it's clear that they're just trying to get money at this point.I don't want to pay $75 dollars just to play a single race, every class is broken in one area or another, the game has gone from a little grindy to exponentially more grindy, the level cap increase caused more problems for me than it did help, the queue system is still when it's probably one of the if not the number one complaint I see in and out of the game, the PvP is very dull and you will almost always lose to someone who paid to win, packing the most ridiculous enchantments and gear in the game, there's a problem with bots that seems to be increasing from what I've heard, more often than not a Guild will die just a few months after it is made because Guilds serve next to no purpose except for getting into Gauntlgrym and just doing everything on your own anyway.

												If you enjoy skyrim type combat and action rpging... seems like you can play the campaign for free and have some fun but it's a rather repetitive affair and the gameplay gets boring.Game is full of the MMO trappings to get you to fork over your money in copious quantities so if you are not a fan of that I suggest you stay away and keep to proper single player or co-op rpgs.I got to level 20 and bailed, not too bad of an experience as my first MMO at least... just boring.

												I don't recommend this game for anyone. I played about 900 hours of this ""thing"" from the open beta(soft launch in March 2013) to the release of Module 2.Unfortunately the clowns in Cryptic and Perfect World are turning the game even more P2W with every patch. New reskinned mounts became companions and reskinned companions became mounts that cost outrageous amounts of Zen. PVP is dominated by bots, 110% mounts and players that have bought his gear with money, like the Tenebrous enchantments. Bots are dominating the market and the developers do nothing to punish this behavior. Every new patch introduce new bugs and exploits and old bugs and exploits still haunt the player community from the soft-launch in March 2013.The game has 6 classes now but you need only 3 to do the end-game content, a Divine Cleric, a Trickster Rogue and 3 Control Wizards, oh wait, the game has no end-game content too! Boring and repetitive dailies and ""epic"" dungeons full of glitches and exploits are the only thing to do after max level. And before I forget, the community are one of the worst that I have ever seen, fanboys and dumb kidos everywhere, defending the need of profit for the company that are milking them.Stay away from this thing.*For the ones that live on Gabe's Harem only, look here:http://social.xfire.com/profile/blackdragonbirdAnd learn to read, I already stated that the games was soft launched in March 2013.

												There are reasons why I think this game isn't worth playing anymore..Before all the strongholds, and the underdark, neverwinter really cared about the gameplay and the community. However, the recent updates have been really really bad.My first reason for this game not being recommended is that the game is really time consuming and evolves a lot of grinding at levels 60-70. Before the stronghold update, traps did not give you injuries. Now. Every trap gives you an injury UNLESS you are a VIP, which proves this game is no longer focused on the community, but more on their income. Stronghold armour relies on stronghold boxes, which in order to open require a strongbox key, which is also on their market, and also proves they just want more income.There are so many campaigns to do after level 70 that this game gets boring as you are constantly repeating missions. PVP is still broken with bots, at level 10-50, at level 60-70 if you haven't got a high Gs you will not stand a chance. Before strongholds, health and power were all balanced and the level cap was 60. Now health can go up too 160K and the level cap is now 70. Level 60-70 is possibly the most boring part of neverwinter. The only good part about neverwinter is the story, which is level 1-60. After that, it's all grinding and repeated quests and dailies.Personally, I don't recommend neverwinter. At all.			"

												Oh Jeez, where do i start...? Well, first the things i liked:- The combat is great. I like the way classes feel and play... even though it's 4th edition D&D.- Graphics are ok and atmospheric, sound and music fit.- Character developement is a bit deeper than usual (in terms of Skills and attributes, which are on autorail in most mmorpgs).- A crafting-system which does not require you to stand at a work-bench and wait while your avatar creates one low-tier-item after another until next tier is unlocked. All in all you can have fun in PvE... until you hit levelmax and enter the  addon-campaigns like temple of elemental evil.At that point you will meet a barrage of Paywalls and daily-grinds. Seriously! You're expected to do daily-missions for about a week until ONE Story-mission is unlocked or a Progression-bar is filled. Then rince and repeat. And the High-End-Mobs expect you to have at 4k-gear. My Trickster-Rouge has about 3.5k-gear after a long grind and investing a bit of money and i still keep getting overwhelmed when i try to go solo... and sadly this extends to foundry as well.    I mean, it's a bad sign if you do a group-dungeon for your Level, but doing less damage with your DD-Rouge than a Tank with 4k-gear. Seriously f*** that sh**!!!!!Oh, and PvP? Forget it! Even if everyone is phased to a common level, player with high-tier-equipment will destroy you. Neverwinter whas a nice F2P game when it launched... but right now, it's a freemium. Can you overcome this Wall without paying a dime? Sure, but that would be masochistic. Oh, and to those guys who say ""nah, it's fine. You just have to invest a bit more time and grind"": NO! That's not a sign of quality, that's Stockholm-Syndrome			"

												Like many PWE games, this game is fun for a time.  End-game is interesting when you first reach it, but you quickly realize that you MUST buy ""zen"" to get the most out of this experience.  The primary barrier being that if you party up with people who have epic mounts, you will get left in the dust without purchasing one yourself.  It IS possible to acquire ""zen"" with the in-game Astral Diamond currency, but it will take you a LONG time to acquire enough AD to buy enough zen to purchase an account-wide epic mount.  Some mounts can be acquired solely with AD however these will be bound to your character, whereas mounts purchased with zen will be account-wide.  While this might not necessarily be much of an issue if, say, epic mounts only cost around $5 worth of zen, it is an issue because they cost more like $25 - $40 worth of zen.   As with all other PWE games I have played, this game has a severe greed problem and pay walls will keep you from getting the most out of it.  Avoid this game.  Take your $40 of epic mount money to a proper MMO.			"

												I only play PVE so if you're looking to get a review about PVP look more.So I've played this game for quite a bit and I think its amazing. I'm currently have 4 60's : GWF, HR, CW, GFMy GWF is 18k GSPros:-Combat is fast and fun, if you're not paying attention in those end game dungeons you might find yourself dead.-I always have a goal, wether it be getting new gear or my campaigns.-The community is actually really friendly, I've had some really great experiences my self.-You can earn everything in game for free. EVERYTHING. Yes it might take some time, but whats the point of playing a game if you dont want to earn some things?-Skill matters, what I mean by this is if you practice your class and get good at timing with your abilities etc. You can potentially out damage somone who is higher geared than you, that is if they arent as skilled as you. I like this because I'm lightweight competitive and I always want to be the highest damage dealer on the charts.-Leveling isn't a drag, sure some people want the leveling to be a slow process but the thing is, IT CAN! If you want to take time leveling then do that, pay attention to what NPC's say, read the story. But if you want to zoom to 60 skip everything do the quests as fast as possible and you can get it done extremely fast. I'm an altoholic so this is good for me :)-25 man raids will finally be coming out soon! thats right, 25 man raids!Cons:-Okay there are wallet warriors.. But don't pay attention to them, if you like PVP then I don't reccomend this game for you entirely, pvp can be a mess sometimes.-The end game relies on you to farm. You might have to farm a dungeon 10+ times in a row to get the things you need. BUT THATS NORMAL. I've ran every dungeon in this game probably 50+ times. I love the combat in this game so i never get bored.-Farming the end game currency becomes a chore. But if you're a long term player then don't take it seriously. Play the game to have fun, hell dont even play the game everyday. You can collect an easy 24k of the end game currency a day and if you get that + do a few dungeons you can easy make 50k a day and be rich in 3 months. Otherwise farm hardcore and become a bawss.-No open world. Okay I don't have an excuse here, I really wish this had open world but hey, it doesn't have it, it never will, and if that makes you hate it then dont play.About the classes I've played so far:Great Weapon Fighter: By far my favorite class. They are fast moving high damage dealers. They can also take a punch. I find myself constantly moving around in battle finding the best way to position myself, because in this game there is a thing called Combat Advanatage, which allows you to do more damage to an enemy if you're hitting it from the right spot. The skills on this class may not be your devestating mage skills but they are fun and fluid.Control Wizard: This class is probably one of my least favorites. I'm just terrible with this class. It does high damage but I feel like it moves really slow, I don't like it's dodge move and I really dont like the way it casts spells. Although when I am farming for enchantments I use this class to wipe mobs out really fast :P.Hunter Ranger: This class is actually really fun. Moving around constantly shooting your bow while kiting enemies then when they are low health switch to your duel wielding daggers and go in for the kill. The skills on the hunter ranger are really flexible and allow you to choose to be a high damage ranger, or go more of a supportive role and do damage while boosting the damage of your allies.Gaurdian Fighter: This class is pure tank. This is another class that feels really slow to me. I like to move fast ""sanic"". But this class is starting to become a very popular class in the endgame right now with the addition of new dungeons, and I imagine with 25 man raids coming out this will be a most wanted class. This class is mainly about buffing your allies and tanking though.So this is my review and I hope you can give this game a try at least. Obviously there are alot more Pro/Con's but those are the ones I felt like mentioning. Sure this game isnt perfect, and it could use alot of work. But if you're looking for a new long term MMO then I would reccomend this. With expansions coming out every 3-5 months, and 25 main raids coming I'll be sure to stick around.Also if you ever need some help in game or have any questions you can add me in game Jessi@dubstepghostt "

												Honestly.. I've been playing this game since mod 2 or something and many things have changed.In fact, i want to be accurate and i've been playing this game since Dread Ring was released.Before even Hunter Ranger,Scourge Warlock and Oathbound Paladin classes were even realeased.For those who have played this game they know the Dread Ring Campaign,they have played this game just before it's release date they know about what times i'm talking about.Back then there was no overflow experience and not 70 level being the maximum level.I remember dungeons were divided in 3 tiers and the highest gear score(which is basically one's player stats)was about 21k and maximum HP about 50k(which back then it was something mad) and i'm talking about full epic equipment with full rank 10 enchantments.Things back then were not that easy but still.After i've realised the servers have been treated poorely by the developers and now the game is evolved into a stealing money machine i've reached into a conclusion.After experiencing the whole game in mod 6 i've grown tired of this,after watching everything change into some sort of artifact hunt and mythic b*llshit,after trancendent vorpal enchantments got out and rank 12 enchantments worthing a hell lot of money i understood that this game has been destroyed.Around 500 hours on Steam and same as many in Arc launcher almost to 1000 hours of gameplay i realised that i will be never be bored to the gameplay of this game.Because it is amazing but as i said before i'm tired of this sick growing development.If you are still reading this, good job.. many would have just ignored that or pass this review just like an old dusty book in a library but if you are the one curious to open and read that old dusty book,you are from now on a really good path because only dusty books hide some secrets and let's say that this review is just one of them.I'm telling that you will love this game but after spending all this time on this game and you reach to an end you'll then realise that it was a waste of time. Because gaming has now lost its own sense and meaning and you will really wonder why haven't you spent all this time somewhere else so in the end you would be satisfied.In all means(and just because i'm a assh*le writing all this huge boring sh*ty review)i'm telling you to play this game and you will have fun.You will come down my path and you'll experience as much as i had but in the end it doesn't even matter.So fellow gamer good luck :)and don't forget it's good to explore new places.

												I`m playing with standalone game (not via steam) since open beta.Game is really fun, mechanics and lots of parts of the game are well-made.It was fun to :- make all of 9 characters- farm with friends new content and became stronger with each update.- to see, after so much time put into your character, how good you became.- help less experienced players and keep your party together in challenges.- etc.And then fire nation attacked (with earth, water and air together). Module 6 (Ele)mental evil.Changes:- added lot of farming areas with no story. Just to justify levels 61-70.- taken quests/maps/dungeons from level 60 to 70, making them unreasonably harder.- with higher levels you gain LESS effect on the same stat value (example, 10% damage reduction on 60 will be 6% on 65). Because of that i was getting WEAKER wih every level up. (I didn`t want to level up, how ridiculus is that.)- They set new line about ""decent"" and ""good"" gear. Now ""awesome"" gear you farmed hours, days, weeks for are ""meh"" or ""bad"" now. However good you were, you are weak now.- New skills? Too bad most of ALL skills are broken now. Wait a month or 2 and maybe they will fix half of them.- PvP became ridiculus. Some healers can fight 4-8 other players in the same time. - As unfriendly as it can get for new players. Even old players are unfriendly to new players. Everyone hate new players until you`ll throw 10x AAA game price into game, and you will get kicked / killed / trashed / massacred / laughed at / danced on.And this are changes only in this module.So, when other games add new content where you can get even stronger than before, this module made youWEAKER and force you to FARM or PAY to be at least as good as before and play OLD content.Why the hell do i have to struggle, or farm, to be able to win in dungeon that i played already over 100 times?Why the check most of my almost best equipment i could get became WEAK in a week?Why would you want to start playing this game if you`ll know that you can become weak with every update?Why would you want to pay for something that will become insignificant? Some of players lost a lot of money because of this module.Just stay away from this game, until you don`t have anything to do with big amounts of money, or hear about some big changes.			"

												This game falls into the usual Perfect World crap - poor account handling, massive amounts of pay to play/win traps, and thoroughly broken loading screens. Like Star Trek Online, another MMO ♥♥♥♥ out by Perfect World/Cryptic, the game hangs infinitely at the game's own unique loading screen and will never proceed. There isn't a single fix out there for this and you'll know it's a lost cause when you take one click and freeze the whole game leaving you with no choice but to forceclose it. Even then, can this game be truly worth it? There hasn't been a single PC game that's been faithful to D&D. From Neverwinter Nights to Baldur's Gate even, it's strayed as far as it can from the core game. Even Dungeons and Dragon Online was a massive failure and also prone to pay to win/play traps and a noticeable and depressing lack of content. I can see Neverwinter falling into this considering this IS Perfect World and a company that repeatedly fails as fixing their games and instead places all their effort into making most of the content paid for, the repetitive nature of MMORPS are never worth it. Don't even waste your time downloading this. It won't work.			"

												It's a huge cash grab. It's not p2w but it's pretty close, you can play for free and have some fun but you'll never be great for free anymore. They keep taking stuff and nerfing stuff trying to combat bot farmers but here's the thing, those farmers aren't negatively affecting players, the changes that they make to combat the bots do negatively affect the real players. They have made it so much harder for the new players to ever get anything that I'd never recommend this game. If I never played again it'd take a new player 5000 hours and a couple of thousand dollars to attain the things that I've gotten in my thousand hours. It has great things about it and if they made it a subscription game and stopped all the stupid nerfing then it'd probably be awesome. At this point I'd recommend Rift or ESO before this even though they are also heavy cash grabs.. I guess the days of great subscription mmo's are gone in favor of the cash shop..editing because my comment was too long to reply in the comments.demon dog, I have every class at 70 (10 characters - 8 are 70) and complete collections of epics. I know how to play and I can afford things if I did want to buy them.. If you read everything I wrote I explained that new characters can not get these items now without thousands of dollars spent and thousands of hours. Yes you can play the game now and enjoy it for free but you will never be the best without paying, even if you play great they have now make it impossible to earn enough in game to level up items, pets, etc. without spending cash. I am a guild leader and I see new and casual players leaving the game like crazy because they can't grind for 1000 hours after hitting 70. They are making changes that ruin the game for new players and casual player alike. Get your epics, pets, maxed, runes to rank 12, without paying? I don't think so. Perfect example is wards now are only buyable with cash or trade bars which come from chest which you pay cash to open, good luck getting your enhancement slots to rank 12 without spending a fortune right there. Pets take 1 million astral diamonds to just get from purple to orange, they just took out the freebie daily diamonds so now you have to go raiding to get them and salvage anything that you get. getting 3000 at a time good luck with that too. Getting one of the best mounts without cash? you tell me how now. Now that the mounts also add combat stats it actually does make a difference. The foundry? That turned to crap a couple of years ago, does anyone run player made stuff anymore? doubtful as nobody that I know does. The community in general has been declining greatly over the last couple of years. Now random groups are all zerg with maybe even an afk or two. It was not that way before and the changes that they are making are in my opinion for the worse not the better. How many guilds ever see more than 10% of their members online together now?Best of luck to those that want to play it, enjoy it. I think that you can probably play quite a lot before you really notice the issues or before you start spending your cash. I didn't say the game is garbage, it's headin in that direction though, I stand by my review. My review is for new players to know what they are getting into, for the record I have no problem myself attaining anything or in completing and dungeon, I feel the need to point that out as some are taking my review as me whining and that's not what it is..

												Ok so to start things off i have been here almost since the beginning of neverwinter and spent almost 1 thousand hours playing. So I think it's safe to say i have a good foundation for my opinion. The game for the first few zones is fun and then on after you can start to feel a repetitive scheme. After reaching level 60 the grind really begins.   I stopped playing neverwinter about when the maze engine released so a lot probably has changed since then but nonetheless, It became a struggle for me to continue any longer, playing a game in which a character who was level 1 had gear and items far superior to mine, when the grind was to bothersome and tiring, i have lived through it and experienced it all. I have about 3 level 60 characters and two level 70's or something like that (it's been a long time) somehow i managed to play for so long to achieve that much. But when it comes to enjoying the game, I could no longer do it. I couldnt say i enjoyed it. At the time it felt so 'flawed'. Everyone always looked like they were one step ahead of me, why? Probably because the only money i bothered to spend on the game was just enough to buy the dusk unicorn mount and that is about it, yet everyone else decided to spend their money buying things and exchanging this for that, the AD currency could do a lot of things if you have enough of it, even get gear beyond your level if your level 10 or on par with the others around you. But for me the p2w aspect hurt the most when I made the choice to play pvp.  I played so hard and spent so much time doing things legit and without the help of money, yet when hardworking players like me that upgraded their gear increased their stats, and had the willpower to say ""I did it"" and feel satisified only to get completely obliterated by some bragging, cocky and overconfident rich kid who boasts about how much money he spends on the game on a daily basis is just beyond me. Believe me, if you plan on playing this game as a newcomer go right ahead you may just enjoy the first few or so hours of the game or maybe you might enjoy the entire game, but dont stray to far from what's possible you can earn every piece of equipment if you work hard enough, but if you want to ♥♥♥♥ on every hardworking, time sinks dreams, than spend all the money you want, it will get you everthing you want 100 times faster and you'll leave everyone eating your dust. That is what drove me away from this game, that is what i left for, to stop wasting time and doing things i could no longer accomplish because i was so far behind, it would take a year to catch up to the p2w players. Because when you purchase something from that market you will very likely possess an advantage over the average player, even if it is a mount like the one i purchased.			"

												What can I say, this game used to be good, until they made almost everything pay to win, I did play this game for more then 2 years and had to quit because a non-casher like me couldn't compete with millionaires in this game anymore, end game is now hard, PvP is all about money, if you don't want to spend money don't bother starting to play this game.

												One of the best examples of a Pay 2 Win game - Definition of Wallet Warriors. I AM PLAYING FROM MOD 3 !===PVP=== Dont bother going PVP over between 60-70 as would be constantly be 1 shotted by P2W players. Try to pvp between 1-60? not with our system ! which is broken beyond repair and we dont bother to fix it, only to get new items out and get your money ! 4/5 Matches you will find at least 2-3 or even more guys, with transcendent (best enchants in the game) enchants, which will probably makes your life unbereable and most likely 1 shot you ( by most likely i mean 100%). Not to mention the mounts that give bonuses. Run into some dude with 2k Power / Crit on his mount and you're most likely going to lay down dead while he talks nonsense for you being a peasent ( yes this is that kind of game, where P2W players talk nonsene for being too overpowered and by overpowered i mean they put a lot of money in the game and get too many kills). Did i mention premade pvp teams?===PVE=== Pve is pretty good (not really, it's pretty horrible too if you have lag...) Expect from time to time enemies hitting you from far away or 1 shotting you, especially if you are running an epic dungeon when even a cockroach can give you 80k damage or even 1 shot you. PVE over 60-70 is pretty much a bunch of nonsense... Grind you way to the 70 trough hoardes of enemies that are too powerfull for you and can easily kill you. Reach lvl 70? Good now run trough an epic dungeon and i'll let you know yourself this time, what hell means. ===CLASSES=== There are like 9 classes in the game or something like that. want to get really good with both PVP an PVE? Go with Trickster Rogue (TR) which can survive the impossible and deal huge amounts of damage, both to players and monsters. Annoy players in pvp like there's no tomorrow.===GRINDING=== THIS GAME IS ALL ABOUT GRINDING !! Grind 1000 of hours only to get that 1 piece of equipment you can buy from the store for 10$. Daily limits, yeah...k...more pointless grinding, come back tomorrow for the same quest which gives you 1 point out of 100 to continue. come back in those 99 days to keep doing the quest until you complete to receive nothing. in general the grinding is pointless and gets boring really really quickly.===PATCHES=== From my experience so far and many hours grinding and playing this game with steam or with ARC launcher i can say that most patches are complete utter trash. A patch is not making items in the store cheaper cryptic... pls.... Sure they sometimes ""try"" to make something good but it just ends horrible. Breaking the game, from nerfing classes to the ground making them unplayable to making classes impossible to kill. They released a new patch? It's full of bugs? Players abusing it to get rich and then get banned ? We'll fix it after 3 months so we lose more and more players ! Jesus christ Cryptic... broken broken and more broken. ===SERVERS=== Not the best but could be worst. Huge amounts of lag. If you dont have a beefy computer dont even bother. Glitchy, broken, and god knows what.===FEEDBACK & COMMUNITY=== Now i'm not so sure about the community on the forums since i dont visit it very often but i sure can tell you a lot about the community ingame. Trolls, P2W, F2P, Flamers... wait... this suddenly sounds like LOL... There are good players in the game that SOMETIMES will help you go trough dungeons, farm, grind, give you items but that's very rare. Most of the time players will laugh at you for being weak and not spending money to get gud, laugh at your expense. Feedback...god almighty... dont get me started. ===PERFORMANCE=== My specs are on my profile, it's public so go take a look. Performance is pretty horrible, hehe, not surprised eh? The game has a wide options in graphics settings and visuals but most of, even if you put them all to low you will only get 10+ fps since the servers are bad or the game bad optimised. 1 or 2 changes to the right settings can give you 7-8+ fps while the rest 1 or 2 fps bonus. The game will look like ♥♥♥♥ on low. In average i get 20-30 FPS with my current specs on. Stronghold map, you will acces this map once you have a guild, i currently have around 6-15 fps on that map since it's their biggest map ever made... Make a gigantic map with a bad optimized game, not the brightest idea. On extra low settings you get like 2-3+ fps. Yeah. ===THE COMPANY=== Money grabbing company. Biggest changes you will see is making the game worse, deleting items that you cant find in pve or pvp only on store. They dont listen to feedback and mostly care for money. They fix bugs from time to time only for players not to leave the game completely. Give this game 1-2 years it will die. And that frikin Trickster Rogue is still op, both PVE and PVP, and we've been complaining from like...forever... ===IMPORTANT NOTES=== There are 3 currencies in the game, (4 if you count items, trading) ZEN - GOLD - ASTRAL DIAMONDS (AD)--ZEN = Currency you can get only from putting money in the game or exchanging Astral Diamonds. The value like any real currency floats. It can get bigger or smaller. In this game it only gets bigger which means more AD for 1 piece of ZEN. --GOLD = speaks for itself. COPPER - SILVER - GOLD--ASTRAL DIAMONDS = Astral diamonds you can only get from Dungeons,Events,Skirmishes,etc. There is an auction house which only works with ASTRAL DIAMONDS AND NOT GOLD ! English is not my native language so i'm sorry if i made any mistakes. You the reader will have to play for yourself and see how the game feels for you, if what i said here applies to you or not, if you feel it or not. You just have to play the game and see if you like it. I persoanlly did not like it.			"

												Quick tip, don't take a great RPG series and turn it into a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ MMO that barely qualifies as a Dungeons and Dragons game. To their credit, they did manage to implement some interesting features from DnD, but they missed out on some very important ones. Such as depth. It's basically DnD 4th edition except even more watered down,  which I guess is somewhat impressive. The classes are very boring as well, you have the rogue, which unlike actual DnD rogues is bland and uninteresting. The ranger gets the ability to switch between Drizzt and Legolas which if you've ever asked anyone whose never played DnD before those are the only two types of ranger (Which can't be a coincidence). The fighter gets two classes, you can be the guy with the sword and the shield or the guy with the bigger sword and no shield, but I guess I should just be happy they've recognized there are classes of fighter other than ""Guy with shield"". Then we have the cleric, a pure healer class that lacks almost aany offensive capabilities, no turn undead, no evil smiting, just healing and buffs. And finally, the mage, which can't specialize in any school of magic and, due to the game's ♥♥♥♥ ability system, can only have a total of 5 different spells in their action bar (Even worse than 4e), preventing any real variety in their strategies. My favorite classes to play are the barbarians, druids, paladins, bard, and monk. Because they aren't in the game. I guess I'm not surprised because they're some of the most interesting classes, and designing them would take effort.Anyway, enough about the ♥♥♥♥-tier classes, let's move onto the combat! Basically, you hold the left mouse button to hit people, right mouse to hit people with the equivalent of a 4e at-will power, and occasionally Q, E, or R to use an ability, oh wait, ""Encounter power"", which you will use multiple times in a fight. Because the devs have probably never played DnD You also get daily powers that you can use by spending an action point (Doesn't do what it actually does in the tabletop by the way), represented by a blasphemous D20 shaped gauge in the middle of the UI which is filled by hitting things as well as something else which is based on your class, unless of course you're a rogue or wizard in which case you just hurt things. Because interesting game design is difficult. Also, there are about four different kinds of enemy, just with different skins slapped on them which, coupled with the fact that all the dungeon quests are the same too, means that the game is quite repetitive. There are also a lot of mechanics which are named after actual DnD mechanics that bear no resemblance to their namesake, such as the aforementioned action point. But hey, it's hard to replicate the mechanics of a game you've probably never played in the first place.On the free to play side of things, all I want you to do is scroll up to the DLC tab and look at the pricing.TL;DR, They took 4e, stripped it down to the most boring part, and made it even shallower.

												How's ""pay to win"" games fun? it's like using hacks or using gameshark on the older systems to gain advantage in this case you're buying the advantage with the in-app(game) stores.

												Due to Steam deleting my review which literally reached the character limit and I did not have it copied, I am going to just give a TLDR about this game.TLDR:I have over 3,000 hours on this game despite it saying 2 hours on Steam, $780 spent.No incentive to farm anything, no end game, not fun (PVE, PVP however is a cluster ♥♥♥♥ now), lots of removed content, broken classes, PVP is broken as hell, not worth it to farm anything, devs do not give a single sht about you, lots of lies from the devs, banned for making too much AD (main currency),  etc.Just no, don't invest your time or money in this game, it's bad.Edit: Since some people are illiterate and cannot read the comments, let me clarify.This game is NOT worth it for newcomers to get into, or old players to come back to, the only reason I kept playing was solely for PVP which I had near max gear. If you're a newcomer, it's going to take you quite a damn while to get near max gear, I gave up on PVE in Mod 5 (about a year and a half ago?) and only kept playing just for PVP. Most PVP players are in full groups with a near maxed/maxed guild (Guild boons, give a crazy amount of stat points) so you're not going to have fun, thus why I continued since it was worth it for me, a player who had near max gear.

												I would not recommend this game at this time if you are just starting out for a RPG MMO. First what WAS good about it:Neverwinter during it's first mod 1-4 was a great game, and as F2P was a excellent product. It's combat system at the time was a bit better than all the other MMO I have played, it wasn't just a stand in one place and hack away type of combat system, you had to watch what the adversary was doing and react. It had enough content to keep even the shortest attention span busy, and had a fairly well rounded grouping and dungeoneering system, with plenty of dungeons etc. As they added new powers and skills and classes they were well tested and fit in a cohesive manner, yes there were a few tweeks needed as they went live but they got on it and it worked. The refining (gem slotting) system was fairly easy and made sense and the professions (crafting) were well balanced (to an extent). The game was always advertised as casual friendly and alt friendly and it was, you could get up and running through the first 20 lvl and tutorials with logical steps, the newbie stages were well thought out and introduced you well to the features. If the class you started wasn't a good fit for you, it was easy to start another and have an alt. it wasn't too expensive to get additional character slots beyond the initial 2 so you could try other characters on with relative ease. The community was friendly, and while it's always had a gold/AD spammer problem (AD in game currency), it was a minor annoyance. You could earn in game currency through in game activities with some effort, and with some patience and hoarding and haggling get about anything you truely needed. Then the changes came....What IS bad about it:About mod 5 they started obsessing more about monitization and content pushs, than bug catching. The classes introduced were unbalanced from the get go and didn't seem cohesive. When they tried to ""balance"" things they went at it with a meat cleaver and only made what was bad even worse, then they had to hack back on something else with the cleaver. Despite a forum with tons and tons of suggestions and pleas, they ignored it all and bulled right on through to the detriment of both the game and the player participation levels. They never have gotten any semblance of balance to PvP and the same classes always dominate, the matching system that was rudimentary at first, but worked was ""improved"" to make it even worse, anyone not BIS in everything need not match up in pvp, you will hate it, it's a gear fest in the worst way and 2 classes are nearly god mode in pvp.Because of the monitization, they made some short term decisions that got people to buy more character slots, and invest in assets for crafting as a means to generate AD to keep up with the ever increasing and complicated refining system and the mod anfter mod gear obsolesence. They took the random dungeon drops (that were the whole reason to dungeon in the first place) away and put them in end chests that either were on timers or needed Zen (Store currency) to purchase keys. Rather than an insured odds of some drop, they nerfed even the chest rewards to items that were'nt salvagable or refinable. The in game ""loot chests"" that you needed another type of key got put on a increased rotation rate, so there was another whole set of chests in a month.Decision after decision, mod after mod they have done more to damage the game and annoy the player base. The mod 6 introduced a guild content push, locking lots of content behind forced groupingand huge material outlay to get to it (oh and of course you can pay money to get past all that material outlay....$100s and $100s of dollars). With that mod alone they effectively killed the ""casual play/alt friendly"" model they always pushed, the BIS stuff was all lokked way, way ebhind that guild content.They are at mod now, and way abck in mod5 when they nerfed all the AD generation they promised to ""fix"" things so those that play get rewarded, they have yet to deliver, they have only added some window dressing fixs that apply to the elite 10% and the rest are left out.They have changed the casual play to  a hit it and quit it model, unless you are the long time elite 10% you got no real reason to play, they advertise hard on the internet to bring in the new player and are trying to get the person that will make a huge money investment to get up to speed, then in 6-7 months, when they tire of spend spend spend, quit. With a new influx of new player behind them, they have did little to nothing to retain the middle ground player, and seems to have gone out of their way to antagonize them.My recommendation:Unless you have wads of cash you like to spend to get to a P2W status, you are going to hate the needlessly added grind and negligable ""if you play you are rewarded"" they never deliver. If you are a ""paper doll"" type of play, like to collect suits and clothes, it has a samll alure, but better plan on investing on baggage space to hold it all (RL money btw) since there is no stable or a wardrobe system inplace. Barring wads of cash, stay away from this one, otherwise within weeks you are going to be logging on to only place set stuff and then off, not really playing. "

												Don't play Neverwinter.Seriously!The game is over three years old and has still vast technical issues from day one and also laggs and framedrops on newer GPUs like GTX970 or GTX 980.Also this game is pay2win. You need additional bag space because they created a strange refinement system with hundreds! of different items while the bag space can cost you over 30 Dollar. You want an epic mount: Buy it. You want the best mount in the game, a legendary one, then spend several hundred dollars on the gamble lockbox machine.Certain key items that you need for your gear progression are locked behind the ingame shop.They will state you can get everything with time but that is a lie because they have somekind salvage system in the game that only exist to restrict your daily income and dungeon runs will net you no profit over that limited forced uppon you through this salvaging system.And even if you catch up, they can make an update to ""rebalance"" the game and litterally delete the progression of several years of work.The game has on PC at best only 20.000 player left from formerly 2 millions. PvP is unplayable because it lacks the playerbase and is otherwise broken because you can buy power if you are in a big guild (which is easier and faster upgradable if you spend money).The Foundry, one of the key features of the game is not playable and isn't updated in over two years.Seriously don't play this game. I played it since the beginning and only recently got rid of their own Steam-esque client because it opened a security hole in my firewall.			"

												This was my first MMORPG that I took seriously. I really enjoy the fact that it is based on D&D, as I play 4e in real life. I was specifically looking for games based on D&D when I came across Neverwinter. Started playing a lot, and found an AMAZING multi-game guild that are now like my extended family. Moved up the ranks in the guild, passed 1000 hours in-game... what can I say? I love this game.However, there are some negatives. Cryptic and Perfect World Entertainment have slowly been removing things from the game that players really used to enjoy, the Gateway being a big one. Before I started playing, apparently Coalescent Wards were in the Trade Bar Store, but now you can only get them with Zen or huge amounts of AD. Little things like that add up, and I know many players who left the game because of it. These changes also fundamentally destroyed parts of the in-game economy (the Zen<->AD trade comes to mind) and it still hasn't balanced itself out.All that said, I still really enjoy the game, and the Winter Festival (on now) is pretty awesome. The new content in Storm King's Thunder is great, though you need to be pretty high Item Level to solo it. I highly recommend joining a guild, and if you find me in-game (Tieran The Blind) I'd be happy to add you to our guild.EDIT JANUARY 2017:Well, they just changed the way the loot system at the end of dungeons works. They claim that there's new, better loot, but the big change is no previewing of chests before you use a key on it. I know this is probably how it works in most games, but it's been like this since the launch of Neverwinter and a LOT of people are angry about it. What really rubs me the wrong way is that PWE and Cryptic know they can do anything they want and most of their players will just suck it up and keep playing. We need to STOP playing for a bit, and send lots of negative feedback. If they see their numbers drop off a cliff, they'll listen.Until this is resolved, I'd say stay away unless you have friends playing.			"

												While I cannot recommed this game, it does have some good qualities. Unfortunately, the bad out weigh that by far. I started the game in beta. Initially, did not like the graphics but got use to it. The lack of dedicated controller setting is also an issue. The game gets many updates/extra content which can be both bad and good.Now on to the bad. They add things fairly regularly. But everytime they do, have to get the better equipment. Making the older stuff useless. They also have the 'gotta have em all' mentality by adding new items and such which means in most cases you either buy extra slots somewhere to keep the old and get the new or something to that effect. Recently, they removed Astral Diamonds(AD') from the leadership crafting. Astral Diamonds are an in game currency. They dropped it because they could not figure out how to stop the bots from being on Neverwinter. Instead of working on the problem, they punish the player. Then they have the 'gold sellers'. These sites get people to break the TOS of Neverwinter. When reporting gold sellers, they say that they cannot let you know the outcome of them looking into it. Asked them what the usual punishment was told they cannot say for same reasons. If they are just account banning those people, doesn't mean crap. They get another throw away email and go back to it. They should be IP banned. The bots and/or the gold sellers ruined the in game economy ages ago. The exchange is maxed at 500AD's for 1 Zen(real cash money to buy these). The game has turned into a grindfest of all grindfests. The game has went cash grab big time.  Look for another MMO that you can actually have fun in.			"

												The most recent expansion (Mod 6 - Elemental Evil) has the misfortune of being the single worst expansion for any game I've ever played.  The level cap was raised, but half of the new zones were recycled versions of previous zones, and there are zero new endgame dungeons, encounters, events, or zones.  All old items are obsolete, of course, and furthermore new tiers were added to every item type to encourage more people to use the cash shop.  There are only three dungeons to play while leveling up, where there used to be a dozen or more.  The new zones don't have traditional questing - just repeatable hourly kill quests you have to do 16 of before advancing to the next hub.  I could go on, but the end result is that this expansion feels like nothing more than a shameless cash grab with no new content.			"

												This game was really fun until the latest expansion. I have played many hours of this and didnt really find it boring apart from the daily quests grind. The dungeons are really fun but the market has NEVER been viable so you'll never ever purchase anything because its just stupidly high for average stuff. With the current update up to 70 I have quit the game because its now the worst grind I've ever done by a monsterously big margin. Like.. repeating the exact same quests 16 times in an area to then move onto the next to do the EXACT same thing. What a load of ♥♥♥♥. The developers in this expansion should all lose their jobs as this is the ♥♥♥♥♥est thing I've ever seen. And I've seen my own poop. It's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ than ♥♥♥♥. They've just killed a great game.			"

												Really solid for a freebie; cool environments, awesome music and voice acting, and the combat is quick, varied and responsive. It takes a lot of dedication to try out a class to its fullest potential but replaying the leveling portions offers class and racial specific quests. Open instances are populated enough to be fun, but not crowded. Dungeon queuing could be more organized, its blind until you get in. Its got lots of content, and events seem to be coming fast and furious with unique items, mounts etc. The ingame currency to cash conversion rates seem a little steep, but its supply and demand, so I imagine the rates will drop over time.Overall, this is tough to pass up on!  9/10.

												At one point, this game was phenomenal, but sadly is no longer. The game took at turn for the worst upon the release of module 4: Tyranny of Dragons. The campaign system was already full of grind and repeating the same daily quests and was not very enjoyable for the most part. The staff decided the perfect solution, allowing one to pay 50 US dollars to completely skip the campaigns (each!) while also making the newest a larger time sink, not even making new zones for the quests. Only small extentions to questing areas and an additional small, single player dungeons. Upon raising the level cap, entire dungeons were removed (though, to be fair, they were added later by popular demand) and released a broken raid fraut with performance and connectivity issues that weren't fixed for weeks. The (relatively) new classes, Scourge Warlock and Oathbound Paladin, are unimaginitive and are, mechanically, variants of other classes. The Drangonborn race is blatantly ""pay to win,"" as you can only obtain it by paying for it. The racial passives are (subjectively) the most useful for all classes and can place bonus attribute points anywhere, unlike all of the other races which have a single bonus placed in locked attribute, and an aditional bonus that can be placed between 2 other attributes, or in the case of humans a single bonus in any attribute. If you are fan of Neverwinter Nights, Neverwinter Nights 2 or D&D in general, you'll be sorely disappointed. Classes lack creativity, many not very true to their classic renditions: Wizard being solely a control class and not having proper casts on spells, fighter being split into 2 seperate classes, ranger being nothing more that a fighter with abilities that have natural-esc names or effects and a warlock being a damage based wizard with some life steal mixed in. And the blatant abuse of classic characters is simply insulting to true D&D fans.			"

												Neverwinter looks and feels obsolete, in one word it’s tedious. What little Neverwinter has going for it is quickly crushed under a colossal load of bugs, asinine design choices, poor level design and the monotony of grinding.Pros:- engaging combat system (until it’s overexposed)- easy to play (I can haz buttonz to click 2)- free to play (no really it is. you can exchange game currency to the currency used in the pay shop, and getting the game currency is surprisingly easy, but does take a lot of grinding and time)Cons:- bad to sometimes broken animations (oh yeah we’re all contortionists)- poor sound (sound check, look it up)- textures vary greatly in quality even at maximum settings (gaze into the abyss of poor textures, also makes the textures gaze into you)- collision (I can clip a boulder but not a tiny torch?)- countless of bugs and server lags (I’m st...stu...stuck)- dull quests (wow another kill and collect quest, and there was much rejoicing)- end game is based around grind, and daily quests (another way of saying “we don’t care” or “we’re not that talented,” pick your poison).- poor level design (running back and forth is so fun)- several descriptions of talents/powers/items/quests in the game are either downright wrong or lacking crucial information (here take this boppermambu it will increase your batamino with something)- very little variation in what monsters can do (the bandit is an ogre in disguise)- Surprisingly bad story in a game based around D&D, one would think they had enough source material to pick from (once upon a time ... forget it, here take 8 dragons to fight for random loot).If you love narration, innovation, creativity and everything D&D stands for, avoid this game like the plague. If you want to laugh, as I did, of the cringe worthy bad design choices and poor executions hop on the wagon, it’s not really moving so it’s easy to catch.                                                                          //----------//If you do give it a try, which I think you should, here are some helpful macros. In the chat type:/gfxsetdefaultfov 90(sets the field of view to 90, in effect you zoom out, default is 55. Changing the numeric value changes the FoV)./bind f “interact”(This will make more sense once you try the game, but every now and then you will have trouble interacting with an object, either because the interact area is odd, or because another player is standing too close, This binds your F key to access only the object)/bind g “interactandloot”(This can be set in the menu, and is the standard interact option, it’s advisable to have it mapped to a key because on rare occasions you’ll need it. G was the key I mapped it to, you can obviously set it to any key)./bind h “gotocharacterselect”(again H was only the key I had it mapped to. Logging out and in is instant in this game if you can navigate through the menus fast enough, since every time you’re hit, the menu will close. This macro skips several menu steps and goes directly to the character select option, you still have to hit ""accept"" before you get hit, or take damage from a poison etc. This is useful when you want to complete a solo dungeon but is in a hurry, or tired of during the same dungeon over and over again, since you can run past all the trash mobs, log out to reset aggro, then in again to finish the boss)./hide(Makes you anonymous, useful to avoid pesky gold spammers, invites etc. But you can’t be invited into a party when this is on, but can still invite people into your own party, join PuG groups, and participate in encounters. You appear offline for friends)/friendsonly(Makes you anonymous for all but those on your friend list)/unhide(Removes the anonymous status, effectively ending both /hide and /friendsonly)There are several other macros that are fun to play around with, and I encourage you to try them out, since the customize options for the interface are limited.

												Neverwinter is an action mmo which requires you to be quick on your feet instead of just standing still in a corner while you mindlessly press your skill buttons, which most mmorpgs tend to be these days.The game features a dodge system where a red ring will appear when the enemy is about to do a powerful attack. If you don't dodge out of the way in time, you'll take a big amount of damage and you're more likely to die after that.Your skills aren't limited to mana. Each of them are on a cooldown timer which require you to plan ahead to make some big and powerful combos.The game currently features 6 different classes, all of which are unique and function in their own specific way. They're all interesting to play and doesn't feel bland.The graphics are really pretty to look at. The environments are very different from area to area and they're always fun and interesting to explore.The main storyline can easily be completed solo or with a few friends. There are a few optional dungeons and skirmishes along the way which require you to have a full party of 5 to be able to complete, if you don't have 4 friends available you'll be able to queue up and find other people who wants to complete the dungeon as well. But you aren't required to complete those dungeons or skirmishes if you want to progress in the main story line.It features one of the best, if not the best, paying options of all f2p mmo games out there.It closely resembles the paying options of Team Fortress 2 and Dota 2. You can chose to pay for items or you can chose to play the game and use the in-game currency called ""Astral Diamonds"" to buy store exclusive items. Most of these store exclusive items will also be available to purchase trough other players, either by directly trading with them or trough the in-game auction house.Note: The only store exclusive items that provide a stat bonus are companions, and they're pretty much worthless once you get to level 60 and start doing epic dungeons. However, you'll be able to get companions by just playing, but they won't be as powerful as their store counter-part.The devs have events about 1-2 times each month. Where you'll be able to get new items exclusive to said event or gain extra Astral Diamonds at a much faster pace than you normally would.They also regularly patch the game, either with bug fixes, balances fixes or new content. On top of that, they have also released new areas pretty often. The game went out of beta less than 6 months ago and they have already released 2 completely new endgame areas, a completely new class and a major overhaul of many of the in-game features.			"

												I've played this game FOR WEEKS BEFORE IT GOT INTO STEAM (that's why my hours are not registered on steam, so don't be so silly as to think my review is based on 12 minutes). Don't play it unless you're willing to spend A LOT OF REAL WORLD MONEY... A LOT! I MEAN IT! Otherwise you would need to play for too many hours to get what I call a decent character (one that doesn't make you fell obviously lagging behind others). Of course most of these hours would be filled with frustration and anger. Everything in the game is made annoyingly limited unless you pay (or play through eternity), including stash space for items, equipment, consumables, companions, mounts, etc...  You can even buy advantages for the PvP area (yes, it IS pay to win on PvP and pay for improvement on PvE). And don't you think the Starter Kit is a big deal, it's only a very small help. Besides, in my opinion, this game tries too hard to keep you playing constantly, there are ""bonus time"" and drops that you can get every few real hours (not gameplay hours), so to make you feel like losing items and oportunities if you're not there all day long, not to mention there are things you will lose if you don't login for a day (like gems that you gain only one each day and must accumulate at least 5 to exchange for some worthy item, meaning you must play for 5 days in a row or lose all you had accumulated).Other problems for me are that it's not an usual D&D RPG. Since it's an action RPG, don't expect a great story, it's OK, but nothing really compelling, and for me, it's actually slightly based on D&D, since character classes are pretty different from traditional D&D.There are good points of course, controls are fine, graphics are fine, you don't move like a slug, setting is big and well done, fights are nice, coop is worthy and sometimes necessary, there is a foundry where users can make their own quests and make them available to everyone else (so you'll never run out of things to do).The game actually got me impressed for the first few hours, but then, I began to fell like being deceited, like I needed to dedicate too much of my time and money to it. Of course you don't need to spend money if you don't want to, you can progress at a different pace and you can leave behind loot or sell very cheap the dozens of treasure boxes you don't have keys to open, but I really don't like this kind of thing, that's why I can't recommend it. For someone like me, it would be necessary to spend about US$ 200 or more to make the game enjoyable.			"

												I originally played this game during early beta (through their client) and found it to be a fun F2P MMO. However, there were a few issues with the games balance and I ultimatally stopped playing because of repeatitive endgame.I have recently come back to the game to see that it has drastically changed to the P2W model. Leveling has been nerfed and they request you to buy VIP packages to get to where it was, Astral Dimonds are much harder to obtain than they were before, making obtaining ZEN more arduous to get. Before you could spend about 2 weeks doing dailies and get enough ZEN to buy a mount.

												Great combat system similar to TERA and other new-gen action MMOs and pretty decent looking settings/Gear. You see its true colors the moment you hit a larger city though, the whole pay-to-play kind of mechanic, all sorts of limitations that rely on purchasing things with real cash. An enjoyable game.....for the first 2-3 hours. Differently from what the Reviews they have posted on the store page say, no, the game did not learn from its predecessors. I also agree with other player reviews that stated healing classes arent really needed in groups, only in the really late game. Its pretty sad that this is where the name Neverwinter (A game i had alot of fun with) ended up.But, since it is ""free"", try it out and pass your own judgement.			"

												Was a nice idea, combat is quite fun, there is enough lore, but its getting worse and worse, incompetent decisions by dev team are running the game in the ground, for a new player it would be a nightmare to start playing, bots and exploits running wild, ppl with large stacks of currency gained from exploits ruining the market, PvP is forgotten and only for rich ppl, company is grabbing money wherever they can without providing anything ppl would want to spend money on(no new cosmetic stuff for ages). Bugs take years to fix. Constant grind of daily quests and dungeons for tokens needed for equipment, while the dungeon drops are bad and almost worthless. Overpowered lockbox drops.			"

												All games have to make money, so I expect that some level of purchases will be required to play a F2P MMO at any kind of reasonable level of effectivness. But you are MUCH better off playing one of the superior subscription base MMO at $15 / month for access to everything a game has to offer than playing Neverwinter. This game is for suckers.Neverwinter has one of the most horribly abusive free to to play models I have encountered in an MMO. Basic game features such as upgrading companions would cost -- literally -- hundreds of dollars of purchases to attempt to maintain the aspects of your character at level. Don't even consider trying PVP unless you are willing to spend $100's to upgrade your character. This is in addition to the fact that the game is extremely linear and key features like the Foundary are taken off line for weeks at a time with no explanation or ETA when they will be fixed again. The developers are also willing to remove aspects of the game that players thave invested months of effort and significant amounts of money to force players to spend more money and increase their profitability.I can not recommend this game to anyone.

												i have to correct: its worthwhile until level 60 then all the pay2win aspects come to faceif you want to have a quick mmo blast for maybe 100-200 hours you can have that but there is nothing to do when you reach level 60 except running trough dungeons you already ran trough whilst leveling up but this time in tedious awful HP meatshield mode where everything has way too much HP and the bosses which are the only thing worth killing (if any) in the game spawn so many adds that the HP meatshield adds become the challenge every time and never the boss, then when youre done end up with no loot at all because the roll system is totaly screwed up.All loot drops except from epic t2 mode bosses are just placebo garbage that will never earn you any amount of astral diamonds(ingame currency) to upgrade your pets or enchants which costs hundredthousands of ADIF you have the rare luck to get your hands on an epic t2 boss drop its 99% of the time worth not more than 3000ad because the exploiters break the game and kill bosses with just 1 player which yields them 100% of the loot which then flood the auction house for minimum prices.. ive seen it multiple times and there are no GMs or support to do anything.

												The game is fun enough while levelling up, though expect a solo game. Once you get to cap there's barely any content, it's just tons of grinding to improve gear for no real reason. The game's pretty buggy, loads of outstanding issues. Very little polish, and newer content is often just re-used assets from the original areas.It's heavily monetised. PvP is entirely pay to win. The game constantly wants you to pay to bypass grinding.Maybe level up if you enjoy fantasy RPGs, but beyond that I wouldn't recommend it. It's aggressively after your cash and there are far, far better MMOs out there.			"

												Even though my time say 1.2 hours, I have played this game on XBOX ONE for hundreds of hours. Before Mod 5 this game was amazing for a free to play. The dungeons (That were taken out) Were creative and numerous enough where you didn't get bored. After the installation of future mods, the point of the developers became quite clear. They made a half broken game to keep you from leaving, all so you would spend money to get accepted into epic dungeons, and PVP.I don't really have much else to say, as more recent reviews have pinned this game down as entirely accurate. For new players, they will love it, but as you will discover, once you maxed your character as far as levels go, you will be booted, for not being an elite pay to win player, or your game will crash constantly from Cryptics absolutely terrible servers, and even more horrendous patches, which just add items for you to buy, and don't fix a damn thing.All in all, do not play this game. It is but a mere shadow of what it was when it first came out, and jumped head first off the cliff of greed, and terrible optimization. Don't believe me? Read the other reviews, they are completely accurate.P.S. Don't bother commenting on Cryptics forums, they will delete your well versed complaints, regardless of whether or not they are staight-forwards and critical. Not to mention, if you were like me, and spend $10 dollars for a mount, only to have the discount not go through, again, do not bother emailing them. They will blame you, even if you provide a screenshot as evidence that they ♥♥♥♥ed up.Run away now.			"

												I have accumulated thousands of hours playing this game, ever since Beta, about 860 on Steam and the rest, the vast majority, on Arc.  I have eight Level 70 characters, one from each class.  Two of my characters have Item Scores (once known as Gear Scores) that are 4000+, my Great Weapon Fighter, Merek Knightsbridge, and my Scourge Warlock, Tsarra.  I have two characters that have Item Scores of 3500+, my Paladin, Buster Hymon, and my Hunter Ranger, Bo Enero, my other four characters are in the high 2000s.  So, as you can see, I have put tons of frustration and effort (AND MONEY) into this game.The sad, sad thing is that I have invested so much time and energy with very little to show for it, since there is always a new update that makes everything you have accomplished prior, obsolete.  And with each consecutive mod release, I have liked and enjoyed it less and less to the point of HATING it, especially after the ridiculously complicated River District (Cloaked Ascendancy) mod, which, by the way, was released WAY too soon after the Sea of Moving Ice, which required hours upon hours of grinding the same dailies over and over and the same stupid skirmish, Svaardborg, over and over, and the same ridiculously long dungeon, Fangbreaker Island, not to mention the constant grinding for lanolin in the four areas in which you can run what is known as BHEs, or Big Heroic Encounters with other players.  And when I say grind, folks, I mean GRIND.  This has now got to be the very most grindy game I have ever played or ever will play, because, quite simply, nothing is worth wasting hours upon hours of your life to grind and grind and grind and grind and grind just to upgrade a weapon that someone else has already outdone you with by getting some 1 in 1000000 armor or companion-armor drop.The very definition of the word ""game"" includes the word ""fun"" in it somewhere, right?  Fun existed between Levels 1 - 60.  And even the outlandishly absurd grind from 60 - 70, while being a boring grind wasn't half as bad as this game has since become.  I will not ""play"" a ""game"" that is nothing but a chore any longer.People from all over sound like they're dying when they say with obvious boredom and an almost sado-masochistic tone to their voices, stuff like, ""Well, I finally got my dailies done today.  I'll be back to do them all again tomorrow.""  Who, in the name of all that is sacred will allow themselves to be subjected to the greedy whims of this game's devs to be bored out of their minds in doing CHORES to succeed in this game?  It seems there are still quite a few who are under the magical evil spell of this game.  It brings to mind a vision of a bunch of cattle being led to a slaughter, pocketbooks, wallets, and hours upon hours of precious time in hand.Keep in mind that if you have lots of money to throw at the game, many, MANY things become much, MUCH easier, however, the grind remains, at least at some preposterous level.Sadly, my best days in Neverwinter are behind me now.  I may log in from time to time just to relive a few old memories of good times with fellow friends, guildies, and even my wife.  But most days I will play some other game, like Revelation Online or ESO, or just avoid the computer altogether, knowing that I have a $5000 - $10000 account that is utterly worthless to me.  My guild still keeps me as a member because we had a LOT of fun together in the past, but many of them cannot believe that I Ieft; they that are still under the aforementioned spell.  Note that I am not the only person who chose exodus over grinding for eternity for armor and gear that will be obsolete within a month or so.For me, the overly-complicated and NOT-fun River District was the final straw; the end-all of my days in Neverwinter.  Goodbye, ol' friend.			"

Literally 95% of all quests are ""fetch quests"".-Chinese scam, spam and hack bots a-plenty-Almost 75% of the game revolves around RNG.-So many glitches and gameplay bugs that you'd swear this game was still in Beta... (you know what they say about PWE games...)-Little-to-no quality or polish (again, it's as if this game was created by ♥♥♥♥♥♥ chinese programmers who were paid minimum wage! :O)-The only server you can play on is an International one, so prepare for foreign idiots everywhere, and prepare to be misunderstood by roughly 50% of the playerbase who doesn't actually understand your language. ;)-It's published by PWE.  What'd you expect? :\Seriously, though.  The fact that Wizards of the Coast decided to choose ♥♥♥♥ing PWE, of ALL god-damn MMO companies, to publish and develop their game, is absolutely dissapointing.

												Long time fan of all things forgotten realms here, and I wish I could reccomend this game.  I wish I could say it's good.  I want it to be good.  I have tried multiple times to pick it up and give it another shot, especially now that rage of demons is out and I would have a  chance to play a game alongside Drizzt, the character that sucked me into this universe when I was young.  But the game is just... bad.  Chat innundated with spammers, a world that feels watered down and stripped of the lore that made the games so great, a complete lack of customization for classes... it's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ization of everything that makes Dungeons and Dragons great.  Not to mention the advertisements everywhere for all the pay to win ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and the ridiculous prices they ask for the most inane things.This isn't dungeons and dragons. This is WoW with a badly done skin of dungeons and dragons thrown overtop of it.  Maybe I'll try it again someday, and maybe it will get better, but I just cannot reccomend this game, at least not to anyone who wants the depth and character that D&D and the Forgotten Realms is so famous for.  If you want to experience that?  Play the old games.  Pick up Baldur's Gate, or better yet, pick up a pencil and print yourself a character sheet and play actual dungeons and dragons.  If my opinion changes, so will this review, but this game has shown me nothing to hold my interest other than one module that is *completely* different for tabletop, but I don't know if I can stomach the rest to get to 60 to experience the different campaigns.

You can check out my full review of Neverwinter Online here[uncrownedreview.blogspot.com]I'd like to say that I don't think Neverwinter Online is inherently pay to win. Sure there are pay to win elements in the game that could easily be stamped out but that's not the most offensive part of this game.Let me tell you a story. Imagine a game called Neverwinter Online. In this fantasy world there was a beta server that a company called Cryptic set up specifically to test for bugs in upcoming patches and updates.A new class called the Hunter Ranger is scheduled to appear in the next update, but something is off about it. Every so often the stars will align and particle effects from a specific ability of the Hunter Ranger will not go away, lagging and crashing instances as particles are spewed out. Very frustrating, but Cryptic knows just what to do! It releases the Hunter Ranger and doesn't warn anyone about the known bugs and glitches with the class! For almost 3 weeks straight, instances are lagging and crashing as the players discover this bug for themselves. Finally, Cryptic decides to go ahead and patch the problem. It was then that the players found out the actual timeline of this bug. It was initially found six months earlier.This, is a true story.			"

												I played this game before it was released on steam, I got well over 150 hours or so.  at the start it's really really fun, playing alone or with a friend. It's not hard to gather items and get your set around mid-tier. I loved to play as Rogue as it was greatest DPS class.Until I got to late game... Even with the hours I spent at it, all of the items required to be at high tier is really really too grindy. I don't mind grinding, heck I've got 6 years of Mabinogi play-experience...that's grindy too! but the grinding in Neverwinter just don't feel rewarding, that's probably the reason why I lacked motivation to play. I loved the character I made however...She has horns, a tail, and an awesome bandana covering her mouth. A sly rogue she is. but sadly, the game after a long time just feels like you're not getting much futher, unless you grind,grind,grind , OR spend a LOT of money in it. I would recommend this game if you are looking for a fun early-game. Lategame, if you play to be super-tier, I hope you have a big wallet, or all the time and patience in the world for the grinding late game.			"

												At first I loved it a lot. It was very entertaining and there was a lot of stuff to do. Many maps and they are interesting. If I stopped playing back then my opinion would be certainly possitive. So what happened that made me change my mind? Well, after 60th level the game begins pay to win. You either buy premium objects or you end up with a character too weak to be able to do anything and constantly dying.So after some time I decided to give you a few examples:- Objects can be enhanced. How do you make them better? You need special objects that can be only bought using Astral Diamonds - and they are so expensive that farming them would get extremely boring.- The higher the enhancement level the lower chance of succeeding. You can make it higher. To get object that allows you, you will have to buy it for real money. Eventually spend several days for a chance to win.- You can get a companion that will help you. But after he reaches level 20 you must upgrade him. The only way to do so is by paying. If you will not upgrade him he won't be leveling up with you and eventually he'll become useless.			"

												I've said it before and I'll say it again: ""Perfect World!! ...cause our idea of a 'perfect world' is your money in our pockets!""Ever since Cryptic got under the Perfect World umbrella, all of thier decent games have become mediocre pay-to-win fests.  Cryptic still does a decent game, don't get me wrong, but the PW/Cryptic combo has no clue how to handle f2p.Just putting my lot in with the reviews.  Just read em!  Decent game ruined by greed, both from within the company and outside of it (botters).Tho, no one has touched on the community for this game.  Simply put?  It is TOXIC.My experience as a returning player goes as follows: Zone chat in the main hub and event areas... you may want to leave off.  It is almost nonstop botting and trash talking.  There is almost no true matchmaking for this game.  High level players are matched with low level players and the high level people almost never give a crap about the lower level people.  Most high levels can solo most of the dungeons in the game, but they are also in a hurry, so they speed run through... One shotting most of what they come across, taking shortcuts the new players don't know about which leaves them to fight entire groups on thier own.  Ask them to slow down?  They tell you (despite the fact that the game allowed you into the dungeon in the first place) that you're too weak for the dungeon and should go back and play the very first dungeon.  And the dungeon rewards?  performance based.  If you don't get high dps #'s, you don't get much reward.  And if you want much of anything in this game, you need those astral diamond rewards cause the auction house is PRICE GOUGED to hell on the stuff you truly need.  But, astral diamonds CAN be purchased via the Zen currency, avilable via Perfect World.  If you want to buy Zen, DO NOT purchase it via Steam!!  Even tho the game Zen store offers this as an option (useful), they DO NOT qualify you for the Zen bonus on purchase, nor do they qualify you for ""1st time buyer"" promos which offer useful stuff for newbs.  If you complain of this, Perfect World customer service will take the standpoint of ""too bad, so sad.  Look at this patch note post we did years ago.  There's a line at the end of a paragraph somewhere in there that tells you that Steam purchases are ineligible for these rewards.""Do you buy game gold from 3rd parties?  If you do, you deserve to be dragged over hot coals.5 out of 10, purely because of how cash shop intense this game is.  If I were to count community, I'd score it even lower.  Play it with friends (it can actually be fun still), play it for free till the grind gets too much, then wipe the character and play again.. or play another game.I do not recommend this game for the average MMO player based on the opinion that the average MMO gamer play MMOs like they were a single player game.  But if you like to socialize and play with friends... maybe.			"

												I used to LOVE Neverwinter, played it for 8+ hours a day for almost a year (I played most of my time not through Steam, if you're wondering why the numbers don't add up. After getting a few characters to max level, I find the game unenjoyable for several reasons. However, let me not be entirely biased to the negative aspects of the game, I shall list some pros too, if I can think of any that is...PROS:+Fun I guess, decent lasting appeal.+Cool animations, mechanics, and cinematics in my opinion.+Many ways to play your character.+Many dungeons, plus community made instances that make end game less dissatisfying, and it welcomes harder or easier instances than what is provided in the actual game.If I can think of more, I'll be sure to mention it.CONS:-Game can be really laggy if you don't have a high-end PC, poor optimization.-Quests, quests, quests.. Daily quests, instance quests, collecting quests, I'm tired of hearing the word quest.-Most of the dungeons provided are WAY too easy and drop absolutely rubbish gear.-Grindfest up to max level, I got bored and took several hiatuses while leveling my first and second characters.-You thought the grindfest was over at max level? Think again! Time to grind for good gear while getting overloaded with gear that's so garbage, it's comparable to Trump's campaign.-The community is honestly toxic. There's a lot of spammers, scammers, beggars, and elitists who look down on everyone else. The Elitists are the worst. I can't count the number of times I had to leave a dungeon because my gear wasn't to their standards.

												WHile the game has been so far, my recent Zen purchase through Steam has soured that experience.  After reading online I discovered that PWE puts every user who purchases Zen through Steam into a 'probation' where they can't spend their Zen until Steam transfers the money to them.  Supposedly this is to prevent money-laundering and fraud.  Nowhere was this stated during the purchase process.  So after five days or so after I made my purchase when I went to use my Zen, I was locked out!  Call it 'buyer's remorse' if you want, but I contacted PWE support saying I didn't agree with their policy and requested a refund,  They replied saying they can't do refunds of purchases through Steam.  So I tried contacting Steam support but their support page says they can't do refunds of purchases for this game and that they generally don't do refunds for in-game purchases after 2 days.  I tried sending Steam an email anyway explaining the situation.  It's been five days since then and they've yet to contact me.  In the meantime I'm not spending my Zen so a refund can be done, but all this time I keep seeing the in-game Zen-to-AD conversion rate dropping significantly so my Zen purchase 1.5 weeks ago is now worth a lot less.The game itself is great, but I have no desire to support a company that does this to their players and I would not recommend that anyone else does either.  If PWE doesn't trust Steam to to sell on their behalf then they simply shouldn't sell through Steam!  If I had just been warned that PWE would do this and their reason for doing it, I probably would have been fine with it.  But this whole debacle has just soured my experience of this game, and of Steam.			"

												Every time players find a way to have fun with their broken classes or discover a new way to make the game's currency inside the game, comes Cryptic idiotic management and ruins the game with nerfs and badly planned modules that create more problems that they can fix it.It is the kind of game that had everything to be a perfectly good experience, however ask any player (even if they still play the game) their opinions on the way the game is managed and you can be certain you will not hear one good comment. Another thing that you should now, before wasting hours of your time: grinding the free to play route is not an option. You'll pay a lot of money (USD 150+) just to be able to decently play your character in a broken game. When and if you find a way to do that, you should know, nothing good inside the game lasts more than 2-3 months, that is, your money has no value.			"

												Have been playing quite a bit of this game recently.  Just found out about the Foundry aaaaaaaaand...... it's gone.  That fact almost turned me off of this game if it wasn't the only good D&D game in my opinion.  The Foundry being broken is a pretty big deal though and I most likely will loss interest in simply playing this game as I normally do with MMO's.  The user generated quests got stupid excited only to be majorly let down by the game and by the support team that is supposed to cover the game.  TL;DR:  If you came for Foundry you might as well turn around unless you like boring MMO's			"

												I loved this game and also always went back to it. Pro is that it really is not a 'money grabber' and you could play this game free all along. To buy are general luxuries you don't really need. The game, even though it has been on the market for a very long time, is still full of people always and it never gets boring.  Now the bad part. I like to play solo a lot and that was possible till I got maxed out with 8 chars. I group sometimes but in general solo. Well now with the new expansions of ""Storm King's Thunder"" etc it seems you cannot solo any longer. Suddenly the game is forced grouping and that is way I am saying good bye to this game. Glad Horizon is on the horizon.			"

												Another franchise ruined by cryptic, first STO(star trek online), now D&D's Neverwinter, cryptic has done it again, managed to turn a great franchise into a shamefull, shallow, turn-key, coin-operated money machine.  Having beta'd STO i'm familiar to this nickel and diming by cryptic, and yes it is absolutely PAY to win, not truly play for free, as you can play for free but dont expect to be any good, regardless of your skill with your char, you will be at the mercy of people with PAY items which are substantially better than their non paid counterparts.  The game is a formulaic mmorpg, borrowing genre standards from various games, including some unique features like action style combat(gets boring quickly imho) and the abilitiy to create your own quests, which is the only thing about this game i actually like.  It is too under whelming, an extremely shallow d&d experience, sharing little but images and names of its original, deeper and more complex counterpart, for having sacrificed so much of what a D&D experience is, it is also inexcuseably boring and repetitive.  Cryptic definately didnt push itself to accomplish anything that would be a landmark experience, it feels like its the exact opposite, like a game done for a quick pay cheque.			"

												This game has a number of glaring issues that prevents it from being any fun. Ill list them in no meaningful order (aside from the first one being the worst)1.) Free to play ruins any chance this had at being a well balanced and fair game.  If you dont want to put $10,000 into this game then you will be behind everyone else and cant access quite a lot of things.2.) Limited skill bar. You can only have a total of 3 skills at any time which is fine for an action game, but I want more out of an MMo. Especially a dnd MMO.3.) 20 different currencies. The amount of currencies this game uses is just stupid. I played to level 20 and had like 12 different currencies.4.) Time requirements. To train followers, level professions, cast blessings or even do a few of the quests there is a time requirement. sometimes its 10 minutes, sometimes its 10 hours. (unless of course, you pay real money)5.) you need to be level 15 to use the friends list. Why they would do this in an MMO where playing with friends is huge I have no idea.6.) quests in parties arent completed at the same time. They have to be done for each person.7.) leveling is very slow. Im sure theres a way to make it quicker with real money though8.) Bag space is a BIG issue. You get 2 bags with a total of about 30 slots combined. Wouldnt be much of an issue if they didnt have so many redudant items you need to lug around. You also have no access to a stash or bank that I could find.9.) Redundant items. you have like 6 different ""kits"" for accessing different nodes scattered in dungeons and the world. It should just be one item to access these so youre not using 6 of your iventory spaces. Made worse by a few other gimmics like this.10.)You get a ton of these item chests that drop from mobs that you can only open by paying real money for keys. Its 125 zen for A SINGLE KEY. You can buy 1000 zen for $10. I had 20 of these chests by level 20 which means I would have had to spent $20 ON A FREE TO PLAY GAME to open these things.This game is a blight on the Neverwinter game. Anyone involved in this mess deserves to be fired.... Out of a canon.... into the sun.			"

												This is the first review I am doing for a game. Now to get to my rating it's a fun game for people that are lvl 70. With saying that I am talking about PvP in the game. They have enough AD to buy rank 7 ruins that make the game unfair to new players. They can pretty much almost one shot you.As for the PvE content it's fun to about level 60. There are only 4 dungoens you can run till you hit 70 so not much to do there. From 1 to 60 it's a straight forward quest line to level you pretty fast beleave I hit 60 in about two weeks or three about 1 to 2 hours a day. From 60 to 70 it is a big grind fest and that's hard since you get almost no exp for killing mobs you get your exp from quest. They do have their daily quest that you can do but even with them it took about 5 hours or so just to level from 60 to 61. Classes seem kinda broken they are all OP in their own way and that really kills PvP also but a good thing for PvE since you can solo all the way to 70 if you wanted too. Treats seem to be broken or just do nothing. As a tank I maxed out my CC Res so I would get hit lease but seems like everyone I come across stuns, roots, and whatever to me no problem. Then healers and the rouge classes can dodge almost every stun I can and then I have to play cat and mouse with them and by time I catch them I am already half dead and I can't get any skills off since they keep stunning me. I also maxed out the increse to the CC I do and it still does nothing for me. It just feels like stats are broken in this game and the only thing that matters are the ruins you put into your armor.Over all it's not the worse MMORPG I've played but it's not the best. I would rather stick with the real Dungoens and Dragons MMORPG for a free to play game. As for PvP I thought SWTOR was the worse but I was wrong. I give it a 4.5/10 And the stronghold like someone else said you need to be on a real active guild unless you can't even enjoy that.			"

												MONEY SINK - PAY2WINI quit playing this game over a year ago due to severely unbalanced systems in every facet (Crafting, Economy, PvP, PvE). PvP was a total joke and the developers never once made any efforts to patch some balance into their money-sink.Hacker and crackers and exploiters were allowed free run with ZERO banning.Gold salez and gold spamz were actually encouraged by this company.If you want a game that you can super easy hack then this is your spot.

												Dungeons & Dragons: Neverwinter is based on the AD&D 4.0 Core Ruleset, and I think that it's done rather well. The graphics, sounds, music, and locations are well developed & quite immersive too. Cryptic Studios made an amazing free-to-play (F2P) game, and you don't have to spend any real world money to level from 1-60; The game is not restrictive in anyway whatsoever.The character models are well detailed, and the combat movement are very engaging - albeit they could be more fluid. Combat itself is great to play, and I love that there are no auto-attack moves/spells; Everything must be done by the player in real time. In this case with regards to combat and action, you [the player] stay involved, focused, and must be have situational awareness -- something that I like very much.To me the only downsides to this game are the ridiculously over-priced items in the Zen Market, and the difficulty in acquiring Astral Diamonds. For the latter it may not be a problem for the very active player, but casual players are at a disadvantage IMO. I also personally feel that many of the zones are very linear, and closed-in - leaving no open world exploring in what I'd like in an MMORPG.Overall the game is a must-have to play for those that enjoy Fantasy RPG's. There's very little to be disappointed with here. I highly recommend this game, especially if you're looking for something F2P.			"

Before trying to argue with me note that this game is heavily p2w and you can't deny it.The problem with this game is that it has very annoying progress system. Either you have to put your life in to it (be a no lifer) or spend dozens of $. So dicide if you wanna play or not. It's really sad that it follows the line of Forgotten Realms. As you know the story, content and everything else is great but when you reach lvl 70 with any of your characters you'll face the sad truth where you'll understand that you've just screwed. You'll have to obtain some equipement sets to be useful in dungeon runs(or noone will inv you to any parties) and you won't get them free. You'll have to work your ♥♥♥ for it or pay and even you finally reach after some months the set will have significat stat changes and no longer will be useful. The pvp is the part that i don't even want to talk about. It's straight p2w. You'll get one hit by a kid who has 4 mythic artifacts. Besides that i have personal other problems with it's graphics. I run the game on lowest graphics settings and even like that fps doesn't get higher than 6 in battles and max i get is 25 when notmoving and doing nothing+no moving objects on screen. As a player who has 500+ hours gameplay i won't recommend it to newcomers or any other player.			"

												(THIS WAS REVIEWED IN OCT 2014, OBVIOUSLY THE GAMES CHANGED)The endgame is very limited and the games requirements to getting its own advantages to making it easier for you (horses, enchantments, armor, etc.) are overly exaggerated to the point where either playing or paying is a loss.The questing to get to LVL 60 can be done in under 6-10 hours, containing underdeveloped areas strictly for PVE and some dungeons which have balancing issues and require an amount of specific classes to complete.The classes you start with contain problems and balancing and have a distinct difference which determines how useless or how useful you are. Some people wouldn't want a guardian in their dungeon run because of the tanking being useless to a boss enemy that will just overwhelm you with damage and aggro imediately, but would want a guardian for PVP because of the defense it has, making the person who intialy chose that class rather regretful. The mages do a lot of DPS damage which makes them a favorable class. There are anomalies in this game that are aggrevating to see. PVE mini bosses sometimes dropped themed armor pieces that have better stats by a little but look very cool to edit, but sometimes you can get a guardians armor as a mage and this armor cannot be sold, traded, only worn and destroyed. But... you can't wear it either... so yea. The currency is limited also, where as after lvl 60, astral diamonds would become your main currency where as the coins would just be petty money to buy potions.The end game is very small and limited and will only have you playing for about one or two weeks before realizing what you're doing everyday is farming for goals like higher gear-rank, enchantments, wealth, mounts, armor, campaigns, which honestly don't open anymore of the game to you after thats completed.

												Well I  was playing the game since Beta and I was hooked on story and areas where ok ish...When beta was over I took a break for few months and came back and  lvled those 10 lvls to join the guild. The guild I was in was amaizng, they did everything end helped everyone and also  were very social. But things began to change when new mod arived with introduction of paladin. You see now if you where not a guardian or paladin good luck getting in to a dungeon. Every time I tried to play with random ppl as soon as they saw that I dont have a good item lvl they abandone the dungeon run. As for the guild itself it forged small circles of friends who would only brind individual ppl inside that circle of friends good luck if you are not in it :P  Now as for the game itself: the new lvling areas are f....ing stupid just hourlys do 50 hourls which include kill 10 things in 3 areas just to get 1 item that i need. All of my ad and gold went to  potions in order to keep me alive.All of the dungeosn were just upscaled in temrs of making a bit more powerfull mobs and most of them removed and never broguht back. You can no longer get ad for your T1/T2 items (so as you can see AD become soo harder to get now, you would have to manipulate the market and compite with prices, and do a loot of Heralods...)Finall note newest patch favoured paladins and  being in a good guild  is requirement, as everyone in the pug expects from you to get like amazing item lvl over a night...  I dont complain that I wasted 300h on it, nope I had fun until they became lazy with newest mod and only recycled all of it and favoured a loot ppl who buy items with real cash (they always did but now they made it absured) For the castle thingy or keep or how ever they call it, I did not bother playing it, the beta testing is in weird period it favoures NA players.. (you can only play at cerain hour).Like usually I will come back after few months or a year two see what happened to the game.FOR LAZY PPL: DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME IF YOU DONT HAVE A LOOT OF TIME AND ARE NOT IN THE GOOD GUILD AND ARENT WILLING TO SPEND REAL  MONEY ON IT!

												I've had quite a bit of fun with this game. The game feels alive, and brings me a much similar feeling of when I used to play World of Warcraft. The combat and rich D&D story is what keeps it seperate from most WoW clones. Arcgames is a shady mess of a company. Their customer support is abysmal, and the servers feels run by children. When I was really liking this game, I spent $50 on it and unlocked a few goodies. They had a sudden announcement about rolling the servers back because of some auction house exploitation, and suddenly I was without 3 of my 4 characters and out $50. All I was given was a reference to the terms of agreement which basically said ""once you give us your money we aren't liable to give a ♥♥♥♥."" It's a shame that a game with such promise would set itself up for failure. Scamming your fans and ignoring repeated attempts at reason isn't a very good way to run your company. Other developers, take note; and players, and beware.			"

												1st impressions of the dungeon experience in this game are very poor. I reached level 12 and got in the dungeon que after a few moments however thats where the problems began. I was shoved into a dungeon with two other players both of whom were lvl 70 synched to my lvl. because of the lvl discrepancy I was only able to actually attack one monster the whole time and the higher lvls not only left me behind but they killed the boss in two hits flat. This was the worst experience I have ever had in a game that offers dungeons especially since you get a treasure key in this game where you can only open ONE dungeon chest per day......this system is really not designed with balance or gameplay in mind, just money. If you want a dungeon experience thats fun and satisfying where you actually get to do something and contribute to the win, then look elsewhere.			"

The same thing happened with the LoK series, it's like seeing your childhood hero prostituting himself/herself for attention.			"

												As long as you aren't looking to play ""seriously"" then it's pretty fun.If you want to put some effort into it and progress your character as far as you can go then you will have to put some money down.There are other MMO's on the market that will cost you far less. It's basically your typical cash grab free to play game.There is no middle ground, you can either play for fun and accept your character will always be behind or you can start putting money down to stay competitive. I can't recommend it because of the shift towards pay to win. It's a shame, this game had so much potential when it launched and now, this.			"

												 TL;DR Invest your time in something else. The core gameplay is great, it's fun and I legitimately enjoy it. This game has great potential, but the developer support for this game is borderline insulting. The ranger class was meant to be in the BETA, but it wasn't until 5 months after the game's official launch date that the Ranger class was finally added. It was at least 2 months before classes got a 2nd paragon path, and as of mod 6, the most recent mod as of this review, 11 dungeons have been REMOVED leaving only 3 dungeons between lvl 20 and 69, and in my relatively short play time I found at least 2 skills that were utterly broken (They had no effect what so ever). The vast majority of end game content is hourly quests, or grinding out ""Heroic Events"". They did add ""Campaigns"" which can take weeks to complete, but only provide a day or 2 worth of content at most. How it works is you complete a quest chain, and then start the first part of the campaign... and then wait... for 20 hours. Then you repeat this 2 more times to move on to the next stage, where you do a questline, and then wait for another 60 hours, and repeat. You also need an item which you can only get from daily quests to start each part of the campaign. "

												I dont mind spending money in a F2P if the game is good and the core mechanics of this game are great. Combat is fun, dungeons are fun, quests are ok. But it requires you to spend a ton of cash to be very successful. To many things that are necessary to play cannot be obtained reasonabley outside of the cash shop. It sucks mellineals complained the sub model out of existense and cursed us all with the microtransaction monstrosities because they dont want to pay for things. 99% of what makes this game ♥♥♥♥, could be eliminated by perfect world if they just offered a sub. I hate SWOTOR too, but thats the best F2P model and its still more or less ♥♥♥♥.			"

												I'm really loving this game so far.  I've played quite a bit through three different classes, Great Weapon Fighter, Hunter Ranger, and Control Wizard.  I started only a few weeks ago but I'm thoroughly addicted and the paid aspects don't seem too bad, despite the other comments.Pros:Great dungeon designExcellent lore (DnD-verse, coincides with the actual tabletop PNP game)Satisfying hits on the classes I've played, really feels like you are doing cool stuff at even a low levelFun eventsReally complex and awesome guild system (Strongholds really feel like a base, and the map is incredibly large)Good variety of enemiesSolid voice actingInteresting quests, I actually read all the quest details in this game and it feels like there is a reason beyond ""kill 50 orcs""Cons:Lots of bots in PVP dominationLuck based refinements are really annoying and can add up in cost pretty quickApparently the end game can become really P2W in PVPSmall guilds (10 players or fewer) take a lonnnngggg time to upgrade strongholdsSomewhat annoying Zone chatMixed:Crafting system (I actually like this aspect of the game and find it like a game within the game, but it can take quite a long time to craft and level up your professions)Prayers over-level characters (I wanted to experience the content at a good pace, but prayers and dailies seem to level you so much you end up 5-10 levels higher than you should be for an area)GRIND (You NEED to like the grind to enjoy this game without paying.  Luckily me and my play group do)I am having an excellent time, and I don't mind dropping a few bucks here and there for the game.  Definitely give it a try!EDIT REGARDING ZEN FROM STEAM:Stupidly, the game doesn't like you purchasing Zen (in-game pay currency) from Steam.  IF YOU PURCHASE ZEN FROM THE STEAM WALLET INTERFACE YOU WILL BE UNABLE TO CLAIM THE FIRST-TIME BUYERS GUIDE, ALL ITEMS YOU PURCHASE WILL BE ACCOUNT BOUND, AND THE ZEN-ASTRAL DIAMOND EXCHANGE WILL NOT WORK (selling zen for AD, that is).I recommend using their Arc client.  You can find it on the neverwinter site.  This is really stupid and absolutely deserves to be fixed.			"

												Do not waste your time with this dying game. I have not seen this level of incompetence by a development team since the craptastic closed betas, and releases, of Vanguard and Age of Conan. Almost every decision, and change to the game, they have made since June has caused an ever decreasing population of actual players. The developers lie about the reason for making changes. The biggest, and most abused lie they spread, is that the changes are meant to stop bots and black market trade of Astral diamonds--every chnage they have made has only given more reason for players to make purchases from the black market and has done nothing to stop the infestation of bots.

												This game had a few good things to it but the game gets very unbalanced at certain parts. When it's near endgame the quests become too repetitive and boring which started killing the expierence for me. Then when I decide to try out pvp it was EXTREMELY unbalanced. Even at low level pvp it was unfair. People had OP gear and to a casual person like me, I didn't stand a chance. Though with all of that what ruined this game was that it was p2w. You can't get OP without spending a single penny on this game. Even though in the beginning was great it went downhill the more I played. I would not recommend anyone to play this game unless you are a rich ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who doesn't care about what they spend their money on.			"

												Where to start? This is a fun game. A bit repetitive, but fun.The good : controls are good and customizable, spells are interesting (or attacks), lore is good and worth a read and of course the D&D locations. Plenty to do and it's pretty fun to do. i.e. a lot of events and some dynamic events.The bad : WORST SERVERS EVER. Seriously. You WILL get disconnected. A LOT. No matter your internet. Graphics are passable, but not a TON of variety in gear. Currency system is friggin NUTS. There are SO MANY currencies and they are hard to keep track of. Not fun trying to find out what merchant takes what. Also, doing events FOR those currencies don't always reward you everything you need to actually BUY something. I.e. you'll kill dragons and get coins for it, but to get an item you need the coins, some super rare scrolls AND an UBER rare item to go with it all and you'll have NO IDEA where they drop without google. Storage space is non-existant UNLESS you buy it with real money. This game WILL nickle and dime you. Free is a relative term. Sure you can play, but if you want to be certain races, or get some of the cooler things, you must pay. Lastly, this game is SUPER grindy. All in all, i'll play it, but i cannot in good conscience recommend it.			"

												So, I have only been playing a few hours and it has already had a critical crash twice.  Both times right in the middle of a battle.  First time, I logged back in and my character was dead.  Second time...well that is the time I decided to never play again.  In all seriousness, the two crashes just pushed me over the edge.  I hate the free-to-play ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  They say it is free, but in reality, you have to pay to get anything good.  Example...when first creating my character, I had the option to add new character races, which were pretty interesting, and I wanted to try them.  Shortly after, I found out I was going to have to spend upwards of $50 (USD)...for EACH.  The stuff people were saying about needing to spend $10k to get the good stuff...they likely are not exaggerating.  No matter.  I prefer Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Nights, and Sword Coast Legends gameplay to this.  In case any developers are listening--make more games like those.  I actually spend money on those games.			"

When the game was new being high level was rewarding and fun. You could do fun dungens and pvp with friends and other people. However with the recent updates thi game became 100% sh*t and just a scam to try to get mony from you. Plus most all the players have stoped playing. Would i recomend this game now... hell no.

												This game is fun for the first few areas you go to, but I think you'll find it hard-pressed to keep playing once you approach the midpoint of the area-based progression. Too often did I find myself simply going from area to area doing what seemed to be the same quests. That's not to mention that this game becomes a bit pay-2-win at around the point I'd previously stated, and PerfectWorld doesn't do a very good job maintaining it.extra note:This isn't really a criticism, but: if you're looking for a game that's pretty and generally not harsh on the eyes- you probably won't like this game.

												Not impressed by this game.There was no real semblence of a world to explore, just instance after instance that you get shoved through on tedious quest with a lack luster ""story"" before being dumped into a rather lengthy grind. I never went to level cap I had enough before that point and looking  ahead I could see nothing but x quest that had to be repeated many many times to progress. Leveling comes hard and fast with xp for every little thing so that if you go through each instance in its intended order you will soon find yourself overleveled. There is not much of a community that I found for this game, most people ignore chat attempts and there is no communication in public groups and everyone leaves the party after the dungeon is over.  This was my biggest dissapointment part of the point of an MMO is the community and in this game I found none. The combat system is perhaps the best part of the game, it is active and requires the player to aim at their targets reducing the simple click and wait, however due to the above more often than not you end up doign it all solo, this is particulary tedious if like me you choose to play a healer.I checked out the cash store but never ended up buying anything as it seems to be all very overpriced I was also annoyed by the incessant advertising in character dialouge, loot drops and on the HUD. I have played a few F2P games and while they all have some kind of in game marketting none have ever been as in your face and as intrusive as the type practiced in Neverwinter.I gave Neverwinter a fair number of hours but sadly do not feel as if I got anything back for those hours entertainment wise.

												I didn't play the game too much but from the begining I noticed a few .. messy things..I will make a short list about the game: Cons:well.. pvp is completly crap in my opinion. PVP mostly consists of TR (trickster rogues * an assassin* which is rediculously overpowered and oathbound paladin which kinda fits the same profile, extremly op. therefore the pvp is completly craplots of griding which gets really annoying on the same maps (once i grinded a whole day and felt sick for another 3 days, that much pressure i felt during the grind) (didnt get what i wanted thou)money grabbing and money hungry game, every single little **** costs real money. its really annoying, you can actually exchange some in-game currencies for in-game money but you gotta abandon your wife children school collage job or whatever to actually feel that youre doing something.noticed a few bugs here and there, for example the character getting stuck in the ground.some dungeon quests are unavilable for more than 3 months even thou they promised to fix themIn other words.. if you are rich and looking to fu** up others , invest a ♥♥♥♥ load of money make a TR and pawn the whole game with it, if thats fun for you .I can say 60% of the game consists in TR and outhbound paladins.. which kinda sucks since there are ALOT of posibilities to play the game,, but those are fast fuc*** by the sweet TR.All that micro transaction is ruining the game, its simply way too much of it Pros: nice storylinegot a gps for questing (you dont have to run around to find something)good graphicsmany classes and races+ bonus stats on each racenice boss fightsPS. so if youre looking for some adventure then this is a good choice, once you hit 70 you will realise how.. much time you sadly wasted on this game.PS. the stronghold map is really bugged, laggy. the word broken sums up the map			"

												Neverwinter was once an Amazing game! Unfortunatly, module 5 brought many unwelcome changes. I have played since Module 3, (through Arc) and thouroly enjoyed it. Most of the positive reviews are prior to Module 5, so do not be fooled. Before Module 5, dungeons dropped loot to sell in the Auction House. The gap between moderate and well geared players was there, but not too prominent. The P2W factor was there, but it was rather controlled. Now... Dungeons drop currency used to buy BOP gear. Many dungeons were just completely removed from the game. Many maps are recycled. Seriouslt, 1 map is the same as another map, just upside down... Many mini dungeons are identicle top module 3 mini dungeons (with different monsters..). The new Strongholds expansion has completly destroyed the smaller guilds, as people left to join bigger guilds that could offer better Stats/boons (since when should a guild affiliation grant stat bonuses?!). The new higher level enchantments are extremely difficult and time consuming to grind for unless you pay money to buy supplies to refine them faster. The new VIP Program gives extra HP to member who pay for monthly VIP status. There are new artifact weapons every 2-4 months so the gear you do grind for is obsolete too quickly. When you refine your old artifact gear into the new sets, they only salvage about 75% of the original refinement points. Every time you buy something new in this game, it is nerfed (google teneborous enchantment). The PVP matchmaking is a disaster. I am constantly matched up against premade BIS players from the largest PVP guilds with the best boons. Solo queing into PVP will result in failure 9/10 times, as it COMPLETELY IGNORES differences in gear. This means a new lvl 70nplayer will be ""thrown to the wolves"" if he/she tries to pvp. I highly reccomend you stay clear of this game untill these huge issues are fixed. Definately save your money. Lvls 1-60 are decietfully fun and easy. Lvl 61 hits like a bus. The grind to lvl 70 takes forever. Please do not be fooled. Read the official neverwinter forums if you have any doubts.			"

												Neverwinter is a good game, yes, I'm not recommending it and I certainly won't play it ever again, but I want you to know right off the bat that it's not a ""bad"" game and you may even like it. I didn't.At first the ""move with AWSD, click to swing the sword, etc"" thing seems pretty fun and original, but it gets dull quickly, specially considering that you only have 4 powers that you can use anytime. The game aims to have a combat system similar to non-MMO RPG's but fails utterly. The PVP system is absurd and boring: Rogues defeat any other class with almost no effort, they negate damage, avoid attacks, backstab for ridiculous damage and seem almost invulnerable at times. But PVP seems to be the weak spor for many MMORPG's nowadays so it's not a very damaging characteristic that PVP is completely broken and unplayable.I personally found the game to have too much payed content (races, mounts, etc). Again, many RPG's nowadays have the exact same problem so it's not really damaging for the game to block a lot of content from free players, but it's something you should consider before downloading the game, if you download the game at all, I mean.Next thing, the quests: they are boring and unoriginal (even the user created ones), go here, kill that, pick that. The loot is mediocre and it certainly doesn't help that most armor and weapons look exactly the same (I mean EXACTLY the same, every other player with the same class and level as you will have the same armor and the same weapons). A feeling of ""Why the hell am I doing this?"" hits you constantly while you play, to the point that you may find yourself not wanting to play anymore and deleting the game some days later (what happened to me). Why would I stick around in a game that feels like a chore instead of a fun activity? or the most important question: why would I stick around in a game if I have no fun while playing it?There are definitely other F2P MMORPG's that are way better than Neverwinter out there, many, many MMORPG's. But if you really want to play it, don't let this review stop you, you may even like it.			"

												Neverwinter is visually stimulating, and has some unique mechanics, if poorly implemented. I got my rogue to 60 and ran out of content in the first week. I've visited the game here and there over time, but the game feels like a hollow shell to me. Theres almost no character specialization, which is why I love D&D, and the quest creations (one of the big draws during beta) was little more than a sham.A while back, they announced plans to stabalize the in-game economy, but I honestly don't care enough to come back.This game is VERY watered down. Pros- Visually pretty- Fluid combat- D&D franchise- Mostly free (I regret buying my way into the beta)- Elf Women- Kill a dragon with knives.Cons- Virtually no character specialization (theres a talent tree, but its the blandest thing Ive ever seen.)- Dragonborn characters cost $75 USD (what? who drops that kind of money on DLC???)- Spam. Lots of it.- Kill ten rats. - Kill 10 Orcs.- Kill 10 Ogrest.- Kill 10 Zombies.- Kill 10 goblins- Pay 3 PVP matches.- Login To worship your diety for gems.- Login to send out crafters.- Login to worhship your diety for gems.- Do I actually care about crafting?- Login to worship... eh who cares anymore?- Uninstall.

												I have to say that I have never been more frustrated with a game company in my life. I wanted to play neverwinter and champions online again after a long break. I came back to find my account was hacked and all my characters and money was gone from both games. I was still able to login to the game and my arc account without issue. I submitted a ticket and subscribed to champions online to get started. No sooner did I pay for my subscription than my account was listed as banned and I was emailed for verification details. It has been 4 days since is sent the details and I havent been able to play either game. I recieved an email 3 days ago saying that my ticket has been escalated, but have heard nothing since then. I cannot believe the incredibly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ support and response time, but also that they would lock me out of my account after I subscribed. I highly doubt I would get reimbersed for this time even if I still wanted to play (which I dont at this point).To put this in perspective, I thought I had cancelled my 6-month autorenew for WoW and I noticed I was charged for another 6 months the other day. Less than 24 hours after submitting my ticket I had a full reimbursement without any additional fuss.			"

												A fun game to play for the most part... if you have either 2 or 4 friends that play it with you. The dundeon queue used to allow anywhere from 1-5 players to tackle a dungeon. I solo'd a few once lvl'd up enough. Now you have to have either 3 or 5. Dungeoning was what made the game fun.

Doing the same dailies everyday gets old quick after the first week and most dungeons are not worth doing. Pvp is only for braggin rights and not much else to do after your pvp gear is maxed. You will get bored. My guild leader was playing bdo in between times when he couldnt find anything for us as a guild to do. We ended up just venturing to other games and becoming a community just to keep in touch on the same ts. I love dungeons and dragons lore and the books. Even the table top games but this is not the way to make a dungeons and dragons mmorpg. The world is so small and even with Drizzt thrown in with some cut scenes cant save it. Dont bother with this game. You will get bored after your first playthrough of the content in 1-2 months of reaching 70. And find maxing out your pve gear score is not worth it. The grind time or even your hard earned money will feel like a complete waste.			"

												I get that F2P is going to involve microtransactions [and have enjoyed several games that have had them; TSW, CO, etc.], but this game takes it to an extreme that makes the game itself not very fun but, on the bright side, it will let you know if you are really bad at math by continuing to play]. It became quickly boring when I found out that my companions would hit a rank cap very early on that would require roughly $10 [there is a 2nd MT to get that companion to the next level of rank, no idea how much that is]. You have slots for 19 companions, BTW. Or you can buy the companions for about $20 each. Keep in mind, this is only ONE way to spend cash in this game. Also, the lockboxes are a ""rare"" drop [I have about 100 of them across 4 toons, none of which have hit 30], however, the only way to open them is to buy the keys... which cost about $1 each. It is impossible to get a key to drop as loot in the game.I know they need to make their money, but I would prefer a game that is not sticking me for cash at every corner in order to advance. I would rather just pay a monthly fee. Then, if the game is good, I will stay and continue to pay.			"

												Despite being a D&D Forgotten Realms license this is actually a trick to get fans to download it, you download the game and it's barely D&D at all, if you're a fan of other games in Neverwinter the city itself looks cool but even the plot is bad for the setting. Even if you take the setting and plot issues out of the equation and look at it on its own the game mechanics aren't great, action combat has been done much better in other games that didn't try to ruin a pre-existing license.+ Cool to walk around Neverwinter city in an MMO+ Flashy graphics- Setting/license and gameplay disconnect- Continuity issues with the setting- Stupid things hidden behind paywall- Lame plot that doesn't hook you in enoughIf you want a good D&D MMO, just try DDO because even with all its faults it's still better and needs more players anyway.

												From Thumbs Up to Thumbs Down.I used to like and enjoy this game, but it's gone to crap now.  It has turned into a P2W grind-fest.  The only way you're doing a majority of the end-game content is via buying the upgrade and refining materials and so on.  And if you don't, you'll die.Blatant and garbage.

												Used to love this game, the gameplay was fun and the story immersive. Then came Mod 6. I was so exicted, there was new story, new questlines, new level cap. It was going to be amazing. Then it turned out to be just a bunch of daily quests. No new storyline quests, just something that said ""Hey, go to the drowned shore, etc. and play the same quests OVER AND OVER AND OVER.

												I have logged around 470 hours on this game with a GWF. While this is not alot of time compared to some of the players, I feel my review will hit home with people who have families and an actual career. Let me start off by pointing out the good things about this game:- I actually liked the community. Most players I came across were more than willing to help you get started and impart their knowledge about the game- Graphics were nice for an MMORPG. Some of the areas in the world even reminded me of the graphics of some of the elven locations in WoW- It truly is Free-to-Play provided you aim for PvE. More on this as a con as wellNegatives:- O.M.G. The grind is ridiculous. Whatever the developer's lose by making this game free, they gain more than that back by frustrating players into spending in-game currency to obtain. This is after they bait new players by making the lvl 1-60 leveling a breeze. It took me all of 2 weeks (about 2-3 hours a day) of getting to 60. It took me another 2 weeks to get to 70. By then, I was hooked and wanted fast results. Sneaky by the dev's.- Linked to the point above, this is not a game you will enjoy if you have a family and career that you are passionate about. A game like this literally demands 1000's of hours to get to the top- The NW world is ridiculously small. There are less than 20 locations that you can visit to do quests in.- Grinding astral diamonds is not easy. Again, it is a grind-fest. I understand that games like this require grinding, but the amount of time it took me to grind enough AD to afford a decent mount in Mod 9 was just baffling.Overall, I do not want to write too much but in my personal opinion, this game is only for MMORPG fans who have gone broke and have no job or life.

												A fairly good MMO that promised a lot during early testing phases, but delivered none of it on launch. Where did all that ''Founders Pack'' money go i wonder, probably into expanding the cash shop.If you are a new player and you like D&D you'll like it nonetheless.

												Simply P2W with the recent changes. If you want your character to be competitive in PvE or especially PvP, you MUST pay largeish sums of real money. The ""grinding"" option is just not possible, as it reqires literally thousands of hours to do what paying users do in a couple dozen.			"

												I had a difficult time figuring out whether i would give this a thumbs up or down. After much thought, I decided on a thumbs down. If you are the type of gamer that is willing to put hundreds of hours into one toon and still not get your toon super geared out, then this game will work very well for you.If you the type that likes to get there relatively quick, then this might not be the game for you, and if you are an altaholic, then this game most definitely is not for you. Don't even bother.This game started out very well. Very strong, and had plenty of potential. The graphics were and always have been kind of dated, but the gameplay for a while made up for that. And the storyline, if you chose to read everything, was very compelling. The biggest problem really goes into what I explained first. This game kind of caters to a particular niche. For the hardcore grinders. Thats about it. They have not been able to find a happy medium to draw a generic crowd. That's about really it, and that is enough for me not to recomend this in general.

												I've played this game for about 20 hours now. I leveled a Half-Elf ranger from level 1-40, and I can't say I recommend this game right now. In a lot of ways, NW falls short of the WoW watermark, and that's a shame, because I was hoping it would be a good successor to DDO and WoW as an MMO great. Let me say that on my SLI GTX 760s I did not experience any stutter. The game didn't even access more than 30% of these cards during play, which makes me think this could be played on a tablet if someone wanted to. Which is good if you don't have a system with great specs. Secondly, the game's visuals are only okay by 2010-2011 standards. This was released in 2013, and in 2016, it looks bad. Graphics are very flat with no shadows, no specular highlights, and no volumetric fog at all. Player meshes look like they were designed for cell phone support. Overall, visually, this is the worst MMO I've played in a great while.But that wouldn't be a reason that I wouldn't recommend it, that comes in with the gameplay, and its annoyances start to become more apparent the longer you play and come into your class. As a ranger specializing in archery, I progressed through the game, but found myself fighting with the mechanics of the game more than the monsters. Either a mob would path behind a wall and I'd lose my shot on them, or the skill that I chose to control aggro of mobs just wasn't all that good. One of the rooting shots in the Hunter tree roots for about 1 second, even on rank 3/4...(You don't gain access to the 4th tier of abilities until level 70).But the main reason why I won't be playing this too much longer is because of the game's broken companion AI. It's terrible. You can't set your pet to aggressive, passive, or neutral. And that makes it impossible to use the companion as a tank. On average, my companion was able to pull aggro on 2/5 of every mob set I went into. That's simply not good enough. You can't even tell the pet to attack before you shoot your bow, so you have basically no control over aggro whatsoever. With my reduced threat perk maxed, I always wound up with enemies charging at me, and running out of stamina too quickly.There were times when I would trigger combat intentionally, wait for the companion to charge in and get some hits, then I would retreat to max bow range only to have the companion disengage for no reason and come running to me. I don't get it. This would happen in crypt-sized dungeons as well as outdoor maps.In addition, around level 40, the game starts setting you up with obvious AMBUSH chokepoints on the map, which antagonize your abilities to no end. Hunter/Archer skills are about keeping an enemy at range, and when you have to walk onto a trigger point where 10 enemies pop in surrounding you on all sides at point blank range, it makes everything in your action bar kind of pointless.Bottom line, if you're going to do this, don't play a ranged class unless you have a friend dedicated to going through the quests with you. It's pointless, and I just wasted 20 hours figuring that out. Until they fix these issues, I can't recommend Neverwinter.			"

												This review is currently in progress and should only be taken as a first impression of the game.Graphics: 7Gritty and decently realistic, but textures are unusually low quality and character models are a bit chunky.Sound: 7Average sound, not bad, not good.  Has decent voice overs.Gameplay: 5Combat similair to Tera online except you can't move while attacking, only dodge moves.  It suffers the same problem as Tera online that it's just hiding the targeting from you, but still auto targets whichever monster is closest to your cursor when you attack.  This is extremly obvious on a ranger where the split arrow move is very difficult to aim as you can't aim between enemies to hit them both, when you right click your camera auto targets one of the enemies making the attack less accurate.Like every other MMO, it follows the questing format that we've all grown bored of.Impression: 3As an MMO it doesn't break any new ground that hasn't already been broken by Tera online.  The graphics are lower than some newer MMO's, the combat is slower, and the quests are still boring.  The game makes a vague attempt to play to neverwinter lore, but then falls appart with pre-made canned characters removing the ability to apply dungeons and dragons like upgrades.  If you were hoping to roll your own character, play Dungeons and Dragons online instead which does a much better job of letting you roll play your own character.Value: ?Unknown, haven't played long enough.Summary (In progress):I see no reason for this game to exist, the same formula has been used countless times before.  If your in this for the social aspect, play the game the rest of your friends are playing.  If your looking for D&D style roll playing, play D&D Online.  If your looking for active combat, play Tera online or Vindictus.			"

												Used to love this game. Still do. But it is quickly turning into a pay to win. They are quickly limiting you to how much astrol diamonds, the main currency in the game, you can earn and eliminating ways to earn it. I was quick to delete it off of that basis alone. Then, to add insult to injury, you can not transfer your character from the Xbox to PC in viseversa . they claim its because the worlds are different, but its easy to see that its so you have to pay for more currency to rebuild the loss. Their customer service is crap. Very rude, down to the trouble shooting page its self. I will not return unless this game is fixed.			"

												NOTE: I have been playing this game for some years now. And am judging based off my own opinion and experiences.As said above, I have been playing since nearly the start of this game, with little to no complaints. Though Neverwinter is now long past any similarity to what it used to be, it can still be an enjoyable game with lots of story and lore. Though the community takes a little to get used to, and work with. For the content they have added and thus also taken away, I would say that I could not agree with a lot of their actions on this as it has taken away a lot of the casual play and enjoyment away from what the game once had. Though it is free to play, it does have heavy pay to play elements to it as well, which is highly evident in PvP. The new class changeups have also played against what used to be an accepted balanced system. The new mod to be released will add in Strongholds for individual guilds to take and/or fight over in PvP battles. This will indeed give a new reason to be a part of a good and trusted guild, which many can be found here.I will say that if you have friends or plan to make some Neverwinter can be a good place for that. Personally, I have made many online friends here who I still know a couple of years down the road. I give Neverwinter, my old home away from home, a thumbs up as it is a good game to play for free to play.			"

If I remember it right, it's a lot better than this and not as P2W as this is. You pretty much need to pay for everything, including companions and mounts if you don't want to spend half your lifetime trying to get them.Personally, this game gets 4/10, kinda fun, but way too buggy and P2W, sadly.

ALmost totally pointless to try for the endgame. As for anything else though I got my enjoyment out of it for being free.Would I recommend it? If I could go back to the beta I would tell myself to stay the hell away and just goto the local Library and find real people to play REAL D&D. would have been more enjoyable			"

												just put it this way, the game is F2P, its an RPG, lots of folks play, you can still quest and do dungeons even without the super rare legendary ""ive been playing a lot longer than you"" gear. could the game use some more work, yeah, but the way it is, the game is still decent. IMO, they should focus on improving the game overall rather than keep releasing new modules. or at least focus on game mechanics, etc for next two major updates, then go back to releasing modules. i may not have a lot of time invested in the game to voice my opinion about the game overall, but i like RPG's and while im not a hardcore player, im sure somebody would value this opinion/review.

												it is sad to say that after all those days i uninstalled, its still a pay to win.i came across level 65 or 66 and befriended a girl in that open world where we both fought monsters together but sadly life was tough for me cause i was too poor in that game to buy anything yet she gave me hope :') but one day i had enough and took my hands off this game cause everyone had a shining armor and sword and there i was with nothing but a sword that dealt 25% damage to a high level boss.so i went to a smith so he can sell me his finest sword that could cut through a dragon's a.s.s but he led me straight to my steam wallet asking me for real money and alas i had enough.so i exit the game and deleted it from my library forever.i wonder how my female friend is doing cause i promised her i'd repay her for killing all those bosses for me once i become stronger in that game.be safe me princess <3 yer' prince still thinks about you.

												Yes and no. In my experience feels like a water down version of guild wars 2 both in graphics and system. Not to mention the rediculous 190€ Hero of the North dlc. Who the f*ck do you think I going to buy that ♥♥♥♥?Like so many other good franchises the producers take advantage of the name and the succes of previous versions. This, nothing butr a commercial piece of crap. D&D rules whatever, the commerce bit is too much.			"

												Although all the cons, I'm still recommending this game. It is simply fun. If you do not have high expectations, just wish to spend some time it is your game.Pros: - Well it is fun. The quests are narrated, and have real stories. Also you can find lots of lore objects to know more about the world.- Looks nice.- Almost all of the tools / interfaces are reachable from Browser.- Have a minigame with dice-rolling, from browser, if you have 5-10 mins during the day. The minigame can yield in useful items. (I have not told it will be quick, as the Tier6 dungeons are really hard - like collect 18 shield from 8 dice...)- Have some connections with the original Neverwinter games.Cons:- It is not D&D.- Still bugging after almost 1 year, eg: many times the daily quests cannot be completed.- Lagging, in dungeons the latency usually fine, but around peak hours it is (or at least feels like) more than a second, and with the dodging system, it is sometimes lethal.- Graphics of the game is nice, but clattering. It would really need some optimalization- The PvE part is fun, till lv 55 and after it became hard, and turning to a pay to win game.- The PVP part is still under development, some pvp is available, but the single map became boring after a while.- Items has variety of looks, although the same item looks the same on all of the races. At least as dwarf, I have not seen any difference from sun elf, or from humans.- To gather the ""real"" money, the astral diamond is really slow, and painful. (daily quest gives 3k - x4 as there are 4 quests, with 1-1 hour to complete-, while 300k is needed for the simplest upgrade - horse, companion, ...).- It may be annoys you, but the game constantly downloading in the background.Actually the Zen / AD system (astral diamond) is confusing to be bad or good. It is the same as all Perfect World games.- You can buy Zen. It is an universal curency within PW games. If you transfer it to NW, it can be traded for AD in the exchange, or use it to buy items directly from Zen market. As the game is free to play and the servers has to be maintened, this will generate the income they are loosing with removing the monthly fee.- It is mentioned that everything can be collected just with play without pay. Right. To collect 1 purple artisan resource, you need 4 blue, 1 blue is 4 green, 1 green is 4 white(lv3), 1 white (lv3) is 4 white (lv2), 1 white (lv2) is 4 white (lv1), each trainings are 18 hours (offline time also counts). It is 1365 cycle x 18 hours, which is ~1000 days. At lv 60, you possibly have 5-6 slots opened already, so it is ~200 days.  And you will need 9 as you have a total 9 slots for professions. Or you can buy profession pack with a chance of green/blue/purple resource for Zen or for AD from AH (green 250k, blue 1mill, purple 4 mill AD).- Also myths on the internet are saying, with proper trading you can gather 300k AD / day, and there are several guides available on the internet how, but for it you have to be professional stock handler (Zen / AD exchange), or tradesman constantly monitoring the offers and needs on the AH.

												I've changed this review several times. The game gets good, the game gets bad, and then it gets mediocre again.But this time they can't bring me back, and I know for a fact that they have lost many other loyal fans.With the addition of Module 6, Elemental Evil, came the realization that the developers behind this game care nothing for it, and only care to fill Cryptic's wallets.They do not develop the game. They develop a business, and a shoddy one at that.With this most recent module came a level cap increase. This increase was very poorly integrated, both from a chronological standpoint as well as a financial standpoint. It was released only a few months after the ""Rise of Tiamat"" campaign, which introduced the game's first set of Legendary ""Artifact"" weapons and armor. These were made obsolete by the raise in level cap. Also integrated were several new maps, which proved equally as useless and buggy. They were essentially re-lit versions of maps from old campaigns. Mind you, Module 6 was postponed a whole month from it's original date; for what? Exceedingly subpar, untested content.For several months now, the developers have been growing increasingly greedy; discovering all the ways they can obtain peoples' money. Mounts, bags, respecs, rerolls, race changes, companions, a number of sneaky maneuvers that get you to believe ""Oh, it's just a few dollars here and there, for convenience."" They aren't convenient. They are Cryptic's. Whatever you purchase with your money is still THEIRS. They can change the parameters of what you've puchased at any time. That is to say, they can remove items from packs, change them from being bound to account to being bind on equip or bind on pickup, and not even change the item's description in doing so. And you can do nothing about it.They fired their old dev after Mod 6's release, hired a new one, and he immediately promised to ""fix the game."" He hardly acknowledged many of the most prominant complaints, and in his first hotpatch made the purchasable bags ""Bind on Equip"" from ""Bound to Account.""A community moderator from their forums gave me an interesting quote to work with:""This has been said repeatedly, ad infinitum and ad nauseam: Read and abide by the Rules of Conduct. Then you won't have to worry about being moderated--and no, you don't get to interpret them to your liking.This isn't your soapbox. This isn't your crap can. You are, in a manner of speaking, in Cryptic's house. The rules of Conduct are the house rules. You wouldn't go into someone else's house and talk a bunch of crud about their house and how they run it, and not expect to be abruptly shown the door, no? Then don't expect to be able to do it here.There is a way to go about showing concern and dissatisfaction besides being insulting, condescending, rude, or demeaning. We don't expect everything to be sunshine and rainbows but there is a constructive and civilized way to go about it.""-lewstelamon01, Community ModeratorThis quote pretty much shows you how much of a catch-22 their customer support is. There are constructive ways of going about it, but what is ""constructive"" is purely based on their judgement alone. I have seen many a support thread shut down, by this moderator and others, because it was ""unconstructive.""They weed through, delete the flack, and make sure to remove anything remotely within the parameters of their ""Moderator handbook"" so that the forums look clean and pretty to any new onlooker that might be seaching for an opinion on the game.Hopelessly corrupt and nearing a fatal blow, is how I would describe Neverwinter Online. Don't let them see a penny of your money unless you want it to slip into the abyss.			"

												I first picked this game up when it was released. My initial impression was good. A Free to Play that seemed to allow players to advance without spending real money, albeit  a bit slower than paying players, is acceptable. The combat system is not quite what I was expecting from a D&D title (cooldown based abilities all around), but it is still a LOT of fun. Very easy, quick controls that respond well, as long as the server is not lagging (which, unfortunately, happens a LOT). But I still played it, and had a lot of fun doing so. I spent a little money on it, just so I could open some of those lockboxes, and I did manage to get an epic sword and cloak out of them. This was a couple of years ago, though, before the changes that recently hit. Since then, they have taken this game from a Free-to-Play to an all out money grab. It has gone from Free-to-Play, to Pay-to-Win. -AD rewards have been nerfed. No way to acquire the currency needed to buy things from the auction house unless you buy something from the Zen market first. -The zone dungeons are broken (literally removed from the game, for reasons I will speculate on later). -We now have at least 3 types of those infernal, blasted, annoying, inventory-slot-robbing lockboxes that can only be opened with a key that can only be acquired through the Zen market. I have only seen 3 types; there are likely more, and they drop CONSTANTLY. You WILL get them, even when you don't want them. There are constant system messages pasting across the screen, stating things like,""So-and-so just got an epic whats-it-ma-thingy-with-flames-flying-from-its-rump from a Rusted, drops-all-the-time, yet somehow still shows EPIC rarity lockbox of money grabbing."" -Loot drops, which were never all that great, are now an abysmal joke. I consistently see the same 2 or 3 pieces of armor dropping in every single zone.-Quest rewards are a waste, if not an outright insult. Remember when I said the dungeons were removed? Yeah, those used to be the only source of decent gear in the game that didn't require you to open your wallet. They're gone now, but the devs left the quest links and markers in place. I saw all these changes, and I decided to conduct an experiment. I bought $50.00 worth of Zen and bought as many keys as I could. I think I ended up with thirty of them, making each one cost about $1.60. I had some Zen left over, but not enough to buy anything without coughing up more real money (seriously, do ALL of these games have pricing schemes that make it impossible to take your ""currency"" balance to zero?). Anyway, I opened 30 of those damnable lock boxes, and got CRAP. A handful of epic enchantments. A couple of blue craftsmen. Oh, and a 5th character slot for buying stuff on the Zen market. 50 bucks got me NOTHING worth mentioning. No epic gear, like it was in the early days. No new mounts. Just a bunch of enchantments, runestones, and a modest amount of astral diamonds. Pathetic. I could go on, but I won't. I'll just say that this game was, when it launched, much less greedy. Players who spent a few bucks would be rewarded with epic gear that levelled with their character, or a cool mount. Not any more. Neverwinter is now such an obvious wallet leech that the very first screen it gives you upon logging in is the Zen market. Draw your own conclusions from that.  "

												Stay far away from this game, if you're new to it. Your wallet (and sanity) will thank me later.Many MMORPGs fail to consider their new blood, but this is easily one of the most egregious offenders you can find on Steam as a whole. It's a blight on gaming in general, an abject lesson in taking a once-great title and driving it straight into the ground over money. There's no balance of time versus money. You will pay up on this one, or you won't be competitive.The PvE content is only truly fun up till 60 (when they introduce the horrible Mod 6 content -- and it just gets worse from there on in terms of agonisingly boring grinding), and PvP is for masochists only. Mobs will regularly one or two shot you in epic dungeons, and established players are invincible in the battlegrounds... assuming you can find a PvP match at all, with the game's lengthy queues. This developer has chased their players away, and for good reason.			"

												I played this game years ago with a friend. I never liked the combat system, due to the way animations freeze your character in place, making the combat actually feel much less smooth than 'non-action' MMOs like WoW or similar. But playing with a friend it might have been fun enough, except it was so repetitive. We got to like the second area or something and the whole place was just groups of the same 5 orcs over and over, with the occasional ogre. Every quest was just some variation on ""fight/kill the orcs"". It was one of the most astonishingly boring and grindy experiences I have had in an MMO, and we both quit in frustration. It's got to be pretty bad if playing with a friend can't save it.By all accounts the game is even worse now than it was back then, so I would definitely stay steer clear.			"

												Used to be fun.  Ignore my hrs recorded here on Steam as I usually play via ARC and only use this to play the game when ARC is going crazy and won't let me log in. It used to have a free to play model and in some ways, it still is.  However, they  (as of this writing) have sneakily reinserted a subscription perk called a VIP program that makes it pay to win as the perks listed definitely brings a major advantage against most non-subs.  Also, as of this writing, there's some tomfoolery going on during high level dungeons crawls on pugs that gets you kicked out via teammates that want the loot for themselves or for their friends that weren't even in the group.  I started playing around February of 2015 and got almost all of my toons of every class and race not hidden behind a pay wall to max level, but the grind for gear on dungeons for the newly max level character almost stops due to other players kicking you out of the group for the abovementioned reason in regards to loot.   After experiencing it more than once soured my overall experience of the game.     Pros: fun levelling, impressive graphics, some of the quests are downright hilarious in terms of story/spoken dialogue.Cons: See my rant above.Conclusion:  If you can stand the cons, then you'll enjoy the game.   It could have been a WOW killer... unfortunately, that potential got wasted.			"

												I actually liked this game for a while but eventually it got really old fast. Same old quests where you kill this amount of mobs and find a certain amount of these, but thats not the worst part in it. I hated the end game ♥♥♥♥ where you had to only do one quest a day. It actually makes you wait 24 hours before you can do another. With the sheer amount of end game content itsw not worth it. I figured out that it would take more than a year to actually beat it, and by then they would have already come out with even more end game content for you to wait on. Then again you could spendd hundreds of dollars just so that you can beat it. Yeah this game is a p2w, dont believe anyone that says its not. You have to pay for everything, mounts, gear, in game money, and even for your own guild you have to pay. I spent only 5 dollars in it and that was to get some in game cash and I didnt get ♥♥♥♥ for it, all I got was a common mount that anyone else could get. For people playing it now I would suggest leaving now before the devs make it any worse than it is.			"

												After playing my heart out of Neverwinter Nights 2 in my teen years, I came upon this game with nostalgia induced passion. Only to realize this is the age of Pay-to-Win gaming. A factor I found that hurt the core of the games that utilized this. Neverwinter Nights 2 may have been an old game, and I still play it now, but I cannot bring myself to hit the ""thumbs up"" on this game. I have never liked an RPG based game that did not enforce actual Roleplaying, utilized Pay-to-Win gaming, and whose active community was unwelcoming.I don't mean to say this is a bad game, it's got a few great features, such as:- Graphical abilities- Great Camera Angling- The ability to actually jump.- Utilizes D&D 4.0 guidelines- Interesting progression rates- Great HUD- Free to playBut here were the exact areas I felt hurt the actual gameplay:- Pay-to-Win- Non-enforced RolePlay in a RolePlaying Game & Server (players talking OOC all the time)- Unwelcoming community- Leveling up granted no satisfaction in creating your character- In-ability to crossclassThough personally I would rather play D&D 3.5			"

												While Neverwinter isn't quite pay to win, it wouln't be a stretch to call it pay-to-enjoy. The monitization strategy PW chose for the game is to place all sorts of artifical obstiicles and inconveniences in the game, which can of course be trivially overcome if you just spend money, and they choose to remind you of that with the hard sell at every possible turn.Customer service is terrible, even for paying customers, with support tickets taking days to be resolved, Long standing bugs and balance issues abound, with developers not even paying lip service to addressing them.All in all, these factors combine to turn what could otherwise be an amazing expreience into an absolute slum of a MMO.

No fluff no hype....it is FUN!As far as those who gripe about the ""Pay to Win"" minomer, no game this good is without cost to make and continue improving.  The game offers variety and challenge.  There is always something new to explore.  On any Free to Play game, a customer would have to get something for their money or who would ever pay at all?  With that said, I can recommend you try it for free see what it is about then decide. I can also recommend you do some reading about the class types and how to build a strong player character.

 UNOPTIMIZED While the the fast paced combat makes this game really enjoyable, the optimization makes Neverwinter ♥♥♥♥ing unplayable. I can't get a decent frame rate even on the lowest possible settings and I'm not alone on this one. Also Cryptic don't seem very intrested in fixing the game and they prefer releasing modules on top of modules that pretty much boil down to the same thing: grind resources to unlock passive abilities for your character.In conclusion, ♥♥♥♥ Cryptic and ♥♥♥♥ this game.

												This game should be somewhat interesting to DnD fans - if you don't count yourself one, I would warn you to stay away from this game.Leveling your first character from lvl 1 to lvl 60 is kinda fun - exploring Neverwinter and it's surroundings, visiting Underdark, dealing with Spellplague, bla-bla-bla - only if you don't mind underpopulated locations. Seriously, expect to see some really large zones that have only ""kill 10 mobs"" quest.Everything changes drastically when you're hitting lvl 60 - after that it's just one big grind fest.You get some new zones to grind daily quests, which reward with providing access to new daily quests, which reward you with some gear that allows you grind these daily quests more efficiently. Endgame content is a myth - 2 PvP arenas and, like, 4-5 dungeons designed for 5 ppl max.'Elemental Evil' addon should've patched things up - players got tired of daily quests, everyone wanted to see some new epic content, etc.So developers really listened to the community - now you have one raid instance, that's designed for level 70 characters. But, yeah, it's available only after you've spent several dozen hours - you get it - on your most favorite daily quests.Not to mention that reaching lvl 70 is a one big DAILY QUEST GRIND from lvl 60.Yeah, and to add an insult to injury - this game features something like 200 or 250 different currency types, so I guess we can label the game as new-player-friendly.

												oh you found a good way to get gear? BAM *content deleted in new mod*wow, you reached the endgame? BAM *your gear is thrash with the new mod, buy new ones or grind hundreds of hours*I used to love this game, they always added new content and made things interesting even for those who play this game f2p. Now they dont care about anything but money, they said they will add content then they deleted the old dungeons without adding any.  While im typing this atm, new que system that they added and never worked properly (try to que for pvp and get 15 mins ban or join a game that is already lost and near to ending) is crushed and whoever tries to que gets stuck untill they do something about it (usually they dont do anything so good luck with that), 2 years ago when i started playing this game, it was the best mmorpg that i ever played that i can't even enjoy any other anymore. Now its full of bots and spammers. It used to be so crowded that what you type in the ''looking for group'' chat  couldn't be seen and you had to spam it and put something like ///---- ((((( to make it noticeable. Now you have to play the game at spesific times to find people to group and wait in pvp ques for 5-7 mins (just to see same people who are doing pvp anymore with this unbalanced pvp system).  The lag in the game is something so normal for those who play is incredible,  game is rubber banding, you lose connection randomly, IWD is absolutely unplayable.  A disgustingly greedy company is sucking all the fun out of this game, and i feel sorry for those who still feed them with their money. At this rate this game won't see 2017, Whenever something is bugged, patched (there is no good patches anymore) and changed, people quit the game.			"

												Okay. This is a pretty standard copy/paste mmorpg. I initially played when it first came out, I only played a few hours, got sick of it's genericness and stopped. Came back figuring I was a bit too harsh to quit so early in the game (I wasn't) and here we go.Dated Graphics with low poly models. But the game is an unoptimised waste of system resources. If your system is fine with it, like mine was until I entered town the reason is -> you'll find that whenever other players are around you your start to actually download data that you should already have on your system in order to see those players, such as models and textures. Basically - the game only installs monster models and npc data on your system to keep the download short. After that whenever you walk around the game world and see players wearing gear you don't have, the game downloads it automatically whilst you play. So you'll be stuttering like a mother♥♥♥♥ing slovenian on a computato for a good hour.Music isn't memorable, few hours after playing you could seriously wander if it had any music at all. Gameplay, rather bland and grindy, just spamming left click.Animations, clunky, enemies like to glide along faster than their animations.Tutorial/Introduction - Unimaginative garbage. You wash up on shore with no gear, then loot boxes to get newb gear, talking to people along the beach. Literally the exact same introduction as path of exile and age of conan. Then you talk to some people at a camp and get a quest (am I playing path of exile?) then you go and kill some undead (okay, what the ♥♥♥♥, this IS path of exile) Pretty standard Press ""button"" to interact on objects, interact on more objects, talk to people - by interacting on them with button. After that you fight more undead, because hey, they didn't use the same model and monsters enough in the lame ♥♥♥ introduction that now they're sending you to a crypt with totally unrelated undead who just happen to be there. Then you go to some slums, because trouble starts at home and fight some guys. Time to go to the sewers and fight the rat men and solve incredibly ♥♥♥♥♥ puzzles! This turned from a review to a splurge of hate, so I'm stopping it here. This is a generic piece of ♥♥♥. I literally feel like I've been ripped off and I didn't spend any money, just time. Time I could've spent playing a better game.Oh did I mention that a majority of the game is instanced based, y'know dungeons. You don't even get to see other people in your quests, it's like playing a single player game with random people standing around blocking NPCs. (Oh yea, if there are too many people around an npc, good luck interacting with them, you'll be bringing up player menus with the same button!)			"

Thier suport people deleted my tickets so i had to email the company directly for support and found out my ticket were deleted because they were duplicates. I included step by step screenshots of money spent through their broken games and their ARC Client with three separate issues and they never read anything just closed them. when i inquired about them i was told i had made a mistake and they blamed me.. even though i had screenshots proving i didnt make any errors. they refused to refund my money citing they could not refund Z coins and would not compensate me with anything else. then they downright stole 35 dollars from me by not creditting my account and i sent screenshots of the confirmed purchases.. i was also told to ♥♥♥♥ off about that.... do yourself a favor and protect yourselves from these flashy SCAM ARTIST who are stealing money from people left and right.

												Game seems alright. Nothing too special, but not a bad game by any means.Combat feels a bit clunky, but once you get used to it this can be mostly overlooked.Big complains-Progression is slow and feels bland-Pre-made classes are not what DnD has ever been about-DDO online does a better job making interesting dungeons for people to take on, with interesting nerrative. -Largely Pay To WinALL of these things can actually be looked past and you'll find a great game...however....I've been crashing nonstop every few minutes, and can't enjoy the game even after trying tons of different things to fix it, reinstalling multiple times, verifying integrity, Starting in safe mode, etc. Looked it up and this isn't new, this dates back as far as 2013, so, no, not recommended.

												This game has the absolute worst customer service I have ever encountered. During a break, my account was hacked and millions of AD worth of items were stolen. When I contacted customer service I was asked for some account information which I gave, and finally, after a week and a half and one single response from Perfect World per day (regardless of how quickly I responded to their emails), was told they could not restore my account. I was upset and asked for a refund on a Zen purchase I had made during the time of the ticket being open. This request was also declined. At this point I am absolutely furious. I was a VIP subscriber and had spent a generous amount of money on Zen in the last few years. Do not make the same mistakes I have, do not give Perfect World your money, they will completely disappoint and disregard you.			"

												I used to adore this game. It says on Steam that I only have about 70 hours played, but that's because I used to play it on the Cryptic launcher instead of Steam. I've played a lot more than that.But lately, they've stopped producing content for people who can't or won't pay for things. I'm all for having items and even certain questlines be pay to play, but whole classes and races? The new and ridiculous ""events"" are annoying and useless. They get in the way of actual gameplay! I'm trying to kill this boss, and a ""you just got a -insert stupid name for item necessary for event-! Here's a large popup box and a new quest!"" And suddenly I have to rush to click out before the boss smashes my unresponsive avatar into a pulp.The game is super unbalanced, too. Want a tip for how to breeze through early levels? Pick Hunter or Cleric, the two most OP classes. Mage is also pretty good- the ability to eliminate your enemies ability to move or attack is pretty OP. Less awesome damage, though. The game is never hard unless you go somewhere above your level. The monsters are nerfed to hell and back.There's also no variety. I used to love the dungeon crawls, but after the first thirty or so, their novelty wore off. And they are no longer worth the cliche grinding of ""kill 20 imps"" to get to. Every world, every quest, every single thing is exactly the same throughout the entire game! ""Walk through absently designed dungeon. Interact with switches. Kill monsters. Kill boss. Done.""This game hints at awesome customization with the character creation and the class/race quests and objects you can get to open more parts of the game. But none of these are expanded on in any useful way. They're token efforts to make players feel better. The only one I came across that had any kind of interesting class/race quest was Scourge Warlock! For all I know, Dragonborn or Moon Elf might have it better. But I wouldn't know, because they're behind a paywall!Honestly, the cashgrab aspect is probably losing them more money than they're making. If players are leaving because the game sucks without money being added in, make it a pay to play and move on. Plenty of games make plenty of money on that system. But if you don't have players to buy things, no one buys things. I would happily buy some of the beautiful companions and mounts and costumes if I had the money available. I would gladly buy the weapons and other cool things. But I refuse to be fleeced for the ability to play all of the actual game parts of the game! A free to play game should have the ability to buy extras. Not the ability to buy mroe of the game.			"

												This game, like all the others from Cryptic, is a pay to win and pay to play game.There are curently 5 classes to pick from.The PVP needs to be renamed play the thief or die, as the thief uses stealth, they can kill you while they are hiding,  and you can not do anything to stop them.  I do not ever see a thief in the real game, so the players just make one soley for pvp.The classses are not like the D&D game system at all.  The cleric can not turn undead, all they do is heal, they can not do any damage and use a magic missle type attack.  The ranger class is very weak, you should only use the basic powers you start with as higher level powers actually do less damage then these as you level up.  The wizard controls people and can ""freeze"" enemies which does not work all that well since anything bigger then a minion is immune.  The other 2 are fighters, one tank and one high dps warrior.Everything takes astral diamonds, or real money called zen, everything.  You pick up an item and need to identify it, it costs a scroll you pay for with astral diamonds.You want good equipment, a mount, a companion it all comes out of the astral diamonds.Guess what, they are hard to earn!!!At the beginning levels you can do 1 skirmish for 1000 astral diamonds and if you do it during the hour of the day that features skirmishes you get an extra 1000 for a total of 2000 for that 15 minutes, assuming that there are enough people on at your level and on your map to get into the queue.  You can also do dungeons daily to get 3000 astral diamonds but some of them take 90 minutes or longer depending on who you have on your team.Guess what, you want that good gear, it will run you 300000 or more astral diamonds, per piece, you do the math here.Of course you can always swipe your credit card and get 1 million or more astral diamonds, I mean they even have an option for you to spend $200 real dollars all at one time to make it easy for you to play their game.I did pick yes to recommend this game.It is fun to play, to try out the 5 classes and run some missions.You will get to your own point of saying, that is enough.  After your 3rd time in a row of being killed by someone who spent $200 for their pvp gear or maybe after spending more astral diamonds on identify scrolls running through a dungeon then you actually make. That point will be up to you.So hop in here, please, so that I do not have to wait 30 minutes in each queue to play something.  :)___________________________________________________________________________________Okay this is edited after module 3 came out, the icewind dale.  At this time I have put in another 50 or so hours trying out the changes to the new hunter paragon path and the new module.  When I first looked at this game I read the first review on the forum.  It had a guy who had spent over 900 hours on the game and did not recommend it.  I thought that was kind of stupid, who would spend that long on a game and not recommend it.  SO HERE I AM RAISING MY HAND AS WELL. I am changing my game recommendation from yes to try it out to NO just stay far far far far away.The price of 1 piece of real Zen, real money is now maxed out again at 500 astral diamonds.  Pay attention, you will earn 1000 astral diamonds for every 15 minute skirmish you run.  So that means if you spend 15 minutes playing a skirmish match and trade in your astral diamonds you will get 2 real zen.  Now take a look at the Zen store, you want that nice cheetah mount, it will run you 3, 500 Zen.There are players in the game who have multiple accounts, multiple meaning up to 50, who just run bots on all of them to farm astral diamonds.  I now see why they do that.There really is no fun way to get astral diamonds.  You can rerun the same skirmishes daily, assuming it is the skirmishes hour and make 1,000 astral diamonds per one, remember the longer ones will take you 15 minutes each or longer.  You can do the daily dungeons for 3000 astral diamonds, remember they will take you up to 90 minutes to do that.Okay so the new area, whoa what a bummer.  First you need to be level 60, current game max.Then you need to have epic level gear so that your gear score is over 10000.Then you need to have level 3 boons unlocked from either one of the grinding campaigns at the end.So basically, only those players who have done everything they possibly can and are still playing.Then there is the new PVP part, since the game was so unbalanced to start with, they now will reward those players with even more power after spending $300 real dollars or more on PVP gear.At the time I am writing this I have 4, yes 4, different lock boxes sets stacking up in my inventory.These are boxes where you have a very tiny chance to get good gear, or a new mount or a companion and they all take Zen, real money, keys to open.So I have tried every single class, both paragon paths for each, I have beat the game, max level on all of them.  I have written a ton of helpful hints for new players and now done a review twice.  I wish I had all that play time back now!!!!It just gets worse and worse as Cryptic nickel and dimes you to death at the end.			"

												To bad the studio is super shady. Could have been a decent game. Of course, I'll always hate them deep down because it wasn't neverwinter nights 3, and instead, a cash grab MMO.  It started from before the game released, with their limited collectors edition. Something which they still continue to sell today, I believe. So much for limited. But not only that, they advertised custom gear that wasn't actually in the pack. Later on they changed the advertisement, but you can still find it with a search. Just one of the many sketchy business practices of this company. Oh, and if you get hacked, good luck. This game has plenty of it, and everything you own can be instantly liquadated and sold, due to the way gems, and money work in this game. Cryptic won't even care, and they don't even have an option to report such things.			"

Getting new items means repeat waht you have done 100 x times before and maybe you get something usefull. Also after the new update to lvl 70 makes the game not better .... only thing is now i lvl up to 70 and with lvl 70 i need to repeat all the dungeons i have done before with lvl 60 100 times. Grinding and lvling is a lot of fun right, but if you have reached lvl 70, pvp is unbalanced and not a lot of fun and repeat allways the same dungeon to get new items  also not a lot of fun ... and game is too much ristriced for non paying players  ....Good:LVL UPBuild up your char.Bad:-Nothing new -Repeat same quest and dungeons to get new items -pay for comfort (inventory bags, char reset, charaktar slots, items )-bad pvp system also after stronghod update (attack someone with 5 ppl and he does not get down is much frustrating)			"

												First looks suggest this game simply uses the name Neverwinter, and isn't anything to do with the previous two RPG releases.  Shame that, it could have gone a long way.  This, taken as is, is a fiddly bit of nothingness that doesn't hook any interest with me I'm afraid.  It seems amateurish and aimed at an audience that probably won't remember the originals, as I can't imagine anyone old enough to have broken their teeth over ther last 20 years on the two fine games would have any interest in this at all, other than curiosity followed swiftly by huge disappointment.

												This was a fun game, but could be updated on the gameplay and graphics. I have only got to level 6, so I have MUCH MORE to learn and experience. It is an MMORPG similar to World of Warcraft, RIFT etc. (Although WoW is the best xD)I would recommend this, as it is very good for a FREE online game.			"

												This game was pretty good when I first played it. But I guess there was something I was overlooking when I first played it as well that basically is the worst thing ever.This game is a cash grab. Just look at the price of the DLCs and that says enough. See all those people running around on cool mounts? Gotta buy em, otherwise your stuck with a plain Jane horse. Companions? Money. Crafting? Money, Items? Money. Dungeons? Money. Money Money Money. Everything in this game has a price tag and while the in game prices aren't too bad, that's where they hook you. ♥♥♥♥ is cheap and odds are you'll get ""Something"" of use out of each random bag you buy meaning you'll keep spending gobs of money. Really though it's not a problem if you're not stupid.I spent upwards of $45 on the game with in game purchases and played the game for about 4 months, so I'd say I got my  money's worth out of the game. It was interesting for sure, but endgame content was non-existent at the time.The quest immersion is great, with actual things happening in the quests, plus the toolset to build your own quests makes this game pretty good.Classes are bland and generic, but then, what do you expect from Dungeons and Dragons. They've never really been the most creative when it came class variety or uniqueness. Likewise with the race selections. Class mechanics are fun and interesting but lose their flair quickly.Dungeons are brutal in length and boast a pretty hogwash set of mechanics for any fight. Just pick one boss from any level dungeon and they either suck to fight against because the mechanics are annoying, or the mechanics are so bad that the boss is broken or too easy.Leveling up from min to max takes almost a month of casual play to attain, less if you're hardcore, so that's not bad.Save your money when playing this game as it doesn't offer much once you hit max level and most of the things they offer for you to buy are cosmetic in nature or offer only slight boosts to your character. You can pretty much skip over this game and not miss out on anything.			"

												In my opinion, game was good before the introduction of Module 6. A lot of the beloved dungeons were simply removed, quest lines are broken and dungeoneering, for one, became impossibly hard. Life-stealing and healing have been nerfed to the ground, which basically made this game extremely hard to play.That's how I quitted this game.			"

												Curiously, I actually enjoy this game. The game itself is a strong MMO, if a bit outdated on the graphics end. My reasons for giving a bad review is the 'free to play' claim. While I have no real issue with a game that allows players to purchase the best gear, this should be a shortcut - nothing more. It is technically true that players CAN access the paid content by trading in-game currency for ZEN (the real money currency), the amount of time to get even a small quantity is highly limiting. But this isn't the major problem. The major problem I have is that it seems like everything in the game is locked behind that pay-wall; need more bags? Zen. A mount upgrade? Zen. Bank slots? Zen. Character slots? Zen. Re-spec? Zen. Access to the [current] best-in-slot gear? Zen. Better companions? Zen. Upgrade companions? Zen (or an astronomical anount of ingame currency). And the prices are, quite frankly, offensive: 16 bank slots on a single character? That'll run you about $6. That's more than a character slot. Some mounts are $40. The lowest rank bag? $6. Whoever priced this stuff needs to lose his job - and everyone who actually paid these prices is only enabling this mess. I want to see the game succeed, because I enjoy playing it. But that isn't going to happen if everyone actually pays their exorbant prices. Finally, I was forced to post this here because the developers refuse to allow posts about thier 'pay to win' pricing at all in their forums. They know it's an issue, and their response is to be adversarial - they clearly don't treat their customers with respect and think of them as little more than piggy banks.			"

												Game is an insult to The Forgotten Realms franchise and a slap in the face to it's creator Ed Greenwood, if your expecting an Advanced Dungeons & Dragons experience you'd have a better chance at Dungeons & Dragons Online.~ Numerous issues listed below:- Performs substandard no matter what build your desktop is (and I'm running off a i7 Quad Core @ 4.4Ghz and two SLi'd GTX 780s with 16gb DDR Corsair Veng Ram and this game runs like a slug)- Game is overpopulated with gold spammers and the community devs do nothing to address the issue at hand- Game is Pay to Win - cannot access better companions unless you pay an absurd amount of money basic blue quality one is 29.99$ USD- Combat is Clunky at best more like Two Worlds when it was first launched; complete inbalances with classes- Contradictions involving Lore if you've read any of the Lore Books or The Forgotten Realms Campaign Booklet- Magic System is mediocre heavily favors melee characters over spellcasters (not unforeseen as most MMO companies seem to have some unrestrained hatred towards anything that doesnt swing a giant metal stick); game contains 4% of the spells in PhB, devs add their own versions of spells which contradict pre-existing spells.- Alignment System forces you to play Good/Lawful or Neutral no option or flexibility to be Chaotic or Lawful Evil or Neutral Evil (completely biased against anyone who wants to play the greedy backstabbing merc or someone who wants to dabble in Necromancy)- Servers latency is worse than a 64k Dial Up Modem, constant disconnects.- Uses the Awesimium Process which is considered spyware to monitor your computer (possibility it's recording http sites you are visiting so it can spam your registered email with junk mail later)- Character Proportions completely wrong; Tiefling look like full Daemons unlike what they look in AD&D of a mix of human and Daemon depending on the Generation the Tiefling is.- Limited Imagination of the Dev Team and ""Imperfect World"" as me and my friends call them.- Little to no Customer Support; never address the issue with all of their games it has taken 1 year 3 months for them to get the mailing system somewat function again in STO; many quest markers have issues such as bugging or not working properlyAll In All horrible game to play not worth the time or effort invested.((I dont play through Steam I played through their PW client))			"

												i've got so much time and money into this game but i agree with everyone else at this time. Greedy Greedy Greedy. there is just so many stupid decisions being made by the dev's and they don't listen to the player, they just look at where all the money is. there's no more clear endgame. the refining system is just WAY too expensive.  and all gear that i have has been rendered obsolete each new Mod they add. half the games dungeons have been taken away because they are broken??? they keep adding more Crap yet don't fix the present game. they claim their fixes are to fix all the bots yet every chat system is filled with bots selling in game currency. this game and it's dev's are so Full of it!!!! it disgusts me if this is where the gaming world going too and i think we should ban togther and not allow this kind of filth and greed destroy our gaming world.i look at so many other reviews of people with hundreds of hours logged all saying the same thing. it used to be great, something i didn't mind putting my time and money into. but now.....it's ♥♥♥♥!!!!screw you cryptic, i hope all your games die and you find yourselves in a 3rd world country begging for food!!!

												I started writing a detailed review and just couldn't be botheredIt's a great MMO until you reach level 70 and then you'll realize that this game has no End Game content, No armor set variations, little to no character skill variation, a beyond imbalanced pvp system with a whole 2 types of pvp game and a complete lack of anything to do or work towards.The Strongholds mod was supposed to breath new life into the game but what it ended up doing was giving people a place to go stand around that wasn't the main city.Imagine watching Rocky for the first time except in the final fight Rocky knocks Apollo out with the first punch and we all just sit there for the last 20 minutes watching Rocky wander around the ring looking for something to doThats how this game made me feel. Pretty good at the start and the middle then flopped on it's face when it came to the end.			"

												I started playing this game out of boredom and found quite a few hours to do the starting quests, up to level 60.Since I am no classic MMORPG player, my review is mainly based on my experiences in that game without direct comparison to any of the other billion MMORPGs out there.Lets start with variety:You have to choose a certain race and role on the beginning. Each role has it's own abilities. Depending on what skills you use later on, you can fulfill multiple purposes in each role.The game is quite interesting on start and it's fun to try out new abilities as you level up and get your first horse or companion. At least on start you get the impression of following some sort of storyline, doing several different things. After a while it gets very repetitive since quests quickly change to a pure seek and destroy.Finishing the first ""plot"", you will be sent to the capital city to a certain officer that offers new quests which allow you to visit other places.Most places are fairly nice to look at (depending on your settings) and the level design is pretty interesting in several cases. You get to fight a variety of enemies, a few of which have specilized abilities as you progress into higher levels.Second point would be fighting and the skilling tree:Fighting requires some concentration as strong enemie's attacks are displayed on the ground as a warning. These warnings and some slow mob's attacks are supposed to be dodged by running away or staying out of range.The skill tree offers a variety of different spells and abilities. These are divided into:-""daily powers"", which supposed to be strong spells and need action points to be filled up, likely through fighting.-""free powers"", which are started using the left and right mouse button and can be seen as a variety of basic attacking techniques.-(red powers?) ...are what you would call a spell. Cooldowns, damage values and/or custom effects.In addition, you get a variety of so-called ""talents"" that start with basic ones and advance into specialized talents that would power certains aspects of your normal abilities.Experimenting with these to find your own playstyle is interesting.So much for the major gameplay. Now off to the (many) points why I wouldn't recommend playing this game at it's current stage:My main point would be the lack of originality and heartblood.Everything you get to do has already been there many many times in countless other MMORPGs. After a nice start, the game quickly breaks down into loveless quest design and the further you go, the more confused you get.A constant flood of items without any sort of explanation about the point to it fills the inventory. Every time you figured out what to do with one of those strange new coins you found, the game is telling you to collect another 2 kinds of coins. The sheer amount of different ""currencies"" is nuts, while the majority of these will be outdated by the time you figured out what they are for.Huge areas with different questing points of any kind of importance spread all over make it very hard if not impossible to orientate on which plot you are actually working right now and where you may want to get something special from.The progress after the first levels is very quickly nullified and the game wants you to spend many hours on tiny steps forward. If you want to use the things you find, you are supposed to collect immense amounts of points in certain ""currencies"" the further your level progresses. The game very quickly yells at you ""BUY OUR STUFF OR YOU WON'T GET ANYWHERE"".It may be free to play, but it's very close to ""pay to progress"".As soon as you get to fight in a group, you quickly lose track of what's going on. Insane amounts of special effects from the players, their companions and the minions often make it a lag fest where you see nothing anymore and steer on your cooldowns to use the next spell on the ""blazing-green-red-white-yellow-blue"" part of your screen where you saw a dragon a few minutes ago, hoping he's still there.Going over to the serverside:Terrible server performance and countless bugs make playing a mess quite often. Constantly brought out new content keeps flooding the already messed up system. Reported bugs do not seem to be worked on in time - if at all.Since the content of this game is too huge to break down most things, I tried to keep it at a minimum. There are many more things I didn't like about this game. Unless there are major changes (keyword is major), I cannot recommend playing this game.			"

												They ruined the Dungeons and Dragons franchise when they made a F2P P2W MMO, the game itself is fun untill you come across the glaring gear disparity between those who pay and those who don't.The ability to make up quests and stuff like that gives this game a ton of content much like the earlier Neverwinter games, the pvp is entertaining - hardly balanced but that's neither here nor there, it's still fun but again is ruined by this P2W model. It really is a shame as this game is actually quite playable in terms of functionality controls and having an interesting environment not to mentions the ♥♥♥♥♥on of lore they can draw from.This games worth a playthrough if you're really bored with other MMOs but by no means worth sticking around with the P2W attitude to end game.If they had offered Neverwinter as a once off payment of about $80 with none of the P2W options ingame this would have been great. They even could have charged again for expansions.P2W is honestly the worst thing i've ever seen in online gaming, it completely defeats the purpose of gaming in a competitive environment and Neverwinter 100% subscribes to this model.

												Fine to level 60, as soon as you hit 60 the devs literally hate you. Laziest, grindiest missions ever. Stupid mechanics which mean you can only take 4 missions at a time, when you need 8 to move to the next location. Oh and you need to about 50 of those missions to level up. Prepare for hours of running back and forth going to the same place you just were in order to do the same thing in the same place.TL DR Devs dont give a ♥♥♥♥ about this game, bugged/lazy/grindy missions after level 60.

												I cannot blindly recommend this game without knowing what the potential player is looking for.  The game doesn't appear to be very deep regarding NwN/D&D lore, so if that's what you're looking for I'd think purchasing a copy of Neverwinter Nights or Neverwinter Nights 2 a good idea and seeking out a player run persistent server. If you're looking for a game with a good combat engine, and some pretty fun multiplayer (with friends) then i can see this game being a good fit, especially considering The Foundry and the idea of playing player made content (which i have yet to experience but read its quite good). On the other hand it does seem to be buggy and laggy in high populated areas, and if you're into MMO PvP, stay away.  Just looking at whats in the in-game-store, its quite obvious this game is pay to win.There is also some weird issue with censorship on the Perfect World forums (Chinese policed internet?).All in all, id only recommend if you have some friends to group with, and are not looking for anything to deep or involving.

												This game is not terrible, but it's not very good either. I love Cryptic games, especially the engine in which these games run. Both Champions Online and Star Trek Online are controller compatible. Why was that feature removed from Neverwinter I'll never understand. But let's ignore that for a second, I'm not a D&D fan so the lack of accurate lore other people complain about doesn't affect this review, I'm going to base it off gameplay, fun factor and economy.Let's start with gampley, this is a hybrid action MMO. You can move around and even avoid some attacks by moving but when you attack you're locked in place. Once you get used to that then the gameplay shouldn't be a problem. Except when we go and look at your efficiency in battle. Your level ups grant you attribute points to make the build that best fit your style, OK that's normal. But then we have gear and that's when things get out of control. You have a variety of ways to get the right gear for your build:1. Be on an efficient and active Guild willing to baby sit you while you farm it (good luck with that )2. Farm the currency you need to convert into gear. (I'll talk about the economy in a bit)3. Buy the currency to get the top gear (better known as Pay 2 Win)Which brings us to the economyAstral Diamonds is the top currency. You use it for almost EVERYTHING and you have a daily cap (to refine it) of 24,000 (if I'm not mistaken) Want to level up your mount? OK that's a couple of million astrals per level. Want to level your companion, Another couple of million of astrals. Plenty of things you want to buy you need astrals for, and even to transmute some gear. The entire auction house uses astrals as currency, so that armor that some dude was lucky enough to land on a dungeon run, well you may have to pay close to a million 'cause people aren't selling things for cheap. So that's farming Astral Events (skirmish) which take anything from 5-30 minutes (depending on the team and your level) for 1,000AD each run, Doing daily missions (which can take a very long time as some involve running the same instance multiple times in a row to complete and pretty sure the best one pays only 8,000 AD and that's unlocked at lvl 60) So basically you'll spent most of the day, every day trying to hit the refinement cap so you can get enough astrals to buy ONE piece of gear you want. Yes you can sell your stuff for astrals and those are already refined, but that means you'll have to spend hours farming good enough stuff to sell and hope to god someone has the ""money"" to buy it. Even worse if you want to level your companions, it's just not humanly possible and that's where the game falls apart. It's filled with these gold farmer things, you'll get bombarded through mail about them. It's gotten to the point where they not only have become the only viable option to play this game but that they have gone out of their way to destroy the exchange.You may be asking, what is the exchange? well Perfect World games use a virtual currency known as zen that you can only (mostly as you can do surveys and crap) obtain with real money to buy extra content on their individual stores. The exchange was created so that people with less income, but more free time, could play for astrals so that those with jobs (aka more money and less time to play) could still progress at the same rate by buying those astrals from players. That's a meta game on its own as you can play the market, buy when low and sell when high. The fluctuation usually caused by sales which PW was very keen in having them weekly. That way people would always want zen don't they? That's a bit troublesome but understandable, it is a business. But the problem in this situation is that most players don't like to think, thinking is forbidden in neverwinter, you can't be rational. Players are impulsive, which makes the job of gold farmers a hell of a lot easier. they managed to break the exchange hitting the cap of the most useful currency. What I mean by that is, 1 zen which is the equivalent of 1 cent, can get you (at the moment of this review) 500 astrals. So let's say you want to throw $20 worth of zen at the exchange, you come out with 10 million astrals. So all that effort farming that currency shows nothing for it. It is the currency that gets the game going but ultimately, the players have lowered its value to a point of no return. PW isn't doing its job protecting the game from farmers either, but again I understand it, ultimately they get a piece of the pie. A reduced piece if they throw some numbers, the ones getting the big bucks are the Gold Farming sites/services.How much do you need good armor? A LOT. Level basically means nothing, it's pretty much all in the gear, that's what make you a badass. I can't recommend this game, even with the Foundry which is a really good but gimped system that let's you create your own adventures. (gimped part, you can't have access to all the armor assets when creating NPCs) It's been over a year since I started playing and never felt like uninstalling the game, until now.			"

													Lost in translation between an MMO and the pen and paper source material, Cryptic studios has birthed a tepid monstrosity of classic dungeons and dragons.  In lieu of a glorious celebration of problem solving, fierce combat, and character interactions, we're given a series of adventures so generic that it brings up comparisons to decades prior.  Game mechanics similarly suffer a compromise between core dungeons and dragons concepts from fourth edition, and traditional MMO fair.  While it isn't necessarily terrible, especially for a free game, it doesn't warrant our attention either, and I'm stuck wondering who it appeals to.  	Forgotten Realms beckons adventures to sally forth to the wonderful locales such as Neverwinter, Icewind Dale, and other notable cities to defeat the evil Lich Queen Valindra as she does what all evil characters do; bring about death and destruction.  Story wise, it's so by the numbers that about an hour into it I was just clicking to get my quests.  The game throws so many tropes at you that it defies belief; a person you just met dying while trying to ingratiate himself to you, a fetch quest belaying the importance of resources to soldiers, and so forth.  There was even a quest to save three privates from becoming zombies, and after it was finished I wasn't allowed to save any more, dredging up memories of the infamous dickwolves strip of penny arcade.  These things aren't necessarily bad, as tropes can be used very effectively, but these are just sloppy.  	Continuing in much the same fashion, we're told that opportunists are wreaking havok on the land of Neverwinter, and we're tasked with helping out.  Only, I really didn't want to, because most of the people we're saving are ♥♥♥♥♥.  I understand that conceptually, a MMO demands effort on the behalf of a player to reach rewards like enough money to buy weapons and armor.  When a city is in direct peril, and the fate of shopkeepers ultimately depends on me killing five zombies or collecting three leafs, fleecing me an arm and a leg to get a shield that will increase my odds of survival, or treating me like an a-hole isn't really motivation enough to get on my high horse to defeat the arch bad guy, or save the crown jewel from Nashkel, or even delivering a message to Sargent Whatshisname.  	Clearly, it doesn't take any chances on bucking the formula with the narrative, and largely it plays it safe with the game play as well.  After playing for a couple of hours, I can see that the team took ques from fourth edition, but the concepts don't really apply to an MMO.  Having encounters, daily's, and at wills stressed cooperation with your team and planning for the next encounter in the pen and paper version.  Here it means waiting a bit to mash e or q.  A cheap cop out for an MMO, timing is only a small part of it.  Your life is now preposterously high to compensate for a lack of a traditional AC system.  There aren't many choices to customize your character beyond putting points in different powers to level them up.  Purchasable/findable kits allow players to bypass certain skill blocks like thievery or dungeoneering, and all for the sake of looting, nothing more.  Essentially, it negates the importance of player choice, and emphasizes purchase power.	Perfectly exemplifying the translation from pen and paper to MMO would be the previous Dungeons and Dragons Online.  Where it succeeds, and likewise Neverwinter fails, is letting the player define their character in so many ways.  Not just in play style or character creation, but also letting the character choose how they interact with the NPC's, solve quests, and align themselves with the different factions.  The questing itself was extremely varied, and conjured amazing stories, like a drinking contest with beholders, or a carnival of the undead.  It was an amazing triumph that empowered the player to adventure and discover, not just run between quest giver and questing zone.  Here, there is very little the player has an affect on, which makes it feel soulless.  	I've spent little time with Neverwinter, so I can only hope that it improves beyond the initial image it conveys.  Reading more about the game though, I'm struck with my impression of tedium and depression.  We've all been “the chosen one” who can destroy the great evil and bring peace to the land, but rarely are we impressed enough to continue that adventure to its climax.  Neverwinter is an adventure for a different kind of player, and sadly it isn't the one Dungeons and Dragons traditionally appeals to.  If you're looking for an MMO fix, you can do far worse, and it isn't necessarily a terrible game in its own right.  It is uninspired, and in a market with far better choices, I can't justify spending any more time in the Forgotten Realms.			"

												I really wanted to like this game and put in some time to give the game a chance.  Much like other reviews have stated, you are slapped in the face with so many pay walls.  So, I gave in, bought some Zen and did so because there was a bonus program.  My purchase met the requirements for the bonus.  Or so I thought.  Because I made my purchase on Steam, I was not eligable for the bonus.  However, this was not stated anywhere in game, nor was I warned during the purchase.  I found this out after using their ticket system and experienceing their poor customer service.So, my reasons for not recommending this are:- Too many pay walls.- Bait and switch on the Zen purchases via Steam.- Poor customer service.- Builds are very limited.- Not all that challenging and somewhat boring.

												Recommending this game would be the same as recommending an addictive drug for me.I have spent 1019 hours of my life on this game. Please do not ask me why.  The only great thing about this game is the friendly community. I could have as well spent that time on msn or facebook, chatting with friends. I have seen a 65% of the game content in those hours I have played. But for higher level dungeons, you will need greater enchantments which mean lots of money (appx 160 dollars)oh btw, lets not forget my friends that got banned randomly and gold spammers that never get banned.and your characters that you spent hours suddenly get nefred(nuked) and they dont even show the courtesy of giving you a respec chance unless you buy one for real money.zen market is a nice idea. but of of course, İF you can find anyone willing to sell zen. ever. I have seen the market devoid of any zen for months.so if you don't want to pay a crabby company for doing a sheety job, just hang out on facebook and make some new friends there. do not go and download this game. only play it if you are willing to pay it, or you never see the 100% of the game content.

												The game (content and playability) is ok.  Stress that ""ok"".  Overall I would give it a 5.  However, Perfect World, the company actually running the show is the worst example of a ""use them and throw them away"" MMO company I have ever encountered.  (And I have playyed with many.)  They respect NOTHING about you and could care less about you even AFTER you have paid them money to play their ""FTP"" game.  WARNING: Buy absolutely NOTHING for this game through Steam.  They will lock down your account and severely limit your ability to do ANYTHING in game JUST BECAUSE YOU BOUGHT SOMETHING THROUGH STEAM.  I am not kidding.  Steam really REALLY needs to completely withdraw thier support for this game if Perfect World is going to treat their ""new steam friends"" with utter contempt and litteral utter trash.			"

												The free-to-play model is done fairly badly here as there are too many quality-of-life items that are locked behind a paywall. The game play is hindered by being tied to a console-model which limits how many abilities you have access to. It's not at all apparent what the different choices you're asked to make at level 10+ and 20+ really mean and since it costs money to re-spec, you can't afford to keep trying different specs to learn what the different choices mean.

												It's hard to not recommend a game when you supported it through closed beta. It's fun for awhile but, IMO, the trick to making money in a F2P model is to not constantly force it in the player's face. I wouldn't say it's pay-to-win, and you could enjoy the game without spending a dime if you are ok with three big negatives. 1.) It's not D&D; 2.) It's nowhere close to being an expansion of the Forgotten Realms games; 3.) You will constantly be reminded that you can spend real money. That said, I did enjoy the dungeon-building. (I didn't build one, but I enjoyed playing others' campaigns.) It's worth playing around with for awhile but the revenue model takes away from a lot of the fun.*** EDITI agree with Random Gamer in that Neverwinter is not P2W. This is a case where I really wish that Steam offered a continuum rather than a binary Yes/No range of recommendation options. Of my three complaints, the only one that drove the thumbs-down was the amount of in-game promotion of, even if not necessarily the case, what appeared to be ""driving one to a cash shop"".That said, I admit that this sentiment is based on my experiences immediately into launch. Developers adapt and adopt different strategies for generating the income that they justifiably need and deserve; therefore, my complaint may not be as valid as it was at game launch.A good example of a game that, imo, started out with an excellent model for generating income is GW2. ANet's philosophy was that people would spend if they enjoyed the game....that advertising should be bottom priority way below content. Of course, in that case, one purchases the game...but that isn't going to pay for their ambition to evolve a living world (i.e., monthly new content). While there is a bit more in-game advertising than I think ANet originally planned, I think that their model has been successful in that a rather solid and loyal playerbase continues to puchase novelties and skins that do little, if anything at all, to make the player ""better"".I plan to spend a bit more time in NeverWinter. As said in the OP, I do recommend trying out the game. It's just a pet-peeve of mine (automatic deal-breaker) to have immersion interrupted by marketing. I prefer it when the game promotes services, perks, pets, etc. via the log-in screen, the game's website, and/or e-mail newsletters. Of course, this is also coming from someone who prefers having subscriptions as an option (e.g., EQ2's model).			"

												You definetly should not try this game if you hate pay to win games.I've played this game,before release,before it came to steam.It was the best game of my life,until I hit max level,thats where you are pressured to spend real money.PvP to the best of my knowledge,end game wise:HAS ALWAYS BEEN F***ING PAY TO WIN.To the best of my knowledge the best way to get maximum satisfaction from this game is to DELAY YOUR LEVELING PROGRESS AS MUCH AS YOU CAN.Don't do the questing areas,focus on daily quests for PvP and Foundry.When I was playing this,the leveling areas where both a grind fest and a runing simulator,I dare compare it to ESO(from what I saw on twitch and youtube),but this did not have a way point sistem when I played it.Story wise and time consuming wise,foundry quests are better,and can be replayed anytime(at least that was the case before I quit this pay to win bear trap),compared to the stuff done by PWE and Cryptic.The dungeon quees at low levels were decent in my day,I hope they did not tighten the pay wall since I left to make low level pve pay to win as well.This is the kind of game that I recomend you should play when you're favorite mmo/moba is on maintenance for a whole day.The pay to win aspects were so strong that I had to quit the game,end game pvp is a farse desingend to eat up your whole wallet.The combat of this game is absolutely the best I have exeprienced and it made me want to do pvp in mmo's,that's how good the combat is,it turned me away from being pve focused to a balanced mmo player(I now like both pvp and pve in mmo's,before this I hated pvp because all of the mmo's I played were tab based and seemed both dull and complicated,I was a proper scrub,until Neverwinter my first action combat based mmo),but they took it to far.Everything other people say in their reviews about the economy sistem is true,it has been so since release.To conclude this review,I recomend it for players who have friends to play with in pvp and foundries.I also recomend this for people who are new to mmo's because this game offers you the best and worst of the mmo genre,giving players awareness on what to look out for in their next mmo,market wise.Avoid this if you are a SOLO,EXPERIENCED MMO PLAYER,you might quit this game before you get your first purple item,I sure as hell did.

												A disclaimer - it's a game set in Forgotten Realms universe, but don't expect DnD-like gameplay. Now what should I say about this game...Neverwinter is a MMORPG, and a really good one. I was somewhat off for the first few hours, but the game gets better and better with every hour you spend in it. A disclaimer #2 - if you don't like timegate mechanic and grinding dailies don't read further.Let's start with some pros:+ Setting - I'm definitely a FR lover. You should know that Salvatore helped with writing some of the quests in the game. You will also meet some amazing characters like Bruenor Battlehamer, Drizzt Do'Urden or Minsc&Boo. + Music - wether you're in the heart of Neverwinter, traverse the Underdark or purge the Dread Ring of the undead you'll always be accompanied by really nice tunes. It's an MMO so obviously music does not play THAT BIG of a role, but the tracks playing at the background do not disturb you.+ Character development(bright part) - it's really well made. While power upgrading does not matter much, traits and boons can passively make your character stronger in different ways(for example make your trap also deal damage over time, and even stronger against immune targets)+ Combat - you're basically on the move all the time, combat is dynamic, there is a lot of dodging, blocking and watching out for enemy attacks+ Endgame - that is just my opinion but endgame is great. Dungeons are challenging(unless you get boosted by that 3k+ player), long, bossfights are fun. There is always something to do due to campaigns which not only give great rewards but boost your character stats via boons. Also progress is slow paced but significant enough to see the difference between those two items, 30-40 item levels or that one tier of your artifact. Cons- Hard to earn currency - getting AD as a fresh player is a pain in the ♥♥♥♥. Enough said. - AD to Zen converting ratio - Zen is that ""real money"" currency of NW. And while gathering AD to exchange for Vip(1k Zen - 500k AD) is not that big of an issue, trying to get AD to buy Zen while also managing your characters equipment is. Artifact here, refinement stones there, goodbye 120k AD here. - Outdated graphics - we're in 2017, yet graphics sometimes feel like a 2012 game. It doesn't look bad, it had actually aged quite well, but I think devs should consider making some upgrades here and there. - Character development (sad part) - boons from campaigns are a double edged sword. They greatly increase character capabilities, but good luck getting most of them. Some of them are after huge timegates(ToD, Dread Ring, Underdark) and others are just annoying to start with(Icewind Dale, ♥♥♥♥ you).My final mark would be somewhere around 7 or 8 out of 10. It's definitely a game worth at least trying out.			"

Professios require quite a lot of time (which people with a life don't have). It keeps the player tied to the game.Missions are repetitieve and lack any originality. And soon after the level 30 even weak mobs will be able kill you.PvP is poorly balanced and you will most likely get matched with some overpowered players, who paid for their gear.Overall the game requires a lot of time from the player, oferring very little in exchange.

												(This review deals exclusively with Neverwinter's Dungeon Creator and its community)I sunk dozens of hours (all before Neverwinter was on Steam) into the one redeeming quality of this game: the level editor. It's one of the best I've ever seen and writing, planning, and creating dungeons and quests is an awesome game in itself. I can't say enough in its praise. However, even this element of the game is ruined by the toxic community. Creators band together in level-making mafias to promote and upvote each others' dungeons (without letting on that they all in it together), and God forbid you ever give less than a 4/5 to one their quests--they will downvote your creations in retaliation.That this game's playerbase can take something wonderful like the dungeon creator and infuse with all the nastiness and spite of hardcore PvP left such a bitter taste in my mouth that I've never touched the game again.

												Neverwinter is free-to-play, and we’ll get a bit more into pay-to-win, pay-for-convenience elements later.  The important thing here is players can get right into the game and begin playing without friction.Neverwinter boasts one of the best combat systems in any MMORPG on the market today.  It’s not the bogged down tab-target “sit-and-watch, hit 1 2 3” that the genre grew up with, nor has the pendulum swung all the way toward the oft touted “action-MMORPG”Every class in Neverwinter can solo quite easily, and because the combat is probably the game’s greatest strength, there’s no shortage of fun for those electing solitary confinement.

												Well i spend around 5 hours (now around 30 hours to keep in mind if missed something and NO i didnt miss anything) in this game and i HIGHLY NOT recommend this game. No open world - totally ugly animation - VERY boring UNdynamic combat.I am not even speaking about that u have to use loads of money.For me gameplay is the MAIN atribute, and this game have just terriable and boring to death gameplay. This game is really waste of money and yr time. 0 fun.			"

												36 hours into it and I still haven't unlocked chat, trade, or other features fundamental to an mmorpg. I like the concept and gameplay, but seeing all these other players around me and not being able to interact with them is a serious damper to the gameplay. I can make a party but can't talk to people who might want to join a party with me. Their efforts to stop spambots is so intense it is also stopping people from playing the game.			"

												Initially, I felt actually happy and grateful for the chance to play a nice, decent MMORPG for free. But I've been around the gaming block long enough to see a variety of games and refine my idea of 'fun'. So, this review will particularly make sense to you if we happen to share a similar concept of FUN, applied to MMORPGS in particular. What makes a MMORPG *fun* then? To me, it would be:- An interesting storyline- A good level of customization and a reasonable amount of freedom- Some variety in the gameplay- A good implementation for social features (or at least a good excuse to socialize, because if I had to solo the whole content I'd just go for a single player) - Some PvP aspect (because again, the whole point of being online is to either cooperate with other players or kill em all, or both, basically)- A nice, detailed graphic look (but that's just personal)Thus said, I can't really expect to have it all, especially in a free-to-play title. But let's say that, for fun's sake, I'd be just happy to find at least 3-4 of these features in a mmorpg.How does Neverwinter score then, in the fun board?PROS+ beautiful visuals+ adult/mature aesthetics (no manga fluff nor japcutesy of any sort - counts as a plus to me, lol)+ UI done right: intelligible, intuitive, and graphically pleasant+ fluid combat style+ fluid mouse controls (I did appreciate the 3rd person view paired with the free mouse-look: that should be a standard for any game featuring some PVP)+ voice acting over walls of text, with the option to keep listening to the babble while you're doing something else in-game+ some variety for events here and there (raids, skirmishes, pvp)+ PVP indeed: tricky one, say a mixed bag. Altho it's maybe one of the aspects i enjoyed more about the Neverwinter experience, it's got many issues that never got resolved - like dumb matchmaking, overpowered pay-to-win dynamics, and the very repetitive nature of it (ONE small MAP ONLY for arena and one for RvR - which isn't even technically RvR -see cons)+ the foundry (always nice to look at someone else's creations)+ dungeons and+ dragons+ it's free to play..but well, pretty much, that's it. The whole thing kept me entertained for a total amount of ~1k hours or so, but in all truth, at least 1/3 of that time was me praying (literally) and hoping to see something harder-better-faster-stronger that sadly, though, simply isn't there.CONS- meh storyline (around the 3rd time you get 'the talk' from sgt. Knox, you've stopped caring already)- absolutely useless loot (after hours of quests, all you're left with to fill your baby backpack is a pile of worthless junk and a bunch of pennies - drops which would be actually useful for your class are so rare that you'd be tempted to just hit the shops.. but dem prices!)- way too many currencies, REALLY. I personally lost count of the various local insignia, the sigils, the seals, the ardent, celestial and whatnot coins. Glory? Zen? Black Ice? It's simply overwhelming, and it's probably there to prove your patience and push you to the shops- a shamelessly overpriced Action House and an even worse real-money shop: prices are simply unrealistic. 40$ only on a fancy mount, knowing you have to pay almost as much on bits and bobs like armor pieces or refining material you can't just do without if you wanna enjoy late game at least a little bit. Or even just to reroll abilities and skill points!- ridiculous prices usually lead to one main thing: GRINDFEST. Expect hours (or DAYS, or WEEKS) of joyless plodding through dungeons and minor uninteresting events just to farm enough Astral Diamonds to buy.. a key. - quests and dungeons get boring and repetitive after a while. Let alone the random seasonal events, which appear for a small few days window and induce players to direct the grindfest focus on those, for a slim chance to get mmm, a new pet?- the rigidity of the events calendar. That's even against the basic notion of free-will. You'll get something like a 45' span to do -say- skirmishes, and if you do them in that time-frame you'll get some bonus. Point is that, given the desperate amount of grind, everyone would rather do these activities when it's bonus time - therefore, outside of that time-frame, good luck queueing for dungeons or whatever else. - no real reason to socialize, apart from dungeons: the game is not open world, so you can't just put a group together for some good ol' free roaming. You've got your tiny shiny path to follow - alone. But even skirmishes and dungeons are not the ideal place to make friends: at the end of the day, everyone worries about themselves and the loot, which is a bit sad indeed.- no open world, just instances - I find them a bit limiting and claustrophobic.- crafting? forget about it. just read: GRINDFEST.- PVP, as I said earlier, is something that i really enjoyed in the game, but it's got its problems. You get the chance to take part in a sort of fake-open-world arena later in the game, but no one really plays it and it's not even a proper arena either: you'll just hang out in that specific area, maybe to do some fetch-quest, and will randomly bump into some other player from a different 'faction' who's there doing his own thing. To kill or not to kill? You might as well just ignore each other and finish your own silly quests in peace.- RvR which is not really RvR (my heart still goes to DAOC), it's called 'Gauntlgrym PVP'. Basically a capture-the-flag zergfest where you'll run around a lot, and if the numbers are on your side, you'll simply overwhelm the enemy faction. BUT, prior to getting into one of these matches, in order to be eligible for the queue, you'll have to take part in a series of hectic fetch-quests.TL;DRGive it a go if this is your first MMORPG maybe, just to see what's what. But if you're a more experienced player, looking for something new&challenging, you might get bored soon.			"

												Always on the lookout for a great F2P game, and this one sure stands up. Yeah there are the WoW-geeks and stat-trads that like to gear score themselves out of any fun in MMRPG universe, but there is something for everyone here - especially D&D fans. Take the time to explore and appreciate the level designs, you will not regret it. Itis regularly updated for content and has its share of seasonal events and goodies. There is relatively little frustration with levelling (not really sure why power-levelling scabs / Astral gem / gold farming hax even bother, but even the laziest of lazy like to play games too I suppose). Levels can mostly be done solo or with a companion, but in the tradition of D&D, try to form a party or get your friends to play with you - way more fun! Overall very fun, gorgeous graphics and within the spirit of the venerable game.			"

												The game is actually good. I spent more than 4000 hours on it since its release. However, Neverwinter is not only p2w but also operated by a chinese company, which is really awful. This game may be free to play but in fact, it is by far more expensive than any other game in the market. You absolutely cannot get BIS without money or exploits. I played since beta, spent a decent amount of money, and I am still far from being BIS. At the current state, I will never reach BIS because I can't generate enough in-game currency by legal means. The game is also extremely grindy. You have to grind forever make even the smallest changes to your character which makes it really hard for new players to actually become competitive. By the way, if you decide to pay to win through the in-game store, be aware that it may cost thousands of dollars to get decent.The company behind the game is also infamous for its bait-n-switch practices. They promise things on the forums, then break their promises a couple of months later without any consideration for their player base. Please understand this. You do not have active GM's online, bugs rarely get fixed, and there is no transparency in how the devs do business. One of the game's main feature which is the ""Foundry"" gets disabled all the time, and it is currently unavailable to players. It has been down for nearly two months and devs do not even bother to explain why or when they plan to get it back on. In other words, bad customer service, bad dev team, bad business model, and lazy and rushed content,Players have absolutely no voice and censorship is extremely common in the forums. I have posted many times in response to the issues that negatively affect the game just to get my posts removed. The forum moderators lack preparation and it is not uncommon for some staff members to indirectly insult and mock players in response to their lack of satisfaction with the game. I loved Neverwinter since its pre-release. It is a game full of potential with amazing mechanics and possiblities of infinite content through the Foundry. I still play the game but I do not advise anyone to spend money in it. The money you spend is a waste as the economy is volatile and extremely unstable. If you are looking for a game to play for a while that will be fun and rewarding, then NW is not for you. However, if you are looking to just waste time playing a D&D themed game, then go ahead.

												I don't know if i can say it's worth any real money to put into it. It is a breath of fresh air in game mechanics for MMORPG's but I dont know if it's enough to gain all the time you need to invest to get anything done. The crafting system is the most annoying system I have ever come across in an MMORPG. I found myself just ignoring or avoiding it all cost. Unless your a true fan of MMORPG's or roleplaying fan don't bother. But if you do like to role play it has a good system for getting you and others into your toon.			"

												First of all: The Reviewfeature needs an ""undecided"" Option and not just ""yes"" or ""no"".Second of all: Do not expect a D&D experience from this game. D&D-Campaigns usually do not throw dozens of Dragons, Pitfiends and stuff like that on you while everyone rides around on Drakes, Unicorns and other mystical beeings while saving the world three times per day.As a hint: My character witnessed four dragon deaths before level 40 of 60 and killed nearly an army of devils by himself. This kills the atmosphere outright.Also the Dungeons are just ... bad. You basically always run through a corridor and kill hundreds of Monsters. No scripts, no story, no dungeon master, nothing. Just killing monsters. And even those monsters are usually boring pushovers withhout any interesting mechanics at all while the bosses are just versions of the normal monsters with a lot more hitpoints.Cryptic developed already two MMOGs before this one and one might think, they know by now how to create interesting Dungeons. Well, they do not. The Champions-Online Dungeons are actually more fun than the Neverwinter ones.Nontheless, this game is still fun, if you do not expect a great Multiplayer D&D dungeon delving game. Go for Dungeons & Dragons Online, Neverwinter 1 & 2 or the Infinity Engine Games like Baldurs Gate, if you want a ""real"" Videogame-D&D-Experience.Though, if you are looking for a good and simple Action-MMOG in a generic fantasy setting go ahead and give it a try, it is not as bad as it sound and it is free after all. There are a lot more bad representatives of the genere out there.Fazit: Too much Dragon, too less Dungeon.PS: Do not expect a fair monetarization in this game. You can theoretically get everything for free, but this will require years of playing like eight hours daily, while you get direct and indirect advertising efforts thrown at you all the time. Sadly Cryptic is also not offering some sort of subscription this time.			"

												This game is just a mess.It's F2P, but it's impossible to play without constantly being reminded of the expensive in-game purchases. Early on I found myself getting some rare drops from the monsters, which all ended up being chests that I can open with a key I can buy for actual money to get a chance at getting rare gear.The areas early on are bland. They are very, very generic fantasy castle zones colored in different shades of grey and brown. The game hasn't kept me entertained long enough to actually get further.The quests are boring. Nearly all of them are ""go to generic npc, kill mobs/do a dungeon, kill a guy."" Haven't had much fun with the quest descriptions either.The interface and menus are confusing and weird too. Now, this is entirely personal, but the game ran pretty ♥♥♥♥♥ily on my PC too, even when my specs are better than the recommended specs. No matter how low I set my graphics, it stuttered a lot, so I won't recommend it to players with low end pcs.The one thing I did like was the combat system. It wasn't just right-click and button spam, it was pretty dynamic, although mechanics were still very simple, and it got boring rather fast, especially since there's only a few abilities you can use.It looked very promising, but due to it's multiple issues it turned out really disappointing. I didn't even mention the DLC that adds up to, I think, about 400$ dollars. Most of the dlc content is stuff most MMO devs would throw in a free update, or just take a bunch of them and add them in an expansion pack. I mean, there's a DLC for 70 euro which gives you access to a new race, some items and I'm guessing maybe a few zones. You can buy WoW with all of it's expansion packs before Warlords + a month or 2 of gametime if you look hard enough.To sum it up: Neverwinter is a very generic fantasy MMO mess filled to the brim with additional purchases(most of which are terrible deals).

												just an other shameless cashin from Cryptic and Perfect World. speaking as a D&D player and GM of over 13 years, the only thing about this game that even remotely touches D&D by any stretch of the imagination is the paint job. the combat is lazy, the story is fine. in summery: all form, little substance. go play the dragonage origins, tabletop D&D or DDO and you'll have a much better D&D experience. i certainly expected better from these guys... it might as well be copy-paste from Champions Online and Star Trek Online.

												I haven't played this game for too long, but what i saw did not impress me. Let me point out why it didn't.1. Graphics: I don't have that good of a computer, which sucks. With newer mmorpgs, i have to turn it to low to avoid lag. In this, not only was it horrible looking on low, it lagged quite a bit. AA looked and ran better. So in short, the graphics are dependent on your pc. For me, they were horrible, with heavily pixilated details when they appeared.2. Gameplay: Now, this is the main reason I played the game for more than an hour. You have a smaller hotbar of skills, making you think about what skills you will pick. I played the Guardian guy, and the combat was solid. It was similar to Tera in you don't just click and target, you do each slash individually. And if you play the class I did, you can actually block with your shield, which is small byt refreshing. You also have this ultimate skill which is pretty cool. Overall, ifound the combat fun. A little easy, and it can become repetitive, but fun.3. Community: The small interaction I had with others was not positive. I asked for help finding a rare item, and was told to screw off. When I did a little dungeon thing, people expected me to know exactly where things would pop up because they had been grinding it. It also has the ""greed/Need"" thing, which i didn't get AT ALL. Most of the time I do, but there was no explanation of it. So I asked and was given many rude comments. The DDO people were nicer, and on the server I played on I met maybe 10 people. It may have been dead, but it was way better.4. Misc. Stuff: The H.U.D. confused me. It looked like those free to play things where there is a small area to see, your hotbar and meters, then a whole crap-ton of shops and things. I didn't play long enough to see if it was pay to win. I tend to be strictly PVE, so i can't say anything about pvp. Also, the world felt... closed off. Smaller and less open than other mmos. It also doesn't have tutorials where they are needed most of the time.Overall: I'm not reccomending it. I've played three different editions of D&D, and I can say if you want to RP or have a D&D-like game, this probably isn't for you. Dungeons and Dragons Online was much better, even though the combat was slow and the game was dead. If they had just redone DDO but overhauled the combat, I would have loved this. But they didn't, and instead made this. I see potential if they changed a few things: Make it less cluttered, add more tutorials and change the graphics a bit, just to name three that would make me consider coming back.			"

												This was the game that finally convinced me to close my account across all of Perfect World Entertainment's games. Firstly,  as a compulsive RPG hoarder, you start of with a very spartan amount of storage space for the many items you'll pick up and sell along the way. Half of the time I was playing, it was staring at the screen when it was telling me that my inventory was full. You'll get another bag at later levels, but it only provides around 12 spaces of inventory. I thought, ""Hey, that's no problem. Maybe I can start crafting my own bags!"" Nope. You get what you get, unless you want to pay real money. It also has some very imbalanced-feeling PvP, where you're steamrolling one team and getting destroyed by the next. Nearly everything in the game has its natural progression blocked to a dead stop until you a. find some way to farm the correct currency or b. pay up. I would like to support companies that make good content and give me very good reason to pay for premium features, but when the first thing you see is advertisements for ingame stuff that you would end up paying real money for, and a distractingly shiny ""pay me!"" logo in the interface itself, that's where I have to draw the line.

												The game started out great, but exploits surfacing every few months makes the game very unfair when it comes to PvP. A new player will have to spend several thousand dollars just to compete, and even then the class-balance and patches are horrible for the most part. If you want to try it for the story and gameplay go ahead, but I suggest you stop playing after you have hit max level because from there on it is all a cash-grab where you either exploit or pay to stay competitive.

A lot to discover and try, so a lot of fun.After a while I found I was stuck, or the progress was slowing down a lot, and the main cause was clear: unless spending real money I could never have enough to keep progressing. Ok, that may be fair, but by spending money in this game I mean A LOT OF money. Everything is crazy expensive and you gotta have in mind that if you spend a lot of effort, time and money creating a char, your class will probably be nerfed to useless so you'll lose it all without warning. That's how they make money here. It's pay to win, it's expensive and they will kill your char so you need to play and spend over and over again.When I was geared enough to try the content to better geared chars, the game turned into a complete mess. We have, for example, Valindra's Tower, Malabog's Castle and Epic Lair of Lostmauth. You need to wait in a queue to get in any of those. Sometimes you wait for 30 minutes, 40 minutes, or even more. And when you can go in, lag lag lag. By lag, I really really mean it. You start to rubberband a lot, timewarp a lot, key commands take 1 to 2 seconds to work. I listed Valindra's Tower, Malabog's Castle and Epic Lair of Lostmauth. After maybe two months doing quests while waiting to enter these, the first two were absolutely unplayable with most players simply leaving due to the lag. I coundn't finish the first two due to that. The Epic Lair of Lostmauth I finished only once, and when I did, the prize, a chest for you to open and pick your rewards was bugged and I couldn't take anything. So I tried again and again over and over (I really needed the armor and due to the lag I could't foresee any other chance to get it), maybe 20 tries or more, and finally it worked. I recorded a video showing this.Well, after playing for a while and playing A LOT everyday, I ended only logging in to do some daily quests to advance in the campaigns. My chars are stuck because I'm not putting any money on this game because it feels like they may change important things anytime; because I can't play very important parts of the game, the most difficult and rewarding ones, due to lag and bugs; because paying is the only way to succed here. And you need to spend a lot.Note that I don't even mention PVP. PVP in this game is the most stupid thing I ever seen.EDIT: I forgot to say that my first char was abandoned because it was a god until lvl60 but after that turned into suffering and frustration, dying all the time to anything that moves. I kept playing with it until after the lvl70 (and two or three excess lvls so I have many skills maxed out) but the char kept dying over and over again, too weak for anything. I tried different gear, different combination of stats, maxing defense, maxing deflection, maxing power, arpen, crit, making it balanced, nothing worked. Then I read the class was intentionally nerfed. Should have researched first.Then I created the OP and even before the lvl70, when I was like lvl67, I was destroying everything the first char couldn't even face. The difference is HUGE. I can leave this char afk in the same places where the first char can't even walk in alone. This game is unbalanced like hell.			"

												The game started out great, but exploits surfacing every few months makes the game very unfair when it comes to PvP. A new player will have to spend several thousand dollars just to compete, and even then the class-balance and patches are horrible for the most part. If you want to try it for the story and gameplay go ahead, but I suggest you stop playing after you have hit max level because from there on it is all a cash-grab where you either exploit or pay to stay competitive.

												This would be a very nice game if it wasn't full of bugs, most of them very frustrating. Example: you finish a dungeon or skirmish and you can't get the reward chest because you are still in combat with some glitching add that you just can't see. I played a lot of MMORPGs and RPGs and had my share of bugs with each of them, but when it occurs as often as in Neverwinter, it makes you feel sorry about all the time wasted playing the game. I never met a game so bugged as this one and I understand this problem has been going on for years now. I never got an answer to the issues I made notices for from no GM, even after weeks after I posted them.Conclusion? Although I understand it's a free-to-play game, the developer shows no respect to players however, therefore maybe they shouldn't be in the business after all.Too bad, this game could really have potential.

												I wish I could post a neutral review of this game.  It was very fun to start, all the way until level cap.  At which point, the pay to win started to show itself.  Unfortunately, it is impossible to have adequate gear to do ANYTHING but dailies (yawn) when you initially hit level cap.  I spent $100 on zen, converted it to ED, bought all the best gear I could on the AH at level cap.  And I still had a GS of only 12K.  That is completely unacceptable.  Not to mention how long it would have taken had I simply played enough to get that gear. Fun until level cap, then worst game ever.  Then prepare to cry when every group you join for dungeons falls apart by the first group of mobs.  Every group of pvp has some twinked out rogues who have perma invisibilty and attack and then run off like pansies.  Only to do this repeatedly until you are murdered, without even touching them.

												First of all this game existed for more then year before it came to steam so arguments about not playing long enough that so many people are saying to everyone that don't recommend this game are not valid.This game allow selling endgame gear on real money auction house. Everything on Auction house is payed by Astral diamonds and Astral diamonds are farmed endlesly or bought by Zen and Zen are bought by real money....Does this selling endgame gear for real money reminds you something? I am sure it does..You want to be good in PVP or PVE? Go to Auction house and buy what you need or become mindless farming zombie...or stick to basic gear without any hight upgrades like runes +9 and accept that you will never be good as those that who pay.This is how this game works in short.

												For being HEINOUSLY repetative and grindy, as well as rediculous price-scaling in Astral Diamons to Zen? This game keeps sucking me back in. The development cycle is relatively fast-paced, the PayWall is not THAT bad. The inclusion of a browser-based mini-game is innovative and fun. But for all the treasures you find, I find that the zone events tend to keep you in a sense of urgency- that COMPLETELY removes you from the story and mission path of that zone. Keep trying, PWI.

												My main complaint with this game is how simple the combat is. You have an 3 abilities on cooldowns bound to Q,E,R,  two ""daily"" abilities which you can use after attacking enough enemies, an artifact which may or may not be combat related and has a long cooldown, and then two normal attacks you use whenever by clicking left or right mouse. I'm not asking for something like WoW where abilities cloud up the bottom of your screen, but having access to 7 or 8 skills at a time gets real samey, and no encounter really differentiates itself as a result. There's a pattern to every fight I'm in, and it is Q, R, right mouse, then left mouse until I can use Q or R again, using a daily if there's a particularly tough enemy, and E if I need to heal me or my companion. I could spice things up and use R first instead of Q, but that ultimately doesn't change anything. At first this game sucked me in, and I loved the world, the music, the questing, all of it, but the combat was  too dull for me to continue playing (at least without friends, but practically every game is fun with friends.)

												I liked the game at first, it was really fun to play the character designs and the graphics are amazing; the scenery is beautiful and unique. However, the fact that it is more pay-to-win is a major disappointment. I don't mind paying for little things like the special companions and things like that, but when you have to pay $30 to $50 for just a horse it gets ridiculous. When you get higher up in the game you realize quickly that if you want anything you have to fork over money to get it. I am a level 39 right now and I'm pretty much hit a point where I have to pay for almost everything.Not to mention the disconnection from the servers, in one day I got disconnected at least ten times before I gave up. Lag is to be understandable there are a lot of people on the servers so that was to be expected.If you are willing to spend your money on the BS then you'll like the game but if you are not willing to pay you will not get far into the game. And that is a real shame because it would have been an almost perfect game.			"

												Game by Cryptic and Perfect World. It's an interesting game with a lot of intensive roleplay options, along with even more interesting monsters to kill and some interesting dialog to be read.I got to level 60, but prior was already analyzing what the game really was about in terms of trade, chat, PvE/P content activity, etc. What I was looking for exactly is:Is there an LG? (Level Gap - Means there's an area where you will run into less then 5 players.)Is it open world?Do people take up on self made content? (Professions, LFW [Looking for Work], roleplay, guilds/clans, etc.)PvP and it's aspects. (Is there a way to lone wolf and how can you conqueror at it.)PvE and aspects. (Are quests dragging on, npc voice acting, npcs and pathing + activity)How is the auction house? (Is it controlled by a select guild[s] or people, what is sold, LG?)Can I avoid the Item Mall?While Neverwinter is a pretty beautiful looking game there's no doubt, but it's locked a set FoV to make sure you think that. No, there is not a zoom in/out option so you have to type in a command to actually change your FoV. Worst of all is in the game you will see a lot of failed rendering and getting close to textures even on the maxed out settings...Shamefully blurry. Looks gorgeous at a distance, one they LOCKED down to make sure of that. If it's not failed rendering, it's bad glitches..From getting stuck in walls, not being able to use the /killme (/stuck) command to simply watching npcs run right through objects and hit you from triple the distance you can hit them at. By no means am I a PvP all star, it's not my forte. Am I bad, not really, it's just something I see constantly being destroyed and generic. Neverwinter is no exception somberly. While the modes for PvP are extremely generic like Domination, the actual combat is much more interesting untill you realize the other team is in full PvP gear, and you're not. The difference amount in such is staggering. I have and never will believe in PvP power and resilience gear, it's stupid, unfair and incredibly hindering for new PvPers. Pathetically to say, this game can claim skill as much as it wants you will not be able to kill a person in full PvP gear even if it was 1 vs 10. That's how different PvP gear is to PvE.As for PvE, it's just unfulfilling in my eyes. There was this level 18 - 22 zone I was in, and it gave me an option like Diablo and FPS Bots; Easy, Medium, Hard, Elite. I picked Elite because it sounded like fun, and for me to be fighting Battle-tested Orcs, Fire Wizard Orcs both elites, and giant Ogres plus the 10-15 normal archers and melee mobs...Happy is an understatement. I had to use skill to kill off the multiple Ogres and Elites and it was just too much entertainment. Pathetically, this isn't an option for every zone you enter. Frankly if there's no challenge, why play? I've played MMOs for over a decade, it's a reality for me, maybe not others.Now let's go back to my list, and don't worry this is much shorter and sweet.Questions & Answers:Is there an LG? (Level Gap - Means there's an area where you will run into less then 5 players.)>There's not much a level gap, 60s seem to be more then willing to help you out if they're not busy and you'll notice the dungeons really aren't hard at all. In fact they're very easy so long as you kill the major ones that can spawn mobs and heal.Is it open world?>It's not open world. It's battlezoned with one and only one major city. Which is f***ing pathetic in my eyes.Do people take up on self made content? (Professions, LFW [Looking for Work], roleplay, guilds/clans, etc.)>I can't be too sure yet if people really go into professions, I've yet to see weapons or armor for sale. No one is ever LFWing, as for roleplay, good luck. Doesn't exist at all from what I've seen. As for guilds, I'm not sure if anyone is even ever recruitting but that could just because the gold seller bots never stop. I mean never. You block one and two pop up within two minutes. This isn't a joke I've f***ing timed it. Two hours straight. They never missed a second. What worries me is I'd see a lot of legit names that players would have like ""GrimReaper"" etc. and it makes me wonder if account hacking is a problem!PvP and it's aspects. (Is there a way to lone wolf and how can you conqueror at it.)>Yeah, you can lone wolf it pretty easily. ""Skill"" + PvP gear... = 1 v 5 me bro lol u nub ded..... /♥♥♥♥INGSIGHPvE and aspects. (Are quests dragging on, npc voice acting, npcs and pathing + activity)>PvE has nothing special, some voice acting is good and the rest is to be questioned of drug use. Quests though are ridiculous and drag on as though to say ""We couldn't think of anything else."" I'd rather go kill x mobs and get y and z items then deal with a single quest that gives 2,000 exp and drags on for 5 hours. Not to mention you'll get voice acting in some NPCs, then suddenly it's gone. F*** off. What's worse is the Epic Dungeons are nothing more then the same dungeons you went through from 1-59 but now the mobs are level 60+. There is litteraly no other change.How is the auction house? (Is it controlled by a select guild[s] or people, what is sold, LG?)>Auction house seems...dead? There's items there for people at and under level 60 and even 20..But nothing good at all. Yet I've seen level 20-30s walking around in nearly full epics. I've never seen an epic yet and I've done nothing but grind quests and dungeons. I really don't know, at least not for levels lower then 60.Can I avoid the Item Mall?>No. Impossible. Unless you only want ever 2 level 60 characters, you will end up buying items from the Zen market. This is a 100% guarantee, and even if you think it isn't, this is a Zen market game in other words you can exchange an ingame currency (Astral Diamons [AD]) for Zen. And you will do it. I promise you, and with how expensive level 60 gear is in AD, it's a lot better for you to just buy Zen then it is to farm AD. That's your choice.For those wondering, no end game gear as far as I can tell is not ahrd to get at all. I have two days played now on my Trickster Rogue, I'm already worked into Tier 2 Epics with a gear score of 10,000 (About half the assumed max.) People take the pay-to-win route a lot and you will see it heavily, but you can make it without. It's just not as easy, and very, very annoying.Do I like this game? No. Would I recommend it? No..It's too easy to level in and too generic. Nothing stands out at all, even their target and combat system has been done and much better.			"

												I'll keep this short, since all I really wanted to do is drop off a thumbs down.Pretty  much everything that people say about mod 6 is true. The grindfest for the endgame is already unbearable if you are an old-timer (like me) with 10 characters as profession farms. If you just started the game you will rue the day you hit lvl 65-70, unless you have a few hundred $$ to spare on this game.Prior to endgame the content is actually still fun, (as long as you avoid pvp), especially if you level through foundry quests. Don't get serious with this game until they fix the mess of mod 6 though.Edit: Ever since cryptic changed the AD economy things have gotten a wee bit better, if you are a casual player. The grindfest that is level 68 however still remains, and the refining systems to upgrade your gear is so painfully slow and expensive that you can spend more than half a year on one character's minute upgrades, while you repeat the same dungeons and daily quests, day after day.

												Firstly, I must state that I haven't paid any money for this game so I can't comment on pay-to-win problems.- Anyway, this game had a good atmosphere and a well written story. It wasn't surprising, considering it was based on Forgotten Realms.- But it also had -still has- a very active combat system, unless like a lot of MMOs with static ones.- Leveling up was pretty fun, too. ""Not grinding"" was the main reason for this, you always changed maps and quests and moved forward. It was very fun.These three properties made Neverwinter special in my opinion. But Elemental Evil changed two of these for the worse, much worse.Compared to the first 60 levels, it's story is really poorly written. It's like they didn't even bother to delve into massive sea of lore that is Forgotten Realms, but instead they made bad guys suddenly just pop up and attack us. That's it, there's nothing more to than that (except for an old friend, well technically two). No satisfying explanation, diologue or anything, they just attack and we just kill.Also, I was very confused and upset to see Neverwinter using the grinding system, especially in a game that was never meant to be that way. Using the same old maps, and very boring, not diverse quest types made it worse.Two of the most important things that made Neverwinter different from other MMOs were anti-grinding and story. And they somehow managed to ruin this.			"

												I purchased this thinking that Dragon Born would have the option to select Bahamut as a diety and that there would be some unique dialogue and/or content associated with the various Dragon Born NPCs around the Faerun world.  I was, sorely, disappointed.  All of the Dragon Born NPCs treat you as if you are just another adventurer instead of one of their own.  Cryptic was lazy and did not create any helmet art other than the 2 pieces that come in the pack.  One is for a ceremonial fashion set and the other simple overlapping plates on the head.  The 'toon' looks ridiculous on a horse, so if you are one those who wants your character to look cool, you will have to buy (with real money) a larger mount.  To get the Metalic Dragon skins, you will have to gamble your way thru lockboxes, that are only available for Astral Diamonds, and buy however many keys (about $1.25 each) it takes to get it.The other content is okay.  The bag helps to keep from having to find a vendor all the time, The Heart of the Red dragon artifact helps at low levels and the ring is okay.  The rest of it is just fluff.  You can't even use the overloads until you reach 60th level and then only in special sets of armor you have to grind your way to get.Not worth $75.  Not even worth the $60 I paid for it while it was on sale.  If you just have to have the dragon born race, spend the $25 to get a race reroll token (less if you get an in-game coupon for 15% off any zen market item).  The race reroll token can be use, after creating a regular character, to reroll it as a dragon born.			"

												Firstly, I must state that I haven't paid any money for this game so I can't comment on pay-to-win problems.- Anyway, this game had a good atmosphere and a well written story. It wasn't surprising, considering it was based on Forgotten Realms.- But it also had -still has- a very active combat system, unless like a lot of MMOs with static ones.- Leveling up was pretty fun, too. ""Not grinding"" was the main reason for this, you always changed maps and quests and moved forward. It was very fun.These three properties made Neverwinter special in my opinion. But Elemental Evil changed two of these for the worse, much worse.Compared to the first 60 levels, it's story is really poorly written. It's like they didn't even bother to delve into massive sea of lore that is Forgotten Realms, but instead they made bad guys suddenly just pop up and attack us. That's it, there's nothing more to than that (except for an old friend, well technically two). No satisfying explanation, diologue or anything, they just attack and we just kill.Also, I was very confused and upset to see Neverwinter using the grinding system, especially in a game that was never meant to be that way. Using the same old maps, and very boring, not diverse quest types made it worse.Two of the most important things that made Neverwinter different from other MMOs were anti-grinding and story. And they somehow managed to ruin this.			"

												I loved the style of the game, I loved how there isn't a mana pool, I've only played one class which was the mage and I didn't reach end-game but I played a decent amount of the content, it's all very standard of an mmorpg and pretty nice stuff, interface can be a little confusing at the start (for example it took me a while to find out how to queue up for dungeons and stuff) but unfortunately as other people have said it is definitely pay2win and they constantly try to encourage you to buy things with real money by making every single mob have a pretty high chance of dropping these boxes, which they tease you with by showing you the epic loot inside, and they can only be unlocked with keys that as far as I'm aware can only be bought with an ingame currency called Zen which you can either buy or buy from other players with other ingame currency called Astral Diamonds which you can only get a certain amount of each day, I suppose this in essence stops ""gold farming"" situations however the economy is so skewed that grinding for the Zen Market items is unrealistic so you're practically forced into spending money, similarly to the boxes you're constantly given discount coupons which once again tempt you into spending money, you can't do anything else with them and dropping them brings up a warning like you're about to throw away the offer of a lifetime. The profession system from what I saw of it seemed intriguing although I never got into it deep enough to discover it's practicality, the unique thing about it is you're not locked into one or two professions but can train all of them to max level, however you're restricted, to level a profession you have to do ""tasks"" tasks are simple; have the required items, wait a set amount of time, receive reward, you can start the tasks anywhere and continue doing other stuff, however, at the start you're only allowed 1 task slot and professions seem to level painfully slow, additional slots can be unlocked once certain requirements are met but these requirements are clearly end-game level stuff and realistically it's still probably more beneficial to level up 1 profession first which will unlock you additional task slots, the game seems very grind intensive which I suppose can be expected in this day and age and I've heard some stories about the developers and tech support not being particularly caring towards their community, because of this and the fact that I feel they're just out to get your money I can't recommend this game completely, consider this a half recommendation, I suggest you download it and play it with a couple friends but don't invest too much of your time in it and don't invest any of your money in it, basically play it to check it out, especially if you've played other Neverwinter games because I felt like the combat mechanics were quite satisfying to start off with although the novelty wore off and the graphics are nice, a bit WoW-esque but I like that style.

												Don't get me wrong, there are things about this game which are really quite excellent.  I really like the crafting system, and the companions.  The best part by far is the Neverwinter Gateway - a website you can log into to run new crafting missions, and play a dice game which is actually kinda fun to level your companions, earn rewards, etc...Aside from that though, the combat is a little boring, you have access to numerous skills, but can only ever have a few of them que'ed as active.  The zones are relatively small and linear, limiting your options and forcing you to play the way the devs want you to play.And as you have read in numerous other reviews, this isn't really a free-to-play game, if you want to enjoy it (and have all the best toys) you have to spend money, lots of it.It should be noted I didn't stick around for the end game, it just wasn't that interesting to make me think it was worth the time.

												The game looks nice, the combat is very fun and engaging.  It's definitely a different take on MMO combat compared to other games I've played.  The character builds seem to have variety and depth, but I can't say for certain as I'm not max level.Unfortunately, that's where the good stops.The game is garbage.  You get nickel and dimed every two minutes.  If you want to succeed in the game you have to participate in the worst MMO activity ever invented - dailies.  Alternatively, cash shop.Beyond that, the rest of the game sucks as well.  It's extremely linear.  It is not open world.  There are ? and !'s above people's heads.  The group combat is faceroll.  Literally.  Play a healer, go to dungeon, roll face on keyboard.  Bet no one dies and nobody even notices that you didn't do anything.  The quests are boring and your actions do not affect the world in anyway.  There is no PvP outside of instances as far as I can tell.  The game is literally 95% PvE, even moreso than WoW.The game would be far better if it was subscription base not f2p.  Unfortunately, beyond the combat mechanics, the rest of the game sucks so I wouldn't subscribe anyways.			"

Devs are forcing people to spend money on higher lvl to progress properly...since you lack of diamonds which would take you like forever to farm. From lvl 60 to 70 you grind repeatable dailys...over and over and over again. This is a mess since I thought I found my new favorite MMORPG since the leveling was so fun!

												The game is actually good. I spent more than 4000 hours on it since its release. However, Neverwinter is not only p2w but also operated by a chinese company, which is really awful. This game may be free to play but in fact, it is by far more expensive than any other game in the market. You absolutely cannot get BIS without money or exploits. I played since beta, spent a decent amount of money, and I am still far from being BIS. At the current state, I will never reach BIS because I can't generate enough in-game currency by legal means. The game is also extremely grindy. You have to grind forever make even the smallest changes to your character which makes it really hard for new players to actually become competitive. By the way, if you decide to pay to win through the in-game store, be aware that it may cost thousands of dollars to get decent.The company behind the game is also infamous for its bait-n-switch practices. They promise things on the forums, then break their promises a couple of months later without any consideration for their player base. Please understand this. You do not have active GM's online, bugs rarely get fixed, and there is no transparency in how the devs do business. One of the game's main feature which is the ""Foundry"" gets disabled all the time, and it is currently unavailable to players. It has been down for nearly two months and devs do not even bother to explain why or when they plan to get it back on. In other words, bad customer service, bad dev team, bad business model, and lazy and rushed content,Players have absolutely no voice and censorship is extremely common in the forums. I have posted many times in response to the issues that negatively affect the game just to get my posts removed. The forum moderators lack preparation and it is not uncommon for some staff members to indirectly insult and mock players in response to their lack of satisfaction with the game. I loved Neverwinter since its pre-release. It is a game full of potential with amazing mechanics and possiblities of infinite content through the Foundry. I still play the game but I do not advise anyone to spend money in it. The money you spend is a waste as the economy is volatile and extremely unstable. If you are looking for a game to play for a while that will be fun and rewarding, then NW is not for you. However, if you are looking to just waste time playing a D&D themed game, then go ahead.

												Initially, I felt actually happy and grateful for the chance to play a nice, decent MMORPG for free. But I've been around the gaming block long enough to see a variety of games and refine my idea of 'fun'. So, this review will particularly make sense to you if we happen to share a similar concept of FUN, applied to MMORPGS in particular. What makes a MMORPG *fun* then? To me, it would be:- An interesting storyline- A good level of customization and a reasonable amount of freedom- Some variety in the gameplay- A good implementation for social features (or at least a good excuse to socialize, because if I had to solo the whole content I'd just go for a single player) - Some PvP aspect (because again, the whole point of being online is to either cooperate with other players or kill em all, or both, basically)- A nice, detailed graphic look (but that's just personal)Thus said, I can't really expect to have it all, especially in a free-to-play title. But let's say that, for fun's sake, I'd be just happy to find at least 3-4 of these features in a mmorpg.How does Neverwinter score then, in the fun board?PROS+ beautiful visuals+ adult/mature aesthetics (no manga fluff nor japcutesy of any sort - counts as a plus to me, lol)+ UI done right: intelligible, intuitive, and graphically pleasant+ fluid combat style+ fluid mouse controls (I did appreciate the 3rd person view paired with the free mouse-look: that should be a standard for any game featuring some PVP)+ voice acting over walls of text, with the option to keep listening to the babble while you're doing something else in-game+ some variety for events here and there (raids, skirmishes, pvp)+ PVP indeed: tricky one, say a mixed bag. Altho it's maybe one of the aspects i enjoyed more about the Neverwinter experience, it's got many issues that never got resolved - like dumb matchmaking, overpowered pay-to-win dynamics, and the very repetitive nature of it (ONE small MAP ONLY for arena and one for RvR - which isn't even technically RvR -see cons)+ the foundry (always nice to look at someone else's creations)+ dungeons and+ dragons+ it's free to play..but well, pretty much, that's it. The whole thing kept me entertained for a total amount of ~1k hours or so, but in all truth, at least 1/3 of that time was me praying (literally) and hoping to see something harder-better-faster-stronger that sadly, though, simply isn't there.CONS- meh storyline (around the 3rd time you get 'the talk' from sgt. Knox, you've stopped caring already)- absolutely useless loot (after hours of quests, all you're left with to fill your baby backpack is a pile of worthless junk and a bunch of pennies - drops which would be actually useful for your class are so rare that you'd be tempted to just hit the shops.. but dem prices!)- way too many currencies, REALLY. I personally lost count of the various local insignia, the sigils, the seals, the ardent, celestial and whatnot coins. Glory? Zen? Black Ice? It's simply overwhelming, and it's probably there to prove your patience and push you to the shops- a shamelessly overpriced Action House and an even worse real-money shop: prices are simply unrealistic. 40$ only on a fancy mount, knowing you have to pay almost as much on bits and bobs like armor pieces or refining material you can't just do without if you wanna enjoy late game at least a little bit. Or even just to reroll abilities and skill points!- ridiculous prices usually lead to one main thing: GRINDFEST. Expect hours (or DAYS, or WEEKS) of joyless plodding through dungeons and minor uninteresting events just to farm enough Astral Diamonds to buy.. a key. - quests and dungeons get boring and repetitive after a while. Let alone the random seasonal events, which appear for a small few days window and induce players to direct the grindfest focus on those, for a slim chance to get mmm, a new pet?- the rigidity of the events calendar. That's even against the basic notion of free-will. You'll get something like a 45' span to do -say- skirmishes, and if you do them in that time-frame you'll get some bonus. Point is that, given the desperate amount of grind, everyone would rather do these activities when it's bonus time - therefore, outside of that time-frame, good luck queueing for dungeons or whatever else. - no real reason to socialize, apart from dungeons: the game is not open world, so you can't just put a group together for some good ol' free roaming. You've got your tiny shiny path to follow - alone. But even skirmishes and dungeons are not the ideal place to make friends: at the end of the day, everyone worries about themselves and the loot, which is a bit sad indeed.- no open world, just instances - I find them a bit limiting and claustrophobic.- crafting? forget about it. just read: GRINDFEST.- PVP, as I said earlier, is something that i really enjoyed in the game, but it's got its problems. You get the chance to take part in a sort of fake-open-world arena later in the game, but no one really plays it and it's not even a proper arena either: you'll just hang out in that specific area, maybe to do some fetch-quest, and will randomly bump into some other player from a different 'faction' who's there doing his own thing. To kill or not to kill? You might as well just ignore each other and finish your own silly quests in peace.- RvR which is not really RvR (my heart still goes to DAOC), it's called 'Gauntlgrym PVP'. Basically a capture-the-flag zergfest where you'll run around a lot, and if the numbers are on your side, you'll simply overwhelm the enemy faction. BUT, prior to getting into one of these matches, in order to be eligible for the queue, you'll have to take part in a series of hectic fetch-quests.TL;DRGive it a go if this is your first MMORPG maybe, just to see what's what. But if you're a more experienced player, looking for something new&challenging, you might get bored soon.			"

												I don't know if i can say it's worth any real money to put into it. It is a breath of fresh air in game mechanics for MMORPG's but I dont know if it's enough to gain all the time you need to invest to get anything done. The crafting system is the most annoying system I have ever come across in an MMORPG. I found myself just ignoring or avoiding it all cost. Unless your a true fan of MMORPG's or roleplaying fan don't bother. But if you do like to role play it has a good system for getting you and others into your toon.			"

												Always on the lookout for a great F2P game, and this one sure stands up. Yeah there are the WoW-geeks and stat-trads that like to gear score themselves out of any fun in MMRPG universe, but there is something for everyone here - especially D&D fans. Take the time to explore and appreciate the level designs, you will not regret it. Itis regularly updated for content and has its share of seasonal events and goodies. There is relatively little frustration with levelling (not really sure why power-levelling scabs / Astral gem / gold farming hax even bother, but even the laziest of lazy like to play games too I suppose). Levels can mostly be done solo or with a companion, but in the tradition of D&D, try to form a party or get your friends to play with you - way more fun! Overall very fun, gorgeous graphics and within the spirit of the venerable game.			"

But the reason why I'm telling you to try it, but not recomending it is because there isn't much to do after you hit lvl 60, The pvp is unbalanced, and The zen trade is also unfair. I'm trying to keep every thing brief. The good:One thing they did really well and is the reason why you should at least give it a try is a the combat. It's really fast paced, which is something that other mmo's should have. And also instead of spending Money you can use Astral Diamonds to get zen. The classes are good, but nothing note worthy. The pvp is unbalanced, because of some classes are too OP. But it's fun and isn't much of a problem most of the times. And my favorite part the Naming system. It's really hard to name your character when almost every name you can think of is taken. Well NW is the first game I played that doesn't restrict any name, even if another player has that name. but you must have a diffrent handle(you're Arc username). No names are restricted so feel free to name your self what ever. The Bad:You hit lvl 60 and now can fight valrinda, get missions from the king himself, and start IceWind Dale. at first this might add some extra hours(or in my case weeks) of stuff to do, and then it get's repeative. Hoping to get to IceWind Dale...You might quit before or after this point so I don't have to explain it anyway.  I'm a Tricker Rogue and the most annoying things in PvP is Great Weapon fighters and Control Wizards. The GWF will most likley charge at you and spam attacks that knock you down. Once you're on the groud you're crying to your avatar to get up because you just now noticed you're getting jumped by any thing not on your team and can't do any thing about it. Same Goes for the Control Wizards. They will either push you back, or use the force that will hold you down and put you to the mercy of any thing in the vicinity. Other people say my class is kind of OP, but if you know the attacks Tricker Rogues do, you should be fine. And finally the Conversion from Astrail Diamonds to Zen. Zen is what you get for spending money, and it's really tempting to get a bigger inventory, more character slots or to rebuilt your Skill points because you ♥♥♥♥ed up the first time. Any way it's around 500Ad to get you a single zen coin. And items on the Zen Market is about 100-10,000. So basicly it will take you years to get what you want from the zen Market.I'll give this game an 7.9/10 and an award for best MMO naming system of all time. It's a really fun game you should play it, but don't expect it to last forever.			"

												After playing this game for 17 hours or so and reaching level 22 on a Human Great Weapon Fighter class I say that this game is pretty good for a free to play MMO. I am pleasantly surprised how Perfect World Entertainment did with the D&D game.Aside from the questing and lore in the game (there is lots of D&D lore) the Enchanting and upgrading enchanting is done nicely and there is lots of Enchanted Chest drops.The queue system for daily's and groups is nice to see. I hate when a new MMO is released without the basic options to make playing fun.The ""Foundry"" (opens up to you at level 15) lets you create user based content and quests. There is plenty of daily quests to do and Dungeon Delves where you get some nice piece of loot when the time comes up for these options.Down Side I don't like is that to open the enchanted lock box's you need an enchanted key and that can only be bought on the market place and you need to use Zen to buy on the in game store.

												Hello,So I looked at this game and got curious, read through forums and so on to find that the game was well received. So as I like to play MMORPGs, I thought giving it a try. As you can see my game time on Steam for this is low but the time I've spent on the game was me trying to adjust the graphics settings and fight the game to make it properly running. Constant crashes, settings not remember or not even taking effect. After few hours and plenty of tries I finally give up.I have a between middle and high-end gaming machine. I've been running a lot heavier games without issues on max settings and max resolution but this one gave me Hell I've never seen before. I hope the DEVs fix all the issues but I've never had this happen to me before.Definitely can't recommend the game due to bugs.			"

												Ahh Neverwinter the Dungeons and Dragons game thats just..well...NOT.I have played D&D since the 80s and I must say this is a good action based mmo. The thing its NOT is Dungeons and Dragons. I don't see how they can even use their name as this is about as far from D&D as a game could get.The game has the 4th edition character classes but its insane how they have taken these classes and totally botched them up.  You do THOUSANDS of points of damage, you have THOUSANDS of hit points, just about everything about this game is WRONG from a D&D standpoint. Each class only has 1 weapon they can use, 1 type of armor. Priests cannot melee the list goes on and on. This is NOT D&D, not even close.Now that I've got that out of the way, I'll describe what the game IS.This is an action based instanced MMO. You have several game hubs or cities scattered around the map.You must teleport to these zones, you cannot travel there any other way so there is no exploration or sense of the world being a real physical place to travel in. You just port to whatever zone you want to go to. There is alot to do in this game and you wont be bored easily as you level up there is always something to do, progression is good right up to the end-game.Character class trees are varied and there are 3 paths to take with each character class letting you mold your character into the type that suits your playstyle in your class.Dungeons are good for the most part, smallish in size not taking too long to run through 30 to 45 mins is the normal timeframe for the group dungeons, much less for the solo ones. You can hire companions to come with you in your journeys, healers, tanks, damage dealers, mages all types of creatures. These companions are helpful but a bit weak at later levels. You can equip them as well to help them perform better, and each one provides bonuses for your character as well. Healers provide a heal or regeneration bonus, tanks increase your armor..this sort of thing. There are alot of daily activities for gaining specific loot and gear sets that you can grind for.There are a few campaigns in the game that require doing the same thing over and over many many MANY times.These are not required but do provide some descent gear and rewards in the end. They seem to add 1 campaign every major update with 5 in-game as of this writing if you include the pvp campaign. PVP is done as you level up and has some of the best gear in the game as rewards for your efforts. Most of the pvp is done on 1 map or arena and gets old quick. The end game pvp is a little more varied with a huge area where you are pitted against another team to accomplish goals.This goes through stages with a dungeon run at the end. Winners get the best dungeon, the losers get a lesser dungeon to run through.With the Icewind Dale campaign there is a small open pvp section of an area where you can fight the opposing faction.All in all Neverwinter is a fun game, its NOT D&D but if you take that out of the equation it is an enjoyable experience with lots of stuff to do. Many will claim this is a pay to win game. I haven't spent a dime on the game since its release and have had a good time playing. Paying will get you things faster, better mounts, better companions, and better gear if you buy the lockboxes. I just ignore all this stuff and have done ok just playing the game for free. The final word. Just try it, take it for what it is and don't get caught up in the lie that its a D&D game.It IS fun, and its FREE, you have nothing to lose!  "

												I am actually not certain whether to recommend this game or not.  It is entertaining in many ways.  However, I played Neverwinter since the beta and many bugs still exist after approximately one year of release (and several patches--which focused on the zen market most of the time).  The inadequate class balancing makes it frustrating for those who love PVP (only specific classes are worth taking into PVP).  If you have played Dungeons & Dragons PnP style, you will find that this game is not entirely D&D (I believe it is stated in the game description that they used modified 4e rules).  If you are looking for something closer to real D&D, Dungeons & Dragons Online is the way to go.  Unfortunately, something about DDO that seems to fail to grasp my interest for a longer duration.  On the other hand, I found myself playing Neverwinter only to collect diamonds during my daily invocation and whenever there is an event.  I think the Foundry is its main asset for now.  As a former Dungeon Master, I wish I have the time to invest in creating quests in the Foundry.  I would like to recommend this game because it is somewhat enjoyable to play.  However, I just find it hard to recommend at this point because of issues that the developers should have fixed a long time ago (graphics bugs, game launcher crashing every so often, game patching can be buggy to some people, some dungeons are frustrating to run because of bugs, some quests/areas/dungeons become buggy right after patching--sometimes to the point of getting stuck and not be able to proceed or appropriate loot not dropping, highly expensive items in the market, and more).  If Steam had the option to take the middle ground, I would have picked it because the game is not a horrible game.			"

												It's a pretty generic MMORPG. Though it does have a lot of bugs, and with almost any type of character you make, you will need to get with friends and in a party to progress further within a timely manner. Still, not too bad for a free game, good if you can't get anything else. But if you can, I advise you do.			"

												It's fun if you like endless pve questing, with tons and tons of gear, crafting stuff, etc. (and of course a cash shop).The pvp is totally unbalanced. The problem seems that there is no real efficient tiering to pvp against other players with similiar gear, and the crowd control means perm-stun. Great for pve, fail for pvp.Edit:The pvp is compete nonsense, worst i have ever seen: a breakdown of gaming balance fundamentals. It's about meta game with rediculous chain disables and phase teleportations. There is no cooldown for crowd control and you get perma stun, repeated again and again. You can't let pve ez mode overkill abilities and gear get into pvp, it's unbalanced. Also, to be able to use p2w gear in pvp is the worst fail of all. The pve side of the game is very enjoyable, and i liked the queue'd public dungeons. I wouldn't ever take a game with this cash model seriously, because it has no real goal, except to hustle you to spend more than you should just to get the content (gear). I do believe in spending some money to support f2p games, and even support a subcription fee for a great game, in which case i would expect ALL content, gear and items , which this game and many others wont do.

												A game that starts strong but collapses into a world where you're forced to dance along a drum line of serrated drill-bit sex toys that continually penetrate your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ while you beg for forgiveness. You'll pray to ""wake up,"" but then the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ will chant ""can't wake up"" as they gnaw at your colon from the inside.PROS---Combat gameplay is fluid, vicious, and fun as hell. I can only speak from experience as a single-target DPS trickster rogue, but the glee I felt from stealthing-and-stabbing never faded even as enemies' hit points rose.---Leveling from 1-60, for me, averaged about 45 minutes per rank. I wasn't rushing to cap, either, and while I admit my eyes glazed over the quest text halfway through the storyline, I wasn't sprinting. Fast, but not too fast.---Events, skirmishes, and dungeons are great breaks from regular questing, though having to pay for chest keys (with in-game currency or with IRL munz) after the once-per-day free one is lame. I get it though: a company has to make money somehow, which is why this stays under positive.---Professions can all be leveled and no progress is lost (there's no swapping out mechanic--they're all available all the time).---The auction house is totally open for F2P players.---Minsc and Boo for us elderly BG players to get a nostalgiagiggle from. NEUTRAL---Quests from 1-60 are relatively-basic MMO trash, but I never got bored because of how brutal the combat was.---It's not an open-world game, but the above-ground instances are large enough to require mounts.---Sparkling lines and the linear nature of most of the world means you'll never get lost.CONS---The 60-70 grind is absolute garbage. There are no scripted/plotted quests; instead, all you get are repeatable hourlies set in a couple different areas that give tiny chunks of XP. Grind in MMOs is fine. This is like being bound in leather straps and lowered ♥♥♥-first onto a chainsaw of OhMiBods made out of shark teeth. It doesn't sound so bad reading it here, but in-game, after having so much fun from 1-60, it's like taking your supermodel date home from dinner and finding out instead of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ she has a black hole that leads directly into Satan's urethra. ---All of the endgame level 60 content from previous patches has been shifted to level 70, leaving the hourlies as the only content to carry the ten longest and most difficult ranks in the game. WHY.---The paid DLC is hilariously overpriced.---Loads of the in-game tooltips have outdated text, as well as the official wiki and the Neverwinter website. Aren't there interns for this? Or fan volunteers? ---There seems to be no effort to combat spammers and farmers. I get a new friend request every five minutes from someone wanting to trade or sell me something. My inbox is always full of spam as well. It doesn't sound that bad, but when you're kiting for your life and some prick sends you a request it gets annoying.---The ""need, greed, pass"" popups in dungeons and skirmishes are virtually in the middle of the screen. And there's always that one nub ♥♥♥♥♥♥ who feels the need to pick up every green item he sees, which forces the prompts to stack, literally filling the screen with them. WHY.---Because there are no traditional gathering nodes (all resources are collected from enemies and occasional, randomized nodes that require kits to interact with), I can't unleash my inner hoarding and trading personality. I won't really hold this one against Neverwinter, though, because I imagine it's to combat ♥♥♥♥tarded BR farmers. Still, annoying.SUMMARYIt's free. You technically can get all the stuff from the premium shop with in-game munz. The 1-60 process was a blast. But from then on it's a completely-different grind that's totally not worth your time. Find a different game until they add something to make those ten levels more entertaining. (And no, it's not ""my problem"" that they're insufferable. The ten hardest levels in the game shouldn't be less fun than getting my bum waxed in preparation for my date with @Nero. They should be the MOST fun, with deference for perhaps the FIRST ten.)Drizzt was a nice touch with the new mod, but still, his stuff is locked out at the 70 cap. Have fun with that.			"

												Good GameGood GraphicsPoor Managment/DevelopersThe game graphics are good, the play style can be very fun, but the developers are so far behind the curve for MMO's its sad, they're barely implementing concepts common to MMO's now in their 8th Mod/expansion in 2 years.  I've been playing since July 2015, and it's extremely easy to level characters to play End-Game content, but so repetitive when you finally get to the end-game content that you want to start another character just to enjoy something different to break the monotony.And they've finally figured out that the best way to make money is to essentially force players to buy most everything via ZEN  which is predominantly purchased with Real World Money.. because they've created numerous mechanisms e.g. Bound to Account BoA and Bound to Character BoC items that you are guarenteed to have inventory issues requiring buying Bank Slots(ZEN)  buying Bags (ZEN).  Other mechanisms that require ZEN are the Astral Diamond Exchange (Astral Diamond - AD) an in-game currency; which like most every MMO, they've made so many mistakes creating an economy for, that people exploited the hell out of it.. and made massive piles of AD  making the exchange market a joke for any peron who wasn't either exploiting it or buying it with Real World Money.The next way to soak up your time and money is in the form of Artifacts; Artifacts are weapons and equipment that are mostly End-game items, there are numerous artifacts you can have from around level 20, but the weapons and equipment will not be avaialbale till a player reaches level 70(Max level)  and can only be upgraded with Refining Stones and a few other very Minor things like lvl 60+ weapons, and considering it will take so many of these items that the people making money on refining stones and refinment items is split about 70/30  Exploiters-Botters/Cryptic  the exploiters run mass amounts of bots farming anything they can sell on the Astral Diamond exchange and Cryptic expects you to buy most everything else from them to actualy complete and finish refining an item to make it more powerful.Other than Cryptic's lame claim that they are trying to make the game playable for people ""with time to play"" and people ""with money to play"" they are very definitely focused on soaking money from people in the latter category.The most annoying thing beyond the money grab is that the game has so many glitches and development screw-ups that if you enjoy playing all of the content and reading all of the stories and background.. you may miss a whole lot, because they've broken nearly every Dungeon that isn't part of End-Game content and if you level too fast or power level you will not be able to go back and finish any of it, because they're too focused on keeping up the End-game content and keeping people paying that they're avoiding fixing the lower level dungeons.  The easy fix has been in most every other MMO i've played,  You power leveled past some stuff, so you join with a group of people to play that older content and your overall level etc is reduced back to the level of the content.  But 5+ mods/expansion later and they're still ignoring that massive gaping hole --that DnD fans like the content and the story--, which most DnD fans I know would/should be pi$$ed about.My biggest gripe isnt that they want to make a proifit, you cant keep a good genre MMO alive without money, but that they are ruining the DnD name with they're inept development and managment of a great Genre of MMO.

												It's free-to-play, very full-featured, and a ton of fun if you like fantasy MMOs. Uses the Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition rules, which actually work a lot better as a computer game than they do in the pen & paper game. The combat is surprsingly robust, much more interactive than in a typical MMO - it uses reticule targeting rather than Tab targeting, and that's a LOT more interesting. The big bonus is the built-in Foundry editor which allows any user to create their own quests, so there's a huge amount of user generated content, some of it very good indeed.Overall, it's currently my go-to MMO, and I recommend it highly.

												This game is pretty fun especially if you have a friend or two to group with.  I don't know what everyone is complaining about the pay to win.  There is nothing in this game that you have to spend real money on at all.  The Zen currency can be purchased with in game currency astral dimonds if your will to put the effort into gettting them... Even then Zen is mostly used for cosmetic items and a couple of companions.  Moving on from there I like the active combat system vs. the stand in one place spaming a button like some of the other mmo's out there.			"

												Model (F2P): The biggest downside to the game is its Zen system which, I suppose is the only way for a free MMO to make money, as one would expect from a F2P model. Unlike in games like Path of Exile, the items purchased with Zen can definitely be game altering and offer advantages that free players would not have access to at a much earlier level. However, there is a way to convert in game currency (Astral Diamonds) into Zen at a conversion rate that changes depending on the market. Neverwinter sometimes pushes the player to use special currencies in order to open lockboxes containing level-appropriate equipment, but is otherwise not too intrusive. Unfortunately, the in-game currency of Zen-to-Dollar ratio uses an extremely expensive conversion when compared to other F2P games such as Rift. While most decent item sets cost somewhere between 1500-3000 zen, approximately 500 zen = $5, depending on how many Zen are purchased at once.Gameplay: Some of the most innovative and fun combat you'll find in the current MMO scene. The classes are very well fleshed-out, but definitely not balanced as of yet. Most classes require re-positioning, timing, and anticipation when reacting to enemies or even allies' actions. It's definitely not a click and spam blindly game. Unique mechanics are introduced depending on the class. A Guardian Fighter can hold up a shield to block attacks, while a Rogue can quickly close distance with a teleporting strike. Every class feels truly unique and full of flavor. The combat system is mostly based on a D&D-type of ruleset with skilltrees in the form of feats and eventual specialization. While questing is very linear and everything else is pretty much what you would expect in a standard MMO, the profession system is more of a que-and-wait.  Overall I would recommend this game to anyone who's awaiting WildStar and its combat system and wants something similar to satisfy their hunger for ARPG-type combat. Additionally, creative minds can use this game to create scenario-type quests and dungeons through a feature I personally have not used much called the Foundry.Multiplayer: Standard faire for the current MMO market. PVP scenarios of varying types pitting 5v5, co-op challenges that can quickly be completed with friends or random players, and dungeons. Lots of variety for all types of players and a guild system. Most players use the in-game chat to find groups or members. No innovation, but definitely satisfying for those who don't like soloing.7.5/10			"

												I am actually not certain whether to recommend this game or not.  It is entertaining in many ways.  However, I played Neverwinter since the beta and many bugs still exist after approximately one year of release (and several patches--which focused on the zen market most of the time).  The inadequate class balancing makes it frustrating for those who love PVP (only specific classes are worth taking into PVP).  If you have played Dungeons & Dragons PnP style, you will find that this game is not entirely D&D (I believe it is stated in the game description that they used modified 4e rules).  If you are looking for something closer to real D&D, Dungeons & Dragons Online is the way to go.  Unfortunately, something about DDO that seems to fail to grasp my interest for a longer duration.  On the other hand, I found myself playing Neverwinter only to collect diamonds during my daily invocation and whenever there is an event.  I think the Foundry is its main asset for now.  As a former Dungeon Master, I wish I have the time to invest in creating quests in the Foundry.  I would like to recommend this game because it is somewhat enjoyable to play.  However, I just find it hard to recommend at this point because of issues that the developers should have fixed a long time ago (graphics bugs, game launcher crashing every so often, game patching can be buggy to some people, some dungeons are frustrating to run because of bugs, some quests/areas/dungeons become buggy right after patching--sometimes to the point of getting stuck and not be able to proceed or appropriate loot not dropping, highly expensive items in the market, and more).  If Steam had the option to take the middle ground, I would have picked it because the game is not a horrible game.			"

												It's difficult for me to classify Neverwinter as an MMO. I feel a much better description would be a dungeon hack-and-slash with some MMO trappings. Character customization is bare bones, even leaving out the fact that certain iconic races are locked away behind the pay wall. You're able to choose your character's sex, race, and class along with his/her origin and patron deity. The latter two are surprisingly limited, given the setting; even in 4th Edition's greatly reduced pantheon, there are a number of gods and goddesses worshipped by the people of Faerun, yet the game only gives you a fraction. Likewise, the origins only cover a handful of locales in the Realms. It quickly becomes apparent that this game was not made for diehard fans of Forgotten Realms.If you're looking for a worthy successor to Neverwinter Nights, you will not find it in this game. The Foundry is a poor substitute for that legendary series' robust world-building and DM tools, with even the most highly regarded player-created dungeons essentially boiling down to the same formulaic hack-and-slash gameplay of the main game. I cannot recommend this game to anyone looking for a meaningful MMO experience. With a friend or two, some fun can be had in  fighting your way through waves of kobolds and orcs so long as you keep your expectations in check.Overall: Pass			"

												First of all I wand to make this review as a player that has played this game since the beta and seen it go down the drain.This was one of the best Mmorpg's I have ever played in my opinion and it use to be a hard game that required skill and that made it interesting. The graphics are nice, the game play sweet and the main story is actually not that bad.The problem is that PWI who have renamed to Arc games messed up a good game. They turned it into a  grindy p2w game.They removed all the dungeons that we loved and now only got a few.Well they do update the game a lot but by killing the original game I just won't recommend this game in the state it actually is in.There is still some value in the game but I wouldn't recomend this game if you are looking for a game with decent end game content.

												Strangely enough, the PC based version from years back in the 90's gave you a better experience, closer to your character.  The inability to zoom in close, to either have a 1st-person point of view, or a very close third-person view, breaks the immersion for me in this type of game.  If I wanted the diablo-esk birds-eye-view, I would have played diablo.  I played several characters for a bit to try and give it a decent run, but the inability to get close to my character had me exiting out and uninstalling before too long.  Nice concept on a stellar dinasty of a gameline, but did not deliver.  Seems more of a WoW graphics with  Diablo viewpoint, with random short-term central bazaar style game system.  It's a no from me, sorry.			"

												It's free-to-play, very full-featured, and a ton of fun if you like fantasy MMOs. Uses the Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition rules, which actually work a lot better as a computer game than they do in the pen & paper game. The combat is surprsingly robust, much more interactive than in a typical MMO - it uses reticule targeting rather than Tab targeting, and that's a LOT more interesting. The big bonus is the built-in Foundry editor which allows any user to create their own quests, so there's a huge amount of user generated content, some of it very good indeed.Overall, it's currently my go-to MMO, and I recommend it highly.

There is nothing in this game that you have to spend real money on at all.  The Zen currency can be purchased with in game currency astral dimonds if your will to put the effort into gettting them... Even then Zen is mostly used for cosmetic items and a couple of companions.

I tried the ""don't start in full screen"" the ""start in safe mode"" the ""start in Windows 7 compatability"" and even the ""open this folder, right click on that and enter this random string of digits into the line here.""  None of it works.  I know I am not the only person who has these problems (see:  dozens of pages of other people that have the same problem) , yet Cryptic doesn't seem to care. The download is free.

												Incredibly fun MMO with heavy D&D feel (but just the fun parts!). Make your own quests! Auto-grouping while killing huge dargons/L337 baddies! Fun combat and pvp, though they could use a few more pvp maps.Crafting system is pretty fun, time-based and anyone can do anything, you can even craft on your phone while away from PC, but I was very sad when they nerfed the ♥♥♥♥ out of leadership, and removed it from mobile.Plus I enjoyed sliding around on my cleric like the dude from Risky Business.9/10 will slide around some more.*Edit* This review was based on the last time I played, maybe 6mos ago. Now, sadly I must agree with many of the other reviewers that this game is no longer worth it. Once upon a time it was fun on a bun, but now its a looooong boring grind unless you're into that pay-to-win thing. Which I am not. So my 9/10 is demoted to 4/10, because its still pretty and the combat is still fun, but the endgame is crap and the grind is too much. RIP Neverwinter, once loved, now shunned.			"

												Neverwinter Nights and Neverwinter Nights 2 were beautiful games. This is not a beautiful game. This isn't even a beautiful MMO. Disapointment doesn't even begin to describe my feelings in realizing that there will never be another installment of Neverwinter Nights, and Neverwinter will only exist in the pretend gaming comunities that are modern MMOs. If you want to see a desperate gambit to get money by mutilating the Neverwinter setting then this is the game for you. This game had potential for being good, but a few fundamental mistakes were made. First and foremost, it was designed to be another MMO in an endless sea of MMOs (Thanks Blizzard). Second, the game tried to integrate pay2win and grind2win without ever considering the previous titles did well because they were play2win. Thirdly and lastly, the company tried to push a game that the returning demographic would not only be disinterested in playing, but also be offended that something they loved was turned into something so heckneyed and low quality. The last mistake might not have been so bad, but their only real advertisement was through Wizards of The Coast, a company that caters to users that would share the woes of the returning demographic.TL:DR, Game is bad and Perfect World Entertainment should feel bad.

This game was a top game until the devs got real greedy. There was always balancing issues, like GWF being very overpowered, I used to get 20+ kills in pvp without dying, I was pretty much the tankiest build in our group. Then it was nerfed, and was literally unplayable, they removed some of the animations in pvp for it too. GWF become the most useless class in the game after they nerfed it.

												My review to Neverwinter -Neverwinter, it is a based on ""Neverwinter Nights"" and ""Dungeons & Dragons"".(No its not part of the series of NN according Wikipedia).Let's start with the gameplay - Neverwinter is not like the other MMORPG games out there like ""World of Warcraft"" etc.it's bit different, we don't have numbers to attack in different ways, we have to press on the mouse,or press Q, E, R and this, to use abilities. (BTW, in NN and NN2 it's like WoW style and NN is not a MMORPG, just rpg).The movment system also different. In case that you don't need to press on the target to attack them only aim and press the ability or on the mouse.Leveling is like the other MMORPGs just do quests, killing enemies and this stuff but the leveling is kinda easy, you get quite enough from quests.Graphics and Physics -Graphics are important part in video games, its can be bad, it can be good.the game shows us what 'Cryptic Studios' can do with their game. graphics are nice, not awesome but nice.Physics are not that good at this game bit silly, like if you push a barrel you can push only that way that it cannot fall only if there something that can do that it will fall somehow.the enemies does not have ragdoll, (It is not so important but just saying).A.I. -Not that smart but decent. the bosses are smart attacking you when you can't attack or you have no ability to attack stronger.Snipers are silly too, like an A.I from a shooter game, when you are behind wall they shoot you, like everybody.the enemies are silly too, like the bosses but not that smart like the bosses.Ok, that is all, this is my review. you do not need to like it you can hate it how much you want this is my opinion, and YES THIS GAME IS PAY 2 WINThe good - Nice Gameplay Nice Graphics Character Customization that can take you at least 20 minutesThe bad -Silly A.IBad PhysicsStory is not that interestingPay to winScores Gameplay - 8.5Graphics - 9.0Physics - 6.0A.I. - 6.5Story- 7.0Final score - 8.5 / 10			"

												Make sure you do not purchase any Zen/packs through the steam store. You can have your account placed on probation waiting for verificiation as Steam does not count as a ""trusted source"".

												I had to download the same 8GB patch at their server's awful 200KBps three times to get it to install properly, and then the servers were so laggy that I couldn't play with a friend who was sitting 5 feet across from me. The actual gameplay looked pretty nice, too bad I never got past the end of the tutorial.			"

												TL;DR - if you are into D&D you'll probably try this game anyway, and you should. for a reader there is some satisfaction in running around the areas you read about. this review is more of a personal disappointment of failed expectations strictly from gaming perspective. ---dont' mind the low hour qty i have listed on steam.i was one of the original founder packs supporters and spent nearly a year playing the game, spending about ~600 across different packages and booster packs. early quests are OKAY. they look like at least a little bit of thought was put into them. however, relatively quickly it becomes mindless grind. you can completey not pay any attention and fight and level very easily. on occasion you come across inept objects and maps portions that seem like the authors were still attempting to do something interesting, but then got distracted by the money making and gave up.i came from DDO, and apparently ive been taking it for granted how great the stories were behind the quests and how stimulating it was to solve some of teh puzzles, and traverse the diverse environemnts, including under water. every ""map"" in Neverwinter just feels like a slightly different layout of the same thing. so do, in fact the classes. Fury of the Feywild gets slightly refreshing, but not by much.2 saving graces of the game are PvP which almost feels like FPS with the right type of people, and The Foundry, where people with actual writing talent can create some interesting quests for you to play out side of the main story line. if you do play the game, dont bother with any of the $$ packs. they do not enhance the game play at all. they just serve as shortcut to getting to the next level of boredom so you dont spend more time on your lower level of boredom. I gave this game another shot on steam hoping it would at least allow for some trivial achievements, or collector cards. that does not exist either. worse, the game play appears to have become even more grindy. the stats math appears to have been redone and i was artificially struggling in maps that i usually breezed through. the same effect can be achieved by playing maps ahead of year level number. it doesnt save the game play.

UPDATE for Module 6 and beyond (as of mod 10):So in my earlier review I criticized this game for being buggy, and its aggressive pay-to-win model. A lot has changed since then, but with microtransactions the game has only gotten worse. Note that the majority of my time in the game has been outside Steam. I have a ~3k item level Devoted Cleric, healer build.Pros:Beautiful music and scenery in most levels. Much of the game has a sort of dice-rolling feel similar to what you'd expect from the tabletop D&D it's based on, especially once you start delving into the finer details of combat mechanics.Free-to-play, though technically only free in that cash payments can be substituted with month-long consecutive time sinks (with daily and weekly caps).Although much of the community remains toxic, there are guilds and groups of people often willing to help out another player. Dungeons (5-player) and epic trials (10-25 players) more and more require teamwork and coordination to win, and cannot be solo'd.The community used to be worse when loot rolls were used for item drops, where votekicking during boss fights was commonplace, but drama-prone loot rolls have been all but replaced with per-player item drops (bound to account to prevent selling it).Cons:The game is extremely and aggressively pay 2 win. If you die, you will have a 15-second timer held in your face, offering to quickly pay real-world money in order to resurrect yourself (using scroll of life). But that's of course optional, and you can ultimately advance through the game without ever buying it. The true nature of this game's pay-to-win mechanic peeks out of hiding at level 60, then appears again at level 70.Once you're at level 70 (read below) your item level - the arbitrary developer-assigned overall assessment of the gear you have - is what determines which dungeons you may enter, and who will be willing to play with you. There are ways to make your character stronger, but increasing the item level is always increasingly expensive because it's biased towards enchantments and armor enhancements instead of gear itself. Potions, buffs, and companion stats (including augments) don't count, and as of mod 6, boons no longer count either.Changes from Module 6:At mod 6, the level cap was increased from 60 to 70. All content as of level 70 was designed to make previous gear obsolete. Additionally, all set bonuses from level-60 gear have been removed to ""balance"" the game and ensure all veteran players must invest in their characters again. Enchantment caps were increased from 10 to 12, and artifact ranks from 100/legendary to 140/mythic. The ""gear score"" stat was removed and replaced with ""item level"", where each item has an arbitrary number listed, independent of its stats. Item level is weighted heavily towards artifacts and enchantments, and less representative of overall strength than of money spent on the game. Max item level is roughly 4200, advanced end-game players sitting between 3000-4000, most players sitting between 2000-2500, barriers to entering dungeons generally around 1600-2000 depending on which one, and around 2600 to have a practical shot at surviving them.Many of the old dungeons end-game players were familiar with, and often used to farm astral diamonds from, have been permanently retired. Castle Never, Lair of the Mad Dragon, Spellplague Caverns, Dread Vault, Throne of Idris, and most of Gantlegrym have been removed. Castle Never was later re-designed to be completely different, with different bosses, shorter, and completely different rewards, while Cryptic has declared the old Castle Never is gone for good. Lair of Lostmauth and Valindra's Tower were converted into Tier 1 dungeons. Aside from re-working Castle Never, no new dungeons were added to compensate for the loss at this time, but a new Fangbreaker Island has been added in mod 10, with extremely strict gear score requirements (3100) and only gear obtained from mod 10 (available for real-world money in Zen store) counts.The need/greed/pass loot roll mechanic still exists, but has been removed from most loot dropped by bosses. Anything picked up from bosses, however, is bound to account on pickup, preventing players from selling items in the auction house as was common in Castle Never prior to mod 6. On the bright side, votekicks are MUCH rarer in dungeons or boss fights, although the anonymous votekick mechanic has not been changed. Instead of dungeon delves, there are daily keys to chests, a mechanic to buy additional keys for astral diamonds, and free extra keys (along with 1 daily lockbox key) provided VIP-subscription players.In order to combat the [s]players using items as a currency[/s] botting, many items once used as currency are now bound on pickup. All enchanted lockbox keys are bound to account. Wards are also bound on pickup, except when purchased from the Zen store for $10 USD each, and have been removed from the trade bar store. The daily astral diamond refining cap has increased to 32k per character, and tasks awarding astral diamonds have been reworked to provide more.What to expect:Level 1-60:You select from (as of writing) 8 premade classes and a handful of races and mixed races (more if you buy premium packs) to build your character, with some customization. Almost every item is tied to 1 specific class, and once you pick that class, you're locked into a fairly pre-determined playstyle. The decisions you make here are crucial.Once your character is created, you spawn in a sort of newbie-void where you're forced along a linear path designed to teach you the basic mechanics for your class, then at level 4 or 5 you're cut loose to grind through quests for experience/gold at your own pace... sort of. From here on, quests are still fairly linear, and areas you visit are level-restricted; you can visit most of them anyway, but with the understanding that enemies in the area will dominate you. As you progress through quests, you are sent to other areasLevel 60:A player can realistically advance up to level 60 within a week or less. The content is linear, sometimes slightly repetitive - kill X monster Y times or run into cave and defeat boss - but takes you to brand new areas roughly every couple levels. Early on, it appears your level is the end-all-be-all of how strong you are. That lasts until level 60.Once you hit level 60, the progress to advance another level becomes exponentially higher. You could spend 3-7 days grinding to level 60, then perhaps a week or two for each level after that until you reach 70. Module 6 increased the level cap from 60 to 70, and introduced the Elemental Evil campaign, which caries very little content. Most other content is off limits until you reach level 70, but you can now pay $50 USD to buy a fresh character at level 70 and skip all this.Level 70:Everything you've done up until this point has revolved around your level. At level 70, you will learn all of that was a facade, like a demo, and the real advancement in the game revolves around your item level. In order to advance your item level, you will need to grind for months at a time, on a daily basis, or spend real-world money on enchantments. Enchantments are complicated to explain, so I'd recommend these below wiki links, but ultimately are designed to be extremely expensive. A single enchantment at rank 12 costs approximately $80 USD on the aftermarket, of which you have about 18 slots. Artifacts are in the same ballpark, for which you have 4 slots. Coalescent wards (available for $10 each in zen store) and Preservation wards ($1 for pack of 10) are designed to act as a paywall, where many enchantments have a 1-5% chance of advancing ranks, where a failed upgrade will discard all the materials used to create the enchantment (much more than the ward). For some, this is 1% each rank from 7 until 12.			"

												This surprised me, for a f2p its not bad.    Pros: PvE this is where the game shines.  There's different  queues for dungeons and skirmishes (team up with people to defeat an outdoor mini dungeon) for your level range.  There's also the foundry which has thousands of player made content which is always being updated and keeps things fresh.  You can of course create a foundry mission which the community can play and applies to the previous statement.  Cons: The classes have balancing issues in pvp and if people have better gear than  you then you'll get rolled but if you farm enough you can get the same gear but its mildly pay to win.  There's class issues in PvE as well for instance I played a tank (so  called) which would lead you to believe you would tank, hold aggro, and be a damage sponge.  This is not the case.  You spend most of your time  running out of the red spots as a tank, which means you aren't dps'ing, which means you're not generating enough threat to hold aggro.  If you stand  in the red and don't block you take huge damage...as a fully geared tank, and spec'ed full tank (I tried both the tank trees in full defensive gear 51% dmg reduction, 32% parry which is very high, and 15% aoe reduction, a large hp pool, among other things) you take massive damage.Your only hope is to use your aoe taunt which has a long cooldown, and spam your fighters recovery daily which unless you're tactician you wont have up when you  need it so thats the  only viable spec I've found.  The so called cookie cutter spec is to stack attack power and go down the tree  that gives you double attack power if you have full block (which means if you block your dps is lowered based on how much shield you have remaining).  This is great for threat, but you can't take much damage and the healing in  this game is pretty bad imo.  This saddens me as I only had an interest in tanking in NW and they've failed the class.  Tanks aren't taken most of the time end game, people would rather have ranged and cc ( ranger and control wizard) control means no healing and more aoe damage potential.Until they fix the tank class to be able to actually tank I wont be playing the game.  ============================================================I did create a foundry mission which was very time consuming (you can spend as much or as little time as you wish on a foundry mission) as I chose to build my own multi-story building (very limited tools made this a lot harder than  it needed to be, for example, if you could select more than one object to copy / paste, it  would have saved me days of work if not more).The community can rate your foundry mission in a 5 star system if they play it and for the most part the community in the foundry is good.  But since most people don't create foundry missions, they don't appreciate how long it takes to make them.  If you want an example do a search for my foundry mission ""Ghost - behind enemy lines"" and play it.  That foundry took me over 3 weeks to make and I'm out of work so that means every day I was working on it (most of the time was building the last building).Its not all bad though, I went into the foundry  sort of knowing it would take a while and some people would be unappreciative but for the most  part the reviews were friendly and the comments some people had were very  satisfying and thoughtful.  People can donate astral diamonds to you if they wish and a lot of people do so that's nice.  If the community rates it high enough it can be hosted by the devs.   People play your content and enjoy it, that makes you feel like you wrote a novel (which you actually are an author in this case) and people like it, this makes it worth it.

												Neverwinter for PC is an outstanding MMORPG from what I have experienced. I have not gotten to a maximum level yet, and I'm not a Neverwinter expert, but based off of my 22.9-hour-impression,  I highly reccomend this game for anybody looking for an MMORPG.Pros:-free to play (all levels for everyone, features like being in a party open to everyone, etc) -good graphics-lots of useful video settings-proper third person view (moving the mouse to turn character)-default controls are simple and open to edit-useful guidance to locations for quests (sparkling line, not pointing arrow)-most things in the game do not require real money-slightly automatic aiming, useful if you're a bad aimer or using a gamepadCons:-not compatible with gamepads / console controllers (although it will work if you use your own installed key binding program)-mounts (creatures that you may ride on) must be purchased with the zen currency which is difficult to get unless you buy it with real money-a couple of races require an expansion pack that you must pay real money forIMO (In My Opinion):-better than any MMORPG I've played-very fun			"

												If you have tons of money to spend on in game items and services, if not then you are going to be one sad person because the game is infested with microtransactions. for example if you wanna respec your character you have to pay 15 EUROS which is rediculous and the list goes on and on.So in my conclusion the game itself is good, but the money you have to spend to enjoy the full content and stuff is unreasonable.4/10Would Uninstall again!

												As a long-time player of the Neverwinter Nights series, this game practically screamed my name to play. I was reluctant at first, however, because a FTP MMORPG that my friends said sucked was not very enticing...HOWEVER this game is THE ABSOLUTE BEST MMO out there. No joke. And it's FTP!!! It runs on crappy machines even, so you have no excuse not to try it. It is kind of a combination of WOW and TESO, providing all the things those games lack. It is a hack and slash with abilities that tops all other point and click MMOs (or any MMO for that matter). One thing to point out is it is much more fun with a friend, so bring a buddy (or four!). I would pay big bucks to play an amazing game like this, and it is even more so amazing that it is free. 10/10 already one of my favorite games of all time!			"

												As a long-time player of the Neverwinter Nights series, this game practically screamed my name to play. I was reluctant at first, however, because a FTP MMORPG that my friends said sucked was not very enticing...HOWEVER this game is THE ABSOLUTE BEST MMO out there. No joke. And it's FTP!!! It runs on crappy machines even, so you have no excuse not to try it. It is kind of a combination of WOW and TESO, providing all the things those games lack. It is a hack and slash with abilities that tops all other point and click MMOs (or any MMO for that matter). One thing to point out is it is much more fun with a friend, so bring a buddy (or four!). I would pay big bucks to play an amazing game like this, and it is even more so amazing that it is free. 10/10 already one of my favorite games of all time!			"

												After 16 years of MMO gaming, this has been the most innovative and fun game I have played. I was an old school MMORPG player and also a long time reader of the books of Forgotten Realms and this game has kept to what the actual world its set in has been portrayed as in the books which is rare. The combat is more than just click and go, you have the ability to completely dodge an attack and that makes this game require some actual skill which only a few MMORPG's have. It gives a sense of challenge and doesn't empower those who spend money to a point in which a person who doesn't can't compete with them. Very fun, and a very friendly atmosphere, I give this game a 10/10 in all points. Give this a try if you enjoy games where you can be uber without years of grinding or dungeon running, and enjoy a game that is completely playable solo. See you ingame!			"

												Hands down one of the best free MMOs I have ever played.  The game is not the most gorgeous, but it looks good.  The game is not incredibly complex, but it has an intricate balance.  I really enjoyed my time in the game... and even outside of it.The dynamic of playing the game from a browser with my companions is brilliant.  The fact that I can craft from the same browser is amazing!  If they had an app that did something similar, I'd almost pay a small monthly fee for it.  The companion system by itself is actually pretty awesome.  Someone to hang out with you and support or tank or fill whatever gap you have is pretty awesome.  While some of them could stand to be a little better, they are pretty good overall and the ones at the beginning of the game are very helpful. My favorite part, however, is the user created content.  The ability to run a ""dungeon"" created by another player is amazing.  I've run some good ones and bad ones, but that feature is awesome!  When I say dungeon, it does it a bit of dis-service.  It is more like an entire zone built with encounters, buildings, bosses and loot tables that plays out as a full quest or mission.  Some of them can be done in 10 or 20 minutes, while others may take more than hour.  The difficulty is also variable.The micro-transactions for this game can get pricey, but I didn't worry too much about them.  They have some interesting packs and people who plan to invest a lot of time can easily wait until a sale and get a great deal.  IMO, the game is good enough to at least invest a little bit.			"

												This game makes me so frustrated.  It has pros and cons, and if tended to could be so much better for players and producers. After playing various characters reaching endgame this is my conclusion-->PVE - Amazing tho a bit linear, still has good stories and quests compared to allot of other grinds out there.  I enjoyed many of the zones and contrary to many critics on vioce acting I didn't find it too bad.  Which is hardwork considering it's f2p.  Combat is fun and fast paced (not too easy, not to hard) and allows for some room to make character builds.  And if you have friends to play with and choose not to pay money to climb this game could be very extensive on PvE terms.  The foundry is one of the best aspects of the game.  It doesn't take a computer science degree to understand the fundamentals to allow for campaign creation. (However it does go down quite often which is unfortunate)PVP - *sigh*  This is the most damaging aspect of the game.  It has the potential to be great but anyone who plays who has not sunked 1k real money into will admit - ""Is broken""  Unbalanced and pure p2w.  Literally post upon post will say the same thing without a change.  Unless pvp is fixed the competetive fan base will dwindle like a candle as it is already and continue until gone.   But in overall opinion it is a fair f2p game but has the potential to be one of the best if handled better.			"

												I have been seeing a lot of negative reviews saying the game is pay to win. If you are going to try out the game, know one thing: you will not start to make a good amount of AD, the main currency, until you hit the max level (60). The game's economy is mostly based around the player base and player market. Items that you get from endgame dungeons will either be worth 500 AD or 500,000 AD depending on how badly the buyer wants said item. For instance, I earned a piece of armor a few days ago that sold for 600,000, but today it is worth around 150,000. You may also exchange AD for the premium currency, Zen, which you have the option to pay actually money for. The only thing you can not get in game without paying actually money are the packs which are really not a big deal.      This is my most played game on steam and I personally think it is very underrated. The questing can feel a bit grindy but it is almost fully voice acted. There is also great deal of lore is case you want to get into it. Otherwise the combat is very quick and responsive, the loot and customization is executed very well, and I feel the game should have a much bigger playerbase.			"

												I can't recommend a game if I can't get to it to play.  Neverwinter is one of only two PC games on Steam so far with which I never got past the launcher to the actual game, in this case because I could never get it to acknowledge that the account I made exists.I've recently tried both a very old MMO and a very new one which both worked fine, so there's not a general issue with me and MMOs' logins. Given the tone of Neverwinter's recent reviews from people who apparently COULD get ingame, I think I'll just go play something else.			"

												This game is SOOOOOOOO ADDICTING... Ive played so many mmorpgs but i usually end up quiting cuz of the long, boring and endless hours of grinding. However this game is always action packed with the large amount of bosses/dungeons. You level up quickly from following the main quests so it keeps gamers from getting bored of doing the same thing. Dungeons also get SUPER epic when you have a full party of 5 especially when you get later into the game. (level 45+)Graphics are amazing at full HD quality, character customization is awesome (get to choose races, jobs etc), combat system is great (similar to Tera Rising)-- dodge/block system, PVP is fun (kinda like capture the flag or Dominion in League of Legends), overall game can be competitive (mechanically skilled players can outplay other players with op stuff), and much more.I reached the max level 60, and during that experience it was HELLA FUN! And it gets way better cuz once you hit 60, you get bombarded with more crazy quests and you can customize your character even more with the access to boons (another skill tree). Overall I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME! It's just amazing bcuz you can have the same amount of fun by yourself or by grabbing some of your buddies to do the dungeons/quests with.10/10			"

												As someone who has played other D&D games before, but has not played the pen & paper game, Neverwinter felt very accessible. It has the most enjoyable combat out of any MMOs that I have played to date.As a free-to-play game, it has a real money (referred to as Zen) cash shop. While all of the items in the cash shop seem expensive, I never felt like I was required to purchase any of them to enjoy the content that everyone else was playing. As you play, you can earn the in-game currency, Astral Diamonds, and exchange it with other players for the Zen that they have purchased. Depending on what you are looking to purchase, the length of the grind required varies dramatically.As for content, the Foundry and its ""infinite content"" is a nice distraction from the developer made quest line. Some of the quests that players have created are absolutely ridiculous, both in personality and in quality.I highly recommend giving Neverwinter a shot and forming your own decision. It doesn't take that long to reach the level cap, and it's free - what do you have to lose?			"

												Is it the best F2P mmorpg out there? The short answer is no. There are a lot of things that are a problem, and most of these centre around the business model of the devs. That being said it is still entirely possible to enjoy yourself if you are looking for a drop in/drop out online exp. The vast majority of the negative reviews are born out of the gaming communities disgust at having to spend actual money on a game they are playing for free. Let that sentence roll around for a moment. Very simply it boils down to whether or not you are looking for a suitable end game experience. If you have a lot of money to burn then this is the game for you. If, however, you would like everything to be free in this world (I think someone once said some about the price of a lunch...) then this is not for you. If you, like me, are just looking for a casual and beautiful online experience to jump into every now and again, then I would say go for it. After all, it is free.			"

												Although PWI/Cryptic have developed a (well earned...) reputation for nickel-and-diming players, Neverwinter is a surprisingly competent and fun action-RPG ""MMO"" (its really more small group focused and never feels like a massive world). The game is heavily instanced and much more fun in groups, much like actual Dungeons and Dragons would be. Don't go in expecting a sequel to Neverwinter Nights and you'll have a much better time. The Forge is fun to mess around in too, and some of the player-created missions are cool (there's a clever Wizard of Oz inspired one that I enjoyed).			"

												A F2P game with some elements of nickle and diming but they're avoidable. It's totally playable without putting a cent into it but you're restricted to two characters. There's no restrictions on the gameplay itself and it's quick to level to 60.     Resetting your character's active skills costs ""Zen"" which is real money, but you shouldn't have to unless you've been playing level 60 for a while. Resetting passive skills called ""Feats"" cost ingame currency called ""Astral Diamonds"" and it scales depending on how much points you put into it already. Astral diamonds can be traded for Zen and vise versa to help cover costs for an extra character or a skill reset if you're worried about spending real money, but it takes time to collect enough of.    Unfortunately, the economy is somewhat bloated with bot farmers selling ingame currency for real money, causing some items on the market to be ungodly amount of astral diamonds to buy. Finding a party to get into a dungeon is almost impossible unless you advertise yourself on the ""Looking For Group"" chat or bring friends. One of the classes, The Devoted Cleric, has a high difficulty curve that can surprise new players and is not recommended to play during your first time unless you know what you're in for. There's also balance issues with enchantments and high level pvp which the developers said to be patched soon.     All in all, decent free MMO that if you don't have problems with gambling (see TF2 or CS:GO i.e crates), should really only cost you none to 15 USD. Surpisingly fun and the classes feel great and powerful to play. It's recommended, if it is your first time, to just play the game however you want without worrying what build you should spec into.

												I have been playing neverwinter since beta, and I can say I enjoy the game. The story is interesting the gameplay is fun the graphics are smooth and the setting is just great. There are not many things I have found fault in with neverwinter but some of these are as follows, for an mmo neverwinter feels extremely linear with one quest linking to the next all the way to endgame. Another thing I dont like is endgame, I always get bored but this seems to just be the mmo way atm, there content creator helps somewhat in that user generated content can be pretty great, but it does not completely make up for some of the default content lacking that spark that makes it interesting. Even another thing that rubs me the wrong way is pvp, when the game was a newer release there seemed to be a more active pvp scene but now all the matches seem to me unbalanced and boring. Now dont think for a second I am going to end the recommendation on a sour note, I had a LOT of fun with the game on all my characters up until the point you start to feel that inevitable mmo fatigue. I recommend you try the game yourself to see if you like it or not, yea end game can be grindy, yea there are some ridiculous cash shop items but are these not things we have all come to expect from a free to play mmo? The game has a lot to offer and a lot of fun you can experience without paying a dime or grinding a second, so get out there and get playing!Update 7/30/14: Neverwinter fans rejoice, Neverwinter is coming to xbox and its getting a new expansion!Update 8/11/15: Neverwinter just keeps getting new content. I have not played in a while but this is good news. I hear its one of the most popular free to play games on Xbox now as well!			"

												I've jumped around through several ""Free"" MMORPGs.  Thus far, I've found Neverwinter Online to be the most fun. The combat is reactive and skill can matter as much as the skills you choose. I know that a lot of people have cut the game down for being ""pay to win"", but if you are not out to be the most dominate player in the game with all the best gear (right away anyway) then you will have fun.Pro: LOTS of quests with varied objectives.     *Decent community compared to many games. Get in a guild and you will have a lot of fun.     *Good respawn times for MOBs. Not a lot of waiting around.     *You can play casually OR delve into the depth of the game's crafting system.Cons: *The graphics are standard. Not bad, but mostly not going to impress seasoned players. Some nuances ,such as mounts, look very nice though.      *It can be considered pay to win. If you are one of those who really think ""winning"" is possible in an MMO, then you may not like this one.    *The HUD is weak, but can be customized to your liking.There's a lot more to be said about this game, but the bottom line is that it is fun for casual players who fear getting involved in the time-sink that is typically associated with MMOs			"

												Well this game is great. Has a solid community and you can really enjoy playing even talking with new people but for those of you who complain about them ""wanting money"" well they do but that dosnt stop you from having fun. But its not bad using money to purchase stuff you like if your going to play this game for a while 50$ wont hurt. Theres been many games that ive bought for example ""Cod Ghosts"" i only played like 20 hours on it for 60$ thats a rip off but since i have about 100+ hours here i wouldnt mind shelling out 20$ here and there once in a while. Just make sure you use your money on whats important first and then if you have left over money you can spend it on a video game other than that great game reccomend it to anyone :P			"

												Oh where to begin with Neverwinter. Now this review will most likely bring on a lot of controversy, but who cares.Neverwinter is a f2p MMORPG Published by Perfect World. Now a lot of Perfect World games tend to be ""Pay to Win"" to the extreme. Neverwinter is not pay to win unlike the others. The only thing to win in Neverwinter is PVP, but PVP isn't a big part of the game itself and there are no items you can pay real life money for to help you in PVP. Of course Neverwinter has an in-game currency called ""Zen"" that you can pay real life money for, but the only thing Zen lets you buy are ""Fashion Items"", dyes, companions, mounts, and a few other items not essential to own. Now of course like many other MMOs, in game currencies like Zen can allow you to pay for convenience such as buying a fast mount. Mounts serve no purpose other than getting you where you need to go at a quicker rate rather than walking. Is that Pay to Win? NO, it is not. What are you winning? A race to the quest area? People do not like spending real life money on MMOs, but the game is free is it not? So complaining is silly. Anways, the main currency in Neverwinter (that requires no real life money to earn) is called ""Astral Diamonds"". You don't want to spend real life money on Neverwinter? Have no fear, with AD you can purchase companions, mounts, and plenty of other neat items. Though for a price. 25k AD is the max you can earn with your daily quests, however, every dungeon you play you have a 90% chance of obtaining a ""Purple"" item. Purple items sell for a fair amount of AD on the auction house whether its to 20k or 1Mill. So really, earning AD is not an issue. Me? I've played Neverwinter since Beta two years ago and have never spent a dime to get the cool items I desired. I just played the game and earned AD, which as stated before, isn't as hard as people say it to be. The point of playing a game is earning what you want and working towards your goal. But many are lazy and do not want to work for what they want. I also forgot to mention, if you really want something off the Zen market but have no desire to pay real life money for exclusive items on it, did you know you can trade AD for Zen? Isn't that nice that Neverwinter allows you to do that? They give you every option in the game to get what you want without paying a single cent. I don't know about you, but thats very nice, especially for a FREE game. In game events also happen often, and every event gives you a chance to get a very unique item of some kind whether its so a very cool fast mount, a strong companion, or just a silly item like a portable throne! Now lets talk about the workers behind Neverwinter that are really a great group of people. They constantly work hard daily to keep Neverwinter running, adding new content very often, and keeping it bug free. The employees are also very easy to get ahold of and they are the most helpful bunch that will assist you with anything you need. Its very important for a game to have that. They also play Neverwinter, and they even take the time to play with players in-game and occasionally help out people in need. How cool is that? They also Stream on Twitch often and give away in game items and even phsyical items like T-Shirts. So overall, Neverwinter is one of the best free to play MMOs out right now. There's a reason I've been playing this game since beta. It even has an epic story line unlike many other MMOs that don't. Like everybody else, I skip dialog, I don't care, I just want to play. With Neverwinter, everything about it whether its to the lore or story line, is so very intriguing and makes you want to really understand whats going on and pay attention. Neverwinter is also very visually stunning and the amount of work and detail put into this game is really quite amazing. Don't believe me? Check out my screenshots and look at my Neverwinter ones. You'll also see that I have an epic mount, easily obtained by earning AD.Like MMORPGs? Want a game full of endless content you can spend countless hours on? Do you like Dungeons and Dragons? Then take the time to play Neverwinter ♥			"

												First of all this is not a pay to win game. ZEN is a currency you can buy with real money. You can convert ZEN into Astral Diamonds or do the opposite - AD into ZEN. AD can be achieved by doing daily quests and is the trading currency used in the Auction House and several merchants. You can buy ZEN to quicken your progression or make the game more convenient(e.g. extra inventory slots, respec tokens, rare companions and more). ZEN converted into AD can get you rare and powerful items from the Auction House. Only difference a paying user could have, is if he bought a Starter pack or Guardian of Neverwinter pack and he would receive exclusive gear, mounts/companions, enchants. They barely affect gameplay and only have vanity value, rather than becoming stronger. All content is the same either you're a paying user or a free user, it depends on how much are you willing to grind. You can grind to get AD and then trade it for something you want. Or be a bit more patient and do daily quests and sell unwanted stuff in the Auction house.Proffessions are a grind fest and work based of timers. You need a certain leveled/valued worker, reagents and time. Most proffesions have task times of 10-60minutes. Leadership on the other hand has 2-12hours. You can access proffesions from your browser/mobile device so if you're really determined you can progress in proffesions nicely.Neverwinter is worth a try, for a free-to-play mmo this one is indeed special.

												Fun game, They make it pretty easy to do the quest lines Without buying items from the zen market. It has a really cool browser app, So you can take care of some of your ingame responsibilities and mini games. It has a companion system which is cool. Makes it easier to solo.The only thing i hate is the queuing for dungeons, It's not like World of warcraft when you Que for one your in within a minute most times. It's not like that with this game you wait for some time or you search for players.I suggest buying one of the 59$ packs there's two of them. Don't bother buying the steam starter pack waist of a 20$. All and all its a fun game with its shoot and dodge mechanics. Your enjoy it!!			"

Instead of just standing there and pushing buttons you actually have tohe ability to dodge oppenints strikes fight at the same time.  Also with the options of the foundry and converting asteral diamonds to Zen this makes Neverwinter one of the best value free to play games out there.

												This is one of those all-consuming, addictive to the point of dehydration and starvation type of games. If you like having a social life in the ""RL"" than I dont reccomend this game for you. But honestly- this is one hell of a fun game. Theres not much I dont like about it- Good story, decent A/V, continued play with new mods released regularly. The only thing I dont care for is the Zen Market. Some of what it has to offer is pretty cool and even useful. But the pricing really sucks. If you really want to get the cool stuff, or even just buy a handful of things that make the game a bit better or more fun, then expect to pay for it. A decent mount? $15-20. A cool companion? $5-20. 10 keys that can only be bought with real money? $11.50 Oh- and the chests they open may have some really cool stuff but dont expect to get it without opening 50+.

												I've played this game for a while and I have to say, that many negative things in negative comments are true:- EndGame PvP is full of players who spend way too much money in a game and just destroy you (there are some guys out there who are stronger then your whole team)- You really need only 3 classes: Control Wizard, Great Weapon Fighter and only sometimes a Devoted Cleric- The game repeats over and over again in the EndGame because of ""campaigns"" and the same Dungeons over and over again- You often end up exploiting bugs in some dungeons and run them over and over again -> grinding as f***Please notice that I'm NOT familiar with the Books etc. I just started it because a good friend told me about it. But there are some really good aspects in the game:+ it looks nice+ the gameplay is really nice and just makes fun+ the music is nice+ real fun with some friends+ nice map/dungeon design+ theoreticly you can reach everything without spending any money, but it would take waaaay too long+ PvE is not Pay2Win+/- the community: On one side, they throw you out of the group because you don't have a 15.000+ Gearscore (shows how good your equipment is) - on the other, they'll help you and share their experience+/- Updates: The game develops more and you get more and more content - but with every update there is at least one new way to exploit a dungeon+/- Boss fights: Many of them are unique and are really great ! - But after the 5. to 10. time you kill the same boss, you'll know how to kill him easily+/- The ""ZenShop"": The ZenShop is a place where you can buy stuff with ""Zen"", you get them for real money. In this shop you can't buy any equipment but Wards, and you'll need those wards for your enchantments.All in all i can say that I had fun playing this game and I will play it further because after every dungeon you finish, after every boss you kill and after every step you advance you make in the campaigns, you'll feel better and you can see how you develop your character. If you have another opinion pls share it in the comments below. It's a game worth a try because it's free2play :3			"

The game is more based on making money, not making social contact. I found it hard to build a deacent community. Developers need to work on the social aspect. But if you have some friends to play with, it is a fun game to play. And challenging enough if no laggs appear. It is a 50/50 from me but it is worth trying, it is free.			"

So. This game is one of the most epick MMORPG's out there. It has a greate sistem and a lot of content.Me miself i like to play FPS's like TF2, Tribes: Ascend, CoD: BO2 and so on. Buth i take a brake and i get into this. A open world game, and really fun to play by yourself or with friends. When it was in beta it came out good, buth now it is just a complete sistem of playing for fun. No money nedded to be spended and if you will have a ""thing"" for this game go check out the guy whos link to a dicusion i sended. He will teach youa nd show you a lot more than i will (no that guy is not me).So if you really like World of Warcraft and games like that, this is the best thing you will come by. I would play WoW, buth spending 5-10 euros a month just so i can become higher level than 20 its just too much. Now this game is rare also in this: Economy. It has a greate economy and it works like TF2 Tradeing. You can exchange your in game money (dimonds) for Zen (currency to buy with money).Owerall the only thing id sead that is wrong is that not a lot of people know this game. Belive me you will maybe not like it a first... Buth after some days (just to brake the ice) you will fall in love with it.Greate game if you are bored and if you are not bored. PvP, dungeon raids, and manny more is in it. Go now download it, put a like on this game and start playing.			"

												Been playing this one since the beta so my hours don't quite reflect my overall experience with NW, just switched to the Steam version in the last little while;As MMOs go this is one of the more solo (but then why are you playing a MMO?) play friendly and is less P2W, non-cser friendly then most out there currently.  BUT.....- Unless you are going to grind grind grind expect to get frustrated with PvP or unless you have mad PvP skills; that sometimes conpensates for the unbalanced gear that some CSers have.  - Visually the game is pretty and has nice seasonal (albeit repetitive) events- PvE is pretty non-cs friendly and with smart groups very manageable and fun- Anything you want is obtainable but it will take an exhorbant amount of time to farm the AD for it; but the fact that it is obtainable at all, puts NW in a different category then most cash shop oriented MMOs.-  For the most part its a pretty friendly community, though like in every MMO you get the odd epeener or epeen oriented guild :D*  A little note to the above, lately it seems that most ingame events and the latest modules (updates) seem to be more cash shopper friendly then in the past, so the non-cser friendly status might become outdated soon.

												I don't have thousands of hours on this game like some other people on here but at first play, this game is incredible. Most modern mmorpgs out there are stuck in a rut where everyone in the game is wearing the same armor to get the same stats because there no differences between classes, except for roles.This game has so much to it. 40 hours of gameplay may get you close to that cap but you are far from done. The complexities of choosing the right moves(sorry infinite hotbar people) choosing the right stats, choosing the right gear, choosing the right abilities will keep you going in this game for a long time.Comabt is hands down some the best an MMORPG has seen, improving upon the Guild Wars dodge mechanics. PvP is about more than seeing who can run the best circles and press the moves in a better faster rotation, there is actually some skill involved. The missions and story may leave you wishing you cared a little bit more; and maybe got a little more out the quests but the combat system will keep you glued to your seat. Better to have amazing combat and an incredible roleplay speccing system then amazing dialogue and story options.8/10Graphics should be better for a game that is a year and a half oldLearning curve is LONGsometimes patches will leave the game unplayable(is fixed quickly though)story is weakdungeons feel a little to short			"

												I have been looking for a game like this for a long time...Finally a mmo rpg with a good combat system! you can tell this game is made by gamers as everything about it is simple and well done.All varification is simple and it actually is free, like lol it`s pay if you want type content you dont have to pay to succseed in the game.The pvp is good and there are fun events and updates best mmo rpg i have ever played. The artwork is great and the game isn`t very laggy (even with my computer) epic storylines and with a tool to let players create there own quests there is an unlimited amount of gameplay, real credit to the makers of Neverwinter! 5/5 star			"

												Positives: * Good implementation of DnD game mechanics. * Good combat mechanics. * Good pace for leveling* Not terribly easy to screw up your character* Clear quest succession path* Handholding is moderately optionalNegatives:* Bad Voice acting* Bad plot* Bad dialog* Bad Graphics* Extraordinarily freemium (however that doesn't seem to effect anything outside PvP and player rank)* You have to pay to make more than two characters, and you have to pay to redistribute points. Overall, good MMO. Really enjoying it.			"

												wow, talk about a pay-to-win game...it says that all content is available free-to-play and that is technicaly true but unless you feel like paying to obtain certain ingredients to upgrade your weapons so you can actually participate at an appropriate level don't play this game.  I understand that this is how they make their money, and it is a well designed game so they do deserve to get paid, but the amount that it costs is ridiculous.  There are certain packs like the dragon born and hero of the north packs whose price translates into well over 100 dollars for a small amount of items that give you minimal help.  This is by far the most expensive free-to-play game that i have ever participated in, even more expensive than dungeons and dragons online unlimited.			"

												Straight and plain and mainly short because Steam is flooded with too many too long game reviews: NeverwinterN has become a great disappontment to me; I have played so many hours because I like the fantasy world of Baldurs Gate and wanted to delve into the lore and storyline. But apart from this you will find only bilions of bugs and ""spend money"" adds in the game. It is beyond my understanding how the game developers could have gotten away with just 1 (in words: one) music loop in the main city all those years. Controls are clumsy. Pvp is terrible. While it is called ftp, I hardly have seen anything more demanding your money. You can play without spending a single cent, but you will probably end up like me: playing an online game as single-player adventure, hoping it will crash just several times a day. Dont waste your time trying to play it.			"

												This game used to be amazing I played most of my time on Xbox One and i still think its a brilliant game but my review is based on how it is now and not the fun ive had in the past.Effectivly all the content before you hit a platau is to get you hooked in the story is pretty unimaganitive its all about better loot as are all MMOs really. Once you cap you have weeklys and dungeons/the real campaign but to really get anywhere in this game its hugly pay to win. want a decent mount above 80% speed how about 10 pound minimum spend...how about a new decent companion? yep 10 pound minimum spend. Expansion for the game how about 40 pound and theres a few. I bought the Dragon expansion a mount a companion and a few other things and realised even then i was nowhere i end up spending 80 pound to hit another platau and before i could even get to where most of my clan where the game would have expected me to pay 200 - 500 pounds. The game is infact VERRYYY expencive and it tries to hook you in with the first buy then you think ohh i cant go back now just no its a game with no real replayability unless your willing to spend a fortune. You cant even make that much in game money that yes is transferable to real money to buy stuff but untill you have spent to much the more you spend the more you make.very very pay to play if you want a game you can keep playing without having to spend more and more money then id not recomend this game at all.as my old mate Admiral Ackbar said ""ITS A TRAP!""

												I've played this for about six months, though recently moved to Steam.First of all, the game is definitely not P2W. There are some cool items that you can get by paying, but mostly, they just look cool, or are unique, but in no way ""win"" the game for you. There's about 30 hours of great storyline in the PvE, but then the end-game gets quite ""grindish"", with only small gains in items or skills to get out of it. PvP is limited to an arena game, similar to most arena PvP games, but definitely takes some in-game focus to get good, especially at cap where the the early level 60 players are up against those with months of gear advantage.One favorite of mine is that the ""for purchase"" currency (zen) is available to trade on an in-game market for the ""earned"" currency (astral diamonds), which helps make even pay items available to non-paying characters without using sketchy outside markets.

												Welcome back to Neverwinter, ♥♥♥♥ is about to hit the fan!This is a MMO-game set in the world of wizards of the coast's Dungeons and Dragons world in the area that they call Neverwinter. You start of in a standed ship and from there on you go into the capital of Neverwinter to follow your quest and get new ones. Even though this is just another MMO game set in a medieval era style, it is amazing. I had a lot of fun playing this MMO and I really got the Dungeons and Dragons feel just as I have while playing the normal D&D game. The atmosphere is really good and the controls are easy to understand, for new and for experienced players.The game has also other things that are better than most MMO's. For example in most MMO's you just do your quest and level your character. In D&D Neverwinter you really want to follow the story and you really try to understand what is going on and what you need to do.Another great thing about this game is that the combat is more action-orientated. You do not use a key to switch between your targets, you really have to aim for them before you do your attack. That is in my opinion much better.Next to that, it doesn't really matter if you play this game alone or with friends, one way or another you are going to like this game and you keep playing.This story short: It is amazing so just play this game!

												(Hours on Steam are incorrect as I used to play with Perfect Worlds launcher and have at least 300 hours+)I started playing Neverwinter back in open Beta and honestly would have recommended this game to anyone and everyone since I genuinely loved the game back then, I had endless hours of fun and took away a lot of good memories from people I met while playing. The game sadly went to the dogs though after mod 3 release, it became blatantly P2W (Pay to Win) and if you weren't willing to put your hand in your pocket to deck out your character then you better be damned willing to give up having any kind of life of sorts and 100% commit to playing with short breaks because you will need to grind like you've never ginded before and even then it will probably take you months just to get one item out of many that you require to progress through the game.Neverwinter is also very quick to permanently banned your account when you've done nothing wrong (Guild members of mine had to make new accounts and start from scratch) oh and that super rare item from that super rare drop that you apparently just got? Yeah, don't get too excited, it hasn't went into your bag.The customer services suck so don't expect them to help you with anything. So over all? Great game with lots of potential but yeno... They care more about money than having a great game.  "

												Neverwinter offers almost everything that you could want form an MMORPG. There are tons of stuff to do, hell of a nominal system that will get your head spinning (even too much) but what lacks the most, is community aspect. The game is more based on making money, not making social contact. I found it hard to build a deacent community. Developers need to work on the social aspect. But if you have some friends to play with, it is a fun game to play. And challenging enough if no laggs appear. It is a 50/50 from me but it is worth trying, it is free.			"

More downloads, only in patching. To clarify, anywhere from 600 MB to 2000 MBs of space needed. I don't have the time, nor memory available for such a large game. Unless you have a fast computer/laptop, my suggestion is to stay away from this game. Especially if it leaves FtP status.			"

												This game is great but with some small tiny things that should be improved on. The first one is mouth animations and head movements seem waaaaaaaaayyyy unrealistic and inhuman. They need to make the npc's talking more life like but hey just look like robots opening they're mouths. I know this can be done without much effort, its just time consuming to make a bunch of new face and head animations. Lazy.Next is the peformance of the game which i may say is terrible considering the graphics in the game are mid ranged. I understand that its a mmorpg and they're are other players in the game and tons of models running around should boggle down my system but seriously the lvls where they're are only enemies and npc's should run smoothly but they don't. There needs to be better optimization of the video cards that work with the game im talking about AMD and ATI cards. I have two cards on 2 different systems my nvidia 640 works well but my ati 4850 which by the way is faster and better performing then the recommended 2900 gt runs wayyyyy slow. Thats a no no.Last probably something I havent figured out on the controls but attack dash or whatever you call it should bigger or maybe im missing something i just need to customize it because as you get to higher lvls you get more skills and I want to be able to use ALL my skills not the juts 3 on my action dash. Lame.Don't let me start on Qeue for dungeons cause its hella annoying sitting there for like 2 hours so that 1 person would join instead of spamming the LFG channel to get someone to party with you to do a dungie. I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY WHEN IM QEUE FOR DUGEONS AND FOR A SPECIFIC ONE everyone in the channel is LFG for that same dungeon. We shouldn't have beg other players to be like hey man wanna do a dungeon. Or you message someone whos been spamming the channel and they tell you that they already have people its just annoying and inconsistent. YOU GUYS ARE WASTING PEOPLES PRECIOUS TIME.Even thought this game has its faults the game is excellent the enemies and the lore and crafting is awesome.The companion thing is pretty awesome too.

												If you love Forgotten Realms, play this game for the leveling experience, then quit.  Pretend you read a book - it's sad, the book ended, now it's time to move on with life.  Maybe start a new character and reread the book.  Just don't spend money buying the same book over and over again.  Perfect World Entertainment is a scam company with no credibility in the mmo marketplace, and every single game they ""develop"" (quotes intentional) are just thinly-veiled attempts at getting your money.  They lure you in with a fantastic concept, spoil you a bit as you level, then crush your soul with impossible pay walls when you've reached high/max levels.   As a huge fan of the FR universe, and RA Salvatore, I really enjoy the storyline and the leveling, just DO NOT SPEND MONEY ON THIS GAME.			"

												Without even touching on it's pay to win nature... It's been out over 2 years and there's still only 8 'classes'. Actually only 7, but there's two versions of fighter. When the game was first announced and the idea of getting to play all the varied classes and archetypes sounded like it would be great.Here we are over two years later and the starting 4 options that looked so promising have only been joined by 4 other options. That's 1 class every 6 months or so, such speed.I guess it's a great plan if they're wanting to keep this game going for 20 years, since that's how long it'll take them to cover the usual 12 base classes and each of their 3 or 4 archetypes.

												This game is  money grab pure and simple. All free to play has some purchase options, however, most are not as highly priced as the items in Neverwinter.  To buy enough Zen to purchase the dragon born or drow racial packs it costs you the price of a full game. This is for the race and a hero slot with very little else. These packs should by no means be more than $10 for what you get in them. Zen is completely unjustifiable at its current price. Astral diamonds, which is the in game currency, can be built up over time, but once you do it is not unheard of for the system to glitch you out of it. I recently lost 102K AD for a 7000 stronghold donation. The response from customer service was oops, oh well. The game play if fine, just dont expect to have any of the good items in this game without having $100's of dollars to spend on it.			"

PVP on low levels is kinda balanced but then high levels its not , You are in pvp with 8k Power and the other guy is there with 27 k power :) thats like totally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t . so PAY TO WIN GAME . I suggest you not to waste time in this game unless u are willing to spend money on this game cuz PVP is unbalanced and even PVE when they have $$$$$$ paid stuff they do hell of dps :) i would rate 5/10			"

												If you think it's F2P, try riding that ♥♥♥♥ing horse to PvP and fight P2P players riding their shiny dragons/epic mounts, and you will see the difference between F2P and P2P. If it's truly F2P game, it should be possible to farm Astral Diamond with reasonable amount of afford and time, but this is just plain money grab. Even so, difference between F2P players and P2P players shouldn't be *this* HUGE. Maybe you can pull it out being F2P to level 70, however, you will have a hard time completing quests, let alone PvP. Not just this, the game mechanic itself is RIDICULOUS; crafting, equipping, profession etc. not to mention bugs, lags, hackers.

												Allow me to start this review by saying that the game in it's basic,free to play version is a decent one to say the least,with a pretty nice community and enjoyable gameplay.Why then am I not recommening this game?It is common knowledge that these types of games are leaning more and more towards P2W,but while other games might actually care about you if you spend money,not this one.Not if use your Steam Wallet to buy the products at any rate.I used my Steam Wallet to buy some currency called Zen,hoping to sell it in game for quick Astral Diamonds,which is basically the common currency.Not only was I not rewarded the First Time buyer's pack,which is reserved for people who buy directly from Arc,my account was put on Probation: meaning anything I buy is bound to my account and I am unable to sell Zen.You would think a day or two while they verify the payment would be understandable,but it has been a week and a half and I am still on probation.I thought fine,lets try something else,so I bought Enchanted Keys which let you open Lockboxes,hoping to find a decent item to sell in the Auction House.The keys were also bound but what they fail to mention is EVEN THE REWARDS IN THE LOCKBOXES WILL BE BOUND.So for example if you found a mount selling for around 6million Astral Diamonds which you do not like or already have you're stuck with it.I can almost hear people say ""Dum*a// of course the rewards will be bound,your key was also bound"" but you are wrong,VIP players (and yes I am one) get an Enchanted Key everyday which is also bound,however the rewards opened with it are not.So to recap,I do recommend this game in the Free to Play mode,possibly get VIP,but do not bother using more money to be treated like a third grade citizen.

												I've played this game a few months after it originally launched on PC and ended up quitting several times for the same reason. I'll break this down into categories: (tl;dr located at bottom)Itemizing+ Equipment isn't too hard to get. However, in the latest versions, the gear choices are a lot more static than they used to be. Doesn't offer too much customization.- Enchants are broken beyond belief. Getting the required amount of shards for Weapon/Armor enchants isn't hard. However, they all have a 1% chance to succeed. Forcing you to either grind and play a ridiculously unfair game of RNG or simply invest into the cash shop. Normal enchants aren't too much of a pain until you get them to Lvl 7, then they get very expensive and the success rates plummet.- Legendary weapons, while good in idea, have been ruined in multiple ways. Refinement Point Items (RP Items) used to be a lot more common than they are now. However, botters started farming them and flooded the market with them which effectively reduced the price of the items and made them available for everyone. However, Cryptic decided to make RP items bound when picked up which effectively destroyed the market. As a result, RP items are too expensive, the game doesn't offer a lot of money making possibilities, and the legendary weapons cost too much to upgrade- Legendary Armor/Accessories. Once again, completely imbalanced. In the current state of the game, there are many options to choose from but only about 3 that are viable and worth upgrading. The community has been very vocal about this and nothing has been done about it. The only improvements are obvious bugs with some of the sets have been corrected.Class Design- Many of the classes have serious problems with some or all of their Paragon Paths or skills. Hunter Rangers, for example, all typically resort to the game Paragon Path and the same Feat Path because the other two are underperforming or riddled with bugs. Scourge Warlocks suffer the same thing. Trickster Rogues also have a broken Paragon Path. There are too many classes that have had problems (some spanning years in the making) that have not been acknowledged or fixed+ For the sake of it, each class does bring something different to the table. The difference between a GWF and GF are very obvious. CW vs SW is also a very different kit. How these affect the game is a different storyUI and Game Mechanics+ The game separates itself from a typical MMO by limiting the number of active skills and redefining how passive skills work. Unlike a game like FFXIV, which has a ton of hotbars, Neverwinter limits you to 2 At-Wills, 3 Encounters, and 2 Daily Powers. Also, unlike most conventional MMOs, NW requires you to equip the passive you want to use instead of it being active at all times. You're limited to 2 active passive skills at a time.+ The User Interface is pretty simple and easy to navigate. It's intuitive and does what it needs to. Each menu in the game serves its own purpose and lots of tooltips are available.- This may be a personal problem but I would prefer if the skills had some sort of scaling formula on them to show how stats, equipment, and buffs affect the output of the skill.- Many options for Encounters, Dailies, At-Wills, and Passives do not serve any sort of purpose in any part of the game. This is part of Class Design.- The Matchmaking system for PvP and PvE is completely broken. PvE matchmaking does not respect any kind of party composition, so it's entirely possible to be matched into a party with 5 DPS and no heal/tank class. The same applies to PvP. Healing classes in PvP are an asset, so instead of evenly dividing classes between two teams, it's entirely possible for 5 DPS to be matched against 5 Healers which typically results in a permanent stalemate.PvE Mechanics+/- Previously, the game had a very respectable array of dungeons and skirmishes to choose from, both for leveling and endgame. Module 7 removed all but a handful of these and they still have not re-added all of the previously removed content which makes it very dull. However, for the instances they did re-add, their difficulties have been scaled up.+/- The item level requirements on endgame dungeons are incredibly misleading. Unlike, for instance, Tera, which scales its requirements on the general level of equipment you should have to attempt an instance, NW's requirements do not follow any sort of meaningful logic. iLvl can be inflated in a variety of ways and, as previously stated, the Matchmaking system does not allow viable party composition. Also noteworthy is that because iLvl can be inflated, someone with the iLvl to enter the instance can end up doing worse than someone who does not meet the requirements- The biggest problem with PvE content is also tied into class designs. Some classes underperform in PvE compared to all of their competitors. For instance, the difference between CW and SW. CW brings some modicum of Crowd Control to the party as well as DPS. SW brings comparable, if not lower, DPS and no Crowd Control. This leaves to very static party comps that do not accept certain classes.- The money-making possibilities from PvE activities are absurdly low. Given the price of RP items, enchantments, companions, etc, the rewards from PvE are ridiculously low and capped per day at an abysmally low amount. Furthermore, most of the equipment gained from dungeons is bound so it can't be traded for money anyway.+/- Two different currencies exist in Neverwinter: Astral Diamonds and Gold. Gold is pretty useless, only good for buying some consumables from NPCs (You'll typically only buy Injury Kits) and the starter mounts. Astral Diamonds (AD, henceforth) is used for literally everything else.PvP- PvP activities are very static. Of all of the PvP maps and modes available, none of them are based on actual PvP (Similar to TDM, DM, Assassination, etc). They're all based on point capture. The two IWD Zones only turn into capture maps during the Heroic Encounter that spawns at certain times of the day, however, these zones are usually very barren.- Very few improvements have been made to the PvP modes since the game was originally launched.- Some classes outperform other classes in every regard. For instance, and yet again, a CW is much more of an asset than a SW. A GF, the dedicated tanking class, has comparable DPS abilities to a GWF, the heavy weapon class. Some classes, once upgraded to a certain point, are effectively immortal when under focus fire from a group. Put simply, the class balance in PvP does not exist.- A lot of class balancing decisions are made from PvP-based feedback. For instance, Combat HRs were complained about for a long time. They weren't amazing in PvE either. As a result of the PvP feedback, the Combat spec was nerfed. The same thing happened to Whisperknife TRs as well. Ironically, if you start from older mods (Mod 3-ish), you'll notice a certain trend in the devs' logic against nerfing a single class. Might be a conspiracy theory but it sure stands out.tl;dr:The game has too many problems. Some classes are a complete waste of time due to bugs and underperforming compared to other classes which makes PvP more trouble than its worth and PvE a pain in the ♥♥♥. The game is hosted by a company that has no other desire than to make money. This is obvious when the developers ask for community feedback and after a 50 page thread of feedback, they completely disregard it and make nonsensical changes to the game that do not fix the problem.I would not recommend this game to anyone. Even someone I hate.			"

												Fun game, They make it pretty easy to do the quest lines Without buying items from the zen market. It has a really cool browser app, So you can take care of some of your ingame responsibilities and mini games. It has a companion system which is cool. Makes it easier to solo.The only thing i hate is the queuing for dungeons, It's not like World of warcraft when you Que for one your in within a minute most times. It's not like that with this game you wait for some time or you search for players.I suggest buying one of the 59$ packs there's two of them. Don't bother buying the steam starter pack waist of a 20$. All and all its a fun game with its shoot and dodge mechanics. Your enjoy it!!			"

												Been playing this one since the beta so my hours don't quite reflect my overall experience with NW, just switched to the Steam version in the last little while;As MMOs go this is one of the more solo (but then why are you playing a MMO?) play friendly and is less P2W, non-cser friendly then most out there currently.  BUT.....- Unless you are going to grind grind grind expect to get frustrated with PvP or unless you have mad PvP skills; that sometimes conpensates for the unbalanced gear that some CSers have.  - Visually the game is pretty and has nice seasonal (albeit repetitive) events- PvE is pretty non-cs friendly and with smart groups very manageable and fun- Anything you want is obtainable but it will take an exhorbant amount of time to farm the AD for it; but the fact that it is obtainable at all, puts NW in a different category then most cash shop oriented MMOs.-  For the most part its a pretty friendly community, though like in every MMO you get the odd epeener or epeen oriented guild :D*  A little note to the above, lately it seems that most ingame events and the latest modules (updates) seem to be more cash shopper friendly then in the past, so the non-cser friendly status might become outdated soon.

												This game is great but with some small tiny things that should be improved on. The first one is mouth animations and head movements seem waaaaaaaaayyyy unrealistic and inhuman. They need to make the npc's talking more life like but hey just look like robots opening they're mouths. I know this can be done without much effort, its just time consuming to make a bunch of new face and head animations. Lazy.Next is the peformance of the game which i may say is terrible considering the graphics in the game are mid ranged. I understand that its a mmorpg and they're are other players in the game and tons of models running around should boggle down my system but seriously the lvls where they're are only enemies and npc's should run smoothly but they don't. There needs to be better optimization of the video cards that work with the game im talking about AMD and ATI cards. I have two cards on 2 different systems my nvidia 640 works well but my ati 4850 which by the way is faster and better performing then the recommended 2900 gt runs wayyyyy slow. Thats a no no.Last probably something I havent figured out on the controls but attack dash or whatever you call it should bigger or maybe im missing something i just need to customize it because as you get to higher lvls you get more skills and I want to be able to use ALL my skills not the juts 3 on my action dash. Lame.Don't let me start on Qeue for dungeons cause its hella annoying sitting there for like 2 hours so that 1 person would join instead of spamming the LFG channel to get someone to party with you to do a dungie. I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY WHEN IM QEUE FOR DUGEONS AND FOR A SPECIFIC ONE everyone in the channel is LFG for that same dungeon. We shouldn't have beg other players to be like hey man wanna do a dungeon. Or you message someone whos been spamming the channel and they tell you that they already have people its just annoying and inconsistent. YOU GUYS ARE WASTING PEOPLES PRECIOUS TIME.Even thought this game has its faults the game is excellent the enemies and the lore and crafting is awesome.The companion thing is pretty awesome too.

												This game is  money grab pure and simple. All free to play has some purchase options, however, most are not as highly priced as the items in Neverwinter.  To buy enough Zen to purchase the dragon born or drow racial packs it costs you the price of a full game. This is for the race and a hero slot with very little else. These packs should by no means be more than $10 for what you get in them. Zen is completely unjustifiable at its current price. Astral diamonds, which is the in game currency, can be built up over time, but once you do it is not unheard of for the system to glitch you out of it. I recently lost 102K AD for a 7000 stronghold donation. The response from customer service was oops, oh well. The game play if fine, just dont expect to have any of the good items in this game without having $100's of dollars to spend on it.			"

												I really had high hopes for this game.  It isn't that it's a bad game.  The fact is that most Perfect World games are cash shop oriented.  I intend to go back and play the new expansion at some point, but this game drastically fails at endgame.  Many of it's counterparts suffer from the same issue.  It's 4th edition mechanics as they were meant to be enjoyed, digitally.  It's a solid game for the most part, but the business model, and endgame inbalance means I can't fully recommend it.   Unfortunately there aren't very many D&D games available.  I would say go play Sword Coast Legends though if you want a proper D&D experience in a game.			"

												I've played it for a bit before steam and well I enjoyed the game, but it isn't D&D and it doesn't try to be D&D, it's basically a good mmo that has some D&D references. This is a good game in it's own right, the problem with all things D&D is that it's a money sink but it's very clearly a money sink, not as badly as DDO is a money pit but its there. The good thing is it isn't as bad as DDO where its clearly pay to win but as you get up in levels you start to feel like things are missing from the game and eventually you've spent $200 and didn't even realize it. I'm a big fan of buying your game but in order to buy this game you need to put in about $600 or more, for some people that's nothing but to me that's $540 more than I want to spend on one game.In the end the game isn't bad, there aren't game breaking bugs, the presentation and production quality are nice but it's just a generic mmo so don't get your hopes up thinking this is some massive world where you can plane shift to the feywild or create your own demiplane and otherworldly leap around a beholder like some kind of Jedi, this is not D&D and it doesn't try to be but again it's still a pretty good game.The not recommended is because it is a money sink and you could basically get three full 5e campaigns for the amount of money this game pulls from you just to get the ammenities.

They don't even attempt to appear to care about players.

												If you think it's F2P, try riding that ♥♥♥♥ing horse to PvP and fight P2P players riding their shiny dragons/epic mounts, and you will see the difference between F2P and P2P. If it's truly F2P game, it should be possible to farm Astral Diamond with reasonable amount of afford and time, but this is just plain money grab. Even so, difference between F2P players and P2P players shouldn't be *this* HUGE. Maybe you can pull it out being F2P to level 70, however, you will have a hard time completing quests, let alone PvP. Not just this, the game mechanic itself is RIDICULOUS; crafting, equipping, profession etc. not to mention bugs, lags, hackers.

												Allow me to start this review by saying that the game in it's basic,free to play version is a decent one to say the least,with a pretty nice community and enjoyable gameplay.Why then am I not recommening this game?It is common knowledge that these types of games are leaning more and more towards P2W,but while other games might actually care about you if you spend money,not this one.Not if use your Steam Wallet to buy the products at any rate.I used my Steam Wallet to buy some currency called Zen,hoping to sell it in game for quick Astral Diamonds,which is basically the common currency.Not only was I not rewarded the First Time buyer's pack,which is reserved for people who buy directly from Arc,my account was put on Probation: meaning anything I buy is bound to my account and I am unable to sell Zen.You would think a day or two while they verify the payment would be understandable,but it has been a week and a half and I am still on probation.I thought fine,lets try something else,so I bought Enchanted Keys which let you open Lockboxes,hoping to find a decent item to sell in the Auction House.The keys were also bound but what they fail to mention is EVEN THE REWARDS IN THE LOCKBOXES WILL BE BOUND.So for example if you found a mount selling for around 6million Astral Diamonds which you do not like or already have you're stuck with it.I can almost hear people say ""Dum*a// of course the rewards will be bound,your key was also bound"" but you are wrong,VIP players (and yes I am one) get an Enchanted Key everyday which is also bound,however the rewards opened with it are not.So to recap,I do recommend this game in the Free to Play mode,possibly get VIP,but do not bother using more money to be treated like a third grade citizen.

												I've played this game a few months after it originally launched on PC and ended up quitting several times for the same reason. I'll break this down into categories: (tl;dr located at bottom)Itemizing+ Equipment isn't too hard to get. However, in the latest versions, the gear choices are a lot more static than they used to be. Doesn't offer too much customization.- Enchants are broken beyond belief. Getting the required amount of shards for Weapon/Armor enchants isn't hard. However, they all have a 1% chance to succeed. Forcing you to either grind and play a ridiculously unfair game of RNG or simply invest into the cash shop. Normal enchants aren't too much of a pain until you get them to Lvl 7, then they get very expensive and the success rates plummet.- Legendary weapons, while good in idea, have been ruined in multiple ways. Refinement Point Items (RP Items) used to be a lot more common than they are now. However, botters started farming them and flooded the market with them which effectively reduced the price of the items and made them available for everyone. However, Cryptic decided to make RP items bound when picked up which effectively destroyed the market. As a result, RP items are too expensive, the game doesn't offer a lot of money making possibilities, and the legendary weapons cost too much to upgrade- Legendary Armor/Accessories. Once again, completely imbalanced. In the current state of the game, there are many options to choose from but only about 3 that are viable and worth upgrading. The community has been very vocal about this and nothing has been done about it. The only improvements are obvious bugs with some of the sets have been corrected.Class Design- Many of the classes have serious problems with some or all of their Paragon Paths or skills. Hunter Rangers, for example, all typically resort to the game Paragon Path and the same Feat Path because the other two are underperforming or riddled with bugs. Scourge Warlocks suffer the same thing. Trickster Rogues also have a broken Paragon Path. There are too many classes that have had problems (some spanning years in the making) that have not been acknowledged or fixed+ For the sake of it, each class does bring something different to the table. The difference between a GWF and GF are very obvious. CW vs SW is also a very different kit. How these affect the game is a different storyUI and Game Mechanics+ The game separates itself from a typical MMO by limiting the number of active skills and redefining how passive skills work. Unlike a game like FFXIV, which has a ton of hotbars, Neverwinter limits you to 2 At-Wills, 3 Encounters, and 2 Daily Powers. Also, unlike most conventional MMOs, NW requires you to equip the passive you want to use instead of it being active at all times. You're limited to 2 active passive skills at a time.+ The User Interface is pretty simple and easy to navigate. It's intuitive and does what it needs to. Each menu in the game serves its own purpose and lots of tooltips are available.- This may be a personal problem but I would prefer if the skills had some sort of scaling formula on them to show how stats, equipment, and buffs affect the output of the skill.- Many options for Encounters, Dailies, At-Wills, and Passives do not serve any sort of purpose in any part of the game. This is part of Class Design.- The Matchmaking system for PvP and PvE is completely broken. PvE matchmaking does not respect any kind of party composition, so it's entirely possible to be matched into a party with 5 DPS and no heal/tank class. The same applies to PvP. Healing classes in PvP are an asset, so instead of evenly dividing classes between two teams, it's entirely possible for 5 DPS to be matched against 5 Healers which typically results in a permanent stalemate.PvE Mechanics+/- Previously, the game had a very respectable array of dungeons and skirmishes to choose from, both for leveling and endgame. Module 7 removed all but a handful of these and they still have not re-added all of the previously removed content which makes it very dull. However, for the instances they did re-add, their difficulties have been scaled up.+/- The item level requirements on endgame dungeons are incredibly misleading. Unlike, for instance, Tera, which scales its requirements on the general level of equipment you should have to attempt an instance, NW's requirements do not follow any sort of meaningful logic. iLvl can be inflated in a variety of ways and, as previously stated, the Matchmaking system does not allow viable party composition. Also noteworthy is that because iLvl can be inflated, someone with the iLvl to enter the instance can end up doing worse than someone who does not meet the requirements- The biggest problem with PvE content is also tied into class designs. Some classes underperform in PvE compared to all of their competitors. For instance, the difference between CW and SW. CW brings some modicum of Crowd Control to the party as well as DPS. SW brings comparable, if not lower, DPS and no Crowd Control. This leaves to very static party comps that do not accept certain classes.- The money-making possibilities from PvE activities are absurdly low. Given the price of RP items, enchantments, companions, etc, the rewards from PvE are ridiculously low and capped per day at an abysmally low amount. Furthermore, most of the equipment gained from dungeons is bound so it can't be traded for money anyway.+/- Two different currencies exist in Neverwinter: Astral Diamonds and Gold. Gold is pretty useless, only good for buying some consumables from NPCs (You'll typically only buy Injury Kits) and the starter mounts. Astral Diamonds (AD, henceforth) is used for literally everything else.PvP- PvP activities are very static. Of all of the PvP maps and modes available, none of them are based on actual PvP (Similar to TDM, DM, Assassination, etc). They're all based on point capture. The two IWD Zones only turn into capture maps during the Heroic Encounter that spawns at certain times of the day, however, these zones are usually very barren.- Very few improvements have been made to the PvP modes since the game was originally launched.- Some classes outperform other classes in every regard. For instance, and yet again, a CW is much more of an asset than a SW. A GF, the dedicated tanking class, has comparable DPS abilities to a GWF, the heavy weapon class. Some classes, once upgraded to a certain point, are effectively immortal when under focus fire from a group. Put simply, the class balance in PvP does not exist.- A lot of class balancing decisions are made from PvP-based feedback. For instance, Combat HRs were complained about for a long time. They weren't amazing in PvE either. As a result of the PvP feedback, the Combat spec was nerfed. The same thing happened to Whisperknife TRs as well. Ironically, if you start from older mods (Mod 3-ish), you'll notice a certain trend in the devs' logic against nerfing a single class. Might be a conspiracy theory but it sure stands out.tl;dr:The game has too many problems. Some classes are a complete waste of time due to bugs and underperforming compared to other classes which makes PvP more trouble than its worth and PvE a pain in the ♥♥♥. The game is hosted by a company that has no other desire than to make money. This is obvious when the developers ask for community feedback and after a 50 page thread of feedback, they completely disregard it and make nonsensical changes to the game that do not fix the problem.I would not recommend this game to anyone. Even someone I hate.			"

For the events and dungeons that require more players you can just join random groups that need players, making it almost a casual MMO if that's how you prefer to play.You don't even need to be a fan of the Forgotten Realms universe to enjoy this one, but if you do you'll like how true to the lore it is.

												This game is fun, but there are some flaws. You can grind up a character to lvl 60 in 2.5 days. One day during double xp events easy. Rogues are horribly overpowered in pvp. Their disables are too long compared to other classes and their damage is too high. Rangers have to channel an instant for 2 seconds to even come close to the same damage, and that gets interrupted on any damage taken. So, get a rogue, dominate pvp.			"

												SORRY FOR MY BAD GRAMMER I RUSHED THROUGH THISThis Game is one of the best mmo's i have seen. Honestly do have some problems, but there is no perfect mmo.My Pros to the game.1.Character Creation. It was easy to understand, and I didnt find myself taking hours just to make my character look nice2.Graphics are great. the game doesnt look like your run of the mill averge rpg.3.leveling is fast and fun.4.Objectives of quest are most of the time clear.5.although i dont like class based skills, they where done quite well in this.6.PVP, This has its flaws and perfections7.The story is over all good8.levels are nicely done8.Many People have been saying this game is pay to play or pay to win........... allthough i can see how they can get the idea, but let me tell you what a pay to play its....... runescape, have you ever playied it? well i have you have to pay to unlock skills, map parts, armor, weapons, and many other things. this game is not pay to play by a long shot.... granted there are some things that are anoying examples... companion  upgrades.... character slots... and other things, but it still isnt pay to play because of astral diamonds. granted it takes time to get these it isnt imposible. u can get up to 3000-4000 a day just by doing pvp....................................................... or even more if u do dungeons  and other stuff........you can also get them from profesions like leadership.... you log in click a few buttons set a task, do some pvp and bam u got u some astral........Cons to this game.1. Skill tree: Some times i just look at my feets/ skill point and im like am i doing this right.2.i go through 20 levels and my armor looks like the same ♥♥♥♥ i had on at the boat crash like wat3.PVP. has some balancing to do4.sometimes i find myself lost on a level and im like what am i suppose to be doing again.5.the heck is up with the dlc's jesusAGAIN SORRY DIDNT CHECK FOR GRAMMER JUST TYPED SO yea...Over all this is a great game.

												PROS 1. Interesting combat system.Heroes are able to press the Shift button to execute unique abilities e.g. dodging, shield. Red areas showing AOE appear in the combat zone to show where enemy abilities are about to be cast allowing players to have an interactive PvE environment. It gives players simple but fun instructions on what to do.2. Quest directions. A shiny path will light up a waypoint to your quest helping players to end their quest faster and removing the need to search aimlessly or look for an online guide. Minor bugs do occur as the shiny path tends to jump to quests that it thinks are closest to you e.g. Switches to Quest A when you intend to do Quest B when Quest A is miles away and Quest B is next to you.3. Graphics. Better graphics compared to some other MMOs.CONS 1. The game is too biased towards players who spend money. There are 2 in-game currencies called Zen and Astral Diamonds that can be exchanged with real-world cash. Both currencies are able to buy essential items such as bank storage, bags, mounts, equipment, refining, auction house items and etc. E.g. You can only upgrade your companion for 200,000 Astral Diamonds or 30 in-house currency. You can buy your level 60 gear using Astral diamonds from the auction house.2.Tedious system of leveling. Players have to spend points into 1. Feats 2. Power 3. Attributes. Each tree can actually conflict in min-maxing your skills if you are not careful. Astral diamonds must be spent to unlearn skill points. The number of points gained per level is 1, so skill point placement might be quite important.3. Quests are repetitive. After the first few quests, the same pattern will emerge. Enter dungeon, kill monsters, kill a big boss, rinse and repeat. Monsters come in standard small, medium, hulk and boss sizes. There are only some semi-unique quests like ""Artifact Recovery"" but they still revolve around bashing.4. Tedious teleportation system. Zone-to-zone transport only occurs at locations called Gates. You must tranverse the whole way to a Gate in order to teleport to another area. There is no way to ""summon"" your ally to you. Even right-clicking and teleporting to the player's instance is bugged.5. Bugs. Dungeons do not reset and do crash e.g. Cloak Tower (CT)6. Game Environment. You can't swim or fly. 7. In-game currency.There are too many forms of currency creates a confusing system. Almost like the EU before the Euro. Value of the different currencies depreciate extremely fast for non-cosmetic items e.g. Seal of the Manticore will be much less valuable when you get Seal of the Pegasus and so on so forth. 8. No utility rewards The only focus is on combat. E.g. Epic Hammer of Forging +25 to Blacksmithing.9. Not enough storage slots.Not such a major issue as you can easily clear all the enchantments for gold. Gold is mainly used forrefining.10. End GameAssuming you collected all your boons.Your end game will revolve around only a few areas1. Protector's Enclave2. Ice Wind Dale3. Neverdeath Graveyard OR Icespire Peak OR Rothe Valley OR Whispering Caverns OR Ebon DownsThe reason for No 3 being grouped together will be due to Cult Secrets that you do daily. They rotate and you only ever need to go to one of them to kill a dragon/dracolich.Everything else is a dungeon/lair/skirmish and you can queue for those.You will be doing skirmishes quite often if you did not pay cash for zen/astral diamonds.11. GauntlygrymGauntlygrym can be done but it's quite boring. Most players simply turn on their computers leave Gaunt to run it's course, the combatants are not even active. They come back after 15 mins to run Delzoun Crypts regardless of who wins. The map is extremely large but there are very few things that are exciting.You have to convince a storm giant to join your cause by feeding him and giving him treasure. You build catapults by collecting wood and explosive balls. You fill up mine carts. You kill Duergar to get their items. They are mostly fetch quests with a time limit.12. Dead EnvironmentEverything is dead. The people function as lamp posts.13. Respeccing costs Astral DiamondsMy CW costs 78,000+ AD just to respecc Feats and Boons. This is a lot of in game currency.  On average, you can earn around than 5000 AD/hour.			"

												SORRY FOR MY BAD GRAMMER I RUSHED THROUGH THISThis Game is one of the best mmo's i have seen. Honestly do have some problems, but there is no perfect mmo.My Pros to the game.1.Character Creation. It was easy to understand, and I didnt find myself taking hours just to make my character look nice2.Graphics are great. the game doesnt look like your run of the mill averge rpg.3.leveling is fast and fun.4.Objectives of quest are most of the time clear.5.although i dont like class based skills, they where done quite well in this.6.PVP, This has its flaws and perfections7.The story is over all good8.levels are nicely done8.Many People have been saying this game is pay to play or pay to win........... allthough i can see how they can get the idea, but let me tell you what a pay to play its....... runescape, have you ever playied it? well i have you have to pay to unlock skills, map parts, armor, weapons, and many other things. this game is not pay to play by a long shot.... granted there are some things that are anoying examples... companion  upgrades.... character slots... and other things, but it still isnt pay to play because of astral diamonds. granted it takes time to get these it isnt imposible. u can get up to 3000-4000 a day just by doing pvp....................................................... or even more if u do dungeons  and other stuff........you can also get them from profesions like leadership.... you log in click a few buttons set a task, do some pvp and bam u got u some astral........Cons to this game.1. Skill tree: Some times i just look at my feets/ skill point and im like am i doing this right.2.i go through 20 levels and my armor looks like the same ♥♥♥♥ i had on at the boat crash like wat3.PVP. has some balancing to do4.sometimes i find myself lost on a level and im like what am i suppose to be doing again.5.the heck is up with the dlc's jesusAGAIN SORRY DIDNT CHECK FOR GRAMMER JUST TYPED SO yea...Over all this is a great game.

												I would like to say this MMO is great.  It has a wonderful system that is in place which is the ability to create your own maps for the game if you're tired of the content that has been created.  Many people feel it is a ""Pay 2 Win"" game.  It isn't unless you make it that way.  That's the real situation.  Overall though, there is nothing that you can't do in the game to play it and get to the same level as everyone else.  The situation is how much you want to devote to the game to get to whatever progress you as a player wants. However as a ""Free to Play"" game, there is a lot of free content that a person can go into and I recommend to eventually get into a guild or make sure you do all the required high level content to get some of the better gear.  I know recently there were some network issues but I believe it has smoothed itself out some and has become playable again.  I recommend this game to the hardcore or even the casual player because the quests are instance based but very quick at times.  It's only the raids that are a little longer and more involved.  Also, make sure to do your dailies but everything is solid for that MMO and recommend it to anyone.			"

Oh where to begin?Well lets start off with some requirements:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------AT LEAST 5 mb/s internet or you will be suffering.- Intel core i3 ddr3-nvidia 600 & Above-Competence-Friends (optional, but the game is much more fun with them)                       These are NOT REQUIRED to play the game                       Only to play it with decent FPS and somewhat decent graphics---------------------------------------------------------------------------------                  The first stages of this game are definately going to be the hardest, mostly due to the lack of tutorials. You have to find things out on your own, but I just cheated and went to the forums!  Once you get past level 15 (The mount level) You're pretty much requried to spend money on this game if you want a soemwhat decent mount. I love supporting games like this, but if it's f2p then it should atleast have some options. 7/10A good timewaster "

												To be fair you can get through the vast majority of the game upto levl 60 without spending a penny in real money. I only started thinking I may need to buy items at a much later stage in the game as pvp at level 60 is pretty hard and its cleara lot of the guys have paid stuff which gives them a massive advantage. However I pvpd right upto to 60 on a competitive level with armour and weapons gained freely. Neverwinter is a enjoyable game if you are willing to put the time into it, its not one of them games you can dip into for 1 hour and expect to be drawn in Crafting your characer will take considerable time and effort and in some cases doing tedious quests over and over. Its a very in depth game with lots of angles too many infact but in a way that gives the game a long life span as there is always something new to do. Graphically the game is quite nice but can get laggy on even the best of pcs (most likely due to server congestion) overall I would recommend people try this game but be prepared to put more than a few hours into it to see its ful potential.

												Neverwinter Online is a decent enough game but is not anything close to actual D&D.  The game is more of a standard MMO with a D&D stamp or veneer over it.  The quests are very repetitive and have little variation between them.  The Foundry feature, which allows players to create their own quests for the community's use, has some good quests but this tool has not lived up to its potential.  NWO has an interesting skills system and the wide number of hirelings and mounts improve the game to some degree, but overall the game is disappointing and lacks long term playing potential.			"

												This great Dungeons and Dragons plays really good for 3rd person gamers as well as 1st person gamers, it has a much more dynamic combat than most mmorpg arround today, the movement and skills utilizing systems somehow could emerge the classic and the new. It's as good as Baldur's Gate, a bit more action packed, and it also has better graphis. Definitelly a great option for those who like the gameplay, art and strytelling styles of more mainstream non-free-to-play games (lookin' at u WOW).			"

Donating money in the game doesn't let you get better stuff, or stuff you can't get without it. It's just faster getting your stuff without waiting.

												Neverwinter is ridiculously fun! I've logged quite a few hours in this game and the storyline is fun and engaging. I actually find the storyline while leveling up is quite enjoyable, when compared to other MMO games. The feel is very DND and the story captures several classic scenarios from table top gaming. Plus, who else doesn't love visiting some of your favorite Sword Coast locales?There is cash shop in the game that is a bit on the expensive side for some items, but they largely appear to be cosmetic and for bragging rights. Some items do give you a leg up on other players, but it's not so substantial that I would consider it to be pay-to-win. If you've got the cash and want to purchase some items, more power to you.As I said before, the storyline while leveling up is terrific. I've not really found another MMO that has the story be so fun and enjoyable. The graphics are beginning to show their age a bit, but this game is certainly on my list as one of the top MMOs available. Just be warned, the end game can get a bit grindy and lose flavor, but that's the case with most MMOs. All in all, this is a terrific little MMO with a fun PVP system and I would definitely recommend the game to anyone looking for a fun story and awesome race/class combinations.			"

												Just another voice to the choir.  Almost every negative review here on steam is spot on.   If you are playing for the first time, leveling a character 1 through 60 you will most likely love this game and I would recomend it.   It's has great combat that is responsive and fluid.  The quests are interesting and fun (for a first time play through).It's a wonderful experience until you reach the end game.   This is where the fun stops.   The end game is nothing more than a grind fest where you run the same quest over and over and over and over and over and over and over(keep repeating 1000's more times) again. Some of these end game campaigns are so terrible that you can actually buy tokens in the Zen store that lets you skip them. Yes for a mire $50.00 each(yes $50.00 'each') you can skip the 'dead ring' and 'sharandar' campaigns.  Think about it, people are actually willing to pay them money 'not to play' their game.  That is just insane.  Keep in mind that it is only for one character too.   Those tokens are not an account wide option. So if you spend any money for extra character slots to try out the other classes, you're stuck with doing those grind fest campaigns unless you pay for the tokens again.  It almost seems like a cruel joke.On top of that the refinement system is not casual player friendly.  If you are someone that only has time to play maybe 2 to 4 hours a week, there is no humanly possible way to collect enough refinement points to max level an item unless you are willing to spend money.  I would not complain about this if it was only a handful of enchantments you can place on weapons and armor.   But now you have dozens of new artifacts including artifact weapons and equipment.  All needing refinement to level up.  If you played 4 hours a day for six months straight you might be able to max level '1' of these items. yes '1' out of some 15-20 you can equip on your character at one time, which doesn't even include the ones you might keep in inventory to switch around depending on what tasks you are doing.  That is just for the refinement points and doesn't include the Reagents needed for the upgrade.   It's absolutely crazy.  There is no way a casual player is going to do this without spending houndreds of dollars to upgrade them.The other thing to be aware of is rebalancing changes.  Neverwinter has been adding new classes and content that has required the game to be rebalanced with every major update.   I understand that this is needed for better game play.  However as I mentioned above items that require refinement to upgrade is a very costly whether you spend the time or the money to do it.  When they rebalance the game what you may discover is that an item you are working on may no longer be worth the effort.  For example Mod 6 is going to change how regeneration and life steal works.  Anyone who has invested the time and or money to upgrade items that buff these stats might not have choosen to do so. That can be literally months of work for some people who used their time to upgrade those items or hundreds of dollars for others who paid to upgrade.SO if you're a new player starting out leveling a character 1 though 60 savior the moment.  It's doesn't last for the end game.   Once you get to the end game I would recommend you move on to something else.			"

												I tried to like this game, don't call me out on my playtime, because I was playing before it came to steam. But since i've come back after a while there are many frustrating problems and ridiculous developer desicions. Firstly, the launcher is complete and utter garbage, most of the time I find myself waiting for 2-3 hours to get in because the loading screen freezes and eventually crashes, then tells me I should verify the files which takes about 10-20 minutes. Then after verifying the files, IT DOES THE SAME EXACT THING RINSE AND REPEAT. It is very frustrating. When I actually get into the game, the begging levels are actually quite fun and the combat is nice, but when you get to the higher levels you are blocked by an immense amount of grinding and paywalls. the events are garbage, PVP is a pay to win, and PVE is like queueing into a pile of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who have alot of money and paid for everything, who don't know what to do. Verdict: Used to be a fun game, the beginning levels are fun but later in the game is destroyed.Developers, please fix this game, and you will have gained another player.for now... 4/10			"

												Neverwinter is a very exciting, action packed MMO based off of the Dungeons & Dragons roleplaying game. You DON'T need to be a D&D pro to play however, that just helps you understand the lore and basics of each class. It is free-to-play, but not pay-to-win. Yes, spending cash does help you advance faster, but anything and everything can be earned in the game without spending real-world dollars. The community is friendly in general, but it does have it's share of butt-holes like every online community. Recent changes to the game have been a major improvement, as some campaings/modules *cough cough* Tyranny of Dragons *cough* had extremely hard to obtain boons and gear, and the economy was trashed and ruled by botters. The devs have made huge strides in cutting out botters, and while not 100% clean, they took a hard hit. They prices the botters/scammers offer for their services now are really high, and there aren't nearly as much as their used to be in the zone chat. I highly recommend making friends, some of my best friends are from chance encounters in Neverwinter. It has it's flaws, especially the grind to reach level 70, the games current level cap. I suggest waiting for the fairly frequent Double Experience weekends/events to level a toon. My name in-game is GravitySage, and I am happy to help any new players. Welcome to Neverwinter!!!			"

												The game is free! You cant beat freeSo far i hit level 15, every couple of hours something new will pop up on your ""Daily"" quest journal. Sometimes this is to complete a sponsored user generate Dungeon in a a set time amount.Oh, this game comes with a dungoen creation tool called Foundry. You can create your own Dungeon. Make it what ever you want, you can even make whole storylines. This tool is kinda hard (they included) a tutorial which is pretty awesome. No MMO, EVER, has this option. Every day i log on, i see new content, more stuff to do. Yeah it has the normal storyline quest you can do.If you played the FTP The Old Republic. This mimics that formula a little bit. Mostly with companions and professions. Ever felt similar and easy to use. The game ""gate locks"" content to certain levels so you dont get swarmed with content at the start (which is nice)But this game has its downfalls, on high cap servers you will get very bad lag spikes. Sometime i have to search out a instance with lower number of players to keep from getting auto logged out. I have not played the most recent D&D addition, i played Neverwinter Nights 1 and read the legend of Drizz't. This is not the Neverwinter i remember. If you want any sense of what the story is trying to tell, you need to wiki the history, which is dumb for a MMO with such a rich lore.But you can pick up lore items which fill in the blanks, oftens times you get them after finding a new area or even just completing a quest. The  combat system is based off skill (so it wants you to believe.) Enemies will hit in such huge radiuses that you cant avoid. I did a test with my Control Wizard (its shift command is teleport) i waited till i was in the face of a enemy, and yes i know that not how you play one. I teleported forward, the game says you teleport 25 feet in a lateral line. I was still dealt damage, even tho this bad guy was a melee character and did not have a 25 foot hit range.For all its faults and weaknesses, Cryptic did a a good job, not Excellent but good. Its playable, its fun, hell i like it. I normally play EVE online and not something like this. Give it a shot, if you dont like. Like i said its Free, you only wasted your time.			"

												Neverwinter is a game that has me halting between to opinions. There are some really good parts about this game, but also some not so good or just plain bad. Let's start of on a positive note.The good!:It is a really fun MMORPG with a cool and dynamic combat system that makes you dodge, run around and use your abilities without them having very long cooldowns. This, in combination with the relatively easy and straigthforward quests, makes you feel like a god amongst men. Hacking and slashing your way through clearly inferior enemies with awesome attacks and skills that are animated beatifully gives a cool kick. I don't mind the easy quests either. They'll take you to a wide variety of area's and dungeons, really making you feel like a badass adventurer. The gear in the game is absolutely beautiful, which for me is very important. It does matter a bit if you are wearing a ""set"" of armor that makes all the pieces look good together. But even when leveling up and wearing rags the gear looks very cool.The not so good:As a casual gamer myself and trying to do some endgame a few flaws in the game come to the surface. The endgame dungeons are buggy as hell. If you do not have a guild or a full party that you can run dungeons with you are bound to use the game's queuing system (which works quite well actually). More often than not you will find yourself on a long dragging dungeon attempt that is usually about trying to exploit the dungeon's bugs in order to skip as many enemies as possible with people that don't seem to care if you die or not. None of the enemies really have any cool game mechanics, they just hit harder or faster than the last guy. I havent really had any boss fights that I found intriguing. Some of them were hard, yes. But that was just due to the enemy having a ridiculous amount of hitpoint and/or hitting very hard. I have not really had any fun in endgame dungeons yet.The bad:The game is published by Perfect world which isn't necessarily a bad thing at all. The game of course is Free To Play, which means that Perfect World will have you try to spend money on it at every turn you take (or atleast that is how I feel) because they have to make money somehow. The game has two main currencies : Astral diamonds and Zen. Both of these currencies can be traded for one another. Almost all the epic gear in the game is Bind on Equip, which means that you can buy all of this gear for enormous amounts of diamonds. For people playing this game full time it is not a problem getting this gear and selling it, but for the casual gamer it can be frustrating to get to these incredible amounts of diamonds without spending any money on it. I guess this all makes perfect sense for someone who is at peace with this system and will probably go ""yeah, so what?"". For me it is really an uncool feeling. I feel that the best gear in the game should only be available for the ones who have completed certain content and have really earned it. For me this feels like Pay to Win. Combine this with the buggy endgame dungeons and the games endgame feels like a letdown.Besides that, the game makes you pay ridiculous amounts for what I call ""comfort items"". Items you do not need to complete the game but make your life ingame so much more easy. Things like a big bag (8 euro's in Zen!!) and fasts mounths (40 euro's in Zen!!) are just incredibly overpriced. These are not microtransactions but you end up paying as much for a fast mount as you would for a legal copy of Guild wars 2 during it's release. Just plain robbery. Of course you can always farm the required diamonds ingame but for a casual gamer that isn't really an option.All in all it looks like Perfect World is trying to benefit from the casual gamer with a job that has no time to play the game full time but has plenty of money to spend on it. Since I am in that categoty I feel a bit exploited by the game.My advice!:Go play Neverwinter! The combat system and the cool area's will give you much fun leveling up. The game really feels complete with cool loot drops and giving you new gear almost every level you gain.Think twice about really endgaming Neverwinter. The endgame dungeon's are buggy and hard for casuals. The game feels really repetative after spending some time at the max level.Rating:+Cool Combat system+Feel like a god amongt men+Nice area, plenty to explore+Very cool skills/attacks and animations for all characters-Everything for sale-Hard for casuals to farm enough diamonds-Feels like pay to win sometimes-Comfort items really expensive-Buggy and repetative endgameAll in all I would score this MMORPG 7 out of 10.Give it a try!

												It works fine as a free to play. keep in mind there are some pay walls that although grindable, would take many months.- you will never have a fast mount (60% inc is the base)- you will never have the best item enhancements (yours will be half as good, approx.)- it's pay to win.. do not pvp unless you are paying or enjoy getting 1 shot.The game itself has a kind of consol feel about it with only 8 or so spells on your action bar, which are players choice, but it's not much and gets repetitive fast. It takes about 30 hours to get to max level, then due to the 'daily' system for the 4 high level zones (where you unlock better gear and harder dungeons) it will take a month or two to catch up to seasoned players.Character roles are a bit odd compared to other mmo's, if you are good you can do the first lvl 60 epic dungeons without a tank or healer, even at high level the healer is more for buffing the other players than actually keepin them alive, i.e. not a vital part of the team. the tank has the same issue with none tanks able to go off soloing in dungeons. It gives the game an easy feel, with little need for teamwork, just button mashing. You dont need allot of skill to play, just either allot of time, or more commonly, money.It's still good fun, it's just this game doesnt go anywhere, there is no sense of accomplishment. You will reach a point where you dont want to pay real money for next upgrade, and the time to get it by grinding dungeons/mobs/trading is just too great to be considered worthwhile or at the very least, enjoyable.

												Ive got over 100+ hours into Neverwinter, so I figured I should review it, and ill keep it short.The game is fun.  If youre thinking of the end game before playing it, just try it out (its free)The combat was innovative as it came before ES:O, and the combo and action combat makes  for a more action orriented experience from an MMO.  I actually had fun grinding my way to the top, because of the active dodgeing and combos with varying AOE, I was thrilled to take on 4 enemies at once by being agile (certain classes block instead). That being said, the Skills are somewhat limited, but they have modifiers to help add to the customization.  So while Wizard 1 may have the same skills as Wizard 2, their modifiers could make them more pure damage or pure control, or somewhere in between.  As for everyone complaining of the prices for mounts, companions, etc, Ill say this: All these things (ALL OF THEM) can be purchased on the AH for Astral Diamonds which you get from playing.  IT IS CHEAPER to buy $5 of Zen Coin and convert to diamonds, because a top tier companion is a lot cheaper in Diamonds than it is Zen (players CAN find the rare mounts, and sell them for diamonds).  TL:DR The free system in this game is ahead of the curve, because all paid for items can be purchased with the f2p system often for cheaper than the 'real money' shop. On top of that, the action orriented combat with active dodging and combos is super fun.			"

												Neverwinter Online is a decent enough game but is not anything close to actual D&D.  The game is more of a standard MMO with a D&D stamp or veneer over it.  The quests are very repetitive and have little variation between them.  The Foundry feature, which allows players to create their own quests for the community's use, has some good quests but this tool has not lived up to its potential.  NWO has an interesting skills system and the wide number of hirelings and mounts improve the game to some degree, but overall the game is disappointing and lacks long term playing potential.			"

												I will give this game credit. It's not what I expected.You hear MMORPG and you think of a game based around using huge hotbars full of skills, but that's not waht you get here. It handles more like a 3rd person action game with a small selection of hotkeyed skills that you pick from a larger list of skills (you need to progress to unlock them).The progression feels nicely handled, and combat is fluid. My only gripe with combat is that, at least on the Warlock I started with, you're rooted in place when you attack. This is bad because as a magic user, you're primarily a ranged class, so letting enemies get in close isn't a smart move. However this is somewhat typical of a lot of MMOs, and while it's a bugbear of mine and I'd prefer it to not happen, I've sort of grown used to it from when I played TERA. Enemies in some areas also respwan fairly quickly. I see this as both being good and bad; Good because it mean there's a lot of mobs to kill so all the players in an area can get some kills, and Bad because if you're doing a fetch quest, you have to fight the same mobs over and over again going to and from the objective.The economy, specifically buying things and vendors, is confusing at first. The map has a ton of icons specific to what each store does... but it doesn't tell you what means what, so you're left to wander the city map trying to find a place to buy armor and weapons (if you even can, because I couldn't find the right vendor).I hear people say there's P2W in the crafting. And there might be, but I haven't gone into crafting at all so I wouldn't know. What I will say is this; early impressions of this game are positive. The classes are distinct from each other and play different roles in combat. Character creation is straightforward (thought I'd have liked more customization options for the character other than face and body-type) and I'll probably end up sinking a decent amount of time into this game. Your milage may vary, but as a F2P game, what do you ahve to lose other than some time?			"

												Note: The review has been updated to include the ""Campaigns"" content.Neverwinter is an MMO by Perfect World Entertainment. This allows us to predict two things:1. The amount of cash required will be huge.2. The classes will be split into the usual healer\tank\damage-dealer arch-types.Starting out, you'll get to pick your race between all the usual D&D races, and have a choice of class. This confirms suspicion #2 in that there is the ""Devout Cleric"" (healer) ""Guardian Fighter"" (tank) and a bunch of other classes (damage-dealers).You'll have an option between the ""Control Wizard"" which deals a lot of damage from a distance, has the ability to crowd-control multiple enemies, throw enemies off cliffs (which is invaluable at high-level dungeons, as it's an instant-kill) and is very very squishy. The main job of this class (apart from throwing enemies off ledges) is to keep the adds controlled while the tank kites and the rogue attacks the boss.The ""Great Weapons Fighter"" which is a berserker with a two-handed weapon. Standard front-line damage-dealer. This class can either target the boss or the adds, depending on equipment and the specific boss in question.The ""Trickster Rogue"" who relies on stealth for solo-play and does single-target damage in dungeons. This class's main job is to kill the bosses.The ""Hunter Ranger"" who, frankly, has the most interesting combat as he has twice as many attacks. Appears to be a hybrid of the rogue and the wizard. The hunter ranger is able to switch between melee and ranged stance at any time, and each of his skills behaves differently depending on which stance he uses. The skills also have separate cooldowns for each of the stances.Combat is simple in this game: you have two ""At Will"" attacks (much akin to auto-attacks) which are bound to the left and right mouse buttons by default. Those do not have cooldown, though they can have charges.You then have three ""Encounter"" skills, which are basically active skills. Mapped to QER by default.Lastly, you have a ""Daily"" power, which is a horrible name for it since you can use it pretty often; the skills require a certain amount of ""Action Points"" which are gained by doing class-specific tasks. Healers heal, damage-dealers deal damage and I assume tanks block or absorb damage (though I haven't made one to confirm it). These could be considered your ultimate attacks and are bound to 1 and 2 by default.There's the ""Feat"" system, which is basically passive bonuses for your character.And then there's the  two ""Active passives"" slots; those are skills that give you passive benefits, but are not ""Feats"" (meaning they take your active skillpoints rather than your feat points, and you can only have two of those at a time) you activate them by dragging them to your skill bar.You can have more skills, but those are the most you can have useable at any one time.Equipment is your standard MMO system; five rarity levels, which are (in order):-White ""Common"" basic equipment.-Green ""Uncommon"" equipment.-Blue ""Rare"" equipment.-Purple ""Epic"" equipment.-Orange (?).Purple equipment is also split into tiers; tier one is obtained from the basic level 60 dungeons, while tier 2 is obtained from more difficult level 60 dungeons.So far, so standard. Where this all comes crashing down is the enchantment system; each piece of equipment can have an enchantment inserted into it (something like sockets in Diablo), and those have several ranks. You can refine those enchantments to get higher ranks, and the success rate drops the higher the rank you attempt to refine - up to a 1% success rate at level 8 (rank 10 is the highest).If you spend real money, you can guarantee the refinement process will succeed.Well, this validates my original assumption that the game will require lots of money - but let's pretend it doesn't and go on.I should probably mention the ""Artifact"" system. These are items that you can equip up to three of (one primary and two secondaries) which you can refine like the enchantment stones. Like the enchantment stones, you will need the item bought with real money to actually succeed in the refinement process. The primary artifact grants you an active ability and some stats, while the secondary artifacts only grant you the stats.Each player gets one at level 21 in a ""Bind on Equip"" state, though they have been known to bug out and bind even without equip. This bug appears to be unique to the artifacts.The game features a companion system. Free players get a white one, which can reach rank 15 (equivalent to player level 30). For 25$, you can get a purple rarity one which can reach rank 30 (equivalent to player level 60).Bag space is, of course, limited; in order to increase it, players must pay real money. The large bag costs (24 slots) 10$.Storage space is likewise limited, and more storage slots can be bought for real money.PvP exists, but there's no real match-making system in place to ensure the matches are fun or balanced; it's a fairly common sight to see one player kill five alone simply because his equipment is better.One-hit-kills are fairly frequent.Story-wise, there isn't that much there; it would appear R.A. Salvatore wrote the begining, then the lore, then the new campaigns and then left. The entire mid-game forward you'll just be cleaning up random disasters that happen in and around the city.The writing is what you can expect from Salvatore; your enemies are more evil than the combination of Satan and Hitler, while you are playing as the pure-good hero who can't even take items from a backpack without the appropriate skill (for rogues) or kit (items that will clutter up your inventory).The ""Campaigns"" which I mentioned are set in zones just like every other part of the game. Unlike other parts of the game, they revolve around daily quests, which give you unique currency that you can then spend to progress in the campaign. Campaign rewards are mostly passive stat bonuses to your character (which require Astral Diamonds - read on for those) and access to two end-game instances with some of the best equipment.Unfortunately, the number of days you will have to spend before you actually unlock all of the passive bonuses is rather depressingly high, which will hurt new players who want to PvP.And, of course, I saved the worst for last: the game features a currency called ""Astral Diamonds"". You receive this currency from various daily tasks (playing player-created content, completing dungeons, playing in PvP) in a ""rough"" form, and must refine them in order to use them. The currency is gated at a refinement of twenty-four thousand a day (a very small amount) for free users, but players can trade real money for more.Astral Diamonds is used to buy various useful items, vanity items, new companions, new mounts, upgrade the rarity level of a companion (from white to green, or green to blue, or blue to purple) or a mount (same as the companion), as well as unlock several passive stat bonuses for your character (from the campaign quests).Now, the amounts of this currency required for each of those actions is rather staggering. It costs three hundred thousand to upgrade a companion from white to green. That is an amount free players will not get before reaching the level-cap unless you sell your artifact. You can get another one, if you create a new character and raise it to level twenty one or if you pay real money for an artifact pack.To top all of this off, the game is riddled with bugs (geometry bugs, item bind bugs, enemy behavior, skill behavior etc) and the now-infamous Perfect World Entertainment Support is just worthless.So, over-all, would I recommand this game?Well, if you have an insupressable need to empty the contents of your wallet, by all means - go ahead and indulge in this extremely pay-to-win experience.Otherwise, no, I'm afraid I can't recommand it.

												To be fair you can get through the vast majority of the game upto levl 60 without spending a penny in real money. I only started thinking I may need to buy items at a much later stage in the game as pvp at level 60 is pretty hard and its cleara lot of the guys have paid stuff which gives them a massive advantage. However I pvpd right upto to 60 on a competitive level with armour and weapons gained freely. Neverwinter is a enjoyable game if you are willing to put the time into it, its not one of them games you can dip into for 1 hour and expect to be drawn in Crafting your characer will take considerable time and effort and in some cases doing tedious quests over and over. Its a very in depth game with lots of angles too many infact but in a way that gives the game a long life span as there is always something new to do. Graphically the game is quite nice but can get laggy on even the best of pcs (most likely due to server congestion) overall I would recommend people try this game but be prepared to put more than a few hours into it to see its ful potential.

I see this as both being good and bad; Good because it mean there's a lot of mobs to kill so all the players in an area can get some kills, and Bad because if you're doing a fetch quest, you have to fight the same mobs over and over again going to and from the objective.The economy, specifically buying things and vendors, is confusing at first. The map has a ton of icons specific to what each store does... but it doesn't tell you what means what, so you're left to wander the city map trying to find a place to buy armor and weapons (if you even can, because I couldn't find the right vendor).I hear people say there's P2W in the crafting. And there might be, but I haven't gone into crafting at all so I wouldn't know. What I will say is this; early impressions of this game are positive. The classes are distinct from each other and play different roles in combat. Character creation is straightforward (thought I'd have liked more customization options for the character other than face and body-type) and I'll probably end up sinking a decent amount of time into this game. Your milage may vary, but as a F2P game, what do you ahve to lose other than some time?			"

												ive played an awful lot of mmos and i have to say this is in my top 5. i thought when i first started playing it it would be like W.O.W but i love it. fair enough to get the good stuff you have to pay but you can go the entire game without paying real money , although when your standing in protectors enclave and you see a majestic unicorn striding by you there is a mighty urge to reach for the credit card.the powers are great i love the gameplay (it was soo buggy but they have fixed it) the scenery and overall colours are beautiful the  companions are awesome i love that if you follow them on facebook etc you have a chance to get codes for limited loot noow fair enough a lot of the missions are the standard ""get this bring it here come back"" but its such an enjoyable game that i overlook the tiny repetitiveness of it.

												Neverwinter is ridiculously fun! I've logged quite a few hours in this game and the storyline is fun and engaging. I actually find the storyline while leveling up is quite enjoyable, when compared to other MMO games. The feel is very DND and the story captures several classic scenarios from table top gaming. Plus, who else doesn't love visiting some of your favorite Sword Coast locales?There is cash shop in the game that is a bit on the expensive side for some items, but they largely appear to be cosmetic and for bragging rights. Some items do give you a leg up on other players, but it's not so substantial that I would consider it to be pay-to-win. If you've got the cash and want to purchase some items, more power to you.As I said before, the storyline while leveling up is terrific. I've not really found another MMO that has the story be so fun and enjoyable. The graphics are beginning to show their age a bit, but this game is certainly on my list as one of the top MMOs available. Just be warned, the end game can get a bit grindy and lose flavor, but that's the case with most MMOs. All in all, this is a terrific little MMO with a fun PVP system and I would definitely recommend the game to anyone looking for a fun story and awesome race/class combinations.			"

												This is my first DnD game and I've really enjoyed it so far. The gameplay is very fun and the story is pretty interesting if you like any kind of fantasy/DnD universe. I play with a couple of other friends and we have a good time running missions and dungeons. Running early game solo isn't too hard but after you hit 70 it helps so much to have a friend back you up when running dailies. Speaking of dailies if you plan on playing for free expect a lot of end game daily grinding. There are very restrictive forced waiting periods to prevent you from finishing campaigns quickly. Fortunately there are plenty of options to spend your time and I generally never run out of things to do. Just expect a wait period to further progress your charcter when you hit level 70. Overall I would definitely recommend this game. Money is no issue. I've paid for VIP for a few months and a fancy mount from the market but neither are needed to enjoy the game.			"

												Note: The review has been updated to include the ""Campaigns"" content.Neverwinter is an MMO by Perfect World Entertainment. This allows us to predict two things:1. The amount of cash required will be huge.2. The classes will be split into the usual healer\tank\damage-dealer arch-types.Starting out, you'll get to pick your race between all the usual D&D races, and have a choice of class. This confirms suspicion #2 in that there is the ""Devout Cleric"" (healer) ""Guardian Fighter"" (tank) and a bunch of other classes (damage-dealers).You'll have an option between the ""Control Wizard"" which deals a lot of damage from a distance, has the ability to crowd-control multiple enemies, throw enemies off cliffs (which is invaluable at high-level dungeons, as it's an instant-kill) and is very very squishy. The main job of this class (apart from throwing enemies off ledges) is to keep the adds controlled while the tank kites and the rogue attacks the boss.The ""Great Weapons Fighter"" which is a berserker with a two-handed weapon. Standard front-line damage-dealer. This class can either target the boss or the adds, depending on equipment and the specific boss in question.The ""Trickster Rogue"" who relies on stealth for solo-play and does single-target damage in dungeons. This class's main job is to kill the bosses.The ""Hunter Ranger"" who, frankly, has the most interesting combat as he has twice as many attacks. Appears to be a hybrid of the rogue and the wizard. The hunter ranger is able to switch between melee and ranged stance at any time, and each of his skills behaves differently depending on which stance he uses. The skills also have separate cooldowns for each of the stances.Combat is simple in this game: you have two ""At Will"" attacks (much akin to auto-attacks) which are bound to the left and right mouse buttons by default. Those do not have cooldown, though they can have charges.You then have three ""Encounter"" skills, which are basically active skills. Mapped to QER by default.Lastly, you have a ""Daily"" power, which is a horrible name for it since you can use it pretty often; the skills require a certain amount of ""Action Points"" which are gained by doing class-specific tasks. Healers heal, damage-dealers deal damage and I assume tanks block or absorb damage (though I haven't made one to confirm it). These could be considered your ultimate attacks and are bound to 1 and 2 by default.There's the ""Feat"" system, which is basically passive bonuses for your character.And then there's the  two ""Active passives"" slots; those are skills that give you passive benefits, but are not ""Feats"" (meaning they take your active skillpoints rather than your feat points, and you can only have two of those at a time) you activate them by dragging them to your skill bar.You can have more skills, but those are the most you can have useable at any one time.Equipment is your standard MMO system; five rarity levels, which are (in order):-White ""Common"" basic equipment.-Green ""Uncommon"" equipment.-Blue ""Rare"" equipment.-Purple ""Epic"" equipment.-Orange (?).Purple equipment is also split into tiers; tier one is obtained from the basic level 60 dungeons, while tier 2 is obtained from more difficult level 60 dungeons.So far, so standard. Where this all comes crashing down is the enchantment system; each piece of equipment can have an enchantment inserted into it (something like sockets in Diablo), and those have several ranks. You can refine those enchantments to get higher ranks, and the success rate drops the higher the rank you attempt to refine - up to a 1% success rate at level 8 (rank 10 is the highest).If you spend real money, you can guarantee the refinement process will succeed.Well, this validates my original assumption that the game will require lots of money - but let's pretend it doesn't and go on.I should probably mention the ""Artifact"" system. These are items that you can equip up to three of (one primary and two secondaries) which you can refine like the enchantment stones. Like the enchantment stones, you will need the item bought with real money to actually succeed in the refinement process. The primary artifact grants you an active ability and some stats, while the secondary artifacts only grant you the stats.Each player gets one at level 21 in a ""Bind on Equip"" state, though they have been known to bug out and bind even without equip. This bug appears to be unique to the artifacts.The game features a companion system. Free players get a white one, which can reach rank 15 (equivalent to player level 30). For 25$, you can get a purple rarity one which can reach rank 30 (equivalent to player level 60).Bag space is, of course, limited; in order to increase it, players must pay real money. The large bag costs (24 slots) 10$.Storage space is likewise limited, and more storage slots can be bought for real money.PvP exists, but there's no real match-making system in place to ensure the matches are fun or balanced; it's a fairly common sight to see one player kill five alone simply because his equipment is better.One-hit-kills are fairly frequent.Story-wise, there isn't that much there; it would appear R.A. Salvatore wrote the begining, then the lore, then the new campaigns and then left. The entire mid-game forward you'll just be cleaning up random disasters that happen in and around the city.The writing is what you can expect from Salvatore; your enemies are more evil than the combination of Satan and Hitler, while you are playing as the pure-good hero who can't even take items from a backpack without the appropriate skill (for rogues) or kit (items that will clutter up your inventory).The ""Campaigns"" which I mentioned are set in zones just like every other part of the game. Unlike other parts of the game, they revolve around daily quests, which give you unique currency that you can then spend to progress in the campaign. Campaign rewards are mostly passive stat bonuses to your character (which require Astral Diamonds - read on for those) and access to two end-game instances with some of the best equipment.Unfortunately, the number of days you will have to spend before you actually unlock all of the passive bonuses is rather depressingly high, which will hurt new players who want to PvP.And, of course, I saved the worst for last: the game features a currency called ""Astral Diamonds"". You receive this currency from various daily tasks (playing player-created content, completing dungeons, playing in PvP) in a ""rough"" form, and must refine them in order to use them. The currency is gated at a refinement of twenty-four thousand a day (a very small amount) for free users, but players can trade real money for more.Astral Diamonds is used to buy various useful items, vanity items, new companions, new mounts, upgrade the rarity level of a companion (from white to green, or green to blue, or blue to purple) or a mount (same as the companion), as well as unlock several passive stat bonuses for your character (from the campaign quests).Now, the amounts of this currency required for each of those actions is rather staggering. It costs three hundred thousand to upgrade a companion from white to green. That is an amount free players will not get before reaching the level-cap unless you sell your artifact. You can get another one, if you create a new character and raise it to level twenty one or if you pay real money for an artifact pack.To top all of this off, the game is riddled with bugs (geometry bugs, item bind bugs, enemy behavior, skill behavior etc) and the now-infamous Perfect World Entertainment Support is just worthless.So, over-all, would I recommand this game?Well, if you have an insupressable need to empty the contents of your wallet, by all means - go ahead and indulge in this extremely pay-to-win experience.Otherwise, no, I'm afraid I can't recommand it.

												Just another voice to the choir.  Almost every negative review here on steam is spot on.   If you are playing for the first time, leveling a character 1 through 60 you will most likely love this game and I would recomend it.   It's has great combat that is responsive and fluid.  The quests are interesting and fun (for a first time play through).It's a wonderful experience until you reach the end game.   This is where the fun stops.   The end game is nothing more than a grind fest where you run the same quest over and over and over and over and over and over and over(keep repeating 1000's more times) again. Some of these end game campaigns are so terrible that you can actually buy tokens in the Zen store that lets you skip them. Yes for a mire $50.00 each(yes $50.00 'each') you can skip the 'dead ring' and 'sharandar' campaigns.  Think about it, people are actually willing to pay them money 'not to play' their game.  That is just insane.  Keep in mind that it is only for one character too.   Those tokens are not an account wide option. So if you spend any money for extra character slots to try out the other classes, you're stuck with doing those grind fest campaigns unless you pay for the tokens again.  It almost seems like a cruel joke.On top of that the refinement system is not casual player friendly.  If you are someone that only has time to play maybe 2 to 4 hours a week, there is no humanly possible way to collect enough refinement points to max level an item unless you are willing to spend money.  I would not complain about this if it was only a handful of enchantments you can place on weapons and armor.   But now you have dozens of new artifacts including artifact weapons and equipment.  All needing refinement to level up.  If you played 4 hours a day for six months straight you might be able to max level '1' of these items. yes '1' out of some 15-20 you can equip on your character at one time, which doesn't even include the ones you might keep in inventory to switch around depending on what tasks you are doing.  That is just for the refinement points and doesn't include the Reagents needed for the upgrade.   It's absolutely crazy.  There is no way a casual player is going to do this without spending houndreds of dollars to upgrade them.The other thing to be aware of is rebalancing changes.  Neverwinter has been adding new classes and content that has required the game to be rebalanced with every major update.   I understand that this is needed for better game play.  However as I mentioned above items that require refinement to upgrade is a very costly whether you spend the time or the money to do it.  When they rebalance the game what you may discover is that an item you are working on may no longer be worth the effort.  For example Mod 6 is going to change how regeneration and life steal works.  Anyone who has invested the time and or money to upgrade items that buff these stats might not have choosen to do so. That can be literally months of work for some people who used their time to upgrade those items or hundreds of dollars for others who paid to upgrade.SO if you're a new player starting out leveling a character 1 though 60 savior the moment.  It's doesn't last for the end game.   Once you get to the end game I would recommend you move on to something else.			"

												I tried to like this game, don't call me out on my playtime, because I was playing before it came to steam. But since i've come back after a while there are many frustrating problems and ridiculous developer desicions. Firstly, the launcher is complete and utter garbage, most of the time I find myself waiting for 2-3 hours to get in because the loading screen freezes and eventually crashes, then tells me I should verify the files which takes about 10-20 minutes. Then after verifying the files, IT DOES THE SAME EXACT THING RINSE AND REPEAT. It is very frustrating. When I actually get into the game, the begging levels are actually quite fun and the combat is nice, but when you get to the higher levels you are blocked by an immense amount of grinding and paywalls. the events are garbage, PVP is a pay to win, and PVE is like queueing into a pile of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who have alot of money and paid for everything, who don't know what to do. Verdict: Used to be a fun game, the beginning levels are fun but later in the game is destroyed.Developers, please fix this game, and you will have gained another player.for now... 4/10			"

												Neverwinter is a very exciting, action packed MMO based off of the Dungeons & Dragons roleplaying game. You DON'T need to be a D&D pro to play however, that just helps you understand the lore and basics of each class. It is free-to-play, but not pay-to-win. Yes, spending cash does help you advance faster, but anything and everything can be earned in the game without spending real-world dollars. The community is friendly in general, but it does have it's share of butt-holes like every online community. Recent changes to the game have been a major improvement, as some campaings/modules *cough cough* Tyranny of Dragons *cough* had extremely hard to obtain boons and gear, and the economy was trashed and ruled by botters. The devs have made huge strides in cutting out botters, and while not 100% clean, they took a hard hit. They prices the botters/scammers offer for their services now are really high, and there aren't nearly as much as their used to be in the zone chat. I highly recommend making friends, some of my best friends are from chance encounters in Neverwinter. It has it's flaws, especially the grind to reach level 70, the games current level cap. I suggest waiting for the fairly frequent Double Experience weekends/events to level a toon. My name in-game is GravitySage, and I am happy to help any new players. Welcome to Neverwinter!!!			"

												I am not a fan of free to play games, It can be guarantee that such games will have malicious players.But the game itself is up to standards when it comes to an MMORPG.However the game is not Stable, many scrips are not optimized just placed in, it works? Great!I have a Windows 10 OS with steam and downloaded it,tried launching it and it keeps crashing.. as a gamer I googled potential fixed, did not find any one that worked.Prior to today's download I played it before bought ingame currency to use and was told my account was flaggedas malicious. I would not recommend this game unless you are bored and wish to adventure in the world of Dungeons and Dragons.			"

												Level 1~60 is a safe n pleasure progress.However after lvl 60, the game is changed to a mindless grinding for no really good story behind, PvP is straight forward pay to win.Developers of this game doesn't really care about what players want, bait and switch everything, they can even change their blogs after some false advertisements already started.The best online game with cutting edge combat system and nice graphics but also with the worst management.

												Lacks atmosphere. Kiddie art direction/ wannabe WoW, graphically. Hand-holding ""quest sparkles"" show you exactly where to go for any quest. Deity and character background has no impact on character or game play. Racial bonuses are super conservative, barely even worth thinking about. Far removed from D&D in all but name. This game is simply hard to like, or get into.			"

												After having spent more than 600 hours in game, I have come to realize that it is simply a money grab.All of the content is repetitive in nature, getting you to kill the same mobs and do the same quests over and over again in order to earn currency excahnged for gear. Gear which someone else can simply buy, if they wish to do so. The zones are not large, and the epic encounters are short and simple in nature.It looks good, but shortsightedness on the part of the CEO, and development team have lead to a game with a small amount of content which is repeated over and over. And Exploiting and hacking have not helped the economy.Essentially, the creators of this game are selling gear, and want you to have to continuously spend to upgrade in order to move forward. They dont sell fun, like any good MMO, of which i have played my fair share. They dont want to sell fun. Nor do they want long term customers. They want you to get in, experience all the points at which its hard to lvl, buy gear, finish the content, get bored, and get out, so that the next wave can come in without them having to buy new servers.You have been warned.

												This game isn't bad but hope you never need the help of a GM.   I was introducing a new player into the game.  We both were ejected from the server at the same time.  We log back in, she's stuck in the terrain - as in nothing but black around here. We  try /stuck, /killme, log in/out...nothing works.   We submit a ticket.   We wait.  We wait.  We wait.   We go find something else to do and we are auto-logged off.We come back SEVEN HOURS LATER.   She's still stuck.So...either we have to SIT THERE and make sure we don't auto-log off to get help...that's not happening...or seven hours later they still have no unstuck her.   That's a wonderful way to sell a game.Needless to say we are going to play a different game.			"

												While it starts off with a story line, plot and different things to do it quickly digresses into a simple grind fest with nothing of any merit to  mention.  Non of the later content seems to have had any thought towards progression of any story line or even transitioning from one module to the next. To top it all off the servers have continual problems with crashing, lagging and the spammers rule the chat channels.. It is as much fun as playing solitaire with 8 or 9 cards missing from the deck			"

												Enjoyable at first,it's action based gameplay is quite fun, but the whole game gets really repetitive, much like all the Cryptic games. It is a F2P in its traditionnal way: you can play for free but all the cool stuff are NOT free, same as all the consummables used to reset your ability points etc.			"
